      "body": "Unemployment has different categories. Not all unemployed does not mean he has no income. This strength can be drawn from the increase in job applicants in factories and some shops. Unemployment means he is free without the need to work according to structured rules. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States:QuoteThere are about 60,000 eligible households in the sample for this survey. This translates into approximately 110,000 individuals each month, a large sample compared to public opinion surveys, which usually cover fewer than 2,000 people. The CPS sample is selected so as to be representative of the entire population of the United States. In order to select the sample, all of the counties and independent cities in the country first are grouped into approximately 2,000 geographic areas (sampling units). The Census Bureau then designs and selects a sample of about 800 of these geographic areas to represent each state and the District of Columbia. The sample is a state-based design and reflects urban and rural areas, different types of industrial and farming areas, and the major geographic divisions of each state.Every month, one-fourth of the households in the sample are changed, so that no household is interviewed for more than 4 consecutive months. After a household is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, it leaves the sample for 8 months, and then is again interviewed for the same 4 calendar months a year later, before leaving the sample for good. As a result, approximately 75 percent of the sample remains the same from month to month and 50 percent remains the same from year to year. This procedure strengthens the reliability of estimates of month-to-month and year-to-year change in the data.Each month, highly trained and experienced Census Bureau employees contact the 60,000 eligible sample households and ask about the labor force activities (jobholding and job seeking) or non-labor force status of the members of these households during the survey reference week (usually the week that includes the 12th of the month). These are live interviews conducted either in person or over the phone. During the first interview of a household, the Census Bureau interviewer prepares a roster of the household members, including key personal characteristics such as age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, veteran status, and so on. The information is collected using a computerized questionnaire.Each person is classified according to their activities during the reference week. Then, the survey responses are \"weighted,\" or adjusted to independent population estimates from the Census Bureau. The weighting takes into account the age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and state of residence of the person, so that these characteristics are reflected in the proper proportions in the final estimates.A sample is not a total count, and the survey may not produce the same results that would be obtained from interviewing the entire population. But the chances are 90 out of 100 that the monthly estimate of unemployment from the sample is within about 300,000 of the figure obtainable from a total census. Relative to total unemployment—which ranged between about 7 and 15 million over the past decade—the possible error resulting from sampling is not large enough to distort the total unemployment picture.This means that each sampling will be very diverse and have changes from time to time based on levels taken randomly or using the questionnaire method. The data will continue to change every month and is invalid for a certain period of time, so the government needs to update the data starting from screening, job applicants and graduation of applicants who were out of the sample last month.I took the questions posed to the informants, namely acting as a research sample that met the following requirements:Quote1. Does anyone in this household have a business or a farm?2. Last week, did you do any work for (either) pay (or profit)?If the answer to question 1 is \"yes\" and the answer to question 2 is \"no,\" the next question is:3.Last week, did you do any unpaid work in the family business or farm?For those who reply \"no\" to both questions 2 and 3, the next key questions used to determine employment status are:4. Last week, (in addition to the business) did you have a job, either full or part time? Include any job from which you were temporarily absent.5. Last week, were you on layoff from a job?6. What was the main reason you were absent from work last week?For those who respond \"yes\" to question 5 about being on layoff, the following questions are asked:7. Has your employer given you a date to return to work?If \"no,\" the next question is:8. Have you been given any indication that you will be recalled to work within the next 6 months?If the responses to either question 7 or 8 indicate that the person expects to be recalled from layoff, he or she is counted as unemployed. For those who were reported as having no job or business from which they were absent or on layoff, the next question is:9. Have you been doing anything to find work during the last 4 weeks?For those who say \"yes,\" the next question is:10. What are all of the things you have done to find work during the last 4 weeks?If an active method of looking for work, such as those listed at the beginning of this section, is mentioned, the following question is asked:11. Last week,, could you have started a job if one had been offered?If there is no reason, except temporary illness, that the person could not take a job, he or she is considered to be not only looking but also available for work and is counted as unemployed.According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the June 2022 Employment Situation is scheduled for release on July 8, 2022, at 8:30 am Eastern Time. So it could be that it will have a significant decrease or even increase. What is clear is that when the US economy is in an unpromising condition, it will only continue to worsen the unemployment data for the following month.",

The cost of living will likely rise as well, as more people compete for fewer resources.There would be widespread poverty, social unrest, and economic instability.I think at that point we would need to even ask ourselves if there is a society which can survive for long with an unemployment rate of 50%? And even if it does, is it a society in which we would like to live in? I ask this because in such a society it is obvious that people will do what they can to survive, so civil unrest all over the country will be a reality and even for the fortunate enough to still have a job it would be dangerous to move around the city, since the probabilities of being victims of a crime will go up dramatically at the point.",

      "body": "High official unemployment rates mean strengthening of informal economy in the country. I can't say about US, but in my country people work informally, because that is the gap found on the legislature for employers to have less expenses and commitments with employees and for small businessmen/autonomous workers to maximize their profits, since they don't pay extra taxes to the government they would have to, in case of registering a business legaly. There are pros and cons on this kind of economical concept, but one thing is for sure: we can't say 50% of the population is really unemployed just because official statistics are stating that.",

QuoteUS Jobless Rate Unchanged for 3rd MonthThe US unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.6 percent in May of 2022, the same as in the previous two months, remaining the lowest since February 2020 and compared with market expectations of 3.5 percent. The number of unemployed people increased by 9 thousand to 5.950 million, while employment levels rose by 321 thousand to 158.426 million. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate edged up to 62.3 percent in May from a 3-month low of 62.2 percent in Aprilsource: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate#:~:text=for%203rd%20Month-,The%20US%20unemployment%20rate%20was%20unchanged%20at%203.6%20percent%20in,market%20expectations%20of%203.5%20percent.USA is a country with over 329.5 million (2020) people of which we have got people who are yet unemployed and yet still doing better as a result of multiple side hustles, and internet stuffs which pays way more better than some office jobs, e.g Youtubing, Freelancing, website and app development e.t.c",
