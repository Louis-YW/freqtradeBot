Stay Clear of the  OSMU discord Why?: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5523134.0 Discord January 13, 2023, 01:23:19 AMHave been watching as a guest on this forum for a very long time. Over a decade. Bitcointalk has been great resource for information and many times of entertainment. Always thought is was cool, how you never had to register to get information. My personality is very introverted. Took a lot to actually create an account and put myself out there. I remember a time in Bitoins past. It was not really safe to say “hi I mine bitcoin” for fear of being kidnapped for your seed phrase.  Silk road was a thing in them days. Bitcoin had a stigma of criminality.  At the time a lot of  people did not want that stigma Bitcoin came with in their professional lives. Think that has always been my reasons for staying closeted bitcoin enthusiast. People fear what they do not understand. At that time very few actually understood it.  Never really got out of that fear intel recently. I was just a huge nerd that loved the concept of Bitcoin. Loved just playing around with computers and gadgets.Seeing how it has become more mainstream and lost a lot of that stigmas. People wear Bitcoin t-shirts now.  It was a huge risk at one time to wear a Bitcoin t-shirt out in public.  One of my life’s biggest regrets is. Not getting more involved in bitcoin community in the early days. Bitcoin has been a huge part of my life and would like to finally be an active member of it’s community .  A word to others like myself. I know you are out there. Watching passively . Get evolved. It is never to late. Come out of the Bitcoin closet. It is safe now.We have all watch the evolution of Bitcoin and thousands of altcoins. After all this time. Finding myself back to the start.  As in the start of Bitcoin we tinkered. We tried new things.Seems like Bitcoin is shifting from seeking the fastest miners to the most power efficient.  CK Pool really allows anyone the ability to solve solo blocks with modest hardware. That is huge in my opinion. The future of Bitcoin is somewhere in that direction. Low power usage more solo directional mining.It is on this forum every day. More people asking about how to go smaller. Go more energy effective. Not even caring so much about hashrate.After all these years. What has got me off the sidelines and active in this community, is a project that keeps coming up on the forums.  Bitaxe https://github.com/skot/bitaxe !!!  Would really enjoy contributing  to the Bitcoin community through developing these tiny energy effective open source bitcoin miners. Bitaxe reminded me of the excitement of my early day’s of Bitcoin. The earlier days of rushing to Bestbuy to buy as many GPU’s as possible or per-ordering  ASIC miners that only half would actually show up in the mailbox.  People who have been on this forum for awhile .Remember a time when projects like bitaxe was a dime a dozen. 2011-2013 most notable. Felt like a new mining company popped up every day. Most never ended up having any kind of success. A huge amount never even got built. A lot of talk about building. The ones that did are considered collectibles now. Everyone back in the day was trying to build their own asics. As time past these project dwindled down to nothing. What was the point really with Bitcoin diff so high.  Bitaxe really got me going again. I do have larger Bitcoin miners but what is the point anymore. They can literally break you with electricity cost. As many of you have. My miners are turned off.  My excitement for mining has not. As with most of you . Bitcoin mining has been a rewarding hobby and a big part of who you are as a person. Glad to finally meet you all,Updated:11/30/2023 Goals:Give away FOSS knowledge and hardware to counteract the centralization of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining.Updated:12/17/2024 Officially withdrawn my endorsement of the OSMU, providing detailed explanations here, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5523134.0",

Recommendation for printers that would functions for rapid prototyping?Already started pulling ASIC chips from my  “S9, S17 and S19” hashboards today. Gathering some of the smaller parts for the next stages of prototypes.The Voltera V-One specs are;Code:Minimum 8 mil (0.2mm) trace width and trace spacing - however, we recommend 10 mil for new users.Minimum 0.65mm pin pitch for SMT IC packages (0.5 mm for solder paste).Minimum 0603 passive size (0402 for solder paste).All of the Bitmain ASICs that I have seen are 0.48mm pin pitch. So that's going to be tough. You are also limited to only double sided boards. You can do plated holes and vias with those rivets, but they are huge and a PITA to install. I had access to a very fancy LPKF PCB mill at an old job, and it was usually more trouble than it was worth -- and that had automatic tool changes for different drills.I think you could bang out some quick prototypes with the Voltera, but once you want to do anything remotely complicated you'll need 4 layer professional boards. JLCPCB, Seeed and other shops in China are soooo cheap for getting PCBs and stencils. Shipping takes a while, but if you setup a full pipeline of boards coming in, you'll have plenty to keep you busy.For small run protos I do like to assemble the boards myself. I think you'd have more benefit from investing in a laser cutter to make stencils, a stencil printer and a reflow oven. maybe even get a pick-n-place machine!

Going to be looking into compiling a new list that includes laser cutter ,stencil printer ,reflow oven and LumenPnP. That  LumenPnP so beyond cool. Watched 30+ videos last night of the Lumenpnp. Speechless on how amazing it is. Your experience in what we need full time. Others like you. If I was to solve a bitcoin block today. That would be my first order of business. I am acquiring a lot of new skill sets. These same skill-sets you already are well versed. What this grassroots imitative really needs is you working on this  9-5 monday-friday.This is something as a community we need to figure out how to make possible. Many people have walked away from Bitcoin with great wealth. They contributed nothing to the development or bettering the space in general. They took and gave nothing.  We need to figure out a way that people like you. Who do the work and are passionate about bitcoin centered development. People who offer the work up free of charge and open source can work on this stuff full time.Made a development discord . We can all work on these things in real time",

Marketing & money from selling their mining TOYS is definitely their focus, not supporting the open source mining community. The sole reason PublicPool exists is because most other pools will not accept running the original NerdMiner from them because of the extremely low hash rate. At least the org BitAxe are (barely) fast enough to get around that.",
