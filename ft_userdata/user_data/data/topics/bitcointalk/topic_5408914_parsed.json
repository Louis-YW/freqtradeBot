In this case it is very clear that the email came from a throwaway or similar and looking to scam some innocent user.Such mass emails are very commonly done to catch that one in a hundred flock of users and in crypto this is very common. Good for you to report this but I am sure the scammers have already had their catch, since only few of these actually get reported and the scammers keep doing it over and over again because that one catch is all they need to fuel their rush of stealing money.",

Did you initially think that it was a legit email, or were you just curious to see what will happen? It's clear from what they wrote in the email that they want your recovery phrase, even though they call it a \"keystore phrase\". You were lucky this time. Maybe next time there will be malware attached to the link that executes when you click on it, and you will infect your device playing around like that. Just delete the email and don't gamble with you money and security if it happens again. What kind of dumb recovery method is that? Only six words. Why didn't they ask for all 12/24 (not sure what the length of Exodus seeds is) lol.Even if you entered 6/12 or 6/24 words, they wouldn't be able to bruteforce the remaining ones and gain access to your coins.",

I agree with you that it's an amateurish phishing attempt but I think whoever is behind this knows about Exodus seed lengths. If you take another look at the second picture in OP,  you will notice that they are asking for the following words from the seed: 1st, 5th, 10th, 12th, 2nd, and 4th. But I still don't understand why they want only 6 words in total. Someone messed up creating this thing.",

The switched up order is probably just a poor attempt to make it seem more \"official\" and less scammy.Brute forcing 6 words, while theoretically possible, would require a huge amount of computing power and cost. Here is an example of someone who managed to brute force 4 words in 30 hours by spending $350 renting GPUs. His benchmark was 143,000 seed phrases per second, which is very similar to the 134,000 seed phrases per second btcrecover says it can manage on some modest hardware: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GPU_Acceleration/To brute force 6 words using these numbers, you would need to multiply those numbers by 20482. However, they ask for the 12th checksum word, so that would reduce the computational requirements as you could reject 15/16 seed phrases for failing the checksum and not have to turn the seed phrase in to an address to check for balance, which is the computational expensive part of the process. Even so, some very rough calculations puts that at ~$100 million over 900 years, or a far higher cost to rent better/more hardware and do that in anything approaching a reasonable time frame. So unless they know for a fact your Exodus wallet is holding hundreds of thousands of bitcoin, then only an idiot would attempt it.So if anyone has given out 6 of their words to this scam, then the good news is your coins are probably not about to be stolen provided you have never and will never reveal any of your other words. You should still set up a new wallet and seed phrase and move everything across, though.",

However, some people are quite convinced that making a winning combination of 2048 words is more likely than winning the lottery, which is of course far from the truth.",
