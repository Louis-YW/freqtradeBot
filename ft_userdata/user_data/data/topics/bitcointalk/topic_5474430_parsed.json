  "content": "Most people for the first time when they hear of bitcoin, due to its volatile nature that can pump very high within a twinkle of an eye during the bullish period, they misunderstand it to be a get rich quick scheme not knowing the reason behind the pump in price. This has made so many newbies rush into bitcoin as they think that the moment they purchase bitcoin in few months they will make mega profit, unknown to them that it doesn't work that way. This will make them borrow money to invest in bitcoin or use the funds for their monthly expenses and emergency funds to invest in bitcoin, and when what they expected didn't turn out to be so, they get disappointed and due to tension on them for using funds that was not meant to buy bitcoin, they end up selling at a lower price than their entry price and run at loss.Bitcoin investment is just like a normal investment that when you start it initially, you take your time to grow, nurture and monitor it, with patient and discipline to make sure that the investment flourishes. The investment can only flourish,when you give it a long  time. It will flourish to the extend that when you take profit from the investment is still ongoing, and not within two years but let's say from four years and above. But if your investment has just started taking shape and you want to start taking profit, you might end up crumbling the investment, because it is still in its early stage.This is how we should see bitcoin investment like, but bitcoin investment is more of value because when you have it in mind that you are buying bitcoin and invest in a long term goal and also having a target of bitcoin that you want to accumulate for yourself in maybe 4-10yrs and above. You will see that you will prepare yourself towards how to achieve that goal. For you to be able to achieve your long term goal, you budget a percentage from your income that wouldn't affect your monthly expenses, so that you can be buying consistently every week, monthly or quarterly, in order to increase your bitcoin portfolio because the size of your portfolio with the timeline is what will determine your profit. Bitcoin investment is worth investing into because  it might be that, it is your bitcoin investment that will turn your life around in future and you will be happy that you invested and hodli for a long term and you could meet up your bitcoin target.Bitcoin is not altcoins that can be hype, bitcoin has a solid foundation and has come to stay, the government knows this and that is why they are approving Bitcoin ETF, which US SEC will soon approve that. Can you just imagine when you build a house without a foundation, any little breeze will shatter it and that is how those altcoins are, they are pump and dump and they were created to scam people who are greedy and need quick profit or people who don't know the potential of bitcoin. Investing on altcoins will be the worst thing to do because it is the same as gambling.Why are you after a quick profit investment, when you know that there is no investment that has lasted, that will give quick profit. The only way that you can profit from bitcoin is when you invest in a long term and focus your mindset on a long term goal with regular DCA. When you invest in bitcoin for a short term, the possibility of you to run at loss is high than when you invest in long term. Invest wisely...What is your thought on this.",

Investing in bitcoin requires patience, understanding, good decision making and knowledge how crypto investment works, Not totally pure knowledge about crypto but at least has an idea and background about the coin. It can't make you rich in just a snap, Always remember that all investments takes time so if you're planning for a long term investment in bitcoin, it's important to set aside money for emergencies and to have debt under control.",

      "body": "The story of Bitcoin is indeed full of false conceptions. You're exactly right: its attraction often hides the fact that investments take time to grow. You wont get rich quickly; it will take time and effort, but it could be worth it in the end. This misunderstanding makes a lot of people risk their most important things in order to make quick money, only to face the harsh tune of instability.A new idea, though: what if we thought of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\"? Just like gold, its a way to save money over time. Its not a raffle ticket. Strategic accumulation is what its all about, not wild guesswork. Your plan to make regular investments that dont break the bank (DCA) is a good one. This way lowers the risk of trying to time the market, which makes your relationship with Bitcoin healthier in the long run.Dont forget either that Bitcoin is still becoming better. Its base is better than the weak altcoins, which is a good sign. Still, its important to spread your money around and balance Bitcoin with other assets. If the world of investments is full of chances, why put all your eggs in one basket? Remember that patience is a technique in investing, therefore lets move carefully.",

They don't care about other benefits like privacy and decentralization. It is correct that was designed to be a currency but anti-government policies, ignorance and volatility have made it a more speculative asset than are currency. I think the post is focused on discussing bitcoin as an investment which is also a part of the bitcoin system. But I get your point @ztight, we should always present Bitcoin as a currency and not just as a means of making money.",

Nothing changes the fact that BTC as an investment is a secondary purpose, when people learn about the BTC network first before learning about how to make returns from BTC, they would secure their funds better and they will care more about privacy and other important aspects of BTC, and then they can make returns from BTC with some of their coins, I believe this is the proper way things should go.",

Everything you have said is valid mate. But I want to add that many people who think that Bitcoin is a scam didn't buy Bitcoin. Many of them were deceived to buy several shitcoins believing that they are investing in Bitcoin. There are many so-called crypto experts who hide behind the concept of \"cryptocurrency\" to scam people. Many people don't know the difference between altcoins and Bitcoin so they are easily scammed and when that happens they conclude that all cryptos are scams.",

Altcoins are very risky and you can have big profit with them but in a bear market, you will lose a lot of money if you invest in altcoins and hold them through a bear market. Many of altcoins will die and usually have 99% price loss in a bear market. Very little altcoins can make new all time highs like Ethereum.Bitcoin is different, it always makes a new all time high with each market cycle because Bitcoin leads this market. Halving each four years creates a market bull cycle for altcoins to join. Dollar Cost Averaging does not help you to get rich quickly but if you can DCA a long time, you will have very big capital spent for DCA. When a bull run comes, with capital you have with DCA, you will have good profit like effortlessly.When Bitcoin runs, it can not be stopped. DCA will help your portfolio increases a lot with a Bitcoin bull run. You can take profit effortlessly too because Bitcoin has very high trading volume.",

It serves as a good hedge, especially for countries experiencing hyperinflation with their fiat currencies. Governments that may not be transparent about their economic status, particularly the impact of substantial debts, could potentially surprise their citizens with the existence of hyperinflation. In such cases, being aware of Bitcoin could provide a safeguard, allowing individuals to relocate to other countries if necessary. All they would need is the key to access their Bitcoin wallet, making it a portable and potentially secure asset in times of economic uncertainty.",
