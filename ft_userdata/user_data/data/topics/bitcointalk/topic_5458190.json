  "content": "Bitcoin Depot, one of the largest cryptocurrency ATM firms in the United States, has announced the closing of a merger deal allowing the company to go public.In a June 30 announcement, fintech firm GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corporation said its stockholders had approved the merger for the firm to act as a special purpose acquisition company for Bitcoin Depot. The deal, first reported in August 2022, cost $885 million and is expected to allow investors exposure to Bitcoin Depot on the Nasdaq starting July 3.According to Bitcoin Depot founder and CEO Brandon Mintz, the merger deal was aimed at supporting “numerous growth opportunities” and promoting the adoption of Bitcoinin North America. Investors will be able to find shares of Bitcoin Depot under the ticker symbols BTM and BTMWW for its common stock and public warrants, respectively.The announcement came amid regulatory scrutiny of firms in the U.S. offering crypto products or services. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed lawsuits against exchanges Binance and Coinbase for alleged unregistered securities offerings. However, investment vehicles with exposure to crypto also seem to be on the rise following BlackRock filing an application in June to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Founded in 2016, Bitcoin Depot is one of the biggest crypto ATM firms in North America, with more than 9,130 locations, according to its website. In May, fellow ATM provider Bitcoin of America announced it would shutter operations in Connecticut following the state’s Department of Banking saying the firm didn’t have the proper licensing...

What we are seeing is just the effects of ETF and if one of them gets approved you can expect Bitcoin to hit 40k. Crypto/Bitcoin ATM does help in Bitcoin adoption but they are not the best place to buy or sell Bitcoin. The reason being high transaction fees, less to nil security and you might also face technical issues. It is better to use exchanges rather than ATM.",

      "body": "The decision for cryptocurrency firms to go public can have both benefits and drawbacks. Going public can increase the visibility and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry, attracting attention from mainstream investors and regulators. It also allows firms to raise capital for expansion and innovation. Publicly traded companies are subject to regulatory requirements, which can enhance transparency and governance within the industry. However, going public may lead to increased regulation (which many people don't want), potentially compromising cryptocurrencies' privacy and decentralization principles. It's a lot to think about.",

Also there fees are generally higher than the other methods of getting bitcoin except otherwise the mempool is congested which I think it also affects them. As for the speed they aren’t faster as people point it out just a little bit than the usual way, because they would still generate transaction ID for you to wait or later get the confirmation. Aside the only advantage of using cash to buy bitcoin from it, there isn’t any too great advantages it has.",

I just searched and I see that you can trade without KYC below certain limits, but they don't specify which ones. If this is not the case, this type of ATMs have no future, because they have high fees. The main reason why people pay these fees is to do it without KYC.",

I was never really a fan of Bitcoin ATMs, because I never felt the  need to use one(and there aren't any Bitcoin ATMs in the city where I live). Bitcoin/crypto is more convenient 100% online and without having to visit a certain place outside of your house.Congratulations to this company for going public and I really hope that the fees for using a Bitcoin ATM will drop severely in the future.",

Always just seemed like a bad way to buy Bitcoin, given that the fees seem horrible. And you also probably wouldn't be buying much Bitcoin at an ATM. Though I suppose if you're just buying a little bit at a time, and if you can do it anonymously, and you don't mind the fees and consider it just an extra cost for being anonymous, then maybe it's worth it for some people.I don't know how they work, like does each ATM transaction give you bitcoin in a different address, or can you specify the address where you want the Bitcoin? Cuz if it is the former that would make it much less useful. But if you can like DCA Bitcoin a little bit at a time at an ATM to a single address anonymously and just pay the extra ATM fees to get that anonymity then that's a fairly legit use case.",

If you're talking about most users in this forum, I can see that. But I doubt the average joe values privacy more than flexibility.  I agree with you, even though KYC can harm privacy, many people will do it in transactions and maybe out of necessity and not much choice. For example, when using a centralized exchange that requires someone to complete KYC and there are lots of people doing it, except when talking to people on forums like you said. Talk about privacy and flexibility depending on who we talk to, but KYC can indeed jeopardize privacy and that we all agree on.Quote from: joniboini on July 01, 2023, 09:42:45 AMThat being said, not really sure it will impact any adoption.

Any positive news in the industry can reduce FUD and increase FOMO. This step by Bitcoin Depot will increase the establishment of more ATMs thereby giving people more access to cryptocurrencies.

You have either have to do a P2P trade which some people may be uncomfortable doing OR figure out anther way to get cash to someone. But with this you put cash in and get BTC out. AND unlike a lot of P2P traders they do have low limits. Looking at BISQ and RoboSats and LocalCryptos and a few others the people that accept cash by mail or P2P all have higher limits. So just doing $50 is not always an option.If you are meeting someone there is the cost of gas & time & whatever. Want to securely mail someone $200 in cash fine, but mail with tracking costs a few $ and then you have to wait a couple of days. Or you just pay $110 for $100 in BTC and be done in a couple of minutes.Not perfect, but it is what it is.Anyone buying? I was thinking of picking up some shares for my IRA.-Dave",

But about the impact that occurs maybe only a decline but will recover again as it is today.
