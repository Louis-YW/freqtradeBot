Back to your question, there is a possibility btc can go lower than current price due to the bearish market and other negative news happening lately.  And no, it is highly unlikely that btc will go as low as $50, that is way too ridiculous, btc has too much utility to fall that low. That will be like going back to 8 to 9 years ago when btc was at $50.Since you know so well the price will dip even more, you should be happy to buy the dip, all you need is some spare cash. Buy the dip why you can, don't wait for $50 and miss out on a good price.",

For me, where there is a risk, there is an opportunity, and to be successful requires taking risks and sometimes trade-offs. Once it becomes too certain and secure, it is no longer called an opportunity.",

If one day we humans mine a metal more precious than gold, gold is still at risk of depreciating, and bitcoin is no exception.Investing in bitcoin is a risky investment, so consider the risk, not just the return.

Yes, WW3 is a big threat but I’m confident that it wont happen because many countries can’t afford this, we should not go back to that era. Bitcoin is still the top coins, don’t overthink about this because I’m confident that this wont happen, we are bound to rise higher.",

Even though BTC is considered to be the safest crypto, it still can drop and then it may take time for it to recover like on what we are experiencing now. Some of us may get bored waiting, some will get worried, etc which can lead them to sell at a loss.I don't think it's a problem for him when BTC crash but he was actually waiting for it to buy more coins. A massive drop like that will only be a problem for those who don't have a solid faith in BTC. Pretty sure that they already sold all their BTC's before the price reached 50 dollars.",

If we look at Historical Data and statistics, we will find that bitcoin did not reach the prices that you mentioned before during the previous nine years, and I strongly believe that Bitcoin in the future will achieve new ATH, so I would like to spend every cent I have in Bitcoin, as the prices are still within everyone's reach.",
