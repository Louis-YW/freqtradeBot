  "content": "As many of you probably know by now, the SEC is suing Binance, and more recently Coinbase as well. How does this affect altcoins? 61 have so far been labelled as securities by the SEC:QuoteThe SEC has now declared that these 48 crypto tokens are securities: XRP (XRP), Telegramâ€™s Gram (TON), LBRY Credits (LBC), OmiseGo (OMG), DASH (DASH), Algorand (ALGO), Naga (NGC), Monolith (TKN), IHT Real Estate (IHT), Power Ledger (POWR), Kromatica (KROM), DFX Finance (DFX), Amp (AMP), Rally (RLY), Rari Governance Token (RGT), DerivaDAO (DDX), XYO Network (XYO), Liechtenstein Cryptoasset Exchange (LCX), Kin (KIN) Salt Lending (SALT), Beaxy Token (BXY), DragonChain (DRGN), Tron (TRX), BitTorrent (BTT), Terra USD (UST), Luna (LUNA), Mirror Protocol (MIR), Mango (MNGO), Ducat (DUCAT), Locke (LOCKE), EthereumMax (EMAX), Hydro (HYDRO), BitConnect (BCC), Meta 1 Coin (META1), Filecoin (FIL), BNB (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Cosmos (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Axie Infinity (AXS), COTI (COTI), Paragon (PRG) and AirToken (AIR).QuoteIn addition, the SEC has deemed that these 13 Mirror Protocol mAssets are securities: Mirrored Apple Inc. (mAAPL), Mirrored Amazon.com, Inc. (mAMZN), Mirrored Alibaba Group Holding Limited (mBABA), Mirrored Alphabet Inc. (mGOOGL), Mirrored Microsoft Corporation (mMSFT), Mirrored Netflix, Inc. (mNFLX), Mirrored Tesla, Inc. (mTSLA), Mirrored Twitter Inc.

Notably Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin and Dogecoin haven't been considered securities, so personally I think value could now flow into them after this announcement (apart from BNB), away from others that are at risk of being sued. Potentially these lawsuits will be fought and won, but otherwise the labelling of these securities may well stick.",

I might be an old man before this is settled.One interesting factor is the strategy SEC are using to label altcoins securities. Instead of going to for altcoins themselves, they are going for the exchanges facilitating trading instead. This effectively means that the altcoins can't defend themselves against the accusation (as this becomes the responsibility of exchanges if they chose it to do so). This is similar to the SEC lawsuit against Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather for shilling Ethereum Max. They never actually filed a lawsuit against the coin, but only the promoters. So it very much seems they are trying to same tactic here again, in order to get certain altcoins classified as securities by courts, without the founders/executives of altcoins being able to defend themselves against it. I realise that XRP is the exception to the rule, as they are defending themselves right now which is probably costing SEC a lot of money, hence they are likely trying to avoid directly creating lawsuits against other coins with lots of funds available.",

As you can see, that binance regularly making very huge profits from its product and it has so much reserved funds even more compared with XRP. Any opinion regarding it? Yes, maybe I didn't explain the SEC's strategy so well here. As you point out Binance has a lot of funds to defend themselves (likewise with Coinbase). The hope is likely that these exchanges will settle in one way or another, that otherwise accepts the concept that certain altcoins (up to 61 of them) will be considered securities. After all, it's common that the SEC eventually will want to settle on a lower figure.The strategy can otherwise be considered as follows:1. Target major exchanges claiming A,B,C to Z are securities. This saves issuing 61 individual lawsuits against accused securities, that would cost a lot more money and time. This is the obvious move.2. Hope that one of these exchanges accepts a deal and settles without going to court, thus acknowledging that certain altcoins are therefore securities, and therefore removing them from platforms.3. With these settlements, then file lawsuits against said securities, with the accusation that major exchanges have also acknowledged they are securities, so they must be securities.4. Hope that these altcoins being sued as securities also settle, given the so-called evidence that major exchanges have accepted they are securities, and also due to damaged reputations.Obviously the main flaw in this logic is thinking that Binance or Coinbase will settle for anything less than a win. It's very likely they will be able to \"pool funds\" from the accused altcoins for their defence, given it's in the interest of these altcoins to be defended (even if not directly). Therefore it's more likely their legal defence budget will become a bottomless pit and will cost the SEC a lot of money in the long-run.At least overall I don't see either exchange \"rolling over\" for the SEC, as it would set a precedent that they can't list new altcoins without their explicit approvals, which would be detrimental to their business models. In this sense, the SEC appears to very much be \"trying it on\" with the accusations of numerous altcoins that are securities, as even if they are, they will struggle to prove it (like with the XRP case).As for the accusations against Binance, which is considerably different to that of Coinbase (that's solely selling securities related), it's likely they'll settle on the accusation of co-mingling funds and allowing US customers to use their platform, as it's not worth defending if there is enough evidence to support these claims. As for the securities argument/claim, I doubt they'll go down without a fight.In summary, they are trying \"catch all\" lawsuits against these two companies (so far), in order to avoid dozens if not hundreds of individual lawsuits, that they simply don't have the time for.",

This assessment directly affects the legal and tax regulations applicable to these cryptocurrencies globally. If the SEC continues to issue decisions to sue and evaluate many other cryptocurrencies as securities, this will cause confusion and negatively affect the cryptocurrency market in the future. This can undermine investors' confidence and cause the weakening of crypto projects that have not been identified as securities. Legal and tax regulations if applied on these cryptocurrencies could push prices down and affect the development of the crypto market as well. Investors should carefully consider and research carefully before investing in any cryptocurrency and monitor the decisions and policies of financial regulators to make informed decisions. reasonable investment.",

Many of these currencies has very questionable marketing tactic to begin with. In sale phase of a token/coin, marketing itself can define if the token or coin is a security. Which is one of the reason when they are attacking the third parties providing the hype for tokens/coins. And i am guessing that most promoters got free hands on promoting and are promoting those assets illegally, hinting any growth in investment price is enough.Â I am not sure what kind of place twitter is these days but at some point they needed to add more restrictive rules for promoting things like cryptocurrencies. Which most people didn't seem to follow, but i am guessing that was twitter's way of washing their hands so they won't get sued by allowing this.",
