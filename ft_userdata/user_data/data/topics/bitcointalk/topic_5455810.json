  "content": "I stumbled upon a thread by Jet Cash, and it appears to be like a professor interacting with his students, rewarding them with merits for their answers. Honestly, I'm quite impressed with what he has done as it encourages posters to provide more valuable posts, especially those who want to receive merits. As we alll know, not all good posts are merited since some boards do not have as many merits as others. This brings me to a suggestion for our merit sources out there. Maybe you can create a thread on an important topic for discussion and reward those who share their valuable insights. This way, it would be easier to determine if a thread contains valuable information, as it is initiated by the merit source itself. I hope you understand what I'm trying to emphasize.I'm not suggesting that it should be compulsory for merit sources, but I wanted to share what I have observed. It's up to you guys to decide how you perceive it.You can see the thread here ; [Merits again] Discuss the velocity of Bitcoin",

I need to go fishing some merits, my merit-blood is low for some time. Lol.",

A practical solution would be to increase the number of sources and make it so that a good post regardless of where it is posted would be found out.Users, whether they are sources or not, can choose to make threads to offer merit, that's their own perspective of how the view merit giving, it doesn't apply to everyone.

This would have been a good suggestion to adopt but we should also consider the possibility for the abuse, quite alright we have some threads created by merits sources that allows then to review quality posts and merits, a good example is the one created by LoyceV on reputation to report any unmerited quality post on his thread, there's one for Ratimov and so also Fillippone all on beginners and help, not all merit source will be able to adopt the same pattern, some do visit threads randomly across different boards to merit their quality posters and so on.",

I prefer when merit is rewarded in natural way - when merit source or just random member see good post and simply reward it with merit. Most of these merit giveaway threads tend to ass licking and posts made just to try getting merit. Also, as mentioned above, with AI being hottest thing in 2023 many members can try writting posts with it when they try to get merit.Sorry if my comparison may be not appropriate for some members, but merit giveway threads reminds me giving treats for dogs whn they have donesomething good.

As we alll know, not all good posts are merited since some boards do not have as many merits as others. The merit system is enough to encourage users to create high quality posts. If any user decides to create a thread and reward people that participate well in it with merits, that's their own way and nothing wrong with that, overall everybody has their own style. But what's wrong is if it becomes something we see too often, in which the only way to receive merits is if you join in threads created by a user who is giving them out. It is going to be counterproductive, and would lead people to post in threads they have no interest in, or plagiarising just to post in them.",

A person should try to create high-quality posts and not worry about that. After a while, if he doesn't get enough merits, he can ask her, but don't make your focus on getting merits more than improving the quality of your posts.",

Merit looks like something that is recycling within some group of people. It is not that only those people make merit worthy posts. It is because they enjoy reading one another's post, it is only when you have read my posts that you will drop merits for me.This is why newbies who wants to rank up keep creating new topics even when it's not needed in order to expose their accounts for merits.Conversations are buried easily, but opened thread can be bumped at any time.The solution to this problem is that when a merit source stumbles on one quality post from a user, they should try to look into the profile of that user to drop more merits if they see quality posts. This should be done for users below 1000 merits. Another solution is what The Sceptical Chymist do as post review.",

Then finally, fillipone also deemed that as a perfect means to help prominent rookies rank up,... Uhhmmm, I understand that it might not be enough since we've got alot of rookies lately; but, you seee... If it gets in excess, then there are chances of those birdbrains ranking up too...
