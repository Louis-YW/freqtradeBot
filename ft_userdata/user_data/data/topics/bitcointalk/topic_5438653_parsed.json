  "content": "I mentioned somewhere that my closest friend has been unemployed for over a year due to the devastating collapse of his line of business and and his wife's sickness. Last time we met was a month ago and he was depressed in certain ways which worried me a lot. I called him to see if he was fine last Sunday and he told me he was looking for jobs and the next day he would go to several interviews. I was glad to hear that. Last night I called to follow up and he said the interviews were not going well. I aksed why. He told me that nowadays most companies are not doing well, barely making even actually. The interviewers would just say the job is not entitled to any insurance or benefits, what they can offer is a very low base salary and the commission part would be subject to how many sales the employee can bring to their company. My friend was not willing to take any of them because he has a family to feed and his wife's condition is unstable which could need a lot of money for surgery at any time. I understand him and am trying my best to help him find a high-pay job. My friend's story sends me a signal: no matter how much I earn right now, try to keep my job and souce of income stable. I am also a family man and have responsibilities. Anything bad can also happen to me so I have to be prepared to the unforseen problems, although I am doing fine now. Make hay while the sun shines. If you have any advice for my friend, please let me know. Thank you.",

It was the same situation for me before; if I hadn't accepted the $4 per day salary, we would not be eating for a few days. He should accept it while he is still finding another job. Having multiple source of income and also having savings is needed for us because anything can happen so we should be ready that even if we lost our job we can still last 6months with food in the table",

If you have any advice for my friend, please let me know. Thank you.Life is filled with uncertainties that's why we need to plan. Regardless of how much you earn ensure you continuously save some part of your income no matter how small. It would also be good if you engage in some insurance policies such as health, fire, occupational, or even life. This might help reduce the impact of some harsh uncertainties. It is also important to note that some uncontrollable environmental factors influence the citizens of every county. Issues like natural disasters, economic problems, high rates of unemployment, and political instability. One must not suffer from depression because of situations that he cannot influence or change. We must learn to endure these difficulties and try as much as we can to reduce their negative impact.Tell your friend to be cheerful and keep searching for a job and let him also check out jobs on some online job platforms like Upwork and others. He might be able to get an international job that would sustain his family. Also, tell him to be strong for his family because depression can be deadly and his family needs him.",

During my time, I was also involved in similar work, and very often, good money can be made solely on the number of sales and bonuses. In your spare time, advise your friend to begin improving in their specialty, as today you must have all modes of communication to obtain a high-paying job.",

I am talking from a personal experience here, my wife did not need any surgery but I too turned down job offers because I mostly thought they were not willing to pay me what is desirable based on my previous jobs and experience and it was a difficult time caring for the family. I believe you should advise him like someone also mentioned earlier, it is better to take small than not to have at all.",

That is way safer, look for side hustles that can provide you additional income other than your main source income. At least, when one fails, other sources will still be reliable. However, with regards to your friend, I suggest not to be picky on jobs because he is in badly needed for a stable income so he should have a work that can put food on the table and can provide his family’s basic needs. Otherwise, his family will starve to death, if he will always wait for a high compensated job. And if he is really thinking about his wife’s condition, he should do what it takes so he can provide money for the upcoming surgery if ever.",

It could be harder now due to many thousands of tech and IT positions being cut by large corporations during 2022. But there is a good variety of micro degrees which can be obtained without needing an expensive college loan with years of debt repayment.There are many free tutorials and educational content available on the internet, which can be used to learn and master new vocational skills. Many in their 40s and older with no prior experience who are learning to develop mobile apps and new IT skills to reinvent themselves. There are a number of feel good stories circulating about the trend. I'm not saying its easy. But there are open doors and opportunities which could be available.",

At the very least, he could use his paycheck to survive while he continued to look for another job. I'm sure if he really tries, there will be a way for him, especially since he has a family to look after and feed daily. Everything is really hard and we definitely want a better job but we won't find it right away because it's a process we must go through to get a better job. Next time, if we apply at the company and get hired, he better take it for a while to earn a salary and survive.",

Companies are now reaching out to individuals of average skill, i.e. with expertise. If your friend has special expertise in a certain area, that's probably where he or she can make some money.",

I also agree with mk4's point about multiple sources of income. I currently work as a private teacher with various students, and I feel good about being able not to worry if one of them decides to stop our lessons or if I find it difficult to work with a particular person. Different sources of income give you more freedom, but it's also a challenge of its own to plan your week, do different tasks under different conditions, instead of just focusing on one job and a fixed schedule.",

If you have any advice for my friend, please let me know. Thank you.Thankfully we have free healthcare in here so we don't have to worry as much. But my parent's were still raised after war mentality that anything could end any time. And it's important to hoard everything and not throw away anything. That it's important to save wealth and not use it to anything but for absolute necessities.They were always prepared for the worst, ilness, electricity shortages, lack of clean water etc. And i guess that rubbed on me too. I try to keep emergency cash and have an account for emergencies only. Money can't really bring happiness but it can bring security that you aren't living in the streets next year because you haven't been prepared for the worst case scenario. Unless something catastrophic happens i will live i guess. But i couldn't really prepare for those any better then my government had as they have been building insanely large bunkers since 80s. So we have our food rations and medicine and infrastructure in place even in the case of nuclear attack.So gladly i don't have to be a much of a prepper myself.",

      "body": "My parents are just the opposite, they were raised in a very poor life, specially my father who lost his father at age 18 which means that he had to be the earner of the house, while my nation had left-right people killing each other, he hated politics because only thing he  cared about was making sure that his mom and his two little brothers were taken care of, and he disliked people who had the \"chance\" to be leftist or right wing when he didn't had time for any of that and he had to work. After that he got married with my mom, and they had me, so he had to work for nearly 45 years, and that resulted with him being super tired of this life of constantly earning. Now? He just sits back and does absolutely nothing, and he doesn't spend too much money, but he does literally nothing, not hoarding, not anything, so he realized the importance of stream of income to make sure you are fine, but didn't do much else.Maybe that is why I am the sort of person who would give anything a try, I love my job, and I will never quit it, but also that doesn't mean I won't chase my dreams or ideas, because I saw what giving up everything did to my dad, and I feel like I do not want to be like that, which is why I have worked in a dozen different industries, and settled in crypto, I didn't work in other jobs because I wasn't good at it, but as soon as someone promoted me, because I did a good job, it started a scary ticking noise in my head and I quit, because I didn't want promotion, I wanted freedom to do anything I want.

Yes. If we can have multi sources of income, that will make our finances more stable and secured rather than just focusing on a single source of income alone. Moreover, on the part of your friend, if his mindset will stay that way, he will never land a job easily and have his own income. People who are in bad situation should never care if their jobs are low paid as long as they can earn an income from it, rather than having no income at all. Besides, he’s a family man so he should always have the means to support his family, especially his wife who is very ill at the moment.",
