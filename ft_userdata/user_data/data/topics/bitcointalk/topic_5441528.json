When you send Bitcoin to some exchanges, the exchange will inform you that you will be credited after 6 confirmations on the block or 2 or even 1, depending on what the exchange requires, to me this adds layers of safety protection for exchanges but it doesn't matter when sending Bitcoin to a friend, 1 confirmation is all you need for the other wallet to receive Bitcoin.",

If you attempt to make a transaction which spends coins you do not have, it will be rejected as invalid by any node you broadcast it to, if your wallet software lets you sign the transaction at all.",

Gambling platform as example usually credit balance even if the transaction is still unconfirmed in the blockchain then allow user to withdraw when the balance received 1 confirmation. Exchange do the same by allowing you to trade for only 1 confirmation then 2 confirmation to withdraw or trade via P2P.3 confirmation above is very safe but it will take some time to occur that’s why it’s rarely use as basis to determine the safety of the transaction.",

Read the OP question again and check nc50lc post which answered it. If your transaction is confirmed, it is included into a block mined by a miner, that is one confirmation. If the next block is mined, it becomes two confirmed and so on. That is what this thread is all about.",

That's the entire basis behind CPFP. I spend some unconfirmed coins in a new transaction with a higher fee, and then (hopefully) a miner will include both the parent and child transaction in the same block in order to cash in on the high fee paid by the child transaction.Quote from: un_rank on February 28, 2023, 01:31:27 PMBut for clarity, wouldn't the transaction have to be validated by nodes to be available for confirmationThat's also correct. Spending unconfirmed UTXOs is entirely valid and nodes will verify and broadcast such a transaction without issue.The sentence from me which you quoted was simply referring to people trying to make transactions with less than the \"minimum amount required\", as asawale put it. If you try to make a transaction spending more coins than you have, that transaction will simply be rejected. This is a different concept to spending coins which you do have, but are not yet confirmed.",

In theory, the system will check the new transaction's validity and will find that the inputs are not validated. If the previous transaction is valid, both will get validated in a single block. It's the normal thinking to make someone undertsnad lol.Quote from: Findingnemo on February 28, 2023, 03:11:36 PMwhich are confirmed by nodes if I am not wrong.A = Current block where your tx is added (your tx got 1 confirmation)B = Next block (your tx got 2 confirmation)C = Next block (your tx got 3 confirmation)With each block added, your confirmation will get 1 more confirmation.",

The inputs will be perfectly valid. If they weren't valid inputs then they couldn't be spent at all, and they might not even have been allowed to be created in the first. Most wallets will reject a transaction if you try to send coins to an invalid address, for example, but it is also entirely possible to send bitcoin to invalid locking scripts which can never be unlocked, meaning they can never be spent.The node will verify the child transaction, and although it finds that the child transaction is spending unconfirmed inputs, those inputs will be perfectly valid.

Yup,.more confirmation the chances of reversing it gets slim but for few hundred dollars I will be okay with 1 confirmation for thousands 3 or more so it depends on how we are convinced and cautious to avoid any loss.Talking about moving millions worth of BTC still 6 is enough because that is what exchange's accept cause the cost of reversing will be higher than the amount we are moving correct me if I am wrong.",
