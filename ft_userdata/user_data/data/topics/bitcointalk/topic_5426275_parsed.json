Will end-stage adopters own only thousands of satoshis? Mabey by that point people will disassociate the value of bitcoin:fiat and associate it to another form of value? If Bitcoin is as mainstream as you imagined it to be, I think most of us will be happy even if we don't own 0.1 BTC. There's no need to feel shame just because you own a thousand satoshis if they are worth millions. I don't think we will see fiat die completely and be replaced with other currencies, so I think BTC:fiat won't be gone either. However, I can see BTC being used as the standard instead since fiat is inflationary and so prone to failure (like Bolivar, for example). No reason not to be happy if that is the case.",

We are hoping that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time and that the price will be less volatile, because we want people to use it as a Currency first and then as a Store of Value.   So, for this to happen.... we first have to make sure that there are a more even distribution of Satoshis between people and not a high concentration of bitcoins for Bitcoin Whales only.",

Bitcoin has become the alternative to world's fiat cash.To me that's why i will insist on saying that bitcoin is only permitted to be accountable for those investors having their coins in their personal wallet and not an exchange wallet, this should be the basic standard to set for those using bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies, there's no mistake be it small when it was been said that bitcoin is yours whenever you have it with you in the wallet which the common slogan for not your keys not your coins set in very importantly.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on December 07, 2022, 04:31:21 AMThe price of Bitcoin is definitely higher than it is now.That is right and is one of the expectations to have when you're dealing with a volatile digital currency like bitcoin in this case, the $68k all time high will soon get another one ahead of it after halving which we are expecting another bullrun sooner in 2024, but not until then we should expect a high volatility in bitcoin which the investors should take note by now in other to help them with their kind of strategies to trade or invest with bitcoin for profitability.",

At a time when the price of BTC was much lower than today, many people tried to be part of the 21 BTC club, that is, to own that number of BTC for the obvious reasons that that number is somehow symbolic. Today, the goal for many is to have at least 1 BTC, and I think that is not something unattainable if we are ready to accept that it happens over a slightly longer period of time.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on December 07, 2022, 04:31:21 AMRight now, most people who want to get into crypto during this bottom-phase of the market but are still hesitant to buy bitcoin because they are going to see 0.0xxxxxxx on their screen and be dissatisfied most likely. Again, this is the behavior of an individual who is uninformed, or misinformed.Numbers are always important to people and their presentation greatly influences how people experience certain things. When we take the example of Bitcoin and some alternatives that used its name (forked coins) then we could see that there were a lot of examples where the investor decided to buy some round number of coins instead of 0.00xxxx BTC. I personally don't see a problem in that, because such decisions should always be left to the individual, no matter how wrong it seems to some of us.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on December 07, 2022, 04:31:21 AMAre end stage adopters going to be happy/proud/satisfied/well-off owning a few million satoshis? We don't know what such a distant future brings us, but if the price of 1 BTC is x50 higher than today, the majority will have to settle for having at least one million satoshis or even less. Even today, some feel good and proud that they have reached that goal -> Today I become a Satoshi millionaire",

Smartphones, however, were adopted quite fast, so Bitcoin is already well behind on the adoption rate. I am not sure how adopted Bitcoin will become, and especially how often it will be used. I don't think it's an issue that people will have small parts of Bitcoin if mass adoption hits. After all, you can just switch to thinking of it in Satoshis, and be happy. And, of course, given that the distribution of wealth is very unequal, some will have sizeable amounts of BTC even if the price is $1 million or more per coin.",
