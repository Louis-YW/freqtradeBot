So I guess that is already a good gauge for us to say where we at at the lowest point and then where we are right now.I'm not sure where you got that $25k, in the last 8 months, because if we look at it, around March, we already had a pre-halving ATH of around $69k. So just a piece of advise, before you post, just get the facts straight.And for the expectations? Even before the start of the bull run, people are already predicting that Bitcoin will be around $100k-$150k so I guess we are still on target.",

If they live with their past mistakes, it won't help them to get any extra money, but cost them a lot in life quality and mental heath as well.QuoteBTC getting to $99k feels so surreal.

A longer you hold it through more market cycles, the more profit you will get. Let me emphasize, you must hold through market cycles to get profit, because if you hold in like 1 or 2 years and unfortunately these years start in bullish to bearish, you will get loss, not profit.HODL camp, Bitcoin profitable days can give many new Bitcoin investors stronger hands to hold, not only in this cycle but I hope they will do it in more future cycles.https://hodl.camp/https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/bitcoin-profitable-days/",

It took time and will take a couple of days to reach the biggest price point in its history. Going low and again bouncing back with new ATH makes Bitcoin so interesting and attractive. We have seen lows this year but I doubt it went to $25K. The lowest it went this year was $42K which was on the 1st of January this year.",

There's no true wealth that can happen without patience.Well.. first of all, there were already expectations about reaching 100k in the previous cycle, some 3 years ago. So imho your title is incorrect for now (it has huge chances to be correct though, and rather soon).Then, those selling clearly had different expectation, as already mentioned by others.The price from 8 months ago is, again, not the best indicator, plus, after the price going parabolic the difference from past prices is .. yeah, huge.And I will end with the fact that while you are thinking to those selling at under 10k, you are forgetting those selling at under 1k or even 1$ (!). I also mean that you should always check the full scale.",

This advice is becoming very real to me. Don't wait till the price gets to your expected bottom before you buy because it might never fall to that point. The reason why someone is willing to buy Bitcoin even at $99k is because he believes that the price will exceed the current price. Bitcoin has the potential to get to any price, that's why we should not be in a rush to sell.",

You can outsmart many people by invest your money in bitcoin, hold it, and wait for late comers who surely will come because Bitcoin adoption has been increasing with a magical exponential rate ever.You can be late comers compare to many people who joined Bitcoin market through either investment or mining in previous years, but there are many people who are later than you. If you can not hold your bitcoin, your debut time in this market means nothing for your investment career and your personal prosperity. You joined earlier than them, but make sure you convert it to massive profit in future.",

Maybe we should overlook Ops misconception about the bitcoin price based on the mentioned which I believe he hadn't been updated about the historical surroundings of bitcoin value.Therefore I'll like to blow his mind up that someone out there in the past has bought 2 pizzas with an exchange of 10,000 bitcoins in the month of May 2010 which marked the first ever transaction. Then total worth the 10,000 was $41.I guess that should stumble him more likely to even appreciate those who held their bitcoin up to the value of $10,000 Worth per bitcoin. 😁😁😁 Which broke to the legendary event of remarking  Bitcoin Pizza Day.I only needed the Op to understand that everyone has a peak of time to sell their bitcoin happily as much as it's accountable that they've made profit out of it.So it does not really matter of who holds longer to the heel of the value of bitcoin.Even those whod hold to the next Ath maybe at $150,000 would criticized by others on how they sold too soon and if they've waited, they'd had made more profits.There's absolutely nothing like more profits when you've a time frame of your investment in-between a short and long term goal.All together the goal is to make profits.",
