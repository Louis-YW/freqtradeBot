      "body": "Quote from: cafter on April 02, 2023, 06:49:20 PM...first of all, you need to have a goal clear to move in that direction, make yourself the question: What do I want to develop? And when you have the answer then you will know where to start your coding journey.Let's say you want to develop a casino, then divide the project by blocks and work on each of them in an individual way, one block would be the games, another block could be the withdrawals and deposits, and another block would be the user's account. And once you have all the blocks put them together.Is important to have clear that Coiding is different than Blockchain, Sockets and DataBases. There is a lot to learn for a crypto project, and HTML5 is just the tip of the iceberg.",
