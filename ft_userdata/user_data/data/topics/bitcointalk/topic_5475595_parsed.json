It was published in 2021 but I thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss about. [video link unavailable. Unable to provide source or the video.] When a solar superstorm happens, the power grids will face the most impact. This could cause power outages for months. And it will happen worldwide. Every country, every state, everywhere. There's no escape. It will also heavily impact the submarine line that will make internet access unusable. So in case even if you have reserved electricity like in a power bank, that will be unable to help you to get access to the internet. Bitcoin ecosystem or blockchain whatever you want to call it, runs on the internet. Without the internet, everything will fall apart. It will be safe till the internet is back on but when it is offline, what would happen? There aren't any ways that we can tackle this situation. Now many of us put all our life earnings into Bitcoin despite hearing that \"invest only what you can afford to lose\". If any of you reading this post, what's your thought on this? What should our alternative plan be if this occurs? Also, can we speculate what the aftermath should be for Bitcoin?",

I do not think there will be any different reply. They are not both the same. I am talking about natural disasters that will prevent internet usage for a limited time. After that, it will be back. I want to know what people will do in that period of time. And what the future will look like for Bitcoin after this is over. I don't know how you see similarities in these topics. They are talking about losing access to the internet permanently while I am talking about a limited-time power outage. Do you understand now? Or should I explain a bit more?

I forgot the website where I have read it when I make search about solar superstorm as it is being broadcasted in radio news in mt country about what may happen if earth is hit by it. I agree with the post above that the answer would be the same as the other thread provided in the post above. Well, people won't be able to use it since you need internet for us to be able to send, receive and trade but the data won't be erased because it is stored in a computer all around the world which it is being downloaded or shared to all those who runs a node. it's obvious that no one can use Bitcoin until the internet is restored if it happens. I think for the price is it won't change since there's no change in its demand and supply since there's no miner and no Bitcoiners.",

But we don't need to worry about since I think experts have some ways to avoid that to happen since they have high tech equipment that can lessen up the damage cost by said incident. But even though with such case we still need to prepare to back up our wallets so that it can't get affected much. If no internet on the world for sure all online activity including bitcoin will stop that's why we should do something to prepare since this is the only thing we can do for such unfortunate thing to happen in the world.",

No particular superstorm that's bound to hit the planet, and if there would be we wouldn't be able to detect it right away to create a real action plan that would prevent further damage to our electronics and all that stuff. We're pretty much fucked if it does come. 2. The sun does this in a regular 12-year cycle, it goes a little dormant every 10-11 years, and afterwards enter an active phase where most \"solar superstorms\" happen. What's being broadcasted right now is the fact that the parker solar probe's already detecting some heightened readings on the sun's surface, meaning that the 12 year cycle is coming up. 3. There's conflicting information as to whether this would affect us short-term (meaning days-weeks) to long term (months to years) but if it does hit the planet, and it rarely does, with the most recent documented one being in the 1800s, (the 2012 one they're talking about is a near-miss) we're going to be fucked as every piece of tech would be fried useless.Quote from: tjtonmoy on November 27, 2023, 03:25:37 PMOk here's my conclusion after going through every reply that has been made so far.
