  "content": "I want to test some Bitcoin wallets for multi-sig  (2 out of 3) support with Air gapped hardware wallets. So I'm not looking for wallets which require a seed phrase!The first wallet I tested was Sparrow wallet. Works just great, no comments (well, except that it was not able to use the camera on my Raspberry Pi 5  Anyay, now I'm looking for other wallets like Sparrow, but I haven't find any so far. For example, I just tried Electrum (deskopt and mobile) but that one just requires a seed phrase.So my question is, what are good equivalents of Sparrow wallets? I would also love to have one for mobile, that would be great I think. Is there a wallet that has multi-sig on Taproot?",

For mobile, I think BlueWallet can be used for airgapped signing, but I wouldn't recommend using a mobile device for that use, as they're designed to connect to as many networks as possible (which is the opposite of airgapped).I don't think there's multi-sig taproot support in any of these wallet software yet.",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I use airgapped hardware wallets to sign, it doesn't really matter what app I use. When I sign (on the hardware wallet) that device will tell me how much bitcoin I'm about to send and to which address. So there is no way it can steel my bitcoins, right? I will check to the wallets you mention, thanks for the suggestions!",

Whatever transaction your wallet software is constructing on your Internet connected computer, you can verify that it's legitimate by viewing the contents on your airgapped device. (You must have exported the unsigned transaction in a safe way, such as via scanning a QR code.)I have only tried SeedSigner, and it does display which inputs I'm spending, which addresses I own, and to which address(es) I'm spending those inputs.",

You can use this tool from Bitcoin.org to choose wallets.https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-walletDepends on your need, you can move step by step, and tick on things you need to filter wallets. For example, with following links, you will have Bitcoin Core, Sparrow wallet and Specter wallet.https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet?step=5&platform=windows&user=experienced&important=control,privacy,fees&features=bech32,multisig,segwit[LIST] Wallets supporting Taproot",

      "body": "Without a seed phrase for multi-sig capability, you might want to check on Wasabi Wallet. It's really focused on privacy and pretty locked down for people who prefer, and it's specifically built over the Bitcoin protocol. Wasabi has gained real traction, especially after Taproot went live and is considered a valid alternative to Sparrow. If you want more mobile options, then Samourai Wallet might be something to consider,  it supports advanced features for privacy, though it is a bit more focused on Android. You will need to do some weighing on pros and cons of each depending on your needs.",
