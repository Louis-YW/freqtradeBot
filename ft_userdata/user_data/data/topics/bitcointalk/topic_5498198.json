      "body": "Some information circulating shows that those (Elsavador residents) who do not have a bank account are not advised to save for at least two reasons.First, holding cash is risky. Bitcoin wallets, however, protect savings via a password or PIN, naturally facilitating regular savings of small amounts over time.Second, savers are rewarded by receiving interest on their money. Without this incentive there is little return on savings. Maybe that is a consideration and I think other countries if their governments support transactions using Bitcoin, it is not impossible that this will happen",

What they shouldn't do is have a unrealistic expectation that doing so will improve be the economy of their country and the standard of living is the citizens and they shouldn't restrict citizens to a certain platform like El Salvador did. Sure, it will help the acceptance of Bitcoin if a top country makes it a legal tender and if it becomes popular among many countries, but that's about it.In many countries it is already possible for businesses to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment and these are the businesses that see the value in it. Making it a legal tender means eveey business will be compelled to use it but may not see the value in it and may not get many users paying through that option.",

This might be a very interesting discussion to see that so many people from small countries are interested in cryptocurrency, more specifically BitcoinAfter El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, another small African country, the Central African Republic (CAR), also followed the same step. The president of the country, President Faustin-Archange Touadera, assented to the law that made Bitcoin a legal tender after it was approved by the legislature. Surprisingly, the law was repealed after a few months. The government never gave any reason for this action but I suspect that the adoption policy was not well planned. No provision for basic infrastructure that would have made the policy executable. Also, the government was not sincere because it was suspected that the government wanted to use the policy to help a country invade sanctions. But when they discovered that it would not go smoothly, they had to repeal the law. There was also a report that the government was pressured by some international lending organizations like the World Bank and IMF to repeal the law.",

Bitcoin adoption is a thing of choice and any country that is willing to embrace on adopting it can make decision for that at any time without waiting on others, this was what we had with El-Salvador when its make the decision of adopting bitcoin as a legal tender, after some time, we have Central African Republic following after, Which i believe is a developing country, what i can only advise from this is that before any country could make its conclusion on bitcoin adoption, they must have to make adequate plans ahead to enhance the suitability of the use of bitcoin among the citizens just as the Nayib Bukele Administration started with.",

That is, as long as the country's president has a concept and strategy that is ready to implement it in the country he leads, then it can be done. By the word ready, I mean that the President is aware of the pros and cons that will occur during the implementation.Bukele, the President, is ready with all the pros and cons, but in implementing it with his attitude and commitments, El Salvador has become a country that is widely discussed positively.",

      "body": "It is very possible, but Bitcoin adoption is not that easy to do because El Salvador itself is also struggling to do Bitcoin adoption because of the many pros and cons that occur in society. But look at how El Salvador is now, they are successful with bitcoin and by regularly buying bitcoin, El Salvador makes a multiplied profit.As well as, they have bitcoin mining machines that use geothermal energy from volcanic activity. And for other small countries it's going to be a challenge whether they can do it or not.Because there are several challenges to do adoption such as high mortality, regulation, infrastructure for the implementation of bitcoin adoption and how the public or society responds about bitcoin adoption.  All of that will be a challenge that needs to be passed and needs to do research so that there is no failure in its application. Actually, in today's modern era, Adoption can be done quite easily if the governments of small countries or other large countries are ready.Crypto education is already quite extensive and of course already know what the benefits are for countries that adopt it.",

      "body": "Making bitcoin a legal tender would not change anything, especially in a small country from a third world country. This is because it will not add any value to the economy and the government will not have the financial power to make it easily used by the poor. Which means that it is only the rich people that will be using it. The reason why I said so is that, android phones and laptops with the internet are needed, and the youths will be the ones that might want to start using bitcoin, but the other people will prefer to use their local fiat that is easy to them for buying and selling without waiting for confirmation of transactions. If the blockchain is congested that alone can make the government and the citizens abandon bitcoin as a legal tender. It not compulsory for bitcoin to be a legal tender before it can be used in countries that did not restrict the use of cryptocurrency, so why must it be a legal tender.",

This might be a very interesting discussion to see that so many people from small countries are interested in cryptocurrency, more specifically BitcoinI have not seen any country apart from El Salvador that accepts Bitcoin as a legal tender, and I believe that other countries are trying to be more reasonable about it. Fine, any country may conclude to invest in an asset, it is a different ballgame, but agreeing that it becomes a legal tender goes way more. There are factors that will be considered, especially the informal nature of Bitcoin, its decentralization and the privacy tendency that could aid anonymity in a way.This calls for strict and serious regulation even if they accept it to be their legal tender, but how many countries have the capacity to regulate a decentralised asset like Bitcoin? This is why I believe countries are avoiding it as the risk could have outweighed the benefits in terms of security, lack of control, money laundry tendency that could aid enough illegality, and the risk of its high volatility that could make it unreliable at times.",
