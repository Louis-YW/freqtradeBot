Sportsbet and Duelbits are the only sportsbook I’m using because they always have a promotion that boost odds and free spin when you bet on their promotion matches.I guess this inquiry is for coinslotty sportsbook, I hope that you will add odds booster on some matches especially those current hot event.",

So far I've tried LadBrokers, Betsafe and Betway, but I didn't test out any crypto-exclusive ones. Are you planning to expand the offer on Coinslotty casino? This could potentially be a great way to attract new users. Esports betting has gained immense popularity in recent years, and as a result, most bookmakers now offer the option of betting on various esports games. This includes popular games such as CS:GO, Dota 2, League of Legends, and many others. These bookmakers provide a comprehensive selection of tournaments and betting markets for each game, allowing bettors to choose from a wide range of options. I recommend checking out the offerings of some of the most popular bookmakers available here. It's probable that a most of them offer esports betting options.",

The reputation and level of trust from gamblers is also quite good so far.So I think the two betting platforms can be a reference for anyone who is looking for a place to bet on Esports matches.",

If you ask about esports betting, which is here and is crypto-based, of course Rollbit is one of the gambling sites that I often use to enjoy betting Esports, as far as I know Rollbit has a lot of markets in eSports matches such as Dota 2, Legends, Arena of Valor, Counter-strike and many others.Apart from the eSports market, Rollbit will also provide additional prizes for its users according to ranking and also during streaming there are many free bets available on Rollbit every month prizes and also NFT eSports can take from your favorite bets.For that, if you want to use Rollbit as an eSports bet, don't forget to read SPORTS POLICY, them before plunging any further.@SirJohnVonSlotty, I have a question for you, why don't you add the eSports betting option/feature on your gambling site (coinslotty), so we want to bet there with a new sensation on your crypto gambling site.",

I mean with various types of esports markets, it essential, that you choose legit and trustworthy bookie also. I mean there are various types of gambling sites there, but at the end of the day that matters is trust. So I would suggest only the trusted sites which are there in this industry for the past few years and have solid reputation. These don’t have vast varieties of markets in esports, but still have good and popular ones. Try stake.com , sportsbet.io and Betcoin.Ag . These are good and reputable sites.",

There’s a lot of million dollar withdrawal on this platform without any problem so it’s really safe to assume that they have the best sportsbook based on their previous feedback from high profile player. As for E-sports, Sportsbet is what I’m using the most because of their odds booster and quick balance credit once the bet is settled.",
