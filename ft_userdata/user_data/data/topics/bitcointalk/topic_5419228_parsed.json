If the domain is bought from namecheap or godaddy then anyone can report the abuse of the domain to them and they will take it down. Some instructions will be found https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9196/5/how-and-where-can-i-file-abuse-complaints/Looking up at domain details this is what I found: tucows.com and my guess is the tucows are their domain register service.",

It must be highly frustrating that even when someone take steps to inform domain registrars about scams they literally take little or no action.If Namecheap and others simply allows renewals then maybe there is more to it than simply being about them making money. They all should have a report function where domains that being used for scam purposes are looked in to by their fraud department within hours of being reported, surely they have amassed enough money to be able facilitate such a small service.Quote from: stompix on November 04, 2022, 08:44:10 AMIf you're extremely lucky!

If someone can take the time out (even a few minutes) to make the report then at the very least a reply should be given. Many people have fallen victim to all sorts of scams therefore if domain registrars take fraud seriously they would take action when domains registered via their websites are being used for scams or for nefarious purposes.No matter how large any business will be, they will never admit to allowing their websites to be used for scams therefore yes the silence is deafening and frustrating for those hoping to close down scam websites.Quote from: stompix on November 04, 2022, 10:27:04 AMJust to make sure that I don't get misunderstood because of the previous post.
