  "content": "The ColdCard wallet can create a backup file of its configuration https://coldcard.com/docs/backups . Other than for cloning, why would you do this?  It would generate yet another passphrase to remember (and back up) and another sensitive file to keep up with.  I thought the whole point was that if you can simply remember/retrieve your 12-24 word seed phrase, you could recover your funds with any other wallet.  Am I missing something?I ask because I recently read somewhere (can't find the link now) that with some hardware wallets, even if you know the BIP39 seed you still can lose funds if you need to recover and don't have a backup file from the wallet.  I'm kinda confused!I'm all about properly archiving & securing my ColdCard's seed phrase, but I don't want to screw up by not making the backup file if it's really needed.  Again, for something other than cloning.",

Probably not, but others might take a look at it and think that it works perfectly for them.Better to have the option and not use it, then have fewer options.-Dave",

Which is why it's so important to have a copy of them and make sure that copy is 100% secure from other people having access to them. If anyone gets them, they have your BTC.-Dave",

Other than for cloning, why would you do this? Well, based on the source link you shared, there are differences between recovering your wallet with a seed and recovering through this backup option. The backup file saves and recovers all the settings you made in the ColdCard software. A recovery from seed doesn't. I have never used a ColdCard, but I assume they have a way to either label addresses/UTXOs or create separate wallets with custom names. The backup file should be able to recover all these names that you used properly. A recovery from seed doesn't know the software changes you made.",

      "body": "ColdCard backup file is just a standard 7z archive file with AES-256 encryption by a strong password.you can decrypt that file using any 7z archive tool and have full access of your funds.Personally, I recommend you to ignore this option because it means that you will need to keep that data digitally, and to decrypt it you need a strong password, which needs to be either stored digitally (risk) or written on paper (the easiest is to use 12 words seeds), so it is an alternative option if you want ( like Core backup file)",
