But there are some opportunities that we can do right now as early as can be and I think some of these influencers that we see on social media, telling what we must do in order to own a business or some hustles are doing a great job and that is because they're disrupting the idea of working until we get old and retirement.That's the norm that we get from the boomers and with this new generation, I think that we're starting to know more better of ourselves and it shouldn't just be work alone. Our lives are too short to enjoy and that's why we have to choose what's going to make us happy. We hustle and work for some as long as they're able to provide for ourselves and then enjoy every weekend, travel somewhere and enjoy the nature that we're having.Like a lot of careers now can be self employed and thanks to technology for producing those and everyone has got a better job while enjoying anything that we do with our passions.",

There's so many good examples in the bitcoin space, but also in altcoins, like the whole ETH dev team who became filthy rich by launching a centralized altcoin that was supposed to flip bitcoin. Another way is to inherit wealth. I know people who own a rental property and they got a nice deal from a bank. Now they don't have to do anything. They get a couple thousand dollars every month for nothing and have a lease signed up for the next 3 years. Last but not least, lower your expectations. People who think they deserve to drive a million dollar car and have servants will have a hard time in life, unless their wealth is 100 times larger than what they spend every year. I'd be fine living in a small house in the country, but there are people who expect even less. They live in camper cars, shit in a bucket and are happy because they're free. That's real life, not working overtime in a corporation so you can afford fuel for your v12 engine.",

I don't believe that a drug is needed for the ones who want to work because we can work without drugs, all we need is food and that works way better then drugs.

I think drugs is everywhere even in the food and in the milks!! Everybody have drugs in their bloods.",

I think drugs is everywhere even in the food and in the milks!! Everybody have drugs in their bloods.Again. It highly depends on your definition of what Drugs are and whether they are all negative or they can also be positive for our health. As a matter of fact our bodies have the capabilities to sintetize they own \"drugs\" out of the things we eat and drink naturally. I am taking about testosterone, estrogen, enzymes, acids, bases, etc. Though , I believe you must be taking bout sintetic substances created by human beings. By the way, I read a very concerning story on the news, about how flight operators are literally taking drugs to stay awake and smoking weed in their working shifts. For some reason there seems to be a shortage of airport operators in the United States...",
