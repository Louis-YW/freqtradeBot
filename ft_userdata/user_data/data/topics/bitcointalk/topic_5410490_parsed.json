  "content": "The title says it all. As far as I know there is one genuine Ledger Hardware wallet \"reseller\" in India.But still, the wise ones recommend to directly buy the hardware wallet from official websites only.Now comes the question what would be the best way to buy a hardware wallet in India.Also, which one should it be? Ledger or Trezor ?The second question is if we buy directly from the official website would there be a risk in delivery ?May be the customs can keep it under their radar or tamper it or raise legal issues against us?",

Seems like etherbit is a good option if we want to buy from India based seller.I like the fact that it is delivering the product in less than a week. So the chances of tampering are way to less when compare to delivery from official website.Although it has a good reputation and reviews do you think it is a good idea to buy from resellers and not from official website ?Quote from: edgycorner on August 19, 2022, 10:05:36 PMQuote from: pawanjain on August 19, 2022, 01:54:39 PMThe second question is if we buy directly from the official website would there be a risk in delivery ?May be the customs can keep it under their radar or tamper it or raise legal issues against us?No, they won't tamper with your device.  Just make sure to reset the device and use your \"own\" keys.But be ready to pay 100% of the cost of product as custom duty(there's custom on shipping charges too in this stupid country  ) And you will have to pay else forget your device.Buy straight from the original website, if they can ship to IndiaIs it really 100% of the cost of product ? I read on paisabazaar that it's just 10% of the cost of product.But at the same time it takes around a month or more to receive the product. Now that's a turn off.QuoteThe assessable value of an imported item is Rs.1000/-Basic Customs Duty = 10%Integrated Tax Rate = 18%The taxes will be calculated as follows:Assessable Value = Rs.1000/-Basic Customs Duty = Rs.100/-The value to impose integrated tax = Rs.1000 + Rs.100 = Rs.1100/-Integrated tax = 18% of Rs.1100 = Rs.198/-Sum of Taxes = Rs.100 + Rs.198 = Rs.298/-source: https://www.paisabazaar.com/tax/custom-duty/",

I already have 3 gadgets from there shops.I would personally suggest that don't bother about resellers and likes of amazon etc. You never know what could happen.",

There will be no tempering. Hardware wallets are not that easy to be tempered with(when it comes to the internal hardware).  Albeit, if you purchase from a source which isn't official then they may include a compromised key. Many have fallen to this scam.If you buy Ledger, then you can even authenticate it with their toolshttps://www.ledger.com/how-to-protect-hardware-wallets-against-tamperingAs for custom duty, yes it can be 100%10% constitutes basic custom duty alone. You will be paying an addition 18% on (Cost +basic custom duty on that cost)And the the cost includes shipping price too  It will almost end up 80~100%Anyhow, you will be storing substantial amount of cryptos so it will be a onetime cost. Don't let the custom duty be a factor here. Just a heads up. As I have wasted my time in the past on trying to remove/reduce the duty by talking to India post(even went to the Post office and wasted more money on cab fare lol), UPS, custom office, etc but I always ended up paying the initial amount lol, you don't have to waste your time and it won't come as a shock when they come askingPrefer official website.",
