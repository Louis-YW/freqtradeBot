I am holding BUSD for dips on BTC but I still have alot, waiting for 12,000$ per BTC before buying but the scary news about USD losing its cool scares me. USD is losing value as we speak. It's called inflation and this year it's big.It doesn't mean 1000 USDT will become 900 USDT. It means that if you go to a grocery store with 20$ you'll buy less stuff than one year ago.I will add that right now USD being strong it simply means the other fiat currencies are even worse. Plus, never trust in news from China (I don't say they're fake news, but the event you're scared of may or may not actually happen, there's no certainty at all).Then, Yen is the Japanese currency, China has Yuan. But I would not go for various \"exotic\" stable coins, since, depending on who is issuing them, the may not be as stable as their advertise (never forget what has happened with LUNA). There are gold-backed stable coins, you can look into altcoin announcements, some are pretty old and reliable (but some may be charging you for depositing the actual gold on your behalf!!), still, it's a risk there and you have to be willing to accept that risk (trust the issuer + trust that the underlying asset - in this case gold - will not go down).I will add that $12k per bitcoin may or may not happen, hence DCA may be a better strategy than waiting and risking to miss the train.",

It still shares same disadvantages with other CBDC's and cannot really be encouraged.Quote- CBDCs have prominent geographic restrictions as they are accepted only in the country that issues them.- Central banks could turn into direct competitors of payment service providers, thereby forcing banks to lose income.-Central bank digital currency cons also point out the increased competition for commercial banks. The nature of CBDCs as a substitute for bank deposits can motivate banks to increase their deposit rates.https://101blockchains.com/central-bank-digital-currency-pros-and-cons/",

Now the concern here is high inflation.USD and any other currency is bound to loose it's purchasing power. The same will happen for stable coins as well if they are backed by USD or any other currency. However, it works in a different way. 1 BUSD will remain as 1 USD but what you used to purchase with 1 USD, will now be sold at higher than 1 USD. That's how it works! Apparent value will remain same while the pur having power will decrease.Also don't wait for bitcoin to come down to 12k as it may never happen. Start from today and buy in small quantities to average out the buying price.",

Stable coins value depends on the value of the currency itself. Just as the crypto market, the value of USD is too volatile these days but mostly, it's going up due to the moves that the Federal Reserve made. We don't know how long it will stay at the current top of its value but, just as we know, everything that goes up will go down soon.",
