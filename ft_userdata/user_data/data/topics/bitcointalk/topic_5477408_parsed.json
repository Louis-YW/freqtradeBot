  "content": "On this topic you'll find detailed information about their ongoing projects, completed achievements, and future plans. I wanted to share this with you guys, to read your thoughts about this project that I came across. If you want to participate in their testnet and run a node, you can find the quick start guide here: https://github.com/KenshiTech/unchained/blob/master/quickstart.mdGeneral✅ Token: ERC20 token released natively on Arbitrum One.✅ Website: Website, and the Kenshi Dashboard are live.✅ Forum: Kenshi forum, an open crypto hub, is publicly available.✅ Community: Active communities on Telegram, Discord, Twitter.✅ Community Engagement: Kenshi Engagement Protocol is functional. Zealy.io is used for community-centric collaborations.✅ Staking: Kenshi staking program is publicly available to all KNS users.✅ DEX: Kenshi token is listed on UniSwap.☑️ CEX: Kenshi token is not listed on a CEX. The target for a CEX listing is at +$25M market cap. (currently at 4M+-)Products & Services✅ Deep Index: Kenshi Deep Index, a serverless framework for indexing blockchain events is released on 8 EVM chains.✅ R-API: Kenshi R-API, a push notification service for receiving and processing blockchain events is live and on 8 EVM chains.✅ IoT SDK: Kenshi IoT SDK, a suite of libraries to enable processing of blockchain events on embedded devices is released for Arduino, ESP32, and Zephyr. The IoT SDK is available on +200 development boards for quick prototyping.✅ Oracle Network: Kenshi Oracle Network, a serverless, asynchronous, fault-tolerant network for creating custom oracles is live on 8 EVM blockchains.⏳ IoT Boards / HSM: Kenshi is building embedded devices that are able to securely connect to the blockchain, manage crypto-assets, manage secrets, make secure API requests, and more.⏳ Unchained: Kenshi Unchained is a peer-to-peer decentralized network for validating data. Unchained is the future of Kenshi, aiming to decentralize all of the Kenshi products mentioned above.Ongoing ProjectsDetailed roadmaps of their ongoing projects can be found in this section.UnchainedUnchained is a peer-to-peer, decentralized network for data validation.Progress:✅ P2P Network: The Unchained testnet is available. The Unchained client is able to auto-recover and connect to peers.✅ Data Validation: The underlying decentralized protocol for validating pieces of data is in place. BLS signature aggregation is used by peers to sign data.✅ Persistence: The validated data is persisted in MongoDB clusters.⏳ Smart Contracts: Unchained uses a Liquid Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. They are working on smart contracts to allow users to stake their KNS tokens for the Unchained network.⏳ RPC: An interface for consumers to be able to query validated data on the Unchained network is in progress.☑️ Plugins: Plugins for the different Unchained use cases still need to be developed.☑️ Documentation: Unchained isn't fully documented yet.☑️ Explorer: An explorer and status page for Unchained are needed.HSMHSMs can be used to manage custody of crypto assets by banks or exchanges. They can be used as programmable wallets by DeFi projects or to make secure API requests. The Kenshi HSM can be used as a more secure alternative to existing secret managers, such as HashiCorp Vault. These devices can also be used for decentralized oracles, data collection networks, supply chain management, and plenty of other use cases.Progress:✅ Prototype: They have made a prototype HSM, including the hardware, and several firmwares.⏳ Open Hardware: They are investigating a Bring-Your-Own-Hardware option where users can benefit from the Kenshi HSM capabilities on hardware that is easily sourceable on the market.⏳ Partnerships: They are in contact with Swiss semiconductor and secure hardware manufacturers.☑️ Firmwares: Firmwares for different use cases, and a GUI app for managing the software on the HSM devices are required before HSM release.☑️ Certification: The custom-made electronics need to be certified.",

      "body": "Kenshi is really an underrated project. It definitely doesn't get enough attention for what it does. Unchained is sure to be a game changer for a lot of people already using decentralized services who want something faster, more scalable and cheaper. I hear they're making tailored versions for early clients that will be ready soon. I already have a node set up for when mainnet drops.",
