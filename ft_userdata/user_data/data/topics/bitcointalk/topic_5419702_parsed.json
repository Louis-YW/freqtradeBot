  "content": "Hello everyone, it often happens that hiveos gives me the error: \"Auto-tune found a low hashrate chip, fixing\"in the last 2 days it has happened to me 3 times. I have no overclocking overclocking and the temperatures are also quite low.is it a common problem of the S9 or are they the first signs of failure of some board?",

      "body": "If it's auto-tuning, then your miner is pushing the miner to consume more power to produce more hash rate. So it means it's overclocking, but the problem is if you are still using the stock s9 PSU, it can't provide enough power, which can lead to some issues like your issue.So better manually set the power depending on what PSU you are using.",

Look at the error carefully; the hiveos is fixing it automatically for you don't need to do anything, but if you don't want to see the error, then manually set the frequency under chips config.",

The reason is that not all chips can take a higher hash raste. So if you donâ€™t want this error you need to lower you limit. Maybe try 1100 watts.",
