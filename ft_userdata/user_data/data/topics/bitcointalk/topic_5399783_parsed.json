Miners will liquidate their rigs en masse, leading to dirt cheap GPU prices, like $500 for the RTX 3080 10G or $200 for the RTX 3060.Revenue will recover after a few months to maybe $0.80/day, which is enough to make a small profit and pay off the RTX 3080 in 3-4 years. The get-rich-quick miners will leave, while the long term speculative HODL miners will stay. If another GPU coin like FIRO/ERG/FLUX becomes as big in market cap as ETH, these miners will make a killing.",

With a faster randomx implementation soon to be released, gpu miners can move to secure the Monero network instead. GPU mining will never die, but the question is if/when we'll ever reach the profit levels of ETH. It's a high-risk bet, which is why there would be a very high reward, comparable to when I mined my first Ethers in mid-2016 and could've been a millionaire if I built another rig or two and held the Ethers. Imagine mining FLUX at current diff levels, then FLUX goes to $300. You effectively made $300/day per card, not just $0.75.Quote from: philipma1957 on May 24, 2022, 10:05:17 PMIf eth actually does the august pos move this will be the most amazing crash everI would love a chance to buy cheap video cards. We haven't had that opportunity for 2 years. Crash or not, I will try to make a profit either way. This is why I don't dread August or PoS or Vitalik at all.",

I remember how each gtx1060 mined close to 7 eth over the whole year back then.Really stupid of me to be selling monthly rather than saving all that eth. Took me a whole year before I finally stopped selling and started saving at the start of 2018. But by then each gtx1060 was only making something like 0.6 eth over the entire year.",

I remember how each gtx1060 mined close to 7 eth over the whole year back then.I learned my lesson after that. I always save 50% of my mined coins and mine a variety of coins now. My hope is to mine at low diff for a year or two with ~100 cards at home and cheap 9-10¬¢ power, before the next bull market.Quote from: arielbit on May 25, 2022, 03:46:49 AMit is easier to purchase and setting up cards than getting/choosing the right place for expansion.It is extremely difficult to set up a commercial mining site. Even renting a 3000SF warehouse for $1500/month is complicated. Getting insurance as well as upgrading the electric service are the hardest tasks. Most small warehouses in the U.S. only have 100 kW of capacity, which is enough for 500 video cards. Upgrading it to 1MW or so can take months. Good luck finding a place with decent capacity without having a ridiculous rent bill. Honestly it makes more sense to just buy a piece of land, set up sheds/containers, make sure the utility can service the land, then buy the equipment. The only benefit is the power cost will be 6-7¬¢ which is cheap for GPU mining.I thought buying the video cards was the hardest part, until I saw how tough the world of commercial real estate is... Even during the height of the 2018 gold rush, I was able to procure hundreds of video cards easily as long as I offered the right price.",
