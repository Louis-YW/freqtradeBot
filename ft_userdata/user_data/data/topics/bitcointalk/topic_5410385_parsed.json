      "body": "I will prefer to take polkastarter rather than seedify. If we are talking about token but yeah seedify has good chance to be multiplied even more compared with polkastarter but in term of adoption and usefulness of tokens, polkastarter is far better compared with seedify. The hype already gone but i think that would be a very wise decision if you are picking both since they were competing in the same field with same demand as well.",
