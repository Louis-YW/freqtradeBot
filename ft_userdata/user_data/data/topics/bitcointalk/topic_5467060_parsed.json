Players like Shakib al hasan in Bangladesh team and Rashid Khan in Afghanistan team, they play so good yet rest of their team players being not upto their standard they lose against other teams. I feel sad about them sometimes lol, do you feel so?",

      "body": "I do not think this topic would be an issue as we will be discussing individual player's performance in this thread. Already there are three mega threads on cricket that are dedicated to the different formats of cricket. I think it would have been good if this thread would have been self-moderated in order to stop spam.Coming back to the discussion. I feel bad for Shakib Al Hassan, he is still the number one all-rounder in all formats of cricket, yet his team has never been able to perform well in big tournaments. Either they are struggling with bowling or they are struggling with batting. A team cannot be dependent on the performance of a single player. in his case most of the time if he performs well then his team wins the match.",

They are both world-class and undoubtedly exceptional players, and it can be frustrating to see them in teams that may not perform as well as they do individually. Individual brilliance doesn't always guarantee team success. But their contributions are still vital for their respective teams, and their presence can inspire others to improve. It's a part of the beauty and challenge of team sports.",
