I think if you can have a good track record about it, then I believe you will easily rank up in the end. You can even ignore the rank and the amount of merit you get due to the quality of the post because actually users who are quite familiar with bitcoin and share their opinion about it will be more privileged than other users.You can find a lot of information about bitcoin in this forum, discuss it with experts, but if you want to learn the basics, then I would recommend you to read a lot on this site.1. https://bitcoin.org/en/",

He created this post on Meta already tell us what his purpose, there's few thread a newbie asking for simple question that's has been answered many times, but he get merit from a merit source.As you can see on his another post, he's asking for 1 merit which mean he already know how to rank up, but he act like he doesn't know anything.I advice to other users to not simply giving merit to him, he seems to be an user who want to attach image but doesn't want to pay copper membership.Quote from: Shaha98 on September 21, 2022, 04:42:04 AMMy Countdown to Junior Member RankNumber of Merit(s) left: 1I want to become a junior member and I don't want to be a new brother anymore.
