With the world’s most famous leveraged  Bitcoin holder having a cost basis of $30,700 and a liquidation level of $21K, I think we may see this dip go just a bit further. Michael Saylor has been a little bit irresponsible with his leveraged buying and I have a feeling that the Bitcoin market may just teach him a lesson before this drop is finished. That would seemingly be the most fair ending to this cycle. With mtgox coins on the way, I wouldn’t discount Bitcoin showing the billionaires it has it’s limits to what manipulation it will allow.",

I mean FED said that they will increase the rates, which caused many rich people and companies to withdraw their money from the markets and buisness' and then put it on interest because it was giving such a good rate for guaranteed amount as well.This is why there isn't enough money in the markets all around the world, not just crypto though, it is literally all around the world and dollar is more valuable in many places. We had the past 3-4 years (and technically last 14 years) that see USA printing so much money and dishing it out, it's just getting a callback these days that's all.",

The possibilities on medium term aren't good for bitcoin. I think the market will only have grasp to recover and enter a solid positive season when the US ponzi scheme based on inflated interest rates starts melting, what inevitably will happen at some point, like it has already happened in every countries which adopted such economical measures.",

So far its there are just more buying preventing that dive. Zooming out to the monthly chart, BTC is actually in the bubble stage. It hasn't pop but maybe because the limited supply of it defeats this bubble to pop.

A fear-driven sales process could result in extreme selling. Bitcoin isn't something anyone wants to use as a currency, they want to make money out of it. I am long term bearish because bear money is the best. However, what about going for quality? If it doesn't pump, it will eventually become the standard. At these lows, i'm expecting some kind of consolidation and range should occur, and hopefully the year will end in an uptrend.",
