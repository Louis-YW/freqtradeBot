So, why do you chose that username?Funny you ... ðŸ˜ŒEven without the fact that different display names are used to maintain pseudonymity, just as you described, could everyone possibly use the same name?? So you won't get marveled any longer?? Shessss!Some peeps get confused when choosing a display name and sometimes, gets cut up by whatever bugs 'em at that point; there by, making outta 'em, a name.Well, there are very many reasons or, sometimes -- no reasons attached to the selection of a display name; in my case, my real name has 3 letters that are included in the first name, SANDRA. Hakeem came after some sort of random selection. It's unique and serves as a prolific mask to the hush- phenomenal user behind the account.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

Positive values applied in the forum and providing knowledge to other users will make you better known even though the forum name only uses the same three characters \"AAA or BBB\".",

But while privacy is closely associated with Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto's identity is successfully kept hidden until now, a number of early Bitcoin adopters, developers even, and strong Bitcoin evangelists didn't really conceal their identities here. Hal Finney got Hal and even had his own picture used as avatar. Gavin Andresen had Gavin Andresen and his face as avatar as well. Andreas Antonopoulos had aantonop and did the same with his avatar. The same goes with Dr. Adam back with his adam3us and his picture. There were probably more of them. And then there was gmaxwell and achow101 and laszlo and more. And even admins Sirius and theymos are not really unknown outside of this forum.Anyway, as for my username, it has something to do with the anime Darker than Black. It should've been just Darker but since it was already taken, I thought of a number combination. I ended up with 45. This, too, has an explanation, quite a long one, so...",

So, why do you chose that username?OP, my little advice is to try using the search. You come to the forum in May, and you suddenly become too active and create topics that are chewed up every three months. Now, in order not to create another mega-thread, you can read this topic. Maybe it will satisfy your curiosity.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414499.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5397275.msg60041950#msg60041950",

So, why do you chose that username?If i may ask you as well that why did you choose that your username? choosing a username is a choice to make and no one can hold you a question to that as long as you don't plagiarize other people's username to impersonate them, you're free to be identified by any means you choose to be called on the forum as your username, but this does not necessarily means that your username is your real identity and if it is doesn't mean you're not private that's a choice made by you, during your registration is when the first privacy about you had been kept and maintain by nit verifying your email address used, username does not makes you private or not.",

Sham has a very good meaning \"Candle\", it is very appropriate to attach the name Sham to your school friend's girl.Sham symbolizes charm and charisma, he is someone who has charm and wants to be the center of attention, the name Sham has a personality Expansive, visionary, adventurous, uses freedom in a constructive way. Your decision to make a username like your idol's nickname is very right, because your forum name has a very good meaning.",

Then when I saw how big is the gambling section in this forum I was even more surprised, although I think most of them play casino games and believe they can win long term with garbage strategies rather than playing games where the expected value of the bets can be positive (or have an RTP greater than 100% if preferred).",
