      "body": "While Russia's war against Ukraine is affecting prices on some products and economic situation in some countries, it can't be used to account for all economic issues. COVID was a big hit on the economy, so it's not surprising that it's finally feeling that hit now. Moreover, Putin doesn't seem eager to stop the war any time soon, and even once it does happen (which will only be when he finally loses), I don't think all sanctions will be lifted immediately. There's still a lot of destruction, deaths, torture, pain and suffering that this war brought. So just stopping the war isn't magically fixing any of that, which is why the sanctions should not be lifted until a major change occurs in Russia and significant reparations are being paid.",
