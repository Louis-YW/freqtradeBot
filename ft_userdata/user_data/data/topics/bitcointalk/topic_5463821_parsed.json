Everyone is trying to get there hands on BTC. Why? Because they all know BTC is going toward next ATH. And in that journey we will see how it will help those countries who have adopted it as legal tender i.e. El-Salvador. How there economy will boost once the BTC make another ATH. The thing is, most of the countries still do not want to make money out of BTC or any other crypto related technology. And my country is one of them but I hope one day there will come some educated people who might know how to get benefit from the golden opportunities with time.",

Better role...\" it is very generic, that is, it is better than 10 years ago, of course, it is obvious, so it is very generic.In any case, being more involved in the discussion to legislate or generate comments from the rulers does not necessarily mean more influence on economic regulations for traditional conventional situations, which is the change that is required.Therefore, I do not believe that there is a great advance in this sense, being anonymous in my transactions is frowned upon, using a means of payment such as bitcoin is not openly allowed, among others.Although the issue is in the fore, basically it is sought to have control over a technology that empowers the people, but that does not mean that it has a direct influence on the traditional economic processes of each country, it is still a long way from achieving it.Be careful, I am not with my thoughts wanting to be in that linear idea, but it is reality.I want to go to the bank and ask for a loan, for example, and support it with my Satoshi, that is not possible today.  At least in my country I have to sell them and support them in Fiat currency to have reliable support for traditional credit, yes, perhaps this is another topic, but the question is, what economic regulations are we talking about in your topic, ah!  Yes, those who want to control bitcoin.",

      "body": "I agree that Bitcoin's already a major economical force. But it varies widely, region by region, and country by country.In North America and some European countries like Spain it seems Bitcoin is already popular as a speculative investment. But it has no major incidence in these countries' economies. If crypto went away, the macroeconomy wouldn't be affected much, it would be like some people had invested in the wrong stocks.But in countries with weak currencies it's different and it really \"regulates\" the economy somewhat. In Argentina for example it's really playing a major role. It regulates the economy in two ways: First, it provides an additional means to save money, which even in crypto bear markets is still better than the national currency. This means that banks have to adjust interest rates of their \"saving\" products to match crypto's performance. While foreign currencies fulfill a similar role too, their market is restricted, so crypto has a relatively high market share (in this case it's not only Bitcoin but also ETH and stablecoins).The second way it \"regulates\" is providing a connection to foreign markets and currencies. It's not unpopular in Argentina to buy Bitcoin to travel abroad for example, even if then many sell them on the USD market to hedge against the BTC volatility risk. This \"loophole\" in my opinion has more positive than negative consequences for these weak currencies. It reduces the shortage of \"real\" foreign currencies that are available in these countries (both on bank accounts and as cash), and thus can give the central banks a bit of air to breathe when they try to stabilize their currency, as it reduces the demand for their dollars/foreign currencies in general.",

That’s because, they see in so many ways how they wouldn’t be generating the needed income from taxes not being able to properly regulate cryptocurrency nor taxe it. This makes it a daring thing to do because, once they accept it and open the eyes of the public to what could be, there wouldn’t be any going back from there.Regulation as well isn’t something that the crypto space is about as, it’s some of its many qualities that makes the space more adorned and taking that away from it would mean, taking a part of its qualities. Little wonder why people run from doing KYC. They want a space with no ties and that’s what regulation speaks of, ties and more.",

Most democratic politicians on the federal level believe in stringent regulations and higher taxes on cryptocurrency. Joe Biden explicitly laid out framework for crypto regulation under the guise of consumer protection: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/It's essentially a bunch of jumbled up jargon, hitting on all the buzzwords related to fraud prevention and consumer protection. When translated, it means higher regulation and bureaucratic red tape related to crypto. Republicans aren't particularly pro-crypto either, but relatively speaking, they are compared to democrats.Then there exists some portion of politicians that couldn't even define cryptocurrency.",

Bitcoin creation is the innovation that the youth are the most beneficiaries of and so with the lack of employment and underemployment, the youth have found bitcoin as the option for investment and financial freedom potential. That will help in increasing youth development in blockchain education, cryptocurrency project financing, management and investment etc , this will inturn lead to healthy financial economy because there are going to increase investment opportunities in youths and growth in the GDP of the country.",
