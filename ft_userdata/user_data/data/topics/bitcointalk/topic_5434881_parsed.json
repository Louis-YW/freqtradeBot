There is no AI top established project yet but in 2024 i can see easily $60B+ market capital for the AI-related projects as VEchain is on my watchlist and there are many other good projects on board as Xal0lex already shared a list for such projects details.",

Most of retailers thinks that this will be the new hype but without having the hype, I think many will get used to it cause if we think about this, its the interesting use case among the blockchain related projects.",

Certainly, the possible hype for projects in the AI industry would help a lot. Let's do some math, I'll analyze the AI Matrix project they're following. Currently, the price is around $0.025, so it takes a 40x increase to reach $1. It's really quite a number. But let's look at the market cap. Currently, it is $5 million, so with the assumed growth of 40x, we will get a value of $200 million. This would currently place around 150 on the CMC list, so it doesn't look like an unattainable thing for a solid project. And let's remember that during the bull run, even complete shitcoins, under the influence of a slight hype, they achieved a market capitalization much higher than the aforementioned $200 million. All in all, I believe that if the project develops well and the conditions are favorable, then $1 is realistic in this case. However, I treat it as a risky investment. Remember, always DYOR.",

The concept of the metaverse, a virtual universe where users can interact with each other and digital objects in a highly immersive and interactive way, is also gaining traction. It is likely that AI and the metaverse will intersect in interesting ways in the future.In terms of AI-related altcoins, it is worth noting that the market for these projects is still relatively new and highly speculative. Investing in any kind of cryptocurrency carries a high level of risk and should be approached with caution. However, as the field of AI continues to advance, it is possible that some projects in this space could see significant growth in market capitalization over the next few years.It is also important to conduct thorough research and due diligence on any projects you are considering investing in, as well as keeping in mind that the crypto market is highly volatile and future performance is not guaranteed.",

To be honest I think that AI projects in the crypto were not as promising as any other project. They will not reach $1 without the hype. There's no reason for vechain to worth $1 with so many supply like that. The ai projects in the crypto were dead since last year. I think that the project like fetch ai and another ai projects were useless. ChatGPT has been transforming AI into the new thing but I never seen crypto AI projects were making something useful like chatGPT",

But if we compare those three projects to the current top AI projects (GRT), $FET and $MAN have a very good chance to be at $1 (if they can surpass the MC of $GRT). BTW, what made you interested in those tokens? Do you think that 2023 is the year for AI tokens?",
