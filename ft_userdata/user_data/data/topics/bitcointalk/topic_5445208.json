I think Op is planning on creating his NFTs and therefore needs his thread but for now, he lacks the knowledge of each board and what types of posts are accepted in a certain board. I don't think op just wants to discuss ordinals but if however, it turns out that I'm wrong about op having to create his project then he should consider joining some of the already existing threads.",

This would automatically add the quote to the message you are typing.- Jay -",

These sub-forums focus on discussions about cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, including NFTs and other blockchain-based tokens. However, it's always a good idea to read the forum rules and guidelines before posting to ensure that your post is appropriate and follows the forum's guidelines.",
