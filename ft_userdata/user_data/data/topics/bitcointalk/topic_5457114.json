  "content": "As of this writing our beloved Bitcoin is on fire as well as it's derivatives and shitcoins.Rate hikes immanent and market backing up a bit.The Blackrock ETF as they have a 500 to 1 SEC success rate.Solid ground for sound money or is this a FOMO perfect storm?I can understand the BR ETF exciting the market (the others are crappy spot ETF apps)But why is the market other than BTC on fire? One must dial back the optics and look at everything.Is this FOMO? As in another thread have we decoupled?Trying to understand why the whole spectrum is overheating.Silver/Gold is dropping as well that trade generally opposite of BTC.What's going on?",

      "body": "There can be some push because of those news about application for ETF and it's not just Blackrock but also WisdomTree, I don't have idea about the latter but it seems another huge company as per my research it has got $87 billion globally of AUM. Other than these news, I don't see anything that can push the prices but it's all due to these fundamentals and good news that we're seeing right now. While those past news about SEC hunting Binance US, Coinbase and more news about Binance negatively globally, it had pulled the market and now these Bitcoin ETF applications and news are likely the reason why we're seeing the sudden push of Bitcoin. But are we going to be surprised with these if it's normal that it surprises us with a bump and then with the typical dumps that we've been?",

It's like it's been such a long period of time until it had move a couple of thousands from the stable price that it had been or from the price during where the Binance news were around. I can still remember when it was like the barrier($30K) that's unbreakable a few months ago.",

This is a significant increase when previously the bitcoin price crashed due to binance.us legal dispute with the SEC. But when everything is over and it is clear, Bitcoin starts to recover again. My hope is that Bitcoin in July will be able to stay above the price of $30k so that it will have the opportunity to go higher to reach $40k. This will apply when there is no more FUD, but when FUD starts to attack again then the market will be disrupted. We will still see some corrections and that is quite natural because some corrections are needed so that the market is not saturated and can go even higher.",

Fud now looks like something normal to the crypto market. When it looks like the pressure of one is going down and the market is trying to recover so hard, there comes another, as if it's been manipulated by some organization gathered somewhere. Just take a good look at the Luna incident, which resulted in a great market dump. On the FTX exchange, the same thing happened. Now the SEC is suing, etc. It's just something normal now but what matter is how the market keeps on recovering after all this. It keeps bouncing back stronger.",

And it's just a question on whether now if we can sustain this run because of the FOMO and then go up $32k++. So it's too early to get excited, in my opinion.

When we thought that it might go down or at least sideways at $26k-$28k, suddenly in the last couple of days, the market seems to be on fire and on FOMO.And yes, we could really smell FOMO here, those who don't want to buy when the price is $26k, is now buying at $30k because they think that the market will continue to go up. Lol, that is the very basic definition of FOMO and I wouldn't be surprised is that is what happening in the market right now that's why the price suddenly went up to $30k in 48 hours.",

After all, the price staying above that level will turn it to as strong support before heading to hit the price of 40k, The ETFs news is huge one to get us there.",
