  "content": "QuoteThe ACCEPT Resolution could see the Capitol Complex accepting cryptocurrency for payment at vending machines.There’s no such thing as a free lunch (or snack) and Texas Senator Ted Cruz knows this, which is why the conservative wants to bring cryptocurrency into Congress.On Wednesday, Cruz introduced the ACCEPT Resolution, which stands for Adopting Cryptocurrency in Congress as an Exchange of Payment for Transactions Resolution. If adopted, the resolution could see the U.S. government contracting with food vendors and vending machine operators that accept cryptocurrency. The ACCEPT Resolution is not a bill, but a concurrent resolution, which are used to make or amend rules for the House and Senate, meaning that the ACCEPT Resolution wouldn’t apply to any vending machines or food sales outside of the Capitol property.“A concurrent resolution requiring the Architect of the Capitol, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives to contract with food service contractors and vending machine contractors for the Capitol Complex that accept cryptocurrency, and for other purposes,” the resolution reads.The resolution doesn’t specify any types of cryptocurrency, if the resolution will bar cash or card payments, or what the timeline could be for this resolution. Cruz’s office did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment.According to CoinTelegraph, Cruz has been a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency in the past. Specifically, the senator has rallied behind the decentralization of Bitcoin, stating on Twitter that “The Left hates Bitcoin because they can’t control it.” Cruz also reportedly purchased an investment in Bitcoin early last year that was somewhere in the ballpark of $15,000 to $50,000.The ACCEPT Resolution is a resolution with a bizarrely small scope, and the next steps are for the Senate and House to agree (or disagree) on whether or not to implement it. The resolution does not need the approval of President Joe Biden.https://gizmodo.com/ted-cruz-congress-crypto-snacks-vending-machines-1850039521....Senator Ted Cruz represents the US state of texas, which is known for having constructed new wind farms. Crypto mining operations have relocated to texas to utilize their newly built wind energy. As such Cruz has tried to defend the texas crypto mining industry in years past.QuoteCruz has been a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency in the past.

      "body": "It's a bit of a gimmick but it's an interesting idea for the fact it expands the Overton window with respect to crypto currency and the Washington D.C. status quo. I'd note that Ted Cruz is perhaps one of the most pro-crypto politicians in the U.S. and his crypto advocacy doesn't just encompass crypto vending machines at Capitol Hill.https://twitter.com/sentedcruz/status/1528891825477455872QuoteBitcoin and crypto represent freedom. It's not surprising that there is tremendous pushback from most Democrats because they cannot control cryptocurrencies. Thank you to the @Heritage Foundation for hosting this exciting discussion tonight.Seems refreshing for there to be a politician that isn't aligned with the central banks and is open to competitors of state sponsored currency. Bring on the crypto vending machines!",

      "body": "Sounds something very specific, if you ask me. is there an actual chance this passes?Because, it is well known that in both the senate and the house chamber there is people that are pretty much against any kind of crypto currency adoption...This feels like something Ted is doing to appeal to his base and even convince some centrist holders that the Republican party is for Bitcoin and decentralization, that is debatible. It may be just a testing probe Ted is releasing to see how much he can push adoption as law, for the sake of his own investment in Bitcoin.Politicians are not to be blindly trusted, imo.",

It is not only that they conceive the state as the best guarantor of rights, but that they buy into the victim mentality, as I just reflected in the other thread I just replied to. Although this has the logic that the socialists I know usually advocate a redistribution less than their own. In other words, they want to redistribute what belongs to \"the rich\" but they never consider themselves rich. Neither when they get $100k a year nor when they get $1M a year, the rich is always the one who is above them.And as for Bitcoin the same thing. Biden is super cool, but my Bitcoin is very private and passed through mixers so that Biden doesn't touch it.",

      "body": "One hand does not clap, and to bring about change like this, you require the people to move to believe that keeping Bitcoin is better than cash, which is something that will not happen in the short term, especially with many thinking of digital currencies as a medium-term investment or a way to achieve quick profit.I think that what Ted has done is a step to attract investments from some owners of mining equipment, who may have supported him at some point, and his personal direction came from him, and democratic countries are not based solely on the opinions of individuals.I hope there will be a serious trend in the future.",
