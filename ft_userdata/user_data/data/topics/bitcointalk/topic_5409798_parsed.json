      "body": "Your mistake is that you think you can earn profit by bag holding altcoins.That is not the right way. As you have already observed shitcoins like Doge get pumped and dumped, they don't have a future. In other words there was nothing stopping you from buying the shitcoin when it was getting pumped and selling it when the pump ended. You never needed to bag hold it hoping for a pump to come.",

Just think of it that whatever the price when you've sold, you're happy with the profits. This is the crypto market and it will never stop wherever it is right now.The price could be low this time and as you've said, we don't know what will happen in the future. But to say that it can also happen for other coins, well, just to break that. It's possible but don't expect that it can be applied to all.",

But if you can take a huge risk about doing that well its up for you to try if you want to figure out if you became rich or get broke in future.I do agree.The problem is that newbies tend to generalize, likewise with non-crypto investors. They easily make judgements about this industry such as \"an easy way to get rich\", \"follow the trend\", \"hodl\" and the likes without thinking of a strategy or doing a technical analysis first. TA indeed does not guarantee things but atleast, it would be a better basis than intuition or any form of gues. In every industry, especially when it comes to investments, there are things to be learned first to make a start and to be good at something.",

I think that older cryptos with good partners and real world usecases, like LISK and ICP, will do well during the next bullrun because they have working projects, not just promises like other coins.",

No coin that's meant to remain constant in it's value. What we need is the growth of any coin. Dogecoin is good coin and their is very possibilities that it will make well during the period of bullrun. Because during the time of bullrun no coin that's free of been adamant in value without adding up. So, i have not seen anything that will make feels sober.
