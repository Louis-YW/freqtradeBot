There is a small section around 1cm (1/2 inch) on the barrel of the pen which is transparent and tinted dark green which allows you to see how much ink is remaining in the pen. When filled, this ‘ink view window’ becomes obscured by the ink inside and therefore invisible (shown above empty of ink) The metal trim of the pen is 24 carat gold plated.The gift box included is also pictured and has a removable lid and an ivory coloured faux leather pouch for protecting the pen when being stored or carried. The pouch can take one or two pens.https://pastpens.com/shop/pelikan-400-white-tortoiseshell-pen-new-box-set/",
