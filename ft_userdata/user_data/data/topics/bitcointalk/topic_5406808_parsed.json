  "content": "If your miner restarts multiple times, you can check from the following aspects:1. Virus destruction. For virus damage, we can download the latest version of the antivirus tool from Bitmain for antivirus, monitor and manage miners in batches, scan the IP of the LAN miners, upgrade the firmware in batches, and restart the miners in batches to remove the virus on the miners.2. The quality of the cable or power socket is not good, and the contact is faulty. Internal contacts are hand soldered, often using acid flux. This will quickly cause the solder joint to oxidize in the future and cause an open circuit or leak between the live and neutral wires. Working for long periods of time can generate a lot of heat and cause virtual connections. At this point, it will behave as a restart of the miner.Another possibility is the wall socket we use. Professionals do not install most wall sockets, so the internal wiring of the socket is very irregular, which can easily cause the miner to restart.3. Insufficient power or poor performance. When the miner is working at full speed, the power protection may stop the output due to the instantaneous power shortage. However, when the power supply stops output, the load decreases and the power supply restarts. Because the recovery time after protection is short, the performance given to us is that the miner automatically restarts.Another situation is that the switching power supply performance of the mining machine is poor. Although the voltage is stable and within the normal allowable range, the harmonic content in the output power supply is too large. It also causes the miner to crash or restart frequently. In this case, it is normal to test the voltage with a multimeter. Therefore, it is better to replace with a suitable power supply.4. The miner temperature is too high. The mining machine has poor heat dissipation. The common problems are that the heat sink on the hash board falls off, there are foreign objects on the hash board, and the fan of the mining machine is too dusty after long-term use. These conditions will lead to poor heat dissipation, high accumulated temperature, and automatic restart.5. The fan speed test failed. When the fan speed measuring circuit of the miner is damaged, or the speed measuring line is intermittent because the miner cannot detect the fan speed, it will mistakenly think that the fan has stopped, and automatically shut down or restart. However, we may see that the fan is running normally and the speed measurement is normal.",
