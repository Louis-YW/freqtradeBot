They hopefully learned a lesson not to store crypto on any exchange as no exchange is too big not to fail. I am not sure whether FTX will allow withdrawal anytime soon. They need to have funds in order to fulfill people's withdrawal requests. When everyone is withdrawing at the same, it won't be possible for them to cater to all these requests. If Binance buys FTX, then we may have some hope that people's money will come back otherwise the money is just gone forever.When you read FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried removes ‘assets are fine’ flood from Twitter, you will find that FTX does not have assets and hence they deleted the tweet that funds at FTX are safe.",

Competitors will always try to keep their way clean. Facebook bought Whatsapp, Instagram and many other raising companies because they want others not to become their big competitor.  Some have pointed out their model is a Ponzi basically and how fragile it is if things descend into a huge mess. Same happened with TerraLuna, Celsius.... oh wait... I see a pattern here...   It was all about appearances and basically they artificially inflated themselves to look big and strong, fake-wealth, \"borrowing user funds\", \"liquidity farm\" etc... but biggest problem IMO, people have attention span and memory of a goldfish and they never learn. Back then ICOs, BitConnect, exchange hacks and incidents Quadriga, Cryptopia etc.... and we still step into the same riverbed over and over and expect something else.  I read posts FTX guy was a huge manipulator and speculator and basically it was very toxic to the Cryptomarket, his dealings even before this - so I get why CZ wants to purge FTX Founder and the likes out of the system.\"BREAKING: Tether reportedly begins freezing $USDT addresses owned by FTX at the request of law enforcement\" - clown emoji https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1590713876198608902",

I assume the USDT freezing was issued by law enforcement in order to prevent a possible exit scam or someone running away with what is left? Also, I have seen some speculation around social media that this is the work of some hedge fund, looking to make big money by shorting FTT, Bitcoin and even Tether (?). If someone could please update the status of the withdrawals from FTX, it would be very appreciated I have no idea these people actually have a plan or are actively trying to run away from all this.",
