  "content": "My old laptop is failing so I want to transfer my Electrum wallets to a new computer, which is also online. Seems the recommended method is to use seed phrase to set up the wallets on the new computer, but how safe is it to do this if the computer is temporarily disconnected from the internet? i.e. would i need to check if there are key loggers installed, and if so how? Using a permanently offline computer is not an option for me right now, so I am really weighing up whether it's safe transfer the wallets by inputting the seed phrase or if I should just send the funds to new wallets and pay the fees",

      "body": "If you are worried about a new computer, you certainly have several options - to scan it with a good AV and preferably with a tool like Malwarebytes. If it turns out there are no threats you can be somewhat sure (though never 100%) that your computer is safe. Another option would be to format the disk and install the OS (if it is Windows) without any pirated versions/cracks.After that, download Electrum from the official website, and for additional security, it is recommended to verify the file before installation. If you do everything by the rules, I don't see why you wouldn't recover your wallet with a seed on a new computer. Of course, in case you have more than $500 in BTC, it is not recommended to use any hot wallet, whether it is a desktop or mobile version.[GUIDE] How to Safely Download and Verify Electrum [Guide]",

      "body": "I will add that:1. You can also transfer the actual wallet files to the new computer and load them up in the new Electrum (in most of the cases there will be no error), and if you get errors/issues then you can go on the seed phrase approach.2. If your computer has malware, it can steal your wallet file and password and hence your funds even without getting directly the seed phrase(s).While I agree with @Lucius' post, for scanning I usually (also) look for images I can burn on CD/DVD, boot from them and use the AV scanner from there. Some of the major AV providers do offer such images for free (just make sure that at running those you check for updates too).And yes, if the amount of money there is significant, you should consider either acquiring a hardware wallet, either learning how to make your own cold storage.",

I'm currently trying to reinstall Electrum but GPG Suite is not finding Thomas V's public key - tried several times. GPG Suite is no longer supported for OSX 10.13 (my OS) but I guess this is not the problem as I've been able to find the keys of the other developers. Should I just keep trying until the server responds?",
