Another part of the problem is the aggressive advertising of casinos and sportsbooks. We can't discount the fact that minors knows a thing or two on how they can circumvent to continue their gambling. At least maybe some of us here when we were young have some tricks on their sleeve to not even around suspicions from our parents that we are indeed gambling.But perhaps the government thinks this is a good way to at least control, but not sure if it will be effective in the long run. There could be loopholes that this minors can exploit.",

If your kid is using your credit card to gamble, you are a lousy parent.OP didn't stated that minors use their parent's credit cards to fund their gambling habit. He said that minors use their parent's account for them to gamble. If this is really true, how come these parents didn't notice anything on the gambling history of their account. Even if their children use other way to fund their gambling account, they will surely notice if someone use their account other than them.

Not everyone want their identity to be fully expose on the government, if they still have choice to not comply to these rules then they would surely prefer those that doesn't need that kind of verification.",

However, this technology still needs development because at least the site requires a facial or biometric scanner to recognize whether a visitor is a minor or an adult. Technology can really help overcome the problem of underage gambling but here, what is more, emphasized is the issue of parental supervision of their children. Parents should really supervise their children, especially their children growing up. The support of technology like this can prevent online gambling problems in children and avoid addiction problems at a young age.",

Tackling age restrictions, particularly for children, is a significant issue in the gambling industry, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Although the approach may not totally fix the problem, it is unquestionably a greater step toward eradicating the problem. In line with this approach, it is still important parental guidance though...However, the issue is that this is still a KYC that most of us do not agree to comply with.",

Crypto casino is obligated to follow because of there license despite they are operating with crypto which is not regulated, There license is always subjected to further audit if they are following the law on every country.This KYC implementation will be good for removing minors but it be bad for all German citizens since it means a mandatory KYC to all of them on all online casino.",

There might be some extra layer of security besides selfie to make sure minors will be filtered properly.Definitely there is an extra layer of verification, I think the service provider has to process the authenticity of the submitted documents, optimizing the scans of IDs and photos for more precise identification.  This might prevent forgery or identify forgery.Quote from: davis196 on June 09, 2022, 06:45:10 AMQuote Minors had been flocking to the online Casino site without any restrictions.  They can blatantly access gambling sites with their parents' cards, fake their identities and so on.So the minors are smart enough to fake their online identity?
