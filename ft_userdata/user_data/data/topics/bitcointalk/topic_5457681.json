  "content": "We keep Bitcoin for every 365 days of our lives, but we forget that no person can work effectively every day. Despite this, we spent our entire lives holding Bitcoin without taking into account our health. The bitcoin you have hidden from the public needs to be protected not only by you, you need good health to stay alive to spend your effort and sweat, you need proper health maintenance to boost your immune system and stay longer but almost every day of our life's, we spend time discussing how to invest in bitcoin, how to secure it but we don't discuss how to stay alive to spend it, especially where we spent half of our lives online interacting with other people on the discussion of bitcoin and what is happening to bitcoin in other parts of the world.This is not a guide but optimized ways to stay healthy as a Bitcoin holder who wishes to see his Bitcoin value tomorrow, this advice will help you stay functional especially if you are the type that is always glued to the internet every day, especially those who have an addiction of opening any Bitcoin popup notification, it’s good to stay updated about the current happening of bitcoin but too much of everything is bad for the health especially when they involve assets, the recommendation is as follows:1. Spend time with your family and friends: Not every day of your life should always be about Bitcoin, you should have a life outside of Bitcoin, it will help your body and health when you engage with people outside Bitcoin and also spend time with them, it helps you preserve energy and also improves your perception of people outside bitcoin and others exposure outside bitcoin.2. Book a day with your health instructors and doctors: The majority of people don't check their health status until something is wrong in their system, you want to hold onto your Bitcoin and want it to grow in value and keep it safe from any harm but it becomes a problem to check on your health. Remember that health is wealth and to spend from that bitcoin in the future, you need to be in proper health condition to spend it wisely otherwise you may even end up spending it on your health, do frequently check your system and tackle it where it is necessary for adjustment.3. Do early morning exercise: There is no harm in doing common exercises for the body, they keep your immune on check and your body system in a fit way, unless you have some specific health challenges, doing morning exercise helps you boost your immune system and also makes you strong, instead of staying all day and night inside without doing anything take a walk and do some exercise for the body system.4. Spend Bitcoin on your health status when there is no alternative for funds: At a point in life, an unfortunate situation arises that you cannot predict and people don't like to lend money, when you have a health challenge without an alternative to the source of money and you have a bitcoin, don't hesitate to take some sats and take care of yourself, it might not even be you who is in need of the money, it might be your parent or siblings, there is no crime if you spend it on them.5. Take a break from the ways you check the Bitcoin chart: Holding Bitcoin for the first time as a newbie could be challenging and you have this urge to check the chart when there is any trending news, it is good to check what is going on but doing it over and over can cause anxiety and fears and that's what people who hate bitcoin want you to feel but fear not, bitcoin has proven and will continue to perform well, take care of yourself and bitcoin will take care of itself.6. Small meet up with people who have the same Bitcoin goals as you: Staying indoors can be depressing sometimes, even introverts feel lonely and bored when they are alone, meeting up with people who have a common insight of Bitcoin will help you and thinks outside your surrounding and indirectly exercising because even sun is good for the body system.In order to enjoy your Bitcoin as you age with time, your health should be something important and a resource that should never be taken for granted. As we age, the body weakens, but it can be maintained with proper care of health. Being proactive with your health keeps you alert and makes you feel better and safer, keep your Bitcoin safe and take care of your health.",

      "body": "It is important to take good care of our health because without good health we are poor. All the points you explain are very important because focusing on making money without proper health care can lead to sickness or even death. When one dies other people will enjoy the money he left behind. Eating healthy food, proper exercise, periodic health check, adequate sleep and rest, etc. are very important. Investing what you can afford to lose is another important piece of advice from Bitcoin investors to avoid sicknesses such as high blood pressure. I want to also add that we should avoid unhealthy lifestyles. Everything should be done in moderation. Some people drink too much coffee or alcohol, while others are addicted smokers. These lifestyles can lead to serious help problems. It is important to abstain and avoid substances that harm our bodies. It is good to keep our investment or Bitcoin safe but it is far more important to live a healthy life.",

Never sleeps and no days off, especially if his position is a trader. The main goal is only one, namely to get maximum profit, of course this requires constant attention. I don't think everyone has a reason and say that the benefits of investing in crypto are more meaningful and greater than the benefits of socializing well with family and the people around them.But, This is a real phenomenon. I also feel that way. The body and mind also need rest and relaxation. It's simple to say but very few people can do it even though many always say For Me Family Is No.1 Yes. I, in this case, agree with what you wrote, getting enough rest, being able to gather with your family is something that can regenerate our body's performance and I think this needs to be done in order to reduce stress and improve mental and emotional well-being.",

If the graph goes up yes. smile if down as usual a bit nagging a little    . But. There's nothing wrong with them, They also try more to bring home the blessings of what they invest in the context of short-term BTC Investments.

I also wonder if there will ever be a moment when they can actually spend these bitcoins. Everyone should have a reason for investing in bitcoin and holding it for a long time. Of course, the main goal is to make money, but what happens after you've achieved a reasonable profit? Do you spend it or do you keep the bitcoin for an extended period of time? I haven't made much money from holding bitcoin, but when I do, I'll set aside some of it to spend and care for my health while hodling the rest because we aren't guaranteed to live forever.

Our health should come first in all we do in life. We should never ignore any indications that could cause illness and we should practice excellent health hygiene and schedule routine checkups with the doctor before getting sick. You have offered some excellent advice that can help someone take care of themselves. Why not take care of yourself so you can continue your everyday activities? Without excellent health, we cannot engage in any of the activities we engage in and we will be powerless.  Quote from: SmartCharpa on June 26, 2023, 07:15:25 PM4. Spend Bitcoin on your health status when there is no alternative for funds: At a point in life, an unfortunate situation arises that you cannot predict and people don't like to lend money, when you have a health challenge without an alternative to the source of money and you have a bitcoin, don't hesitate to take some sats and take care of yourself, it might not even be you who is in need of the money, it might be your parent or siblings, there is no crime if you spend it on them.This particular point really struck a chord with me because some individuals truly hold the opinion that you should never use bitcoin, regardless of the circumstance. It’s true, Bitcoin should not be spent in any way because it is an investment for the future, and if you spend it on any small need, you will keep spending it until you have nothing left. However, I often wonder what the point of having an asset is when you can't use it to meet your needs, especially crucial needs like your own or a family member's health. In these cases, you should use your bitcoin for it if there is no other source of funding.",
