Where can buy or exchange it?There is nothing like dirty BTC, it is called tainted coins and that name is given to it by the government. The reason why the government calls it tainted BTC is because it was seized by the government from people who are into illicit activities. Any bitcoin that is seized from criminals, the government will use that word tainted coin.The fact is that there is no coin that is tainted, bitcoin is bitcoin, because those same tainted coins, government do sell them in auction to investors who are ready to buy it, at that time the government will say that it is a clean coin. Meaning it is the government that is just using that word tainted.I see that this your first post. Welcome to the forum.",

It makes you wonder why no one's thought of it before.  Oh wait! This basically sounds like money laundering, which is illegal pretty much everywhere. You could maybe offer these services on some darknet markets... but good luck with that.  By the way, most of us here don't believe in the concept of \"dirty\" coins when it comes to Bitcoin.",

Asking about it in the forum is not wrong but without knowing trying to find out where it can be bought is kind of odd. I mean without knowing about a digital product why would anyone ask where to buy it? You could have easily got your answer if you did a simple search but it is kind of strange that a newbie account created today is creating his first topic on dirty BTC.",

Where can buy or exchange it?Even though everyone is already telling you that there is no dirty BTC, I believe you heard somehow. So let me tell you about it. There are some coins that were stolen by a massive hack or something, which are considered dirty Bitcoins by exchanges. As soon as the victim of those hacks complains about a file, the authorities of the exchange blacklist the wallet address and they may even track the Bitcoins. If those Bitcoins end up in centralized services, they will freeze the account. But, if you ask where to buy these coins, well nobody knows. Probably on the dark web? But 99% of them are just scam offers. Whoever can hack a platform to steal Bitcoins, can use privacy enhancer tools like Mixers to make their coin unable to track. So, don't fall for those scams.",

If I'm not wrong with what I think you're asking, you want to buy stolen coin or one that's gotten by dubious means and have it sold to you at cheaper rate? More like what happens with stollen phone and other devices? How do you even come up with that idea?Well, the truth is that, if someone successfully steals someone's coin, they pretty much know how to go about there p2p transaction in such a way that they won't end up getting caught and I doubt they would want to do business with you. But then, isn't such idea a dark way of using Bitcoin? If you can associate with someone that steals from people, what makes you different from them? Except I'm misinterpreting what you're saying here if not it's just best to note that you have every tendency of carrying out unethical act.",

This action is the same as fiat money resulting from corruption or illegal actions that are against the law and then carrying out money laundering to avoid criminal action. Why would you buy dirty Bitcoin, after all you will never get any information about it. If you think you can buy it at a cheaper price because of its dirty status, you are very wrong, every time Bitcoin is traded on the market, no one can ever tell the difference because the coins are the same and there are no exceptions. Stop thinking about dirty Bitcoins, even if you hold any amount, you will never admit that the Bitcoins were obtained in a dirty way, that's the logic.",

They insinuate that dirty Bitcoin has been associated with illegal activities such as money laundering, drugs, hacked wallets, scams, etc. But the bottom line is that there is nothing like dirty Bitcoin. Just like fiat, Bitcoin can be used by criminals and this action doesn't make the money dirty. I recently read that 80% of fiat currency has been used for illegal activities. It will be difficult to identify these so-called dirty coins except the address was flagged and blacklisted by government agencies. Why do you want to be involved in such a transaction? The dark web might be a good place to ask this question.",
