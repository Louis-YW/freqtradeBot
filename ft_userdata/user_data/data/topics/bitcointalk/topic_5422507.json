      "body": "Hey everyone,Remember this artwork? It's been quite a journey getting it into the hands of its collector. It took about 16 months, but I finally made it happen! There were some hurdles along the way, especially with the framing and sourcing the Opendime, but guess what? We've now got a Satodime incorporated into this piece, which adds a special touch.I want to give a huge shoutout to the collector who went above and beyond by adding some extra satoshis to help cover shipping costs, thank you so much for your generosity, it truly means a lot.Every collector I gain brings me joy, but I also hope they'll share their pieces with others. These auctions sometimes bring challenges, and I often end up covering the costs out of my own pocket. But despite the ups and downs, the support I've received from some members of this forum has been invaluable. Seriously, I wouldn't be here without you all.As for me, I've been without a permanent home for almost two years now. Most of that time was spent in clinics, where the staff and patients became like family to me. I even set up a small gallery there with some acrylic works to bring smiles to their faces.So, while I continue to navigate life's challenges, I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my art and connect with all of you here. Thank you for your ongoing support it truly means the world to me.bc1q9glwrkckwhzkzce5rhk89hegftnl0vktkyzsaw",
