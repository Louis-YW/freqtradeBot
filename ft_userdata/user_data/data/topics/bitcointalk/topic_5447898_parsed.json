      "body": "I think that there are several ways to exchange Bitcoins for cash in Europe. One option is to use a cryptocurrency exchange that offers fiat currency withdrawals, such as Coinbase or Kraken. This exchange allows you to sell your Bitcoins for euros or other local currency and withdraw funds to your bank account.It should be noted that exchanging Bitcoins for cash can involve risks, such as fraud or fraud. It is very important to use only reputable exchanges or platforms and make transactions with caution. You can also consider selling Bitcoins to a peer-to-peer exchange or using a cryptocurrency trading platform. However, this option may cost some technical know-how.Another option is to use a Bitcoin ATM, which allows you to sell Bitcoins for cash directly. Bitcoin ATMs can be found in many major cities across Europe, and you can find them using online directories.",

And read reviews before doing that.",

I suggest Bisq or RoboSats for ultimate privacy and security (although more technical), or AgoraDesk for a less technical option.Either accept an existing offer or create your own offer, using whatever fiat method you want (cash in person, cash via mail, bank transfer, etc.)Initiate the trade using the platform's in built escrow for the safety of both parties.",

But for example, in Turkey there are specialized exchange offices where it is enough to simply exchange crypto for cash. No problems usually arise, although there are certain difficulties, since many require either an additional commission or you can withdraw from a certain amount.",

What a way for a noob to get quickly scammed. Telegram is a no-go zone for me for the following reasons1. Through phishing/clone telegram usernames2. No escrow service involved3. No arbitrator in case a payment dispute arises.",

I really want to use Bisq since last year but the desktop version is not working in my OS so I want to try the Android version.

What you posted is not the real site, check the links posted by o_e_l_e_o.  I don't think the software will run on Win7, but it should work fine on Win10.  I've been running Win11 and Debian 11 on all my machines, and I don't have any issues running Bisq with those OSs.  I seem to recall having this discussion with you before, you're using Win7, correct?",
