But the casino also accepts people from outside the country, as there are no restrictions for people from outside the country. Besides that, I also didn't see anything about KYC or I have yet to find it.The second site looks like it is an affiliate site because there are no links anywhere, and there are only links that refer to the affiliate page for registering and logging in. However, the site has an app for smartphones.",

I will also say that just because I haven't seen or heard of such casinos before doesn't mean they are bad. But these kind of casinos are mostly scamming with the users than I will tell you that there are many good casinos in this forum and you can select them. I think it is better to check their reputation before betting on such online casinos or gambling sites. And if anyone wants to do it, here is the link- Table Withdrawal Fees and Withdrawal Amounts on Crypto CasinosQuoteAlso, why can't trusted crypto gambling sites can promote their business on platforms like cricinfo?There can be many reasons behind this, firstly one of the reasons is that they get good big money sponsors from them and put them on the website.Moreover, another big reason is that cryptocurrencies are not yet legalized in all countries, maybe because of this obstacle such websites do not accept them.",

So I think we would see different ads based on our region and many of us won't see the ads that OP mentioned if our region is different.By the way, I am not surprised to see less popular casino sites advertise on Cricinfo or non-casino-based businesses advertise there. We know it's all about marketing. Cricinfo may list the ads from those who gave them a good amount to list them. Also, since everyone knows that Cricinfo has a big audience, many non-casino brands may also be interested in advertising on that site.",

I don't know if they're following the same strategy, but in here in my country they're usually operated by Chinese gambling corporations that are mostly shady in nature. Many of them are involved in so many illegal activities.  I'm not sure if Web Paranoid's assessment is to be trusted but their system considers sixs8.me as suspicious. It's actually not uncommon to see shady gambling sites being promoted everywhere. I always encounter the ads of 1xbet and 1xbit everywhere.",

After conducting a few searches, they are regarded as one of the primary sources of information about cricket, so it's not surprising to encounter various advertisements on their website.What you observe might also vary for others based on their location in different countries. However, in my case, it appears that uBlock Origin effectively blocks all these pop-up advertisements. Other than that, if you aren't familiar with what is being shown, ignore it.",

In addition, cricket is more popular in sub-continental areas where gambling is totally seen negatively. On top of that, the number of casinos is limited when we think of advertisements in Asia because there are few casinos that allow local payment methods. Crypto won't help the majority of Asia to gamble. In my country, most people gamble with bkash, nagad (mobile banking) payment. Otherwise, the number of gamblers was very much limited due to the payment easiness.",

Because each website has different rules regarding their services and maybe espncricinfo is not too interested in crypto casino platforms.If we don't know whether a gambling site is legit, we don't need to try it. At least for some time, we can also look for reviews about gambling sites and if there aren't any on this forum, maybe we can look for them on other sites. But still, we shouldn't immediately use it to gamble every day because we don't have more information about the gambling site.If the owner realizes that he needs to promote his gambling site, he will carry out massive promotions to bring more gamblers to his gambling site. But it will also depend on the budget he has. But usually, for gambling sites, they have prepared a large budget because the owners know that competition in gambling is very tight and they have to be serious about promoting their casino.",

As per my research, the first site's trust score rating is low and the identity of the owner is hidden which is a red flag. I couldn't find specific reviews or information about the second one. I'm always hesitant to click on gambling ads, especially from sites I don't know. You should always take caution when dealing with unfamiliar gambling websites, before engaging with any of them, it's a good practice to thoroughly research the site, read user reviews, and look for any licensing and regulatory information. Legitimate sites should be transparent about their licensing and have a solid reputation within the gambling community.Quote from: UmerIdrees on September 20, 2023, 04:53:21 PMAlso, why can't trusted crypto gambling sites can promote their business on platforms like cricinfo?It depends on the platform's policies and local regulations. It may have decided to limit or exclude certain types of gambling-related advertising to ensure the safety and compliance of its audience. Online gambling laws vary greatly from country to country. Some jurisdictions may not allow them to advertise at all, while others may have specific requirements that are difficult to meet.",

Usually, when a site is popular the companies approach the site themselves for advertisement and in this case, they are paid even more by those advertisers. By the way, it should be none of our concern what casino advertisement is run on cricinfo or any other site. We should join and play on the gambling site based on our research and not by seeing the advertisements. Also, there is nothing wrong in which ads the cricinfo displays, they get the money for it.If you want that cricinfo to display the ads of your favourite casino, better ask that casino to advertise there.",

Since there will be the holy month of Ramadan in the next few days, and therefore they are advertising this drink on Cricinfo. So this is not relevant to cricket or any contest so I do not understand what benefits will this drink company gets by advertising at such sites",
