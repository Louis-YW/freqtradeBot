Can you share your experience so that interested user know whether it is comfortable or not.Also, what about security? Is it confirmed that they aren't keeping the log of password?",

You can use it only for few days and will be deactivated if you do not purchase a premium subscription.Due to restrictions for the free version/trial, this trick is completely useless, no need to make things complicated, we can easily access the forum via mainstream browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari.",

While you can just click the \"Add to home screen\" feature of most browser to make it easier to access the forum on your android phones.",
