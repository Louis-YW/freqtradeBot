I know that since US is the world power, other countries are looking up to them on the steps they take towards a healthy economy. This is good news and we should keep hodli and don't sell your bitcoin because soon it will more very expensive, because it will be a competition for government and big tech firm on bitcoin accumulation.",

But sure this will push the price of BTC up if more countries are going to keep up with Us having their BTC reserves as well. No one wants to be left behind. Lucky for those countries capable of mining BTC through their resources, they can just mine BTC.  Not have to buy more using the tax payers money.",

But I think the most impact can only be made by USA adoptions of BTC into national reserves other countries won't do that and before USA in our dreams hehe. Although Donald proved to be a big deal for crypto as before many including me have fingers crossed but he is making crypto adoption more streamlined and he is not even in the full power now I think after 20th Jan big things are coming not only for crypto but for many other problems he promised to solve ongoing in the world like war. If EU also added BTC then things might become more centralized, but as I said it's hard for many EU countries to adopt BTC.",

As the old politicians who have little understanding about Bitcoin are replaced by young people, friendly crypto proposals or bills will be sponsored in the parliament of some countries. We don't know os she will have the needed support that will make her proposal to gain the majority support. But I am sure that more nations will adopt Bitcoin as a reserve immediately after the US takes that step. And the price of Bitcoin will increase. But we should also be prepared for centralization which will make it easy for them to manipulate the market at will.",

Most of the countries are looking to the US for their decision on having a bitcoin reserve for them to follow. As we already know just as with the dollar the US will do all in its power to gain control and regulate bitcoin. It is going to happen irrespective of if bitcoin goes to $1 million or not. The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief corner stone. We'll wait for next year to watch Trump's body language with regards to bitcoin and making it a reserve.",

But what I do not understand is why we project bitcoin to reach $1 million whilr it has not even hit $200,000 rate alone $500,000. I think it will be fine if we are not price conscious in this whole journey. Before now the government is to be against Bitcoin in all ramification but today we have gotten a pro-bitcoin president. This is a clear indication that the future is very bright for bitcoin and her adopters. However, if it's a debate of either BTC or CBDC, I'm confident that bitcoin will win.",

Infact before bitcoin actually hit a 100k during the very first periods of the pump just after Trump won the US election, frankly speaking many persons thought it was just a short pump just before we would retrace back to around 60k + anyways it didn't end up like that.The US may still have some bitcoin hodling though It may not be much. Besides I'm not too surprised about news like this because I had the feeling that this pump will actually cause some countries to want to try bitcoin investments or reserves rather.",

More of his kind will continue to come forward to eat their words up.As for the CBDC there is no reason getting surprised about the government bashing it aside because they have definitely seen how it had failed long from the start. Bitcoin isn’t in par with something related to fiat currencies rather it is with precious metals like gold. As for bitcoin been maybe a legal tender to the US dollars this will definitely hamper their currency as we all know the areas where bitcoin will definitely outperform it. Let’s simply leave bitcoin in the category of gold asset and it’s like, even at that bitcoin to me is still primed to go to $1m",

CBDC does not benefit the people but will bring more benefits to the government, so it will be more important to the government. The government doesn't like freedom, privacy, independence...what they want is to control the people as much as possible. In my opinion, what's going on is just FOMO, nothing more, nothing less. Many new investors jump into the market because they see the price of bitcoin rising so fast and their goal is to make a profit. I don't see anyone interested in its use cases like old investors.Since bitcoin crossed $100k, interest in bitcoin in my area has increased, but they are only interested in how to make a profit and exit the market when the target is reached. I don't see many people saying they are interested in using bitcoin to hedge against inflation or reduce dependence on government.",

I am bullish on Bitcoin but I don't know about price like $1M for 1 bitcoin. It is toooo much, but it is possible. I only don't know when and like how long will it take for Bitcoin to reach $1M?I guess it won't happen soon, maybe next 4 or 5 Bitcoin halvings and market cycles, even more. I really don't expect it too happen sooner like next 2 or 3 Bitcoin halvings and market cycles.QuoteIt is good that we see what we're hoping for, which is one of the world's leading country presidents that will adopt and acknowledge BTC, and it's good we see such movement through Trump.

His adminstration is possibly very bullish and friendly on Bitcoin, so it can pave a solid foundation for Bitcoin to the $1M Moon.

Now, the repercussion is calling and he will not like it. Trump who recently warned BRICS in favour of the USD may not be able to hold other countries if the strategic reserve of a thing becomes a success. This is where Trump will tread carefully going forward.However, optimistic talks like this happen during the bull run, and it might douse down between 2025 and 2026. And surely, a lawmaker is a single person, even if they are many, it doesn't still mean they will win at the parliament. There are more risks to this than we think, so countries like the EU would want the US to be the litmus test, they won't rush.",
