What is the actual acceptable total size of unconfirmed transaction in the mempool before the purging begins?2. Has the bitcoin mempool ever reached a size of 1 GB in unconfirmed transactions?",

You can set it to whatever you want.2) IIRC yes back in 2017 there were a few places that had no max size, or a very large one that were saying that they were above a gig.Going to be interesting to see what happens if this keeps up. Can some of the nodes running on older more marginal hardware may not keep up.-Dave",

Mempool.space is probably running a node with a very large mempool size, which is why you can still see the current size on the site.I would like to think that most public block explorers are. We KNOW they are not, but it would be nice if they did.Obviously if you are not showing ads or offering other services and operating out of pocket so to speak, you might not want to put $100s of dollars a month into running a public explorer. But going from 300mb to 500 or 750 should really not have a cost to you.But, as I said before having a bloated mempool and full block after full block is going to push some marginal HW running full nodes over the edge. And IMO that is a good thing.I have said it a few times, you CAN run a node on a RPi3 you can run a node on a 1st gen i3 with 2 GB of RAM. BUT outside of tinkering you really should not.-Dave",

BUT outside of tinkering you really should not.Maybe that is true but it's not permanent solution for this mess that was made with ordinals and NFT spam goin on Bitcoin blockchain.I think it would be good to somehow upgrade Taproot and introduce some limitations that could prevent things like this from happening.Speaking from non-developer stand point, but this was obvious side effect as result of introducing Taproot fork, nobody want's rollback but we seriously need zo think about one more soft fork.Quote from: nc50lc on March 09, 2023, 04:53:46 AMmempool space is probably keeping track of all unconfirmed transactions but has its own algorithm to compute the default \"Purging\" fee rate.Timechain calendar is showing the Purge, along with all other information shownon Mempol.space website.https://timechaincalendar.com/",

Yeah, fees have been around 400sat/b for first block inclusion before, not something I want to see again but still an order of magnitude from what we have now, so all the current panic over ordinals is, at least from my point of view, just fearmongering.Quote from: LoyceV on March 09, 2023, 08:16:33 PMAlthough the full mempool and dropping price reminds me of what happened at the end of 2017.That's the effect of Silvergate Bank closing down, not the Planet of the Apes jpegs taking over the blockchain.",

Although the full mempool and dropping price reminds me of what happened at the end of 2017.Imagine what would happen on top of bull run with much more transactions and much higher fees, it can become very hard to use Bitcoin for regular people.Speaking about meme-spammers, they paid much higher fees on shitereum blockchain so I don't see why they wouldn't pay the same thing on Bitcoin blockchain.Bigger problem is that someone who is malicious (including governments that have unlimited funds) can use this as a way to attack Bitcoin and blame regular people for everything.",

At the moment it states it is purging anything below ~2 sats/vbyte, and yet the graph still shows almost 40 MvB of transactions paying between 1 and 2 sats/vbyte.Compare this to Johoe's mempool here: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),8h,weight.He is showing only around 3 MvB of transactions paying between 1 and 2 sats/vbyte. It seems he is indeed purging at around 300 MB of memory use.",

I don't think so, people that held USDC were doing so for trading and to move funds easily around exchanges, Bitcoin and self-custody aren't what they were looking for, and even if they do buy coins on the exchanges I doubt they will take them out. The last block had 2sat/b transactions and I don't see anything unusual in terms of incoming transactions volume that is not ordinals, exchanges wouldn't go and batch transactions with 1sat/b  fees either.Of course, we're also 20 blocks over the normal volume for 24h but I still doubt there will be another spam wave.",
