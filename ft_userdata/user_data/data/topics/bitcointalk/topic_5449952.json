Realizing something depends on how strong you are against it in the past and how much preference knowledge especially in terms of technology, it can even take longer than 9 years. However, this is a form of caution that needs to be applied when risking any financial instrument.I think the train is still not too far to say you have missed it.",

Hope you will not panic? Some people that have experience will not sell but leave the bitcoin on their wallet, the price will later increased and increase very far above $27000. If altcoins increased, they can increase than bitcoin, but some may remain as shit coins and not increasing. But if bitcoin is decreasing in price, when it gets to 1.5x decrease, expect altcoins to have decreased over 2, 3, 4x or more. That is why altcoins are like you are gambling. Invest what you can afford to lose on altcoins.What can be more painful about some altcoins is that they may not get to all-time-high.Quote from: Kara3 on April 24, 2023, 05:43:46 AMI must buy bitcoin today, I really don't know if someone else is experiencing the same thing out there?To buy bitcoin is a good idea.

It might lead you to get scammed in the first place if you invested in something that you didn't really know, Most of the early investors on Bitcoin that are already millionaires or billionaires these days were just lucky, I mean yes they invested money but Bitcoin is obviously a big gamble since they don't know that Bitcoin will reach these far.But still yes buying bitcoin today is the best thing that you could do because the market is still in the process of recovering, there is still a lot of room for profit if you waiting for the All-time high and bull run.Quote from: Rruchi man on April 24, 2023, 07:46:20 AMIf you procrastinate a lot, do not let that character affect your decision to invest in bitcoins because you will certainly regret it.Quote from: _act_ on April 24, 2023, 06:16:11 AMTo buy bitcoin is a good idea.

So, price would've still been on a steady decline. Of course, I know that those who buy to hodl wouldn't care if they're buying high or low and would target anything like a perfect entry. They just buy. 2015/16 would've been a perfect time for shrewd investors just like 2023 is now.

Think carefully about what you are doing, because from what you say about the altcoin, it seems to me that you are an impulsive person who gets carried away by the ups and downs of the moment and is buying cryptocurrencies like someone who goes to the casino to try their luck. If you buy bitcoin, you'd better do it with money you won't need for years and with a lot of patience. If you don't have a lot of money, it's worth making regular small purchases, as recommended.In any case, I wouldn't call that procastination, but rather making the wrong decisions over a long period of time.",

There are a lot of people who \"took the opportunity\" but did not \"profit\" from it for various reasons, whether it was that they sold too early, or they lost access to what they invested in. If you take that into account, then there was a high probability that your story would have only one addition that would fit in one sentence \"I bought Bitcoin in 2014 and sold it in 201x\".Quote from: Kara3 on April 24, 2023, 05:43:46 AMI must buy bitcoin today, I really don't know if someone else is experiencing the same thing out there?To me, that is completely wrong and illogical thinking, literally as if someone is forcing you to do it, and it is and should be a matter of personal choice.

Also, some people had no money in the early days to invest in Bitcoin. Procrastination is not just something that can make you not invest in Bitcoin since 2014 to date. Anyways, I wouldn't consider you to be late to Bitcoin; instead, you start accumulating some stash now, and gradually, before you know it, you will have a significant amount of Bitcoin in your portfolio.",
