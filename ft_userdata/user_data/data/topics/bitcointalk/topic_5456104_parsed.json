But it's kind of interesting when you think about it, bluewallet gave up on handling peoples funds for LN and handing the back end LN node.

I guess everyone is going to have their own not over this amount point for doing things in an insecure way. -Dave",

There was some talk about this wallet in the Croatian local board recently. It's a custodial service, but I was surprised to find out that if you deposit to WoS, you can use your coins either on-chain or off-chain. One balance works for both layers and you choose which one you want to use. A very simple entry for Lightning Network beginners.",
