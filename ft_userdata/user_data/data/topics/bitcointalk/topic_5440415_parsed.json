Too much negative news and expense for them. So, maybe it was Antifa or BLM, or any of a number of Soros people.18-inch pipe bomb found near railroad tracks in Philadelphia neighborhoodhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-21-pipe-bomb-found-near-railroad-philadelphia-neighborhood.htmlThe discovery comes after train derailments shook the country after these supposed accidents released hazardous and cancerous chemicals into the local environments, particularly in Ohio.The PPD found the explosive device on Sunday, Feb. 19, at around 1:30 p.m., behind St. Dominic's Catholic Church in Holmesburg. Google Maps images of the area show that there is a rail line behind the church's massive cemetery, and that the area is right next to an elementary school.PPD officials who spoke with local media outlets noted that a passerby found the pipe bomb and that the device was made with a PVC pipe filled with black powder and with capped ends.Police immediately responded by shutting down a nearby road and calling in the Philadelphia Police Bomb Squad to safely take the pipe bomb away. They further noted that the device is now under analysis and bomb techs are working to disassemble it.Pipe bomb could have endangered rail lineFather Edward T. Kearns, the parish priest of St. Dominic Church, noted that he does not believe the pipe bomb was directed at the church or against Catholics. More likely, he believes the person who placed the pipe bomb there was attempting to target the rail line itself.\"I don't think it was in connection to us,\" said Kearns. \"It was behind us, not on our property, [but] on the other side of the railroad tracks.\" Kearns noted that, if the pipe bomb hadn't been a dud, it would have directly threatened the freight line that ran behind the church and the wider impact that would have caused following the catastrophic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio....",

So in what way will plaintiffs be properly compensated for the potential of getting cancer long after the company responsible ceases to exist? Surely the company responsible will go bankrupt and perhaps some executives could be held criminally liable. Of course, trying to collect your due compensation when your impending cancer has not yet been identified is challenging. Maybe the compensation package will account for this.",

Right. The US is built on common law. Common law is the law of the people, not government statutes. It's too bad that people don't understand common law and how it works, or this trouble wouldn't exist in the first place.Why not?Because the railroad would make sure that something like this spill wouldn't happen. They would do it because the people might be able to destroy the whole railroad using common law... if the people only knew.Government doesn't like the power the people have in common law. So they hide the fact of common law as much as they can.",
