Everyone don't trust himI think your post should be in reputation section, I think this is not the right section. Also julerz12 have been a reputable member of the forum and he has run so many bounty campaigns successfully and he always escrow most of his bounty campaign payments. I think all the bounties which you listed are not escrow by the manager and after bounty have been completed, if the team refuse to pay I don't think their is anything the manager can do, but am sure he will be trying his best just to get hunters their payments. I think the manager ban you just because you keep on asking the same question without reading previous messages or pin post.",

You should have decided it before. The manager has full right of who to pay and who not to. Last time I checked in a bounty the social shillings were from template. This is a ____ project. Please ____ the project. #______Not one or two but from several social accounts. A project which wants to have their brand to be out, they do not want to pay for templates.
