Because When the layer one project launches a mainnet, there will be a launching token for the gas fees as well. If we complete the testnet tasks, we can earn a decent amount of tokens as well. I received tokens from the following layer 1 projects earlier.Eg : Aptos,Sui,Sei",

They are allocated 22% for the community with the 90-month linear vesting. So it will not unlock 100% at the TGE. Also the Layer 2 projects are only for the mainnet users. L2 projects not targeting the testnet users.",

I am doing the main net airdrops as well. but you need real funds for that. Most of the layer 2 projects target the mainnet users. Not the testnet users. If you don't have money, a better option is to do the testnets of layer one projects. I am using the below projects for the mainnet airdrops.Eg :1. Layerzero(Not the layer 2 project)2. Zksync (Layer 2)3. Starknet (Layer 2)",
