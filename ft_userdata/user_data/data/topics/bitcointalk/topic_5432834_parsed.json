  "content": "Hi guys,I have a question about dogecoin wallet recovery from the dogechain website. I lost the e-mail it was connected to, so I cannot get a 2FA code. Their support is also not responding at all. Unfortunately I only found this article now -https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-recover-a-lost-dogechain-info-wallet-password-and-unblock-2fa-keychainx-expert-explains/Does this method still work? I can't get the encrypted wallet from the api response now, maybe I'm doing something wrongHow would I decrypt the wallet, with which tools? Unfortunately the article is not very specific on this. Thanks in advance for the help!",

They also did not tell which script to download the wallet data. Either the method now does not work or they hid some information because recovery is their business model.The only help you can get is to contact that wallet recovery service directly.",

Thanks in advance for the help!if you know your Wallet ID, you can try to contact privacy@dogechain.info ask them to send you the encrypted backup of your wallet. it is protected by your password. there still a chance to recover the doge although it needs a lot of work to do.",
