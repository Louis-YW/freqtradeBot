This is wan na parable for nija. Many people prefer not to share their source of income, and you can't force them. If you choose to share, it won't hurt you, but not everyone will be able to follow your path. Let's take Bitcoin, for example. Recently, someone asked me about my current investment, and I mentioned Bitcoin. Initially, he was interested and wanted to know more about it so I gave him things to study. However, when I later asked if he had studied Bitcoin, it was clear he didn't and lost interest. this shows that not everyone can pursue the same income generating activities. We all have different preferences and abilities.so, I don't consider it greediness, bro.",

Bitcoin for everyone no mean say I get anyone to give you, na how we fit help out fellow citizens b de reason for this post.The economy done bad, which everyone of us are quite aware. Millions of Nigeria youths they out there they strive and still nothing to show for it. Online financial platforms don dey available for piple to dey make money. This platforms done turn some youth to self independent people. Another interesting way of having something to live for is the accumulation of Bitcoin and other crypto currency. We can all attest that this has also helped several youths among us.But the sad thing is that, there are certain people who choose to hold financial information to themselves instead of sharing it with the people around them. This issue has become the common habits of Nigerians which has increase greediness among us.Watin e go cost me if I tell you where I dey get my money ?, As long as I no put hand for bad thing, then I suppose fit give reasons to anybody why I dey buy some cryptocurrency.Money na watin we no go fit chop finish, na just information, pass it to who so ever is interested. It's better to share a financial information than to help someone financially. And note, it's not by force, so don't force anything on anyone, but only those who are interested.Abeg make I hear from una too and happy Sunday...My brother wetin you talk na true too o but you see nothing good comes easy even Rome the greatest city was not built in a day. So am trying to say that it takes time to achieve great things. You know if everything is given to you whenever you want it you will find out that you won't value it that much because you don't know the pain people went through before to experience that success. So sometimes it also requires you to go through what they went through so that you will experience the sacrifices they made towards achieving greatness. It's just like sometimes ago someone wanted to introduce me to this platform but I told him I don't have a phone nor a laptop. He told me to struggle and get it that it's not as if he can't get it for me o but that if he does dat I may not take it serious because I get it very easy. That if I must succeed in life I need to be determined and hardworking.¬† So I struggle just to get a phone and when I got the phone I was determined to join this platform so I did, being in this platform and seeing how everything is going it's not really easy at all. Who knows had it been he was the one that bought the phone for me I wouldn't have taken it serious because I may not know the pain he went through. But being that I bought this phone with my hard earn money I brought out my mind to continue even though I know am still new on the platform but I the journey of a thousand miles begins with a step. So I don't think there's need for us to feel bad if we don't achieve things the way we expected it to be.",
