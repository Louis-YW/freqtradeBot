  "content": "Crypto is full of surprises and we have seen how trend keep shifting from one stuff to another, sometimes back to the first one and sometimes it's just bitcoin getting stronger. For example, we have seen how there was era of ICO, then NFT's, and now it's about the AI-based Tokens which are actually putting the Bitcoin's economic strength far behind than what it used to be. However, there is catch to that statement. Personally I don't think that is really true and can last for very long. It's just that another trend moving here and there all the time. But there are some who believe in it and there are few reasons. AI-based tokens are getting popular because people find it attractive to invest in the new and cutting edge technology. In addition to this launch of ChatGPT has given mixed push to entire AI based economy because many of them are relating it as next GEN future. The drag is all about gut feeling, FOMO's, new trends, first invest kinda stuff & etc.QuoteCrypto markets are known to be fueled by narratives, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend.Prominent traders on Crypto Twitter are heralding AI-based tokens as the sector that might lead the next bull market cycle. They may be right so far: Such tokens are up an average of 80% in the past week alone, CryptoSlate data shows.Among the biggest gainers have been tokens such as Artificial Liquid Intelligence (ALI), Fetch AI (FET) and Singularity Net (AGIX), which have surged as much as 220%, as CoinDesk previously reported.The tokens of AI-based upstarts like Image Generation AI (IMGNAI) have more than tripled over a two-week period. The protocol allows users to generate artwork using text disruptions on social platforms such as Discord.One-time popular tokens from 2018 and 2021, such as Big Data Protocol (BDP) and Measurable Data (MDT), seem to have jumped on the hype with tweets that seem to remind investors of how they utilize AI technology within their blockchain applications.BDP has surged 2,100% in the past week, CoinGecko data shows, while MDT has jumped 150%. Both protocols use their tokens to commoditize data, allowing providers and buyers to exchange data securely and anonymously.Crypto majors such as bitcoin and ether have paled in comparison, rising just 30% each in the past month despite fundamental catalysts. However, the market capitalization of major tokens is upward of $300 billion, meaning they require significant amounts of investment and public interest for prices to surge multifold within a few weeks.Why are AI tokens surging?AI broadly refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like humans. Popular applications for this technology have so far been limited to chatbots, self-driving cars, optimizing search in online marketplaces, and image-generation software – but futuristic usecases envision wholly-autonomous cities, cyborg humankind and interstellar travel.Much of the recent surge in AI tokens emerged after the public launch of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software Dall E in mid-2022. Both are traditional software that do not use cryptocurrencies or blockchain and were launched by OpenAI, which recently raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion valuation.Such institutional interest has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector.\"The growth opportunity around the AI and Web3 space combines early interest, potential and hype,” states Ravindra Kumar, founder of crypto wallet Frontier. “While it's true that there may be some hype surrounding AI intervention in the crypto space, we are seeing the emergence of innovative and compelling use cases.’Aditya Khanduri, head of marketing at Biconomy, takes a milder approach: “I believe that the current AI trend is still pretty speculative, leading to a jump for tokens like OCEAN, ALI, AGIX. Some of the tokens with more buzz and followings have pumped and it's less about the actual tech behind it.”“This is because the current AI tokens and web3 projects may not yet know what these decentralized AI tools look like. There's a lot of unanswered challenges and lots to be figured out,” Khanduri told CoinDesk in a recent chat.The likes of Khanduri say token-based usage while scaling AI software is a hard problem to solve.“Say an AI tool gets to 250 million users. Then what will its infra look like? How will people use it? How will the data be trained? Where does the token fit in? Can you even have a way to reward people for their data if you used it to train your models?” he said.Meanwhile, some market watchers remain cautious about the AI token hype.“Once the market starts livening up a bit, all sorts of new trends come out of the woodwork. And they are not all as solid as they might look,” financial market consultant Valentina Drofa told CoinDesk.“There is a risk that this whole ‘new trend’ is going to end up in an empty hype, as there are many speculators that would seek to make use of short-term price pumps,” Drofa added, referring to the recent multifold gains put up by some tokens.“The industry at large will end up dealing with the long-term fallout and another hit to its image. Such cycles are becoming rather tiresome and sad to observe again and again,” she stated.At the the article just states that how it is temporary hype associated with the AI, how they are making everyone invest by luring into the future that may not exist or only exists in the parallel universe!What is your story? Do you believe that AI-based tokens are worth it or is it too early to adopt them?",

Do you believe that AI-based tokens are worth it or is it too early to adopt them?As for things like investment, maybe whoever is the earliest then he will benefit. Isn't that the concept of investment when referring to the hype? But the problem is whether the trend will really come in a short time or it still takes time to seize the moment. So DYOR...Talking about AI-based tokens, they will not be like trending tokens like Metaverse, Meme coin, and short-term trending tokens. I'm not looking at it far enough and maybe even AI Tokens will basically become a forgotten piece. In my opinion this is only used by Token creators as a trend while the project itself doesn't really have any contribution to the field of AI itself. So if it's to survive, the project has to really have the same capacity as AI benefits.",

As a trader, I know about the cryptocurrency frenzy and how many individuals are trying to earn quick money from it. I know cryptocurrency trading has pros and cons. Before investing, understand everything you can about it, from how it works to its risks to how real people use it. Market movements can potentially damage your funds. Before investing, research the asset. This is excellent for long-term success. Cryptocurrencies are assets, and all assets have risks. You could win or lose money. Careful consideration of all choices is the only way to ensure solid investments",

There are a few that I already saw before the chatGPT was released like the FET.Probably all gimmicks and the tokens may not even have a use case in the ecosystem. So far the only use case of the tokens right now is funding the teams to develop the gimmick. One reason that might make it worth it is if you buy those tokens and dump them at ATH right before the hype is over for it's still an opportunity to ride for potential returns.",

Do you believe that AI-based tokens are worth it or is it too early to adopt them?AI-based tokens do not have the strength to survive, the concept of developing this kind of AI only relies on hype that moves full of tricks, but the people involved sometimes never know the effects of returns and risks to be received. If you want to make an investment, it requires long-term planning regarding the chosen coin and it is important to see the fundamental potential contained in any coin, as represented by bitcoin and place it in the best investment.NFT and Defi failures can give you an idea of how unpleasant it is to get involved in AI, the mistake of overzealous people because new trends usually end up with empty hype and therefore some knowledge is needed before starting to invest, running on hype is like trying to put hope in cases same as gambling.",

Unfortunately, image generating AI tools where created right after the NFT hype died.Imagine what would have been, if tools like Midjourney have been used to create NFTs at the middle of the NFT madness? The NFT market would have been flooded with thousands of great looking NFT images and the price would drop to zero, because almost everyone and their grand parents are able to create a great image out of scratch. All those NFT project owners wasted so much money on designers, instead of using Midjourney or Lensa.  This would have been hilarious.I don't know anything about AI tokens, but I don't see any difference between them and ICO tokens. It's just another quick cash grab scam.",

This is somewhat AI in terms of roles normally being filled by intelligent people being replaced by algorithms which eliminatea need for a financial system built on trust. Also known as trust less design paradigm.If other tokens and coins succeed in replacing intelligent people with algorithms or AI. They might also be able to fulfill an intrinsic advantage, which can be measured and quantified statistically.We definitely have a basis for AI or algorithmic tokens providing legitimate intrinsic value, which gives them an advantage.
