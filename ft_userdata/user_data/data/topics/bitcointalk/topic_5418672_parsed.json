  "content": "To build trust on someone takes time and Â sacrifice, you have someone that you trust so much because they know this,they end up disappointing you in a way that might be unforgivable because of money.There are two friends Kelvin and Charles,they have similar likes and have being gambling and predicting results of matches together. One day Kelvin and Charles studied a game together for some days and finally, it was the game day,so these two friends instead of playing separately decided to put their money together to bet big so that the win will also be bigger. After betting since Kelvin and Charles have been friends for long, Charles didn't bother about who will keep the game slip and so the slip was with Kelvin.Four hours later,the game was played, the game came out as predicted and these two friends got a big win of $120K. Charles before the game started,fell asleep and woke up two hours after the game ended,believing whatever happens,his friend Kelvin will notify him. Kelvin noticed the win and checked on Charles at home to find out that Charles is fast asleep.Kelvin secretly withdrew the money and ran away to another state where he feels Charles wouldn't find me, Charles woke up and checked the game,then called his friend but he was nowhere to be seen. Three months later a friend of Charles saw Kelvin living in a big house with a luxurious lifestyle and told Charles.All these happened because Charles trusted KelvinIf you were Charles what will you do after knowing where Kelvin ran away to with the money you both won. Will you just let go,or you will go after him to get justice ? or how will you treat this issue.",

Once money knocks on their door, you are easily forgotten.",

We should not handle life with foolishness, bet separately.Kelvin is now rich. If Charles is not rich, Kelvin may win anything brought up by Charles, except if Charles is rich and able to file a law suit with Kelvin. But even where is the evidence that they added money together to bet.",

Not everyone can control themselves to maintain integrity.",

It do really sucks when it comes to money where friendship or trust could easily be broken outand this is why you should really be betting on your own rather than on trusting up someone.",

      "body": "Gambling can sometimes take quite twists and turns. And if you are really dealing with someone who is heavily addicted to gambling, close friends but also family can become victims. It will not be the first time that a relationship breakup has occurred as a result of a gambler who does everything he can to get money. Friendships can also break, but it's better to confide in a good friend and tell them about your problem than to make fun of him. After all, that's what friends are for and every addiction can eventually be overcome. But you must persevere and certainly not betray your friends and family. It certainly won't make you feel any better.",

So i would personally leave him to karma and work really hard on creating a good life for myself.",

Will you just let go,or you will go after him to get justice ? or how will you treat this issue.This story just sound like one of our Nollywood Nigerian drama. Because they are the only set of people in this world that can act and tell a story just as narrated. But however, if this happens to be true just as it sounds, then justice is the best way forward. But before I start, i don't know the kind of friendship that may have coexisted between these two set of people, because the mistake most people make today is trusting people too easily to the point of sharing secret information to someone you barely know anything about. Because If you go deep into this case, you may get to notice that Kelvin and Charles may have been good friends but never did any of them had deep information about each other. That is, for example...Charles full name, where is he from, who are his sibling, his father or mothers phone number or any emergency contact address or phone number, e.t.c.Because If I was to be Charles, the best decision will be to arrest Kelvin and ask him to refund me my share of the winning.

Nevertheless, Kelvin has run around with the money already and maybe by the time he caught up with him the money might be gone for good.So obviously there will be a problem right there, friendship might have severed already because you have trusted him and unfortunately greed takes over. I'll probably let him go but it's going to be over.And there could be some individual that will go to the extend to hurt the Kelvin physically, to be honest.",

How it turned up that Kevin was easily able to go away without a trace. Since part of the used money on betting was also owned by Charles, then that's a clear theft already. He just needs to clarify everything for his claim and put pressure on Kevin.Anyway, I think that's just a made-up story. Although possible to happen in real life, I don't believe that it can easily happen in reality. Please don't make it a habit of creating a thread like this.",

Quote from: seleme on October 28, 2022, 08:54:24 PMSo complicated, Charles should look for justice and find a solution to take his piece of cake. They predicted together and bet the similar amounts, Kelvin doesn't deserve living luxurious lifestyle without Charles. Thinking twice before making such decision is necessary since we can't choose friends who gonna lie or cheat us. I do not know if Charles can go to court and sue Kevin for stealing the profit from their bet. It is hard to prove that Kevin stole the money since Kevin has the slip. All Charles can do is appeal to the good conscience of Kevin to give Charles what is due to Charles. Other than that, there is no legal way that he can get his money back.",

Tracing out is never been simple specially if you do have that limited source of funds where even there's someone who do talk that he's on other state then finding would really be hard.You cant really expect that someone on his family would be telling his location specially if they do know the situation or that guy already told them not to tell on where he is or totally dont know just because that dude ran away from his home and make a living out of that huge win.If you could really sustain yourself on finding him then majority of us would really be telling the same.You do have the rights on asking some part since you've both have an agreementon betting on the same team/player with both funds combined which it is really just right that you would fight for your right or get on what you deserve.",

What if Kelvin has squandered the money with little or nothing left?. That feeling of betrayal will cost so much trust issues for me after such experience. For me i will involve a lawyer straight up so that i can retrieve what ever is left before he goes bankrupt. I won't blame Charles for trusting a friend to such extent but left to me i will use the law less things gets worst.QuoteI do not know if Charles can go to court and sue Kevin for stealing the profit from their bet.

As long as money is involved a thousand and one volunteer lawyers and human right activists will take up the case because they know too well their cut will be included when the eventually wins the case. If Kelvin can do away with such amount of money without informing his friend then using an appeal will be a total waste of time",

If that's the case Charles surely contact his family about his whereabouts and it will trigger the authorities to help the family find Kelvin on the same day.
