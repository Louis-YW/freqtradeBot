Because that procedure is automated, not manual.",

We consolidate all the deposits into one address and then use that to fund the withdrawal hot wallets and keep most of it in a cold wallet.",

Things here are not as beautiful as they seem.¬† No one will help you make money.¬† No one will multiply it for you for free.¬† You are on your own and there are more evil minded users that will try to attach to your wallet than there are good people.¬† Do not take anything for granted.And last but not least.¬† Familiarize yourself with what Know Your Customer is and how legitimate companies can selectively scam their users by using it as an excuse.¬† Your Bitcoin is only safe in your own hands.¬† You make it as safe as you want.-Regards,PrivacyG",
