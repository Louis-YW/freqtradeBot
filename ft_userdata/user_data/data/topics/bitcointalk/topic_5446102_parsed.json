Peak DKPrint #3. Suzuki MattPrint #4. bitbolloPrint #5. MoparMiningLLCPrint #6. Hookzup1Print #7. rhomelmabiniThis leaves 14 13 for sale @ BTC0.00084You can post your comment or make a booking, I really want to sell all 14 copiesrather than going to the trouble and expense of printing and then having them sitting here.*if I cannot sell 13 I will print the 7 copies as promised for the 7 contributors . . . and 1 for myself!PRESENTATION:These will be a single sided print [Test print to follow shortly]Bearing in mind the expense of getting these posted I have two options of presentingthese as a final product 1.] A1 print folded to A4 size + Single sided A4 cover sheet all in a grip sealed plastic bag.Postal cost similar to that of the Bitcoin Colouring BookQuote from: aoluain on July 15, 2022, 10:53:16 AMPostage [WITH TRACKING]1 book – EU $10 | USA, Canada, India & Pakistan $12 | South America, New Zealand & Australia $14  2 books – EU $12 | USA, Canada, India & Pakistan $15 | South America, New Zealand & Australia $18  2.] A1 print rolled into an A2 postal tubePostal cost to be determined but I'm guessing more expensive than folded flat.",

The poster paper though is coatedso not all media would go on it.There was only 7 of you guys who won the chance to contribute to the poster, so a limitedclub on a very limited project fwiw",
