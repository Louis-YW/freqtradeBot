The project was good for long term but this project didn't meet crypto user's expectation caused by it has not offered play to earn mechanism. We have not seen the project like steam based on the crypto but gala was taking such idea to be the first gaming hub in the blockchain. The only problem is if crypto ecosystem was not the same like steam. It needs a hard work to make the crypto game developers wanna use gala market as a partnership to promote their game.",

The only problem is if crypto ecosystem was not the same like steam. It needs a hard work to make the crypto game developers wanna use gala market as a partnership to promote their game. I guess the bear market is really taking a toll to everyone, even as high as what is being projected with GALA. I mean the hype around it, touted to disrupt the gaming industry, and the developer by the co founder of Zynga, so what could go wrong with this project?So maybe P2E niche is dying, Axie for one, the prime mover, has suffered big already. And now others is following that path. And if you believed in this project, then there is nothing wrong with investing on them right now as the price is very cheap.",

I also once held tons of shitcoins in 2018 that never made it to 2021I agree to you.It's known that the bear market will really stomp a lot of altcoins. On this choice, since I don't hold a lot of it and literally a few bucks I've bought from it and knowing that it's like a promo where that money came from spending on this, there's no issue on me whether this coin dies or prospers. So, for the newbies they have to consider first the potential and do research to have ideas about the pros and cons before investing into different cryptos.",

In my opinion, Gala is a very good project, while other game blockchain projects are busy developing their own games, Gala is actually developing a platform/ecosystem for blockchain-based games.Since the first time the $GALA token launched, it has made ATH at a price of $0.83 or around 7000% ROI. Also don't forget that the founder of this Gala is Eric Schiermeyer, he is one of the founders of Zynga (if you play Facebook games, you must know about this developer).Overall, I think that Gala is a very potential project for long-term investment.",
