  "content": "22nd May is widely esteemed in the bitcoin network as it has found its place in the history. It was actually the day the famous and innocent looking Laszlo Hanyecz bought 2 pizzas with his bitcoin (10,000 btc).While I have listened the interview of Laszlo and he did confirm and reaffirm that he has no regret giving out his bitcoins as high as 10,000 of it just for 2 pizzas. In his words he said \"Someone has to start it all\". Congratulations to him that he started it.That being said, my emphasis is on how Laszlo saw and valued his bitcoin as of then. Obviously he had more than 10,000 bitcoin for him to offer to buy. I don't think he bought with his whole bitcoin. Meanwhile I read somewhere that Laszlo earned upto 100,000 bitcoin while mining with other early progrmmers and adopters of bitcoin. I believe that Laszlo saw his 10,000 bitcoin as $41 and not as 10,000 BTC.  AND that is how many of us see bitcoin today and including myself. In 10yrs time, we could have thousands of Laszlos among bitcoiners, but the difference is that we won't make history as Laszlo did.",

      "body": "How one sees Bitcoin is useless except it gets traded for something else. At the time, 2 pizzas was approximately worth 10,000 bitcoins, today, 2 pizzas are worth a couple of sats or one-seventh of one Bitcoin. Ten years from now, it might be worth 1 sat or less.The value is still very much speculative, but it's those that are willing to use it as a currency that create inroads for more adoption.Quote from: Zoomic on March 29, 2023, 06:49:53 PMObviously he had more than $10,000 bitcoin for him to offer to buy.10,000 units of it, not it's worth in USD.",

When a man uses something as payment, it shows that he believes in it, even though Bitcoin has no value attached to it.",

      "body": "Or may be he never measured it in fiat currency at all. He might just have tried it out how someone would react to bitcoin as mode of payment. He ended up exchanging it with the guy which means either the second person was knowledgeable enough to understand what it is and might have taken efforts to install the wallet or app available at that time and grab the opportunity to get those bitcoins. They both literally done bitcoin exchange for the commodity and thus adding real value to the bitcoin. Just love it how they did it without even having greed for bitcoins fiat value. At that time no one really had an idea whether it will work or not?",

Because thou it may be looking too big for you today because of how it's value has skyrocketed within the past few years, but the fact remains that anybody would have done the same thing he did 13yrs ago by selling his 10,000 BTC for just mere 2 pizzas.So may I ask @ O.P this just one question.. Between 1 Bitcoin or $100,000. Which one will you choose??.. (I guess $100k, right?)So how about in the next 20yrs from today and the price of 1 Bitcoin may have skyrocketed to $1million per BTC, will you ever regret ever choosing $100k over 1 BTC?? ... Yes or No",

In 10yrs time, we could have thousands of Laszlos among bitcoiners, but the difference is that we won't make history as Laszlo did.Fine, it can be as you're saying, but what does it change? Should we never buy anything because it could be worth more? It probably will be, but we have our lives to live and money is just a tool that allows us to do it. It's all spendable and should be spent. To be clear, I'm against selling bitcoin for fiat, but I'm all for spending it on goods and services.Let me ask you a question. If you knew that bitcoin will appreciate 5% every year, so holding a million USD in bitcoin would give you additional 50k to spend every year, would you ever sell your bitcoin? That 50k of profit would produce another 2,5k next year and you'd have more and more money, eventually falling into a spiral of greed. What's all that money if you can't be happy with it and buy what you need? Laszlo wanted pizza and that made him happy. He also made history. Will you ever? Think about it.",

He made a post on Bitcointalk by Pizza for bitcoins? and one of the community member named as jercos bought him 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Here you can read the post made by laszlo says, QuoteI just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.Pictures: http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/pizza/Thanks jercos!Well reading this thread will give you goosebumps so read it if you have a strong heart hehe. The link to the pictures is not working on my side maybe it's invalid now. Well, all I can say What is not in luck, you will never get. There could be a lot of events just like laszlos but only the first one will be remembered same the first man to step foot on the moon is Neil Armstrong but who knows the 5th, or 10th, or 20th one? Only He who initiates is remembered because he is the one taking all risks and has to face good or bad consequences. At that time idk what he was thinking because he can buy pizzas without BTC but why he did that maybe that's the sacrifice BTC needs to be adopted as a payment method maybe that sacrifice kept up the trust of people in BTC which take it to the height of the $69k. It's like BTC needs blood and Sir Laszlo gave it.",

For sure he do sees with those amounts as $41 and not that 10k btcor something that mind off about on whats the price of it on the future.Yes, it does really give out that kind of regret feeling considering on how much the value of those coins todaybut well whats done is done and this one remains out to be historic on Bitcoins history which we know that it cant be forgotten.",

His words were important, because with what mind he bought and whether he kept hold or used for something else need to be known.

I believe he have more than 10,000 btc for him to be able to use it, means he spent little to see what the value of the others will be since a price of 41$ was tag as the value of the 10,000 BTC since that's what the 2 pizza worths",
