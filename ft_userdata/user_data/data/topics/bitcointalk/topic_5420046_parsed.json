Is solana going to suffer and what could be its repercussions on the whole crypto economy..Its just a smart contrat platform that no one is using. There is no big dex, not so much of TVL, not much userbase. Nothing will happend to whole crypto economy. Maybe people will be more sceptical about investing in shitcoins - which has net positive impact on market. SOL is only a overhyped, overpriced project.",

While the price of Solana has stabilized, I do not think that everyone will immediately start to sell the SOL because it will be an automatic collapse, and I think no one wants to go badly into minus. Therefore, I think they will wait for a more favorable moment to sell Solana for 10 or 15 dollars, because it's cheap, right? After all, and took 200, which means that the 10 is just free.

With all the investment they have gotten and all the big money backing yet they couldn't build a blockchain people can using frequently without any disturbance. Now that their biggest investors has been bankruptcy, it's just a matter of time before they start selling their Solana bag and this will crash the market more.Investors need to stop investing in all this over hype project that exchange force on their customers.
