  "content": "after my last two merit games cygan's 'Complete the Word Game and Get Merits 2.0' and cygan's 'Crypto Word Jumble Game and Get Merits 1.0', here comes the third edition of this very popular game to earn some merits.it is always given by me 5 words where the letters are jumbled. your task is to sort the letters and solve the searched word.example: ynagc (>10000 posts) - cyganthis time it is about legendary usernames that you have to guess. as a little help, i will give you the reference of the respective number of posts of the legendary you are looking forhow to get the legendary usernames, you have to find out by yourself the rules are as follows:1.   accounts created after 30th september 2022 are not allowed to participate2.   no cheating, editing, or deleting posts. posts can only be edited if a new post has not yet been created after the post (that is to be edited)3.   you can guess how many times you want, but you aren’t allowed to post again unless someone else writes a post.  4.   you can only guess each word once per post. you can’t provide 2 or more answers for the same word, but you are allowed to guess all of the terms.5.   each correctly guessed word will be awarded with 1 merit for the user who was the fastest.6.   lower and upper case of the usernames does not have to be considered",

      "body": "Another helpful thread of Cygan to distribute merits to whoever answer the word correctly. I thought the jumbled words are words you find on the internet but I guess I was wrong though it was when I saw the correct answers before I read the rules. I was kind of confused at first when I haven't read the rules yet but I do get it now. I'll wait for round 2 and see if I can guess correctly like others did. I think this will be also challenging just like the word game that Pmalek started before.",
