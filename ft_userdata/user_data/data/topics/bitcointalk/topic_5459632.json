He told me to not let any one walk all over me. Not to let any one take advantage of me. It was for him to say I need to be a man at such a young age. And I needed to take this advice to help care for me mother when he left one night out and did not return.",

I think we as a man have to develop a skill of \"white lie\", isn't it? hahaJokes aside, one advice that always stick to my mind is \"You have to have to be precious\". She was my lecturer. Moreover she explained that we have to be precious to be confident enough living this life. I'm still trying to make it happen tho, wish me luck.",

Ignore this trap. Inner peace cannot be attained by accomplishment. Acquire the ability to be at peace with yourself, regardless of your possessions or the opinions of others.",

It's like doing my best and let Him do the rest of it. So, if it's the best of advice, that's it. Because I have been in the lowest part of my life and no one has helped me but He was there for me.That's my belief and that's the advice that I've heard and I just obeyed and saw it with my own eyes on how He moved and did the rest. It might be crazy to think of for the non believers but it is what it is for me.",

Because at that time I was unemployed, I did a lot of studies but I was not getting good results in anything. Then I decided to get a consultation from a medical specialist. The doctor checked my blood pressure there he saw high blood pressure through ECG he said that my heart beat rate was very high. When he heard all the incidents he looked at me with bloodshot eyes and said in a very hoarse voice that you have a mental problem and you should see a psychiatrist. Your solution to this problem lies within you only your mind calms your mind and thinks everything is fine everything is fine you move on from here what has happened can never be recovered.",

Alway believe in your self and your dream and work towards it.3. don't listen to advise from everybody because most of them are not even happy you are where you are today.4. Mind who you tell your secret otherwise you'll become an object of mockery. The great Sampson in the bible was brought down because of Delilah due to revealing his secret. Secret is the weak point of any man or woman and not to be joked with. Many great men has fallen due to revealing their identity to their friends.",
