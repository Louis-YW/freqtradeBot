Who or what finds out that such exchanges were lending themselves for such criminal activity?Crypto exchanges are often targeted for shutdown by the FBI and other agencies because some of them are frequently used for money laundering, sanction evasion, and other illegal activities. Criminals also use different currencies to obscure the trail and then withdraw funds to various accounts. When an exchange too easily allows anonymous transactions or avoids KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations, it immediately attracts attention.",

Who or what finds out that such exchanges were lending themselves for such criminal activity?Sometimes it is not that the exchange is responsible for the crime but because they have failed to build solid security network, the government would interfer using the security operative to sanction the exchange and if need be of shutting it down in other to safe people from being victimized, of course there will be no injustice of it.Also, there are times some loopholes on the exchange linking to money laundering being masterminded by disreputable exchanges or their internal staffs being the architects of the criminal acts being carried in that exchange.So, the governments will have every rights to shutdown such exchange.",

      "body": "Yeah, its pretty straightforward why crypto exchanges sometimes get closed down by officials.  The FBI and whatnot have special units looking into dodgy money stuff happening online these days.  There are ways to track where the bitcoin and altcoins are moving.  So if some exchange isnt following the rules or people are doing illegal things there, the regulators will jump in.  I mean these agencies arent out to get all crypto traders or anything.  but they take financial crimes seriously with the rise of blockchain. and  If an exchange leaves the door open for money laundering or terrorism financing or whatever by not verifying users properly, its gonna get shut down.  Most traders just want a fair place to buy and sell, but some platforms enable shady business.",

An exchange allows you to deposit X coins, trade them for other pairs like Y coins and Z coins, and then withdraw both. If the exchange is decentralized and does not require KYC, it becomes easy to conduct these transactions anonymously, making it difficult to identify the owner or launderer. This is why money laundering can be easily facilitated on such exchanges.Quote from: robertcarlyle on March 09, 2025, 07:53:46 PMWho or what finds out that such exchanges were lending themselves for such criminal activity?Chainanalysis is very common, if the perpetrators address is already identified it's easy for anyone to trace its transactions, unless they use mixers and non-KYC exchange to launder those coins.",

That is users revealing of their personal documents (profiles) in the exchange platforms and thereabouts, users are not self custody of their funds because the exchange platforms does not generate private seed phrases for the users to be personalize of being 100%  in charge of their funds and privacies. That is why it is said that \"not your Key, not your coin\". Meaning your coin in the exchange is limited to give you a 100% self custody.As it goes. Scammers being aware to how the system works, they tends to target users storing their funds in there by cracking/hacking the security system of the exchange and steals holders funds.That o just to say the security system of the exchange platforms are weak to be compared to self custodial wallets.",
