  "content": "Hit 2 210x Plinko balls for $10 each and was only paid one. Watched the balls fall into each 210x... The game itself recorded it, but still wasnt paid. Messaged support and they asked for a video of it... cmon now. Then they said they would be right back with an answer. 8 hours later a new person messages me from support and says \"We have checked with our colleague and only 1 is shown\".... I literally watched it hit lol, and the game had it in the history.... Their history on the bottom didnt show it. Support pretty much avoiding me at all costs now.Screenshot of my screen:https://postimg.cc/z382Rgjv",

Not only it'll persuade your users to be well...more loyal, which in other words, spent more time and funds in your platform, it'll also helps you from having to handle similar situations in the future, especially as you've stated that it happens a lot.One thing that I don't understand though, so you found them doing things that against your ToS and cheat your system, abuse your bonus, etc. but later let them withdraw the money they got from it?Quote from: moegreen on January 10, 2023, 10:15:21 AMPlease note : Upon posting this thread the admin of 8bet.io has paid my withdrawal.

OP wasn't eligible for the bonus as it was created for old users. Still 'moegreen' has received the bonus by creating a new account. The user has also fulfilled the wagering requirement from the free spins winning, then made a deposit to enable his withdrawal. Perhaps, 8Bet team doesn't have any strong evidence of those account connections. It could be a reason for paying the user.",

Your deposited amount is 0.012 SOLYou do not need to be worried as the representative mentioned already on this topic that op deposited the amount which you have posted here. The claiming scammed amount might e the winning amount. And the reason for the amount is a misuse of the free spin of the site which was for the existing user but Op took that from the newly created account. As the promotion was through private message OP has no scope to get the link/coupon if OP had no old account. So, obviously, it is clear op is misusing bonuses by creating a multi accounts.",

However we will respectfully ask this user @SerhiyN3 to no longer play at 8BET and will no longer be welcome to the regular freebies.Just wondering, how are you going to ensure that @SerhiyN3 does not come back with multiple accounts to abuse your system and when you refuse him to withdrawal he ends up creating more scam accusations once again?You are going to keep receiving multiple scam accusations from frauds, and you will keep playing the frauds in an attempt to clear your name.",
