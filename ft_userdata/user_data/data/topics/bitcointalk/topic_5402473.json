      "body": "Yeah, remotemass I'm not sure how you've come to that conclusion, but your Math is wrong somewhere. Franky's above is technically correct, ignoring leap years etc. Although, even with leap years, your Math is still a long way out. Remember, that one satoshi is 0.00000001 of a Bitcoin. If you only spent one satoshi a day (which given fees is pretty much impossible) you'd take thousands of years to spend one Bitcoin. At the moment, it's not even possible to only spend 1 satoshi since you have fees. Maybe, if Bitcoin is altered to utilize further denominations in the future, it might be possible, but right now it isn't.",

I do like the sort of thinking that you don't require one Bitcoin. A lot of new comers to Bitcoin are obsessed with getting to one Bitcoin, and take its current price as still out of their budget. Yet, they forget that there's denominations like a satoshi. I wish, we could to some extent re-educate the masses, and get that obsession with one Bitcoin out of their heads. Although, it has to be said in this particular case one satoshi isn't going to get you very far in life. Certainly isn't going to put food on the table on a daily basis.",

And as the minimum for 3 years, 2 months and 1 day is: 365*3 + (28 * 2) + 1 = 1152, since a month can have 28 days indeed.So \"3 years, 2 months, 1 day\" is \"equal or greater than 1152\"  and equal or \"equal or less than 1161\",and so, 1 satoshi a second would be indeed between: \"1152 * 86400 = 99532800\" and \"1161 * 86400 = 100310400\" satoshi.Since the range is that, it seems quite accurate to say that 3 years, 2 months and 1 day would be: ~= 1BTC.Hehe, cool ;-)",

The current hodl line remains the same as it was around the end of 2013. In most cases you're way better off in a shorter amount of time.It hasn't been changed in years, but it will update automatically if the current hodl line is larger than the previous one from 2013.",

Seeing how much you've made in 3 years by saving a just 1 cent a day might be worth it if you're into projects and such. One satoshi maybe, but I think most users could save multiple satoshis a day. Even, if that requires purchasing them. Might be a good way of looking at it, since I find these days people are way to obsessed over buying a whole Bitcoin, especially those that are new. People generally either forget or don't understand that's okay to have Bitcoin in lower denominations than one. It's not like fiat where 20 pence won't buy you anything. 0.2 or 0.1 can buy you a whole lot of things with Bitcoin at its current price.
