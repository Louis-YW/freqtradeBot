But do not let OP think that it would take 10 minutes for bitcoin transaction to get confirmed, it can take just a minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, it can even take more than 10 minutes, 15 or 20 minutes for the next block to be mined, while also the mempool can be so congested to the extent that if low fee is paid, the transaction will not be confirmed for a day, two days, 1 week or more, the transaction can even be dropped and be replaced by the ones with higher fee.",

Even the time passed since sending the transaction is not just some fixed minutes, it depends on many factors (from luck to say so, since a block may be mined within seconds from you sending the transaction to even an hour sometimes, to the fee used for the transaction and the number of others' transactions not mined yet).But more clearer, all that matters is whether a miner has managed to put that transaction of yours into a block or not.Electrum will show that as confirmations. If (and only if) you have 0 confirmations for your transaction then yes, you may cancel it (meaning to send it to yourself instead of somebody else).",

Just that now, if a wallet do not support it, the transaction fee can be pumped using a wallet that support full RBF through seed phrase importation?...Since each node has their own mempool, the replacement transaction for a transaction (without rbf flag) will be broadcasted to the nodes that enabled full rbf and wont be broadcasted to those who don't.So if all nodes support it, it definitely can reach a pool or solo miner that supports full-rbf, then \"Use Replace-By-Fee\" setting wont be necessary.But from the current stand-point, it may take years to reach a consensus.",

The lower the fee, the lower the chance to include the transaction in the next blocks mined, the longer the time it would take for the transaction to be confirmed. With higher priority fee, your transaction has the probability to be included in the next block, while the chance decreases as the fee decreases in medium and low priority and the longer the time before it is confirmed.",
