Even in this forum I have learnt more about Bitcoin and I urge every one of us to deal with Bitcoin as it will contribute more value to us.I'm still at the learning stage of Bitcoin and one thing I try not to do is give strict or straight suggestions when it comes to financial issues especially Bitcoin which is very volatile bit since you're here, I believe you already have the primary knowledge of the journey you're about embarking on and the high volatility involved I will also advice that you take more of your time to invest in learning about Bitcoin and cryprocurrency in general because it is more complex than it seems and you should learn about keeping your coins save and always try to use decentralized exchanges and also remember to protect your key as there is a slogan that \"not your key, not your coins\".Always do your own research (DYOR) As no one will be liable for any mistake or loss you make.",
