  "content": "So I have been into crypto a while now. But I am the HODLer type lets say that, I have good amount of money invested and I just tend to read about news etc. But dont do it daily lets say that. So now I am trying to educate myself more and more crypto, and trying to learn a bit of spot trading. Now, that I have been learning more and more I see these groups or accounts which have a good community and offers a VIP program offering daily analytics, trading signals etc.So my question is...Are they a scam, and if not, are they worth it?For example I have been looking at this group = crypto.dreams on IG, has good amount of followers and account from 2016, which is positive I think... But its pretty expensive 250 dollars per month, which I am not prepared to spend just to find out if it is legit or a scam, so anyone has any experience with this group or any crypto trading groups?",

If you want to learn how to trade you have to put some effort into it, read books and lose a lot of money while learning so in the end for majority of people it makes more sense to hold what you have.",

There are many ways to learn and follows up threads not likely joining groups. You have internet and browser google and learn. But there are some genuine groups from you know the source and ID of the group but never discuss any private information with anybody no matter how close.",
