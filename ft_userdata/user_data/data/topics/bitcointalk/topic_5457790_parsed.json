He will be trending on the news, social media, TV and everyone all over the globe will have his name in their mouth and in their thoughts, as he is the most entertaining and popular president (candidate) of the world.This does not mean that we won‚Äôt benefit from short term action.In fact, more people will look for Trump related tokens as the market is stabilising more and more, as Trump is gaining more relevance and popularity.Why am I so certain about our success?Everyone here knows that I do not like mentioning other crypto currency project‚Äôs, so let‚Äôs not do this again‚Ä¶ üòÅIn 2021 Elon Musk posted a Tweet saying that he‚Äôd buy a dog called Floki.Remember what happened after?@RealFlokiInu pumped to an All Time High of around 5 billion market cap after that happened just because they were the biggest and most known project in the space with a Floki related name.#TrumpCoin is the biggest and most known project in the space with a Trump related name as well.This means that your investment in TrumpCoin is very likely to pump after Trump gains more attention in the world.Why would you invest now?TrumpCoin is not just waiting for luck or miracles to happen. We are creating our own legacy with the help of our own initiatives.If you remember the very first days of our launch when many other projects tried to copy us, you‚Äôll notice that they‚Äôre ALL dead by now.None of them survived due to them not being as original and dedicated as us.We‚Äôre persistent, hard working, transparent and backed by some BIG whales.Why do you think Venture Capitals approached us in the first place?They know that once #Trump gains more popularity ALL Crypto investors will look for a ‚ÄúTrumpCoin‚Äù so why wouldn‚Äôt they invest in the one and only TrumpCoin!!!Let this sink in‚Ä¶",
