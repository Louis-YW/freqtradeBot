  "content": "Hi EveryoneI recently signed up to OKX to use there arbitrage bot but because I am from the UK I can not use there arbitrage bot, after reading more about the bot I thought can I manually do the arbitrage on Binance.Would this work? andÂ  it considered as a intra arbitrage?Buy BTC on the spot market THEN Sell on the futures market. Is this a intra arbitrage ? https://www.okx.com/learn/arbitrage-crypto-trading-botThank you Andrew",

      "body": "It's simple, so if it works for you then that works. You could test that on your own. I've tried arbitrage before and those were like just a couple of times because the price fluctuates really fast because of what I've done before, it's like from exchange to exchange. And with the description that it gives from that article, it's from the margin/futures trading where you're going to do that. If you're not fond of it then don't do it yet because if you're not yet aware of what can potentially happen that means that you're just about to lose money for your first tries. This thread is also better to be in the Trading Discussion instead of Beginners & Help.",

      "body": "Hey OP, I'm not sure that you would be able to replicate everything that the arbitrage bot on OKX works. This is to assume that the OKX bot actually works and turn over profits, otherwise, you'll be doing all that work for nothing. The crypto market moves fast and bots are programmed to react to certain market events and conditions as soon as possible.My advice would be to just stop trying to be smart about trading the crypto market and invest that time to actually learn how to trade. This would be a much better investment of your time.",

One have attempted it before but mate, the fluctuations is at a speedy level that you need to be utterly fast to be able to take advantage of price differences between the different markets or exchanges.",

Also, you need be be certain your trading bot doesn't 100% empty your account if not functioning as expected! This is where the risk of all this things gets worse because you definitely needs to have funds on this exchanges, the exchanges are mostly centralized ones that go off anytime. So just like you said it will be better not to trust one of this exchanges but rather split the funds in different types. at OP i would advice you learn a lot about arbitrage marketing first before you put your funds any exchange, do not just believe the guide from this exchanges because some are misleading by looking so easy to understand but are not",

      "body": "I think that trying to make money by doing trading arbitrage on a crypto exchange through bots of the same crypto exchange is very stupid. The exchange will also see all your settings and therefore lose your capital when trading on the exchange, because trading bots work according to given rules and are not able to analyze the rapid changes in the market situation.",
