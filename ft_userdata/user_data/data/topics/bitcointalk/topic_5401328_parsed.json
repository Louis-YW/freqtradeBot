You lucky enough that it will go to centralized exchange you can ask the details of the owner however, if not like that. For sure if there is a service that accept this, he will ask for a huge payment. Cause its not damn easy to do that.",

You can hire a service, like the one in the first reply to trace the flow of the transaction, you would surely need legal support to be able to getvoersnal details of the accounts the bitcoins were liquidated into.",

One thing is sure, person with huge amount of money in their bitcoin account would never loose their keys so easily and secondly they will always keep multiple copies of the same secured smartly. This is why I remember there was one discussion recently where you should always split your bitcoin into multiple wallets and preferably keep decent amount on the hardware wallet. If it’s tiny amount then just forget about it, you will exhaust yourself recovering them. That’s because bitcoin is built on the ideology of security, and anonymous nature.",

Chainalysis is one of the famous company that trace hack Bitcoin but I doubt they will do the job for you because there client mostly big companies.Try your luck by posting your job offer on the services section of this forum.

I hope this was just for educational purposes and you haven't really lost your Bitcoin.  It was 79 BTCs     Even in this current Bitcoin price, that's in millions of $ now but was this hacked from an exchange or your personal wallet? Sorry to hear this but are you really trying to go through this effort just to see if there is any leading information or to realize back which I believe is the case, so, I would agree with @Henrobakkara that if the cost of doing this is right and hope the right person/institute are employed not to lose even more.",

You can, for example, offer a reward or define a fee for any evidence that can help you find the perpetrator. I suggest you consider using the escrow service from one of the respectable members so you can give confidence to potential investigators.",
