  "content": "Hey everyone, I am Rikafip, Legendary bitcointalk member. Even though I registered on bitcointalk in 2019, I have been an old school forum user since the early 2000s and interested in crypto since late 2013.Â  Regarding my activity, I like to write in many different boards depending on what kind of interesting topic I stumble upon while browsing the forum. If you want to check my more detailed posting habits, please check Ninjastic Space.Ever since I joined my first signature campaign, I've been a member of some of the best and longest lasting campaigns on the forum like Bustadice, BestChange and ChipMixer. Since my last campaign (whirlwind) suddenly ended, I am on the lookout for another quality campaign so send me a PM and make me an offer that I can't refuse. TermsPayment should preferably be made in BTC but I am open to accepting payment in other cryptocurrencies as wellI am not willing to change my posting habits and posts on boards I don't usually visitNaturally, I am not willing to promote anything scammy and reserve the right to cancel the deal if I notice dodgy behaviour.",
