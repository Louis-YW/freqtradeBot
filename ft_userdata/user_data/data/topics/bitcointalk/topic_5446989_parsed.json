  "content": "I have been using binance app for buying and selling of coins but I just have one challenge with this app here in my country although I don't know if its because am not too familiar with the whole app because I can't seem to find an option where I can move the coins (btc,usdt) to a non custodial wallet like electrum. I can only see an option where I can send the coins to another binance users which is not what I want to do. So l just guidelines on how I can transfer my coins from binance to electrum wallets",

Make sure you send to bitcoin, the address start with 1, 3 or bc1. Any other ones are altcoins which are just sidechains.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on March 31, 2023, 08:44:09 AMOpen your app -> from the bottom, select 'Wallet' -> Spot -> from 'Balance' select BTC -> Withdrawal, you will then get this dialog asking OrÂ  better still, do this:Open your app -> from the bottom, select 'Wallet' -> Spot -> withdraw -> select the coin and the image OmegaStarScream posted would be seen.

      "body": "Always remember when it comes to an exchange platform, for transferring your assets to any wallet regardless you own it or not, you will always use the \"Withdraw\" feature of the exchange. Even sending to binance user address is through withdrawal as well, the difference is binance can check if the wallet is a binance wallet so there's no withdrawal fee will be deducted.",

Using the lightning network would be preferred, but even the on-chain fees are better than binance's.Just don't use other networks (BSC, ETH etc.) if it's cheaper.

Usually, binance will automatically select the right chain based on the provided address but you need to double check it before withdrawing. Better be safe than sorry.",
