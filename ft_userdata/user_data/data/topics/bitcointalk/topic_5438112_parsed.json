They have a slightly higher house edge but they use parimutuel betting system which means you are betting against the other players which is awesome. I havenâ€™t seen any other casino using this system before.They also ask for no KYC which is another plus. Like I said they have a slightly higher house edge but the pros outweighs the cons so you are not losing much.Gambling has no cheat sheet. You are either lucky or you are not. If there was an easy way to get rich, everyone would use it.",

You can't really beat the casino that's for sure so my advice on what is the best way to gamble is enjoy every bits of it playing the games that you like not thinking if you are going to win or not. After all, that's how you supposed to play. There's a lot of casino out there with their own cons and pros and freetbitco.in already proved itself as one of the best casino in this forum.",

Anonymity is there but the majority of the well-known casinos do ask for KYC in the end, so take note. There are some that don't though no matter what afaik (like freebitco). Same with the casinos that strictly use them I reckon, except maybe a few specific casino games here and there, but nothing you won't find as well in other casinos.",

I'm sure many more of the best casinos are on this forum. You can choose one or even more than two casinos to start gambling. Those casinos have bitcoin as the main coin for gambling and altcoins for other options.I was wondering what \"cheat sheet\" mean. If you want to know how to beat the house, it will not be easy because the money you use is limited, while the house has many ways to beat you and take all your money.

And if you are trying to cheat it's not nice, to not mention it's illegal, you should know that.There is no universal answer to what works and what doesn't work in gambling, different personalities/skills/experiences, and different bankrolls make each player unique in some way. So if it works for one, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will work for others... and if it's not working for many it doesn't mean it will not work for you. I guess you need to try it and find out for yourself what's the best for you, what games suit your personality and your skills and knowledge.

As a gambler you don't need to play with other people's strategies rather utilize or generate your own strategy. That'll help you master how far you've gone in gambling. On the hand, online casinos seem to have got lesser playing ethics unlike physical casino that a malfunctioning machine can be to your own favor. I'd say, you'll need a good amount of bankroll set aside for gambling, before thinking about a means to cheat the house.
