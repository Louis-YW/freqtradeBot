  "content": "I don't know if a similar topic has been treated before, but am only looking to lay further emphasis on the terms verification vs. authentication and it is my concern to reiterate its importance and to distinguish each for the roles they effect in the confirmation of a users identity. For exchanges and platforms/companies/businesses using them to confirm trust, very good reasons exist why these verification and authentication are used either online or offline.As verification seeks to confirm who the customers are after presenting documents of proof like government issued ID cards, passport photos or selfies, addresses and bank details, authentication stands to ensure such customers only and non else, have access to the service being rendered or data/information on their registered platform. Authentication is in the form of login passwords to your account, 2fa authentication, recovery questions incase of failed login attempts.Having seen the progress made with KYC, it is clear it has ensured less hack and scammers and has reduced money laundering activities. The upgrade on this KYC in the future, may have to become more specific according to reports and might include details that bother on the users location, typical behaviors distinct to the user inorder to more effectively confirm ID, and may even have more advanced algorithms to deliver real-time verification results.For those who are seeking new ways to bypass the KYC verification on any platform, you are at the mercy of hackers, scammers and even the platforms, because they can fold up with your currency gone, and you wouldn't even know where to begin from. The government through its agencies might even use those platforms to track you down and if it is countries where it is illegal to own BTC or use some of those platforms, you would be in a big mess.Visit source link for better comprehension:https://withpersona.com/blog/identity-verification-vs-identity-authentication#",

      "body": "After every procedures to taking security measures had been put in place, we must verify before authentication takes place, verification is to get the centainty about something as being genuine, it can also be a means to scrutinize something for more adequate and safety measures while authentication means the confirmation made on what has been verified, it another means to endorse or sign in for something as not being a counterfeit, we can do this same things and make them applicable to our bitcoin and security procedures for maximum protection before using any means to hold or store our coins in them",

These scammers may even be within the company as staff. The assurance I have most times is that with government involvement in the form of KYC,  justice can be meted at these criminals, if caught. Also with its oncoming innovations, let's hope it does some good. Or would it just add up to be dumb?",

So, that it is easy and safe to make crypto transactions. I save all related data in pdf format in case of need at any time. If the user does not perform KYC, the consequence is that they cannot perform the WD process.",
