I guess you meant about legit bounty, right? If that's true and then you can find that by yourself. You wanna be a bounty manager but you didn't know where to start. Try to building your portfolios and reputation by creating a proposal that can be offered to the developers. If you wanna get a legit bounty and then you shall be active like discovering the legit project through various ico list site. This will help you a lot to do that.

      "body": "I have spent the last 2 years watching campaigns in the bounty section and reviewing the post history of many managers. Of course, I did not focus much on the managers I know because they manage signature campaigns in the main section that pay in bitcoins. What caught my attention is the presence of managers with new memberships or low membership ranks without having prior experience in running campaigns or having a positive history of trust in any way. Some of them are managing more than one campaign at the same time, and I wondered how these newcomers to the forum were able to enjoy the provision of campaign managing services, and if they were veteran members using new accounts, why do they not disclose this or how entrepreneurs can find them and Trust them on this same basis?I'm beginning to suspect that someone is offering campaign management services on other sites that aren't BitcoinTalk.",

You should evaluate yourself if you can manage a campaign, I believe that asking questions like this easily won't quality you in becoming a campaign manager. There are so many competitors in the market and there are some who is way better than most of bounty manager who is finding campaigns. They have there own weapons such as portfolio, experience and necessary skills how to manage the campaign right including on how to find a campaign also on how to close deals. Projects won't settle for  less, This is why I think those who are old or veterans in managing a bounty campaign simply is the go to of projects in choosing their bounty manager.",

This means that these points are determined by the manager based on the budget allocated to the campaign, or are they determined by the project owners.Also, how is the campaign judged as successful or not? For example, from the view of the manager, the campaign is called successful as long as it is in accordance with the forum rules and the participants are committed to the rules. And from the perspective of the campaign owner, the campaign should increase the number of people coming to the service. what do you think?Bounty campaigns seem more difficult to manage and complex to me, although I do not see serious managers dealing with them.When I asked about the programs, I thought of the participants in the Twitter and Facebook campaign, whose number sometimes exceeds a thousand. I do not imagine that the supervisor counts all of them. And so I imagined that there are programs that help him.",

You will never find the project winner because he is dead    But you can find the project owner. But a project owner usually doesn't waste time talking to strangers. If you want to talk about the bounty, you can contact the project's marketing department.  You can email them or find them on Telegram, Discord and other chat roomsQuoteHow to contact them If anyone knows, please provide the linkThere is a strategy and technique to contracting project team and convince team to run a bounty campaign with him. Which a bounty managers know best. And everyone uses there own strategy and no one will ever tell anyone's secret. So you move on from your own thoughts good luck",

There are trusted members who run Bitcoin campaigns and at the same time run Bounty campaigns for alternative currencies, as these campaigns contain rewards for participating in Twitter, Facebook, and others. Does this mean that they have software to help them perform their tasks or that they don't really keep track of all subscribers?The evaluation process is easy if we rely only on signature campaigns that pay in bitcoins, but it remains incomplete if we forget about bounty campaigns for alternative currencies.",
