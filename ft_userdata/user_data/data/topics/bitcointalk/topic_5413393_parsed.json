There is now a sweat wallet where users can move the sweatcoin they have been earning to. There is also news that some exchanges; KUCOIN, BYBIT, OKX, BITFINEX & FTX will list sweat coin by 13th of September (that is shortly) plus an airdrop for some lucky persons to their sweat wallet. If it turns out to be really legit, It will go a long way for the persons who will be lucky to benefit.see more info from twitter: https://twitter.com/SweatEconomy/status/1569367392052023296?t=YDqzit22uvR6hXtDhBEwPA&s=09",

The thing is people want to use an easy one so I don't think the hype will end that easy, they have tokenomics behind the SWEAT token which is interesting too. We may never know what might future holds but one thing is for sure, they are killing it in the present.",

Hype is not forever but the project looks interesting considering its current trend.You can ride the hype right now while the price is still cheap and while the price is still pumping because for sure if there's no development anymore with this project that is the time for its price to dump and many investors will leave this project right away. After reaching the peak today, now it's on down again so be careful with this volatility, this could be manipluated by the whales with a help of the hype.",

Well, the truth is that the hyped projects won't stay long and after this, a terrible dump is what you probably see in them. If you are investing in this project, make sure that you will sell them at their peak. Don't make to miss that time otherwise, your $100 turns to $0. Many of these projects turn into scams and many people become a victim of this trick believing that they can multiply their money by how many times and neglecting to think it was a scam.",

That's what we have seen multiple times in the past. A coin without any actual utility or no fundamentals are bound to fail. Till the time hype is there, market will respond to the coin. Once the hype is over, you have to add another coin to your deadcoins list. I personally have not less than 50 deadcoins in my wallet which cannot be sold anymore. Sweatcoin is going to have similar fate.",

Why are they risking money on something that he is not sure will succeed when he is looking for profit from what he is betting on? Investing is not gambling. Investment is an activity of investing money or capital for the purpose of making a profit, while gambling is an activity carried out with the hope of winning. So, if you don't understand the future of the project you want to invest in, it's best if you stop investing and look for another project.",

This question of yours doesn't make sense, nothing last forever if you must know. Sweatcoin is a project that is yet to enter any exchange, you can only earn some by using the app, the app looks 80% ready with constant updates from the team, there is a mini store where you can spend your earned sweatcoin on items. there is nothing much to say about the project except you can earn free sweatcoin now if you put in some effort. and as for last forever, I really doubt you understand what you ask.",

Like any similar hype. If you look at it pragmatically, as soon as there is a hype around sweatcoin or any other shitcoin, it is too late to invest in it. At the expense of people like you, the founders and early investors (insiders) will get rich. Will you get rich? With a high degree of probability - no, because the time of hype projects is short and you will not have time to notice how the price of sweatcoin rushes down.",

The project is absolutely nowhere to be found, nowhere to be traded, but it already has a hype? In terms of what around him, artificial or real, you can judge when he will fully enter the market. There are already many projects in the BSC network with the Move 2 Earn business model, but no one has repeated the success of STEPN. That there really was a hype that lasted very long, in spite of the bear market, gave a very good return on investment.P.S. To answer your question. Hype is not eternal, no matter how loud it may be.",

It won't last forever though normally we can still profit from it by utilizing it's market hype now. I've receive some referrals about sweatcoin three times today and I think many people are joining in because of their referral program. Haven't joined their airdrop yet but I see that the hype came from being listed on some big exchanges like Kucoin, Gate.io and FTX. It's a move to earn platform so I don't know what to expect from it knowing that many copycats have failed and can't rival STEPN.",

That project is just for hype and the same with the stepn that have been able to give that craze for walk to earn. I guess just think about your fitness when you're able to sweat and thought that you'll make a lot from this coin.I don't think that this coin is ever going to last longer because of what it has got. Project such as sweatcoin have been made just for people to make profit too quick but it's not going to be able to be continually supported by itself because models like this usually are just good during bull runs.",

I heavily doubt that this hype will go on for more than a few days before it slowly dies off again. I also noticed that sweat has a very large trading volume on Kucoin and because of that i did a little search what this project is and what i have found is nothing special that would justify that kind of hype in my opinion. I also read in their whitepaper that users of their app that is also running since a few months now or so can exchange their earned sweatcoin from the app into real SWEAT that are now traded with a 1 to 1 ration. I have not found info yet if this has already happened but i would guess that once the users get those free SWEAT the price will heavily dump because we all know that 95% of the users of those app are just airdrop hunters and botters that are farming those sweatcoins for profit.",

Well, what I expected from these projects, I actually didn't get the exact results from the projects. But I have to admit that this is actually one of the biggest projects, and obviously, it is also a financially strong project too. Just imagine a project starting their journey with the top exchanges in the market. So obviously, these projects get lots of attention, and more attention means more hype, and more hype means more growth. It actually disappointed users who expected it to begin its journey with a price of at least $1, but it is truly disappointing. But I believe it can reach that position very soon. It can prove that this is actually a great project. Soo, all the best sweatcoin.",

At first, I just simply use that app to walk until I get to the $400 threshold where I can convert my Sweat Coins to Paypal and also buying stuff using them as a discount. When they have decided to enter the crypto space, I didn't expect much from them because I know that the hype would not last long. I don't expect that they will be heading straight to the moon after listing to a lot of exchanges, and that's really true as it only has a $0.05 average price. Plus, we can only cash out 10% of our tokens during the TGE and the remaining will be locked for 2 years I think as what I have seen from various social media posts on my feed.",
