  "content": "Currently you need to sync a node and run several complicated steps to make a wallet for Iron Fish. There is a GUI wallet coming in weeks but it won't be ready for the April 20th launch. Fishguy (in the Iron Fish discord) made a light wallet to allow you to skip some of those steps and avoid running the node. His repository is https://github.com/hairtail/oreos-rust, please star it.I (Chs2 from Flexpool.io) have written this guide to make it easy to use. Consider joining our discord for Iron Fish information and discussion https://discord.gg/P9kXqQrpc8 and consider mining to the best Iron Fish pool, Flexpool. We're currently the only Iron Fish pool that supports Iron+ZIL dual mining. I've pinned a version of this guide that has pictures in our Iron Fish channel.This guide will tell you how to install Oreos light wallet on Ubuntu, Hive OS, and Windows so that you can quickly generate a wallet address and start mining. To send a transaction please refer to the instructions on Oreo’s Github https://github.com/hairtail/oreos-rust or wait for the core developers to release their GUI wallet within a few weeks which you can enter your mnemonic into. Please note that you mine to your \"address\" but if you enter this address in the explorer you won't see anything as Iron Fish is a privacy chain. You need your keys to view your balance.Ubuntu:Step 0: UpdateOpen Terminal then type insudo apt updateStep 1: Install Cargosudo apt install cargoStep 2: Install Oreo’s Iron Fish light wallet tool (Please note this was not created by Flexpool and we have not audited the code)git clone https://github.com/hairtail/oreos-rust.git --depth 1Step 3: Move to the oreos-rust foldercd oreos-rustStep 4: Install Iron Fish dependency./install_dep.shStep 5: Build Oreo’s Walletcargo build –releaseStep 6: Create your keys./target/release/oreos account newThis will create the wallet “address” you can use for mining and give you your mnemonic+keys.
