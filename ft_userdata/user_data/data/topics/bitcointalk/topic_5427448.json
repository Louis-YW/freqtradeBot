There are no such ASICs, because the risks of equipment breakdown are always present.And the more expensive your ASIC is, the more risks you have.For example, C9/S9 were quite reliable and maintainable, and even an engineer with very little experience could make a modular replacement and assemble one worker from two non-working ASICs. Some of my colleagues lost money because they bought asics, but did not install power stabilizers from problems in the mains. And in the village, cheap electricity and frequent problems with power supply. If you were my friend, then I would recommend that you buy bitcoin, because there are fewer risks.",

You can engage in modular repair when you have at least 15 ASICs and the price of the module and the price of its repair are approximately the same. And how many modern ASICs can you buy for $15,000?https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s19-xp-140thFor example, you buy 3 ASICs, and you have to wait for 2 of them to break, and halving in about 15 months.",

You have done good and not good at some points. You should have sold those miners that are much old and was loss to run. And also if you have sold all miners than you can buy Antminer S19 pro that can generate a decent amount of money too. And also Antminers are very very expensive and that's why I think that only Bitcoin mining is good cause in future it will give us good profit in next bul run.",

If the price of the module is approximately the same as its repair can't there be any improvised module that are compatible?. And how on earth can a single miner own 15 ASICs it will take almost an entire lifetime of mining. Mining will be challenging for someone in far away Africa because the will limitations of ASIC parts and it mean spending more on getting more ASIC miners to serve as backup incase of breakdown.",

Read maintenance and care tips and adhere to them, your ASICs may take a while to develop faults.I will be happy if I can find someone, in my state no one can repair Asic miners and you will mess up if you give an Asic to those that repairs electronics like TVs or Sound system, they will add to the problem.Not everyone knew about crypto mining here and those who are into crypto and Bitcoin don't even bother about mining, I guess that's because of the bad grid power, that's even why I set up solar power in the first place but thanks for your concern.",

As far as I know, there are almost no shops selling mining equipment in our area, meaning we have to go to other capital cities to buy them. It is this difficulty that keeps mining from developing in the area where I live.QuoteRead maintenance and care tips and adhere to them, your ASICs may take a while to develop faults.Stable electrical energy is needed in mining, room temperature also has a level that must be considered, if you use electricity from the government it is more risky for mining equipment, because unexpected power outages often occur, this is the reason mining requires large costs because supporting tools cannot tricked in any way.",
