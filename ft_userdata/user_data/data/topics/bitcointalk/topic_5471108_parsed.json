  "content": "all / most online casinos fucking sucks this days man.no tower or mines game ! (how come dude, you serious ?)and when they have it it's either1) thrash (poor designed / slow / buggy)or2) scam / rigged to death (have proof of that and will open a scam report about a few of them on scam report section soon, with live video proof again, and etc, when i have the time)a few examples of what i mean listed by the different casinos i played at, so far1) bc.game: buggy / poor designedclicking on one tile only will not reveal anything, and the mines will get stuck / will not display properly until you click on a 2nd minethen only after clicking for the 2nd time it is that the 1st mine will display.2) stake.com: the mines game is ugly / suuuuuuuuuuper shit man, one of the poorest representations i have ever seen.their tower game also just as shit as the mines i don't know which is better lolso i stay far away from this casino then.3) bitsler.com: the mines game is 36 tiles in total as opposed to 25x and it's also super shit / fucked up on the same level of the stake.com one which is absolute garbage.this one here is next to absolute garbage too.4) betfury: very decent representation of the tower and mines game, just that it's rigged to death both games are next to impossible to progress at all after you made certain amount of profit they will rig it / hunt down your $$$$ and leave u with nothing (if you fool around and let that happen)5) 500.casino: complete scam / rigged / manipulated (have proof of that) tower game and i'll post a scam report about them soon with live video proofs that they under-served my hands/the rng of the game was rigged to serve under fair results and i'll prove that soon once i have time to open the thread as currently i do already have a valid scam report going against bc.game casino.so not recommended to play here as well.6) bit kong: in my opinion the best & fastest mines & tower game so far. one can indeed progress but they work same way as betfury they will allow you to make significant $$$ and in between some rounds they might throw a 10x or 2x or 5x to your tiles/chosen tower, which will multiply your gains massively and put a smile on your face only to wipe out your profits and start rigging / manipulating / under-serving the hands with statistically/probabilistically under-fair picks for your results which will wipe out all your profits if you fool around (same as betfury)so my recommendation with this 2 is to make as much $ as possible and = get outbefore 40 minutes, because after 40 minutes they get into overdrive and start rigging shit to death and you won't win/progress anymore and it'll be just stress....7) chillbet (rigged to death) one can barely pass from the 1st tile on this one here it's totally rigged no chance to the player at all lol.... cbet.gg  very well done mines & tower games, non-proprietary/non-original, and just completely rigged as well, same as on 500.casino9) fairspin non-proprietary games/non-originals mine and tower games, slow withdrawals, high minimum bets, thrash rtp (close to 100% rigged) not recommended at all10) crashino should be called thrashino    lolllllllllllll as it's  complete thrash / poorly designed / buggy, not recommended.11) punt.com thrash / too slow / poorly designed12) Coins.GameWell designed/Well done game and also AVERAGE QUALITY OF '' FAIR '' hands given to player (not much rigged) but it's unfortunately TOO SLOW (no hotkeys) so not recommended at all here (and no tower game also!)and a few other small casinos that ain't even worth myself mentioning (cuz i don't remember also  )let me know if you guys know about = other casinoswith tower or mines games (or both) that i did not mentioned in here / did not tested ??please share here with me so i can go and test it, ok ?don't share casinos who don't have mines or tower game (or both) ok ?as this is the subject of the thread and for your information in my opinion a casino who does not have this 2 games should be called = thrashino (not casino  ) lollllllllllllllllin fact ALL CASINOS should have ONLY THIS 2 GAMES so that i could get BILLIONAIRE by ripping/hussling them offcuz every day i'm husslin husslin husslinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn",
