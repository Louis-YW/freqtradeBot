Not because of what that vlogger said. Because do you think that day that he made the content about the victory of grayscale against the SEC, there will be a pumping in the value of Bitcoin? Probably nothing will happen to suddenly kick the price of Bitcoin in the market, right?But if that content creator didn't show an article, I wouldn't believe what he said. That is why it is important that we always be updated on platforms that provide updates on the crypto industry, such as Cointelegraph and others, so that we are not misled by the news. Don't just believe the opinions of YouTubers; this is just my opinion.",

Most of them are there for profit making so they can promote FUD that can favor them. Some of them also promote some shitcoins they have an interest in. Like I earlier stated it is important you come up with a trading strategy through learning and research. It is also important to know that trading is risky especially when you are dealing with altcoins. It is possible to lose 100%, so those people might have sound trading skills but the market can sometimes make one lose all, especially with altcoins. This forum is also another good place to learn about the movement of the market.",

Although I can see some useful tweets on Twitter but which is not considered by me to be what I should follow. I am more of a scalper and day trader that exit the market immediately I have some profit and I wait for a favourable market with technical analyses. Example of the analyses recently is to open a short position slightly above $26000. If I should open a buy position, this would be around $25750 and if my analysis tells me to do so. With small amount of money, I also gamble with some altcoins.",

Bitcoin may be a failed investment, but it was not designed to be a wallet or an investment fund, but if there is a defective technical error in Bitcoin, then its value as an investment will be affected. Bitcoin is not a company or an investment asset listed in the stock market, so the development of Bitcoin is separate from the price, although the development may mean an increase in demand, which directly affects the price.",

Following channels for trading isn't a good practice because the information might be wrong and will lead you to loss. It is better that you come up with your own strategy if you are a trader. The forum is also a good place to gather information daily,but you should also DYOR,so that you will improve yourself in trading.

But people already have channels or sites where they get news about Bitcoin but with your source, it may be additional information for them.However, what influencers say on many YouTube channels scares investors, especially novice investors. They often say we must be prepared for all the worst possibilities of Bitcoin's movements, especially since Bitcoin's price is experiencing another correction.This makes novice investors unprepared, panicked and don't know what to do. I found a few influencers who could tell me what might happen and what steps investors, especially novice investors, should take.

By seeking a lot of information from various sources, I think it is necessary for us to gain broader insight so that we can make wise decisions in investing. They only make predictions based on historical or economic developments that have occurred so far, so there's no harm in considering analysis from YouTube and various other sources. Apart from that, if we only rely on ourselves, it is also wrong in investing, input from other people also needs to be taken into consideration.QuoteQuote from: adpinbr on September 05, 2023, 12:55:24 AMGenerally I’m just trying to tell you to understand that you have to get a particular place that you can hear the current news on the bitcoin market, because to my little knowledge that is what effect bitcoin either positive or negative.It's ok to always finds a means of getting updates on bitcoin news, especially for those into trading, we have to develope a means of being always updated from genuine sources, all these are part of what could constitute our overall experience in bitcoin always.The point is we really have to open up the widest possible horizons, learn from various sources, while there is a chance!!

The bitcoin price is predictable some times, but it's not 100% predictable. Even the best analysts can't predict the exact price at which Bitcoin will be in the coming days; they can only do their best by trying to come close to what the market will. Most times, their predictions go against them, which is normal as it's the nature of bitcoin; the price just happens opposite of what we expect of it at a time we least expect it to be so.Don't you think that it would have been a whole hell of a mess if the Bitcoin price was to be 100% predictable because everyone would have to follow the predictions given? Then we will be left with the question, Who will buy when the price is too high when they know what the price will be in the coming days? And who will be willing to sell low today when they know the price will go up tomorrow? Those are the questions we should ask ourselves.",

There is a difference between the Bitcoin signal channel and the Bitcoin news channel. Although I have not heard about the crypto zombie, but from your description and their first video, which I just watched, I think it's more like a news channel about Bitcoin, which is very necessary for a Bitcoiner to have a channel, site, or group where they know it's always flooded with Bitcoin news and recent happenings because, as a trader, you need to always be updated so that if there is any negative news about Bitcoin, you would be informed and trade with caution in order not to encounter a huge loss that you should have been prepared for. If that's what I think, a trading signal is not what any trader should just relay upon because the market is so dynamic that not even professional traders can make an accurate prediction about the market.",
