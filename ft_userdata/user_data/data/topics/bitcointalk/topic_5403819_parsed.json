Gambler can still be trusted as long as you make them liable and trusting your friend is a big thing, its not easy but its possible. Gambler should be more responsible especially on handling others money, if you don’t trust them then why give money to them in the first place? You should know the possible risk of this.",

So I guess for us we really need to be very careful about who put our businesses and money and rely them to manage it for us. Not just for gamblers, but for everyone because you really don't know, maybe if they see that the business is growing, they might be tempted to steal.",

And we have a old saying here that if you have a business, don't gamble your profits because you business will go down.Quote from: Rruchi man on June 23, 2022, 09:51:57 PM- Do problem gamblers deserve a second chance to hold a financial position?Everyone deserves a second chance.

I think a serial gambler like that has no sense of responsibility and should not be able to handle a company's major financial transactions or else.  An opportunity makes a thief as they say. Give it to them and you'll pay the price.Quote- Do problem gamblers deserve a second chance to hold a financial position?Yes if they were able to get some sort of therapy or have proven they're able to bring down gambling habits to a manageable level.",

In real life according to my personal experience, an owner will not do that by entrusting finances to people even though he is a friend. Previously will see a history of skills in managing money, well behaved of course and can be trusted, criteria for gamblers are not included in the list but I don't know in other countries.Quote from: Rruchi man on June 23, 2022, 09:51:57 PM- Do problem gamblers deserve a second chance to hold a financial position?Of course not, because he's still a problem gambler. Things will repeat themselves with every temptation of an unhealthy mindset, unless he has given up gambling and has common sense.",

If all gamblers had problems handling money, I swear gambling would've been banned long long ago. And I wouldn't really give a gambler a second chance, most of their bad habits come from compulsiveness and that isn't anything closely similar to a simple mistake, no, it's way worse.It's kinda dumb though how he recruited him based on friendship and not resume. It's all good to help a friend BUT this was a retail owner position. Friend or not,  they should've checked his credentials and work experience properly first.",

That is why when building a business, there needs certain attention and professionalism although they are our friends or even our family. That's why it is better not to involve friends or family in certain businesses if they cannot be professional. For, once bad condition happens, this will really influence the relationship between us and them. Btw, this case can be really a good lesson for us here.

But, if someone has been addicted to gambling, I personally will not choose them for the financial position because this is very risky to be like this case. Although not all gamblers like this, it is not working if we avoid the probabilities, isn't it?",

Just because the term used is \"gambler\" seems to me that you already concluded all as addicted and dangerous. What if that person is really performing well on that work? The second question has a clear answer. They should deserve a second chance as long as they are now a better person after being addicted to gambling.Personally, I have knows lots of responsible gamblers over irresponsible ones. They are losing big almost regularly but outside gambling, they are being professional and their lives are not that affected. We can't just conclude gamblers are supposed to be a big problem later on. That's wrong.In OP's story, I'm sure there are parts of the story that we didn't know.
