  "content": "How many of you are eagerly waiting for the next halving?The number of blocks remaining until halving is 66140. After the upcoming halving, the block rewards would be reduced to 3.125 BTC. At the moment the block reward is 6.25 BTC, which means miners would be earning just half of what they are earning now. At the moment the number of Bitcoin generated per day is 1075 and after the upcoming halving, it will be 537.5. The next bull run should be coming in 2024, I think so as after the previous halving we saw a huge pump. We should start accumulating if you have not or if you are new here and have not invested yet then invest in Bitcoin asap. As always do your own research guys. It has been three months now since I created this thread. Just a reminder to everyone we have 1 YEAR & 22 DAYS left for halving. The expected month for halving is April of 2024.",

I think the btc and crypto community have seen enough bear market that everyone is eagerly looking forward to a more greener and fun market. Things are relatively quiet and slow because of the market situation. And yes, I have been accumulating btc as much as I can because btc is the best crypto investment you can have. It will be sad for anyone who could not buy btc at this low price for whatever reason.",

This will take time mostly I noticed that after halving the price will go up after 3 - 4 months which is a good sign and it will be making new ATH. But only this data was in the previous halving and it doesn't mean that it will be rising again next year as we can't predict the future. It has a possibility that first time in 5 years it will be hitting its all-time low instead of ATH. We should just invest what we can afford to lose and let's control our emotions in this situation.",

Many are waiting as most believe that only when the halving takes place will bitcoin be able to rise again and reach a new ATH. But it can be seen that we are more than a year away from halving, so the bitcoin rally to 23k is something we should be very careful about, the bear season is not over yet, and most likely bitcoin will drop again.",

You can do DCA, and buy little by little, what's important here is that you have Bitcoin holdings and you can make profit out of it. Do not worry- what you are feeling is the good kind of pressure.Given the current trend of halvings and its past effects, expect the price of BTC to skyrocket in the market. While there is indeed that pressure of accumulating, it is the good kind of pressure where the end result WOULD most likely result in a profit. If you feel like you have to purchase and HODL, then do it for as long as you are using your spare funds for this.Before, I used to ignore every halvings and I took it for granted. Now, I will definitely purchase and HODL my coins to take advantage of its price increase on the market.",

Apart from waiting, I also prepared myself to be able to have more bitcoins by buying them some time ago when the bitcoin price was still below $20k.If you just wait and count the days without doing anything, you could miss an opportunity to buy bitcoin at a low price. Many predictions say that the price of bitcoin will reach its latest peak at the next halving. But we are still guessing whether the new price will occur before or after the halving occurs. And if you want to sell your bitcoins at the next high, you should be able to collect more bitcoins from now on.",

I don't mind halving, I'm generally neutral about it. But I think there isn't enough evidence to expect a bull run around halving. We may have a bull run sooner, in 2023, we may have its continuation in 2024. To me, halving it just an end of a cycle, an end of a stage of Bitcoin's life.",

This will take time mostly I noticed that after halving the price will go up after 3 - 4 months which is a good sign and it will be making new ATH. the main reasons are that industrial mining farms do not pay bills by the week or month, using coin they mined that week or month. they have better business models that that silly whimsical game of cat and mouse bill paying game..they pre-buy electric contracts for 6-24 months(ahead) at a fixed rate, meaning better bulk purchase prices than normally offered to monthly bill payersthis means the 2022 residential electric price rises have not affected the industrial miners YETso their cost average is still at early 2022 electric levels of the industrial grid priceshow they account their BTC cost is not done as a weekly/monthly event eitherthey know they will continually mine for a couple years at X rate electric. and their hardware they run for a couple years before selling second hand to then buy new gen efficient equipment. so they work in periods of 1-2 years depending on contract dealsso they calculate their costs at the start of the 1-2 years. and they then see how much coin they accumulated after 1-2 years and THEN set their cost per coin of that allotment. they are not selling the coins they just mined. they sell the previous periods coins (deflation means they profit by selling older coins first)so this is why, even though their coin production halved in:2012 the markets didnt shift until 20132016 the markets didnt shift until 20172020 the markets didnt shift until 2021",
