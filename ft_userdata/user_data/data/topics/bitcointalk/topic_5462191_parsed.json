The thing is, one shouldn't put all of their assets in USDT, it might be called a stable coin but it can be depegged and people hodling it will lose all of their money. USDT should held for only for a short time and afterwards it is much safer to either liquidate it to fiat or convert it to cryptocurrency that you have some control over, like Bitcoin.Quote from: Princess_Devi on August 05, 2023, 05:06:15 PMDon't say reasons that it won't happens, because I want to know if something this kind of thing happens in future what will you do? Of course it is something that can happen, other stable coins have been depegged in the past, and it can definitely happen to USDT in the future. As for what i'd do, i don't hodl USDT like i said already and i don't think it is safe for one to hodl it for too long.",

I really don't see any compelling reason to hold a significant part of my portfolio in USDT or any other so-called stablecoin. Wouldn't fiat be a safer option in that case?",

Diversification is indeed a key for you to be more safe but if USDT will reach that level again, I’m sure there will be panic and the market will go down again since USDT seems to be the basis of many. The market is unpredictable, you can also include the pressure from the government so if this will happen, just be ready for it.",

Don't say reasons that it won't happens, because I want to know if something this kind of thing happens in future what will you do? Of course it will put a dent on the market, as we all know stable coins are pegged 1:1 and we used it as hedge when the price is going down. And if the price of USDT is not pegged then it's going to be a concern for us as it will be very negative for investors.

I can't do anything except for the Tether team to return the price of USDT to 1 dollar again through the reserves they have, USDT has been depegged many times in the past, and its price fell from the price of 1:1, but this did not continue, and the price of USDT returned again. if this happens again in the future, all I will do is wait patiently. It is a big mistake to rush and sell what I have in USDT at the time of the catastrophe of the price collapse and the dollar depeg.Quote from: Princess_Devi on August 05, 2023, 05:06:15 PMIf you ask my replay to this, I can say I will ok with it. Because I put my 20% into USDT right now. Why? because you know guys there is an Old saying Never put your all eggs in the same basket.  Frankly, I agree entirely with you. Diversifying stable coins is an excellent decision. It is worth mentioning that CZ Binance resembles Tether as a black box due to the risks that arise around it, that it lacks transparency because an audit report has not been submitted about it yet, and that his team is in the process of establishing an algorithmic stablecoin and supports more new stablecoins to determine what will survive organizational matters.",

I had some UST deposited into anchor protocol from the juicy rewards but I couldn't sell immediately because there was an unstaking period so I ended up losing money from a token that was supposed to be stable at all time. I learnt my lesson and let my greed take control. With USDT right now, I'm playing it more careful. It has to be a piece of everything at this point.- USDT: Centralized and depegged a few times but always returned to peg. Sketchy team.- USDC: Have had huge controversy this year and depegged a lot.- DAI: Decentralized but DeFi is still riskkkyyy.",

No one knows, but I would not call it impossible as I think the governments are going to begin to attack stable coins with everything they have so they can try to force people to adopt CBDCs.",

If you have savings in USDT, you should convert them to dollars (paper currency) or BTC for security. You should only have limited stock in USDT for trading purpose.

If USDT goes down to 0.20 or 0.10, then this means that there would be serious problems with that equation. If Tether goes bankrupt but investors really can expect to be paid out eventually, the peg would fail but most likely the dump would stop somewhere near 0.50 or even 0.70. People would prefer to wait 5 years and get full value, than to get less than 50% now. Even as MtGox had terminally collapsed, the \"MtGox coins\" still were around 50% worth from the original value, as far as I remember -- because the investors knew that they could expect to get at least something back, and this happened finally.Big altcoins, and of course Bitcoin -- like you already wrote -- should drop also in the case of an USDT catastrophic peg fail, but probably mid-term not more than 50%. A panic dump of 70% or so could happen, but would be recovering as a new leading stablecoin emerges.Quote from: o48o on August 05, 2023, 10:29:48 PMBut i doubt that whole cryptocurrency scene would do that well as this would be worst thing to overall trust that's ever happened. It's likely that what you write won't be far from reality - I also expect a massive altcoin drop if USDT's peg fails catastrophically. But it would be somewhat paradoxical: Cryptocurrencies have been created to cut out all middlemen of finance. A centrally managed cryptocurrency would have collapsed, which means that there were some middlemen involved. Thus \"middlemen\" would have pulled down the \"no-middlemen\" finance concept ...Due to this, I expect that Bitcoin would be strengthened mid/long term, but centrally managed cryptocurrencies and stablecoins would probably lose a lot of trust. I expect Bitcoin Dominance in this event to go again up to 70 or 80%.",
