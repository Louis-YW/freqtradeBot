  "content": "Simple strategies for spammers looking for the lowest-effort process to just barely edge over the borderline of passable posts.1. Mention topic or keyword, even in passing. Prominent choices involve simple dis/agreements by quoting a recent post. You can easily rephrase exactly what they said - even if you do a shitty job, that's fine - as long as you add in statements about personal fallibility. If you have no knowledge of the topic, that's fine as long as you are equally generic and vague in your reply - make sweeping remarks as wide as your ignorance.Quote from: thread about general event with indeterminate knowable resultsMaybe it is possible that (the) [event] could [resultA/resultB] but I don't really know because it is a complicated thing and I think that maybe we might need to find a lot more information before coming to any conclusion.2. Personal anecdotes, beliefs, and questions are excellent padding material. Posing vague or general questions that have already been previously asked dozens of times in the thread can add nearly half a line's worth of words if you entertain enough turns of phrase or perhaps pad the question with nearly every random word that happens to come to mind, if that is so much within your very desire? One special trick that works everywhere is to ask for additional clarification, even if you don't need it or even if it's irrelevant.Quote from: any threadIn my opinion, I think/believe that [make something up, steal idea from thread] and personally we don't know what the future of [topic] looks like.I am hearing that [thread opinion] and I am wondering if [thread opinion] is really true? Honestly, I am not sure [...]I hope that [...]Can you explain more about [thread keyword]? I don't think I understand/we can make a decision yet.Do you have a source/link for what you are saying?3. If you still have room before hitting that golden two/three-line mark of golden post quality, try to look for more opinions you can recycle. Especially important is finding key ideas that you can reuse in multiple posts: vague generalizations of volatility or predictability, phrase-slogans like \"buy low sell high, it can be a lesson, DYOR, use the DCA strategy, nobody can predict the future\".4. Structuring your posts as if you were a child: typing along the multiple lines, adding new ones after every sentence or even partial phrases, and nearly breaking your ENTER key, these are ways to create the illusion of density.typing along the multiple lines, adding new onesafter every sentence or even partial phrases,and nearly breaking your ENTER key,these are ways to create the illusion of quality.5. Anywhere you can place an adjective, there should be one. If you cannot apply actionable adverbs to verbs, use probability-based (always, sometimes, maybe, possibly). Use articles in the unpredictable ways that you can abuse the articles, likely using the term of a 'the bitcoin'.With these five simple steps, you can continue posting with less than two minutes of thought between each of your posts.",

The other day I was looking at the post history of a colleague of yours and I doubted if he uses some AI to write or something. All posts in the gambling section, all 2 or 3 quite long paragraphs, and all full of the same pseudo quality. I don't want to make a generalization because I know there are people in your campaign who write pretty decently.",

It will not be difficult to understand a post written by a bot, especially if it spans to 2 - 3pages. I doubt bots can make posts that are somehow connected to be read. Whenever bots make posts, it's always obvious. I don't know if actually there are sophisticated bots which can scan through previous posts of other users and come up with a post based on what have been collected from previous discussion. Some gambling discussion posters don't have idea of what is happening in the board. They don't gamble and they know nothing about sports. Yet, they post total nonsense.",
