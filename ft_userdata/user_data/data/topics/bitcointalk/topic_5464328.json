Got me thinking – what's your take on this? Do you think there's a connection between Bitcoin's movement and these events? Curious to know what you think about the impact it might have on the Bitcoin scene.",

I sincerely doubt that any Bitcoin traders look and Nvidia chart, think \"this is good for Bitcoin\" and buy more BTC. Even macrieconomic news might not always move Bitcoin. And also any Bitcoin movements can be quickly reversed. So trading based on these \"fundamentals\" is not much better than TA.",

Traders are transitioning away from panic and re-engaging in investments, capitalizing on the market dip, which is the trend we're observing.However, according to this article the correlation between bitcoin and US stocks is presently going up from a negative correlation last month. If uncle Jerome's speech is bearish, this might cause a dump on stocks which might also cause a dump on bitcoin and much of the cryptospace. The small pumps we are witnessing presently might be traders taking a position before the speech to get ready to pump more if positive or to dump if it is negative hehehehe.Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 is 40% at present, up from a negative correlation in July. The increased correlation comes as interest rate expectations are being reassessed and economic conditions worsen in China.Source https://www.dlnews.com/articles/snapshot/crypto-prices-become-more-correlated-to-equities/",

      "body": "As others have said, not sure if there is some correlation about Nvidia stocks and latest news to the bitcoin market. Stocks and bitcoin could have had correlations before, but it's moot that we can't say for certain.For the bounce back to above $26k, I guess it's the biggest support line that's why bulls try to defend it at all cost pushing it at the current price of $26,430. And if we are going to correlate every news to bitcoin whether positive or negative, then for me it's a bad idea as nothing is for certain in this highly volatile assets.",

Curious to know what you think about the impact it might have on the Bitcoin scene.Not that really a fan on taking these fundamentals or news but everything that pertains about adoption and recognition then it would be always that a positive news and any acceptance and utility will really be that good for the market but doesnt mean that its price would follow along whether it would be on point significant effect or having no effect at all. This is why not all news whether positive or negative will definitely be making out some effect on the price. This is where people should really be in concern or would really be looking into. We've seen several news something like this about integration and adoption but it doesnt really give out that huge spike or jump in price.This is what makes the market more really that hard to guess if we are really just basing up with fundamental analysis. This is why it would really be just that wise or better that you should really make combine of fundamental+technical for you to have at least do know on what you should gonna do.",

Nvidia makes gpu's, and gpu's are used for mining, we haven't been using them to mine bitcoin for many many years, about 10 or so years, we have used it for ETH, but that is gone as well, so right now there aren't really that many places we use nvidia products in the crypto world, some smaller cap coins maybe. This means that if people actually still think there is a connection, they are wrong, but sometimes wrong thinking makes people buy and make the price go up, so that could be the case if this is the reason.",

Curious to know what you think about the impact it might have on the Bitcoin scene.Despite the inflation in the world and the negative news in the economy, Bitcoin has managed to survive quite firmly. Now, with every positive news to be experienced, Bitcoin will rise. I think that the environment that investors expect is starting to form. Bitcoin has been giving a buying opportunity for a long time and is waiting for its investor. I think it has been going very well so far, it is now ready for the expected rise. The important thing is a price increase that will come with stable and solid steps. I do not know how far the decrease in the current price will go, but when it goes up, we will understand that these days are opportunities for buying.I have no idea if Nvidia has an impact on the Bitcoin price. More precisely, it does not make sense to me to establish a relationship between the Nvidia chart and the Bitcoin chart.",
