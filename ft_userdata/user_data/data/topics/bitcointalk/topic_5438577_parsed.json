They kept building shitty weak houses and the inspectors approved these projects because they were also being bribed.Greed and corruption killed these people. Not the US or any other thing.Unfortunately for Turkiye, we have lots of greedy and corrupt people.",

Of course, the US has nothing better to do than use their secret earthquake machine to target random countries. I mean, it's not like earthquakes are a natural disaster that have been occurring for millions of years and have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy.",

The majority of them occurring in the eastern and western portions of the Country. But strange anomalies occurred just before the earthquakes. Leading many to question whether a HAARP weapon may have been used to punish the Turkish Government for failing to tow the line of NATO's New World Order overlords.These weapons of geopolitical terrorism will be able to mold the climate change narrative and bend Countries to the will of the New World Order as the target date of UN Agenda 2030 draws nigh....",

Since the US has weather and earthquake machines like HAARP, why aren't they using them on Russia? The reason is kinda like why we aren't in formal nuclear war with Russia. The whole thing is a chess game between two countries, and they play it where it seems to be best for them. Things like nukes and HAARP aren't the moves to make on each other just yet.",

The question is if the US is punishing Turkey for its support for Russia what is the crime of the rebel-controlled northwest area? These areas are friendly with the US and its allies, so what happened? I know they would say they were also targeted to avoid suspicion. All these conspiracy theories are open lies. Everyone knows that Turkey is sitting in an area prone to earthquakes and it is not the first time it is happening. People should stop using such tragic event to scare cheap political points.",

Much of the country lies on the Anatolian Plate, a small plate bounded by two major strike-slip fault zones, the North Anatolian Fault and East Anatolian Fault. The western part of the country is also affected by the zone of extensional tectonics in the Aegean Sea caused by the southward migration of the Hellenic arc. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_TurkeyI would believe the conspiracy theory if it happened in Moscow especially at this time,otherwise I go with factual info.",

This is absolutely wrong thinking and has nothing to do with what is going on in reality.
