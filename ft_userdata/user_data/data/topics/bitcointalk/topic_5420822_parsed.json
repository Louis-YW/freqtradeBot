Upset happens all the time. But why is it that it's Roobet vs Stake fight when they are just asking these fighters to promote them?",

OP is speaking in a joking tone and only in this specific fight, he is not speaking in general terms",

Many fighter becomes stronger after experiencing terrible defeat like GGG. I’m really surprised on the K.O result but I already noticed the weakness on Izzy right after he experienced his first defeat on the higher weight class. I think he should focus on his current weight and didn't spend time on aiming higher weight since his build is notfor higher weight. Alex P is verystrong and motivated on this match unlike Izzy that is just over confident that he can beat Alex.I hope that he will not loss his spirit after this upset lose. He can always have a rematch to regain his title.",

No no, there is no typo here.Hint: Eddie, Stake, you got it.  You can't take anything away from Adesanya he's been a great champion for many years it's just Pereira is a power puncher and Adesanya cannot solve the puzzle in Pereira I don't think Stake will drop Adensanya champions do bounce back and Adesanya will bounce back, it's gambling if Stake losses on Adesanya maybe next time it's their turn to recover their losses.I'm sure there will be talks about a rematch Izzy will have to reinvent himself, if Roobet supported Pereira than congratulations to Roobet.",

The fight continues until you decide to quit fighting totally The fight was a great one that we all had been arguing about of who is going to be the final but it is just too shocking to see that adesanya was not able to keep his belt which he had been holding for a long time. He fight was predictive and interesting with lots of punches against Adesanya which made him lost the fight with less injuries. I will be waiting for the next fight that will come between the two warriors to see if Adesanya will he able to reclaim his belt from Pereira.",

Though he is a weight bully so maintaining his reach on a person his size or taller is always his problem. Regardless, they both fought well and should be credited for that whether you are an Izzy or Pereira fan.",

I expect him next time to have a wrestle-heavy game plan going into the rematch. The dude has been on top for 4years and cleared the division twice. So I think it's about time. The division needed a shakeup. Although we hope to see him bounce back stronger for a rematch.In other words, Drake loses a whooping $2m on him. He betted for Adesanya to win against Pierre.",

So far Adesanya has punished every other trash talker. This is first loss in MMA career, so it is to early to call him a keyboard warrior. Dont forget, that that \"keyboard warrior\" was winning that fight, and if Pereira hasnt risked, he would have lost by UD.",
