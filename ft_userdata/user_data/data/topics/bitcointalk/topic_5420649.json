There are millions of eyes on the RNRAND/RDSEED where a specialized piece of equipment does not that kind of review.Yes it's open source AND YOU CAN BUILD YOU OWN. But, buying it off the shelf you never know what is really going on. And since it's linked to a shopify store to buy you are giving up your privacy since you can't pay by cypto there.Also, it's programmer has been out of stock since what looks like 2017, so you can't even put your own firmware on the device.You want random, go buy some dice.-Dave",
