If not, I can only imagine how hectic updating the table manually would be with so many matches taking place at once. Although I won't say it's bad, I will say that it's commendable given the time and work you put into it. At least we can view the upcoming game's schedule as the discussion is taking place.",

At least this will be a space for us to predict the future of the club. Let me know if there are suggestions that can improve the update method.That's very much appreciated.",

The thread could only be interesting if Moeda really manages to update scores in real time because it would allow people to come here to comment matches in live.That's surprising you are not able to see if a thread is self-moderated or not while being hero member but I can confirm you it's not.",
