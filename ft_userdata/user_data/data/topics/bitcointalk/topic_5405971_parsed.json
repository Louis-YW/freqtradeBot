I had fun watching them despite all that. Drake is known for betting huge amount and still cool even before the partnership. But not that level on the video because that absurd amount of bet because his not worth is just around 250M while he is betting almost 1M per bet which is insane considering it’s just a roulette and some table games.I believe most of his balance at that game is all sponsored including the giveaways because Drake is not a charity to giveaway that huge amount no string attached while losing big time at the same time.",

It looks like that his contract with stake is to stop streaming when the balance was zero or hit a certain profit quota. Haha.I was wondering what platform does he do livestream? I’m sure that the OP video is just reupload while I’m not a regular player at stake to get the real source for this giveaway. Just trying my luck next time participate on his next giveaway.",

Other than that, ofcourse if the guy is going to continue playing, he would loose it, he should have packed it all up when he won that much, it was already so lucky insted he kept playing but I do understand that the casino 'Stake' would have paid more than that amount to him or given him free spins or whatever so there is no way that he lost any money but it was still good to watch.",

Stake does really know on how to play the game on this industry.They dont mind if they would spend up millions if they do know that they could potentially earn more if they did that but of course its not guaranteed but with those known personalities and celebs then its really on high chance.",

Apart from the affiliate program, bonuses, promotions that are already on paper, I think they are all quite reasonable and have indeed succeeded in attracting Drake's followers on all of his social media. A marketing strategy that has been planned from the start and of course not a few followers will make bets in the same place.",

Even the casino agent isn't left out on the chills for drake. Talking about chocolate milk and shits, lol... Well, I must say what i like the most is the attitude he takes towards it as losing didn't matter much despite the huge stakes well, he has the money and his pattern of taking bets follows a repeated format and same amount in stakes everytime. Its cool and he got a 12 from the piece I watched. Sure this isn't som promotion, maybe not but drake and stakes are getting hopes up.",

That is definitely right, that is a business, and being a streamer that has a ton of followers should do something more fun and entertain as long as he has content to show for the sake of his followers.

Dont know but im not really convinced on what Stunna said, we do have our own views and opinions though but reputation/popularityalone is something that could be monetized by someone like Drake even he earns millions of dollars then he wont deny easily on getting more income out of advertisement since he know thathe's capable on bringing lots of people to be aware of Stake site existence which would probably bring profits on the platform itself.If Stunna said that about that matter then its up to us whether we do believe it or not and i do agree on what most people been saying on here which its all about business.",
