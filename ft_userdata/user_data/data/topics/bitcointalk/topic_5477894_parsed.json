I've been trying some testnet nodes and they are frequently sending updates, I was worried about the system security because even after installing all those updates, the system was not behaving smoothly.Anyway, it's about the ledger, hmm other reliable options are compared to the legder because the update you've mentioned was briefly covered in many topics here, At that time as well people were moving from the ledger. I think Trezor is one of the renowned ones.",

However, I hope they will take all the necessary measures to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. If this issue persists, it could damage the reputation of the company.

Do you feel safe storing your crypto this way?I think this one of the last stroke for people using Ledger hardware wallets, they might not be affected yet especially people storing only bitcoin but what happens next? Their new recovery policy was already a warning and after this I would say people should be careful about the product. QuoteLedger needs to be open sourced and the chances of this happening will be lower, however since they are for profit they obviously aren’t going to do that. They have actually opted to go for open source after the recovery saga and many users complained I don’t know if they have implemented it or not but still that won’t bring back the trust that has already been broken. QuoteBest cold storage these days is anything that is open sourced. Not that open source wallet are even 100% temper proof from hacks even the likes of Trezor still have there vulnerabilities although with the code public users who are tech savvy can easily dictate a back door even though not all. I will consider a cold wallet set up by me personally on an airgap device more secure this days.",

I have been seeing that news on many Telegram channels that I have subscribed and other social media platforms are also reporting that news. If that's the case then one should be careful with the Ledger wallet. That's why I always recommend everyone to use open-source software base wallet instead of relying on hardware wallets. The open-source software wallets are much secure as compare to the hardware wallets and I believe the ones who rely on hardware wallets can be huge troubles. Trusting someone's hardware is a risky thing and that's why I believe software based personal wallets works like a charm. I would prefer to go with Electrum as that's the one I use and I will always recommend it.I hope that users will be safe from this hack and they may not lose any of their funds due to the hardware wallet vulnerabilities. A reminder to those who save their Bitcoin on hardware wallets. Kindly, go with an open source software wallet and an air gapped system to be secure as a Bitcoin holder.",

The issue is related to their dapps software, not the HW itself as far as I understand it. Basically a lot of dapps use their connectkit to interact with web3 wallet and somebody managed to publish a fake version of it. While they've published the right version, people should at least their browser cache to ensure they don't cache the fake version. It doesn't matter whether you use Ledger HW or not, as long as your favorite dapps use Ledger's connectkit, you're at risk if you don't do that.Ledger should improve how they educate their employees since all of this happens because of a phishing attack, which in theory should not be unfamiliar for people who work at a crypto company.",
