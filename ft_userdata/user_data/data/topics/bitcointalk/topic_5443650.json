It may worth mentioning that since a bitcoin private key provides 128 bits of security, 12 words are enough.",

I recently went deep down this rabbit hole cause I wanted a deeper understanding of how seed phrases work. When you say that you \"picked out 11 words\", how did you pick them? Did you use a random word lottery? or flip a coin 128 times and convert that entropy into seed words? There are a couple of online sources that I know of but you definitely DO NOT want to use any online service to calculate your checksum word. I am in the process of trying to figure out how to calculate the final checksum word in a completely offline and air-gapped way that is easy for noobs to do but it is more difficult than I would like it to be. For experimentation and learning more about seed phrases and entropy, these tools are incredibly helpful.

Do not use them to calculate a checksum word that you will use to hold real bitcoin unless you understand the risks involved and know EXACTLY how to run these programs completely offline.Personally, I use a SeedSigner and either flip a coin to generate the entropy for each seed word or I just use my SeedSticks to randomly select 23 words and then calculate the final checksum word with my SeedSigner.I actually wrote a series of articles on 4 steps to secure your seed phrase and securely generating your seed phrase is the first step.Here are all 4 of the articles on how to secure your seed phrase if you're interested.- Generate your seed phrase- Write your seed phrase- store your seed phrase- recover your wallet with your seed phraseIf I were you, I would do whatever possible to build a SeedSigner to calculate the final checksum word. It's currently the easiest way that I have found to calculate your final checksum word on an air-gapped device. SeedSigner is also my favorite hardware wallet device because of how easy it is to broadcast transactions while also keeping the device completely air-gapped. I hope all of this helps you on your path to generating your own seed phrase as well as helping your friends and family to do the same.

Using electrum on a safe device (recommended to be air-gapped) is also good. Electrum is an open-source wallet and is secure enough.

To do so, go to console and use the following command. Code:make_seed(256)",

I will have to look into that further and see if they have plans to change that in the future. What hardware wallet/signing device do you use/recommend to all of your friends, family, etc?On a related note, my buddy and I were working on this the other day and he was able to successfully run this python script from GitHub (https://github.com/massmux/bip39checksum) with 23 random BIP39 words and the script calculated all 8 of the possible checksum words. I thought it was pretty slick. He ran this on his desktop computer but we have not tried to get it to run on any sort of air-gapped device yet. We have ordered some simple hardware for like $15 that we hope we are able to use with this script so we can get more people to be able to generate their own entropy with cheap otc hardware that is completely air-gapped. I am also working on how to calculate the checksum by hand but that requires some knowledge on how to calculate a SHA-256 hash by hand and I have no clue how to do that ...yet.",
