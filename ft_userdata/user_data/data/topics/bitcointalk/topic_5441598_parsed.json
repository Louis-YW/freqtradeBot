  "content": "Let me start by saying that the aim of this post is for educative purpose. Actually, I was browsing through the forum when I stumbled on an unusual user with the name \"anonymous\" without hypertext. There's no information about the account, it has no rank but a guest id or tag beneath the username. There is no information as to when it was created or last signed in. I've tried looking for information here about such an account all to no avail. Please out of curiosity I wish to know why is this account different from every other accounts on the forum?",

Well, they already answered it then I guess this thread is much better if it is locked. You got your answer already so there's no point in repeating the answer.",

Anonymous only appears in that thread.I think the OP of the link you provided is Lauda. I may not be so sure but Lauda happens to be the only comment \"reserve#2\". In the forum the topic creator always type reserve after creating a topic. But I am confused because the first reply that said #reserve2 should be Anonymous also.What type of situation can I face to ask the admin to turn my account to Anonymous?",
