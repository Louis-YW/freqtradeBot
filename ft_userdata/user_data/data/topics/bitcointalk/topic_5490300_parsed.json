Will it be lost or is it good to entrust someone incase I'm no longer there?If you are so worried about what will happen to your bitcoin, you should have at least one of your family members, spouse, child, or close relative who you can trust know something about your holdings. Give them a little clue on where they can look if anything ever happens to you. That way, they can be able to locate access to your holdings.  Or better still, you can slip your bitcoin holdings and entrust each of them to each of your close relatives. It's not good to be the only one who knows about your bitcoin holdings alone; no one is praying for bad things to happen, but we also have to take security measures. If you don't give anyone access to your wallet, and if you are gone, those bitcoins will be in that wallet forever and will be considered a donation to other holders.",

      "body": "The fact that it's required of us to keep some things private doesn't mean we cannot share some certain level of things with someone who we think we can trust, it's advisable that at least one of all your relatives, sisters, brothers children etc should at least know some things about you incase the unforeseen happens. There are ways in which you can do that, for me I have wallet where I'm storing some digital assets especially bitcoin and I have told my elder sister that happens to be more closer to me than others that I have so digital assets but as time goes on I will point to you some private key that is the password to where it's being kept with that I have created an awareness in her that something is somewhere with this combination of words but at the point she may not be able to access it. Just as nwada001 said instead of your hard work to be considered as donation when it could help your family, then you shouldn't keep everything away from them one person should be able to know your way about.",

I hope you don't get me wrong when I say free donation to other holders; it does not mean that it will be shared among others, but that particular volume being off-market circulation can have a little positive contribution to the price of bitcoin.   Just as millions of dollars worth of bitcoin have been sitting in some wallets for years, there are no outgoing transactions in those wallets. Any form of movement from a wallet holding large amounts like that can trigger a negative market reaction.",

That's why if you hold some bitcoin, it's up to you whether you'd tell a family member or relative that you own one.But you know at these times, it's quite dangerous to tell someone that you own and hold bitcoin because they might think of you as someone who's truly rich and bad things can happen to you like being attacked by a wrench or any other worst things possible.",

But of course you didn't want your assets to just sit there and do nothing incase you died right? so of course you should prepare a letter or statement where you can give the inheritance of your assets to someone that has knowledge about crypto and of course someone that will make your assets valuable and can make it grow more, or simply donate it.",

And about our holdings it better to  have a companion that know about our investment  cause there's a chance that when the investors died and no other people know about his/her investment then his/her money will remain his Wallet forever. And the money will remain untouched. But there's a positive impact if theres a family member who knows about the money of and investors cause  when the investors died they can use the money to sustain thier needs.",

Unlike regular bank accounts, Bitcoin doesn't have the same system for passing on assets. So it's a good idea to make sure your family knows about your investments and how to access them. You could write down instructions or even designate someone you trust to handle it for them. Put it in you will. Getting advice from a lawyer who knows about Bitcoin and estate planning could also help make sure everything's in order and your family can benefit from your investments if anything happens to you",
