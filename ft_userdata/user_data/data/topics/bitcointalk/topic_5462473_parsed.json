But apart from that,  if gambling is legal in your jurisdiction and you are happy gambling then I will say you can gamble with all pride because no one care about what you do and even if they do,  you are the one directly involved and you know what comes into your hand through gambling,  but in all we must do that in moderation.",

People waste their time talking shit about you? It's not like their words will be a problem for you. And also, keeping your habit known means that when it becomes an addiction, people can intervene and help you. I can give you an example of why you shouldn't keep your habits especially the destructive ones a secret, Hillel Slovak and Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers are both heroin junkies but Hillel wasn't as open to his habit unlike Anthony and so he's mostly alone when he scores which ended his life due to an overdose and with no help around him, he passed away.",

Those that keep their gambling habit a secret is it that they're not proud of what they are doing?.Sometimes the society dictates it to have it as a secret.For example in Saudi Arabia gambling is not allowed as it is considered a major sin but yet many people with VPN-s as with normal ISP-s there they can't,they gamble and they do not tell anyone.There is no real danger in telling there as if you are not caught red handed while gambling no one can harm you but why tell people something that in a specific country is considered as a major sin.Let's talk now in Europe,more liberal society than Saudi Arabia yet in here in 90% of countries if someone is seen gambling,deep inside the people have no real respect for that person and see it as some stupid or irresponsible person,so overall it is the same in all countries,gambling is not seen with a good eye.",

That's why I also agree gambling habit shouldn't disclosed to other people.Everyone has a different perspective on gambling, even a gambler himself also has a different perspective and goals regarding gambling, that's why most gamblers always keep the gambling activities that are carried out secret.You are right to keep gambling a secret from everyone even though these people are also gamblers because when there are other gamblers who know you are also gamblers and often join or gather together while one of them commits a crime then you yourself can also be dragged into the case because you belong to one sphere or group of those people.In the country where I live, gambling is strictly prohibited and there were several cases where a young man committed the crime of theft to make money so he could play slots, but unfortunately the young man was caught and several of his friends who did not know about this were brought to justice because they have participated in eating the money from the theft and winnings from the slot games that were carried out.",

But one should be ashamed of their gambling habits if a person is struggling to feed his family or always come up short with bills and always struggling to make ends meet or worse case scenario the person might be ashamed because of the unpaid debts he had while he's out there doing gambling activities LOL. Again, there's nothing to be ashamed of about gambling as long as you are financially stable to sustain your gambling needs. I only have one judgement for those who are ashamed of their gambling habits \"they don't have enough money to sustain their gambling habit\".",

Answer: No!It's hard to show people a habit of yours where they will 1st think that it is a bad thing. I don't see anything wrong with people gambling if they just do it with their spare money and not expecting some returns. I love gacha games which has a gambling aspect but I always maintain a budget to it and not go overextend to the point that I will have to use the money that is for the monthly expenses.",

Why would a friend discriminate because of gambling. But there are some of my friends that warn we that are gambling that gambling is risky.Quote from: letteredhub on August 08, 2023, 08:19:05 AM Those that keep their gambling habit a secret is it that they're not proud of what they are doing?.They can be proud of it, but they may not just want people around them to know.

Am keeping my bitcoin life secret because of security reasons not to be caught up in any cyber or physical attack because the idea would be that as a BTC holder am a rich person. But with gambling you can be a gambler and still be broke and fluke, cause it's not a means of income in anyway for those that understand.. There's no financial threat like it would be for a bitcoiner making himself open to public.",

With gambling what we experience is loss, we expect it to happen in favour of the ganbler and the reality is completely against it.

This makes people to be down and never want this to be known to the outer world.Next thing is the dear ones seeing us low after losses. During my initial days of gambling my gambling activities were known to my family. Those days I was in winning streak and the same kept my dear ones happy and we used to spend time gambling. Later I started to loss and my dear ones weren't happy and they were able to come out of gambling very easily. I wasn't and till date I continue to gambling and this is a secret from my loved ones.",

IMO, I don't really care what people will talk about. They can gossip all they like until they lose their voices but I will still continue gambling and won't be shy about it. I never kept it to my wife, she knows it and she also knows that I won't go far as being an addict. So why should I be ashamed outside while the people living in my roof already knew about it?",

Among gamblers there are many people who can control themselves during the game and have never had serious problems with gambling, but society often considers all gamblers as unreliable people. Of course they are wrong. I think you realize that I do not want to spend my personal time to prove them otherwise. Therefore, it is easier for me to hide from others that I like to gamble. The only important note is that your family should know that you gamble, because they are able to notice changes in a person in time and realize that he needs help.",
