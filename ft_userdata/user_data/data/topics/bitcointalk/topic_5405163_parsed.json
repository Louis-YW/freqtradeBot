  "content": "With the regard to the adoption of blockchain technology, the U.S. is not behind any other country, but besides that, when it comes to crypto mining it holds more than a third on a global scale.The share of the American hashrate has been increasing since 2019 when it represented only 5.3% of the global hashrate. The demand for cryptographic mining in the United States began to increase rapidly when the Government of China banned crypto mining in 2021.When it comes to mining, Kazakhstan comes in second place, accounting for 19% of the global hashrate. Canada comes third at 11%, followed by Malaysia (6%) and Germany (5%). All other countries where crypto mining is permitted account for less than 22% of the global share.",

      "body": "Where did you get these numbers? I see many smaller unused DCs converting to small mines. Just had another small one in the mid New York area start mining. Even with all the restrictions NY is putting in they are 100% renewable and small so it barely even made a blip, but they are there. In general it works out well for all in these situations. The miners get to move into pre-bulit DCs that although not ideal for mining are already there with the infrastructure in place. The owners of the facilities get revenue till they figure out what to do with them. Power is there, cooling is there, high speed data is there. Depending on how old the facility is and how much if any decommissioning work was done you have BU generators and some massive battery rooms still there and working.-Dave",

      "body": "I think that you need to update the numbers because mining is related to more economic things and therefore whenever there is an opportunity to mine Bitcoin cheaper, it is an ideal place for Bitcoin mining with the availability of cheap electricity, cooling, laws, low taxes, and finally access to a place enough to make mining profitable.Based on this map, the percentage of mining in the United States is 37% ( will not be accurate but away from what you saying)https://chainbulletin.com/bitcoin-mining-map/",

No way in hell that is accurate.Cambridge says this about Germanyhttps://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_mapQuote3.06% ** To our knowledge, there is little evidence of large mining operations in Germany that would justify this figure. Germany’s share is likely significantly inflated due to redirected IP addresses via the use of VPN or proxy services.Germany has had the biggest energy prices in Europe for a decade, there is no way 5% of the global hashrate would be there, and there is no way you would have 5% in Germany and less than that in Russia for example.Quote from: Husires on July 08, 2022, 12:53:27 PMBased on this map, the percentage of mining in the United States is 37% ( will not be accurate but away from what you saying) How is it away from what he is saying when he clearly saidQuoteWith the regard to the adoption of blockchain technology, the U.S. is not behind any other country, but besides that, when it comes to crypto mining it holds more than a third on a global scale.More than one third is more than 33% , you're saying 37% ...",

Not impressed, sorry.When we talk about the US, we do have some numbers, it's in the press releases of companies like Riot, Mara, and many more and in the cases of the publicly traded ones in their account fillings.Here is a discussion from last year, where I followed only those releases of the known actors and they had around 30Exa by the end of 2021 and with a deployment plan of 75 Exa by the end of 2022.Let's cut in the middle so that would make around 30+30, 60 Exa, 30% of the current hashrate.One clue would be the hash rate of the pool Foundry owns, this is a closed pool, it's opened only to big companies with a presence in the US, so you could safely assume that at least 22% of that hash rate is generated in the US by US companies.And of course, those are the numbers only for the big guys not the hundreds of small ones with a few petahashes of gear.",

Mining at break even or even a small loss and they don't care they are just socking BTC away.We see the pool rate we really don't know where it's coming from.-Dave",

It looks like US indeed took the lion's part when China sent out its miners, although I would not be surprised that - exactly like with Germany - some numbers are there only because VPN.I don't know if those big companies indeed have their hash rate entirely (or mostly) in US. I'd expect surprises from there too.",

      "body": "Most of the U.S. hashrate is based in just 3 states: WA, TX, NY. However, I expect that to change. New mining farms will be built in Midwest or Southeast states with cheap power. ERCOT power in particular has become much more expensive. So now second-tier energy markets are becoming more attractive. I moved to NC after I figured out I can get residential power for 7.4¢ (industrial is 6-6.5¢). That means it costs me ~$15k to mine a BTC with ASICs or ~$7k with GPUs (more risky).",
