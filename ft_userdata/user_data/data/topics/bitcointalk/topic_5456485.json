  "content": "Campaign Manager UtilityGitHub: https://github.com/theboxxob/bct-campaign-managerDonations: bc1p6yuzqkl5csrjgwqtzlws38css8ruasjdz6pt37drg40778e9rp0qjyku8hThe program is still in its very early stages and may contain bugs.I am proud to announce a software to help campaign managers here on Bitcointalk to do their job more efficiently.It is completely open-source and free of charge. However, donations are always welcome.The Python utility is aimed at campaign managers who manage any type of campaign on Bitcointalk that relies on their participants to make posts on the forum. It can support multiple campaigns at once. Each campaign contains information about participants that can be added and removed. New campaign rounds can be started by a simple command which will take the participants from the campaign and fetch their current post count, activity and merit. When campaign round has ended, the utility will automatically fetch the information again and calculate difference from the startAdditionally, managers can export round data to CSV.I would very much like if people gave it a go to test and let me know about any potential improvements or issues. Additional features will certainly be needed and I will implement them to the best of my ability but it will also depend on whether or not the project has users.A more detailed description of the program can be found at its Github repository.",

However, I have not had time to implement that yet.But your concerns are correct and at this time, it is required to manually check deleted posts and adjust them. But the idea is that the CSV file that is generated from the program can be easily modified.I will use it to manage a campaign soon but other testers are encouraged. As I mentioned, it's still new software and has not been tested in any real situation yet.",

I believe that you should count posts in a certain period, and not just by the number of posts. That way you would skip worrying about deleted posts from the past.Otherwise, how to automatically check the quality of posts, especially at a time when the use of AI is quite popular?",

Offline/local version might be exist, but i have no idea how good is it (if it's exist) or whether it need decent computer.Quote from: BoXXoB on June 17, 2023, 03:59:02 PMQuote from: robelneo on June 17, 2023, 01:57:51 PM--snip--Since you're offering to manage bounty you can explore and develop it in your campaign this is actually a good tool to add when you are offering developers to manage their marketing.This is the plan.In that case, you have plan to make graphical version of your library, right? Only few people would use terminal for this kind of task.Terminal suits my needs for which this tool was originally developed. Before considering a GUI, there would need to be some demand and I also have to prioritize adding a few more features and making the program use a proper database for robustness.PS. Integrating AI API would be a decent idea but then might need to use a paid service. Once again, I may consider options if there's a demand but I think this would require someone is prepared to pay me for the service.",

Let us accept this first in the future there maybe a way to check the post quality by either checking the length of post (post.lenght()), or by checking the amount of merits received by the post or how many times the post was quoted at the course of discussion.",
