  "content": "If you are in the military, you should pledge to the flag. Often the flag leads the direction into battle. But for kids and civilians to pledge allegiance to a flag... what a bunch of silliness! And one nation? The States are 50. They are essentially 50 nations. The part the Federal has is to protect them, keep them separate, and let them do business that enhances the people rather than hurting them... but to do it by staying out of their business.Why Patriots Shouldn't Pledge Allegiancehttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/why-patriots-shouldnt-pledge-allegianceThough conservatives will be most aghast at this undertaking, the open-minded ones will soon discover they should be among the pledge's greatest critics.Before I open fire, a brief explanation for international readers: The Pledge of Allegiance is recited by children across America at the start of start of each school day. It's also incorporated into many meetings held by federal, state and local governments and private groups as well.Standing and facing the flag with hand over heart, one recites: \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"A Government Loyalty Oath Written by a SocialistMany who consider the pledge a cornerstone of conservative values will be surprised to learn it was written by a Christian Socialist named Francis Bellamy, who was run out of his pulpit at a Boston church for preaching against capitalism, and who called Jesus Christ a socialist....I haven’t always felt this way. Conditioned by 13 years of public school, I continued sincerely reciting the pledge at various functions far into my adult life. Following my U.S. Army service, I’d even stand at attention with heels locked -- Bellamy would’ve been proud.It was only after learning the true meaning of liberty and the animating spirit of our system of government that my mind was changed. If your experience is like mine, once you begin recognizing the pledge as the authoritarian loyalty oath that it is, you’ll soon develop disdain for its nearly every phrase....",

      "body": "I do not live in the USA and I have never stepped on her soil. However, I have indeed heard about the pledge on internet. Reading the pledge it does not seem to me it is about an authoritarian chant which is supposed to be about getting rid of the individual power and autonomy of states but rather something which enforces that the states are supposed to be together to face any obstacle they could find in the long term and against their federal security, like \"we are together in this\" kind of thing. I have even seen conservatives on internet videos embrassing the pledge without any problem, by the way.",

      "body": "^^^ America is about individual sovereignty. Each man or woman or family is sovereign... along with and beside every other man/woman/family. Each sovereign voluntarily supports ideals that they individually hold. They voluntarily support these ideals with other people who hold to the same or similar ideals. The simple words in the Pledge, cause a person who recites the Pledge to convict himself/herself of their sovereignty... handing their sovereignty over to a government.What is a government? It is a group of people who have pledged themselves to ideals in some words listed in the government. The word 'State' really means 'state of mind'. It is written down in constitutions, laws and other documents, because people forget the words of their ideals most of the time. Government is simply words that maintain a state of mind.Wen you take a sovereign man/woman, and get him to pledge allegiance to something he has little knowledge about, even if he isn't serious about obeying all the stupidity in the government words, his honesty bends him in that direction, thereby eroding his sovereignty. If the Pledge started out by saying something like, \"I pledge allegiance to my sovereignty, along with the sovereignty of every other individual in this land...\" then it might be headed in the right direction.",
