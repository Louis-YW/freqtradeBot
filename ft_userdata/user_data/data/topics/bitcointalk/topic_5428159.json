Are there any like-minded individuals/organizations I can work on this project?In Brazil we also have a huge demanda for foreign currency, and for years the bitcoin was about 10% more expensive here.Bitcoin price was normal only when binance arrived in Brazil offering a good service. What is the price of bitcoin in usd in your country  ? Probably a little more expensive...?I believe the main cause of your country high demand for usd is that your fiat is weak, and your government probably created a lot of bureaucracy to make the process of buying usd very complex,  expensive and slow so that everyone just give up (unless someone is rich enough)Instead of making a project with the government and the central bank, can't you just offer companies a way payment processor using bitcoin ?",

We are still negotiating with some private sector companies though. Unfortunately we do not have a major crypto exchange like Binance that accepts payment in local currency in exchange for Bitcoin.The government, on the other hand, can afford to pay the higher rates for the crypto-based international funds transfer services to pay for fuel, fertilizer and other major national imports because the cost is passed on to the tax payers.",
