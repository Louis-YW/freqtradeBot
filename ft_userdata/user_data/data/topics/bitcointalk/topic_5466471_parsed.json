Not even those who are working on the correct resolution of FTX funds. In principle, it looks like this: There is a certain amount of coins and FIAT, depending on how many people stake their claim to it this amount is divided among everyone. So if you had only a small amount of coins/FIAT on FTX you will most likely be fobbed off with only a marginal amount. I have never been registered on FTX myself ... was it even possible to use the exchange without KYC?",

Any claim of a customer with an unverified KYC status will be deemed unverified and the Debtors reserve to object such claims on missing or incomplete KYC info.As I understand this, kyc is not required to proceed further to \"verify balance\" and prepare \"file your calim\", but it is necessary for it to be considered by FTX. so without KYC you can check how much of your funds FTX owes you, but without KYC you can't count on receiving them. In my opinion, this mechanism was created for those who have many funds on different exchanges and constantly transfer them and do not remember whether they left $50 or $5,000 on FTX.But first. Make sure its not phising.Quote from: adaseb on September 11, 2023, 11:38:27 PMDoes anyone know what this means? I would KYC if I knew 100% I would get back at least 50% of my funds. If in 5 years, all I get is 10% then they can just keep it and not going to bother with this.From what I remember, FTX had about $9 billion in client funds. currently it is said that they will dump about $3 billion woth of coins, of which $1 billion is worthless FTT and SOL, so it can be said that they will recover like $2 billion of which they will probably record 20% in their books as \"operating costs\". So in reality they will probably recover $1.6 billion of $9 billion, or about 17%. So I wouldn't count on more than that, and 50% seems unrealistic to me.",

Yes, it is the user's right not to include KYC, so you can skip this, but the problem is because KYC is needed to verify the user, meaning if you don't fill in this, the creditor can reject your request and not return your money.",

In fact, it's not that much of an asset there, I'll let it go.I think a balance of $1000 is big, maybe some people who have a balance on FTX that big will do it, but yeah it will go through a long process and this will probably take years.With FTX going to liquidate several other assets, I don't think it will be easy for customers to get their hands on them.",
