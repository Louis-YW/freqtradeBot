But there are also people who are here because the vision of Bitcoin and the ideologies behind it. I'd say most of the people are a bit of both, like decentralization and want to make a profit in mid-long terms.Perhaps the vision is different depending on whom you ask, but in my humble opinion Bitcoin being a volatile assest, coin or currency is part of its history and essence at this point. I did not meet satoshi but I would assume he/she could not created a crypto-currency both decentralized and stable, so he went for the decentralization (the important characteristic that make Bitcoin special). Nowadays, we have a variety of stablecoins that offer good liquidity and with the advent of CBDC's there will be more options to keep money \"stable\", Bitcoin may have not accomplished its original goal but it does not mean it has not accomplished others which are also important: increasing adoption, awareness, institutional adoption, etc. All this without changing its monetary policy.",

      "body": "A stable price is best for bitcoin in terms of mass adoption. Along with other reasons, volatility is one of the major reason why merchants do not prefer to accept bitcoin. Because the volatility can either give them a huge profit or they will incur loss. Every small merchants don't have a huge financial backup, so they have to roll their money within the business. The volatility is a major bottleneck there. So if bitcoin's price stabilizes, it will be great for mass adoption. Some miners will be definitely disappointed but largely, it will be great for the bitcoin ecosystem in the long run.  So if I could influence the bitcoin's price, I would push for stability over anything else!",

I would say that 95% or more people who got into Bitcoin ultimately only did it after seeing the price rise constantly, week after week and month after month, until that bubble got too big and it ultimately had to start bursting. Bitcoin is a currency, it is meant to be used to trade and that was it's original purpose, many years ago people started holding it up as some sort of comparison to gold - except it had no intrinsic value. Speculators blew up the bubble far larger than it ever should of gotten and now we're seeing it deflate as they all leave.",

For me thats the only way, because normal users are not coordinated.

I did not meet satoshi but I would assume he/she could not created a crypto-currency both decentralized and stable, so he went for the decentralization (the important characteristic that make Bitcoin special). He couldnt make bitcoin a stablecoin for obvious reasons but maybe we can see a stabilization from outside of the network later, like from countries or large institutions. This would have the ability to influence the price without compromising the décentralisation. Still this System would need price changes if supply and demand change, which I think is good since bitcoin is not a stable coin. But with large enough sums you could only find a level that is acceptable for the moment like it is done by every central bank with every fiat currency. The only options they would not easliy have is to lower the price by inflating the supply, which could lead to problems.",

In my opinion, stabilizing bitcoin is close to impossible. No central body that can carry out the decision on bitcoin that's why Satoshi made it decentralized. I think \"decentralization\" is the first word a trader or investor gets as an answer on bitcoin. However, if the control of bitcoin is in my power I'll rather leave it the way it was made. Or provide a means to stabilize bitcoin on a certain price for a long time such that the price falls in smaller amounts. A process that will affect bitcoin's price growth too. But, the world will love bitcoin if it rises too high and plunges afterwards. Than, rotating on a small amount of profits and loss. The market is filled with traders who are ready to take the big profit and scared of the huge loss in profit.",

The theory is that going forward, as the price goes up and Bitcoin is adopted by more people, the volatility will go down, but that does not depend on the decision of certain people, as it does with the ECB's monetary policy.",

Even the creator didn't know bitcoin will turn out to be like this. But that is technology for you, it can evolve to what you don't anticipate. So, the original idea of satoshi was that bitcoin will be a currency. Bur it's good we have seen it also as an investment opportunity. But 95% of the users of bitcoin are either using it as investment and waiting for it to appreciate or they are using it because of some kind of anonymity they can achieve with bitcoin. Others bitcoin of liberty to control their wealth, it is very few that is using it as currency. Assuming we are all using it as currency, we shouldn't be crying much during bear market. Though even in fiat we save but without expectation of increment. This cannot be said of fiat and it is a great advantage of bitcoin over fiat.",

Even fiat currencies are not stable, so the \"steady price\" is some fairy tale situation.4. Less wild fluctuations of the price are supposed to be seen as a sign of maturity and are supposed to happen in the not so far future. It's not \"steady price\", but still.5.

For those that want massive amounts of adoption, and also consumer confidence, a steady price is what you want. For me, I'm comfortable with Bitcoin being volatile for the time being. However, in the future I would want, and expect it to become a more stable currency. It's basically designed this way, as time goes on, and less Bitcoin is being mined, and therefore introduced into the network, the less volatile it becomes. You can almost compare block rewards like printing money off, expect it's already preplanned in Bitcoin to have these injections, and it gets smaller as time goes on, until it's no longer anything. However, for the short term while we do have these mini injections, we see somewhat the same as if the governments printed money off in fiat. We get a sudden increase in the amount of Bitcoin available, which theoretically pushes prices down, because while the demand might still be the same, there's ultimately more coins in the network. When block rewards are gone, Bitcoin should theoretically become very stable.",
