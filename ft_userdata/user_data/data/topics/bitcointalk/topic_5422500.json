      "body": "I also hate it when people start talking about some altcoin failure and switch to bitcoin, like it's one and the same thing. It usually goes like this: the founder of x cryptocurrency is nowhere to be found after a million USD disappeared from the ecosystem. Meanwhile bitcoin, the largest crypto is down 1% following the news about the scam. That's why I never talk to random people about bitcoin because I would have to explain that the crypto scam that was in the news a month ago is not the one that I'm buying. Hold bitcoin and don't do it on centralized exchanges. Remember that in March 2020 the price was 4k USD!",

Because there are so many other things we need to consider, rather than following an unfounded narrative scheme, bitcoin will continue to grow and we will continue to be left behind when it is not properly leveraged.",

But for the three questions above, I think everyone expects Bitcoin to continue to improve in terms of value in the market before the new year, because the profit after buying cheap is something that many people really hope for and it will also make everyone survive longer on Bitcoin. Now what about yourself? Do you also expect better things in Bitcoin ?",

I think criminals are now more encouraged to do crimes because of btc, not only because it's a valuable asset but because of its nature which is hard to trace. It gives its user anonymity. Like they said, once a criminal, always be a criminal. It is hard for them to change but for those who are not a criminal yet and planning to do so, I suggest they don't continue it because it is risky.We are now in the era where it's possible to survive even in the hard times because there are now new technologies which are invented and one of it is the cryptos and bitcoin. They can invest on it or find careers related to it. Doing crimes isn't always the first and the best choice to survive financially.",

I give advice only to those who ask me, and even then I emphasize that Bitcoin is not only extremely volatile, but also very demanding and sensitive from a security point of view. For all other cryptocurrencies, I emphasize an even greater risk, because most of them have no sense and no practical application.Here is my sentence :It doesn't matter what people like CZ, Saylor, Musk or Buffett say about Bitcoin, it's important that you understand it and use it as much as possible in the way Satoshi envisioned.",
