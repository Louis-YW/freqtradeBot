  "content": "BitcoinBTC price failed to hold the $24,000 resistance.BitcoinBTC price started trading below an ascending trend line.BitcoinBTC again declined towards the $24,000 resistance to show that the bears have not left the market just yet. The crypto market may be affected by the retracement phase as this market dominator-Bitcoin slips below the next important support levels.BitcoinBTC price appears under high volatility as its marking also moves up and down on a daily basis. Bears have pared the overall gains of Jan 29, and this could lead to further effective selling if a monthly close below $23K.https://www.tradingview.com/x/mYJrr277/The hourly chart is showing short-term selling as bitcoin price reached the 0.382 level of the Fibonacci retracement level (at $22,930). Notably, this retracement pulled it below the ascending trendline and the price action flipped the buy on dip strategy. Going forward, buyers may see a drop in bitcoin price at this rising hurdle.Although the trading volume decreased slightly, there is still a large number of buyers and sellers. Retail traders used to trade aggressively in the intraday trading session. As of now, there is no need to fear as the buyers have an important protection level at $23,300 if this lower momentum continues further.As mentioned in the previous article $24000 level was an important resistance for the buyers so they will have to cross this mark soon to reach $25K in the first week of February. The upcoming bounce back may increase the confidence of the buyers to maintain the bullish zone.Closing ThoughtsBitcoin speculators should wait for the monthly price close to create another open position. At this crucial level, the retracement phase is also a major concern and if bitcoin rebounds and sustains above $24K, the price is likely to reach $25K soon.",

      "body": "Yes, the current selling pressure is greater than the buying pressure. It's because Bitcoin has never fallen too far when it started growing this month. The fear among traders is that Bitcoin will take a step back and decline. So begin selling once it reaches $24,000. After the growing, this isn't a very emerge, though. Investors' minds would be bullish and push in that direction if Bitcoin exceeded $25,000. Short-term movement is rather positive, but it's too early to declare a bull run.",

Knowing this information would help the speculators, but it's crucial once to open a position earlier to maximize the market's opportunity. Still, it's always going to be a risk for sure.I would have a buy limit position around $25k because it might continue going higher if it went there.",

Just watch the 50SMA applied on bitstamp chart and you will know why. Its the first time we are below that for such a long time.Quote from: NeuroticFish on January 30, 2023, 07:59:24 PMWell, less than 1 month ago we were at $16500.

Depending on these we'll know if the crypto winter has indeed ended or there was just a fake breakout.2more days and we will have a more clear picture of the market (after fed rates decision) . Im sort of leaning bearish. Weekly death cross, monthly not so good (testing resistance), a little bad news can push us down hard to 19.8k support area next. Lets see.",

The retracement will happen but nobody knows how far down it can pull the price. For instance for the past 24hours the price have been slowly dropping but considerably still holding strong for now.",
