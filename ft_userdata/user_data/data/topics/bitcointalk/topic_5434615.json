  "content": "Before, I (founder of RC) begin writing this post, I want to say that it is not easy to find words to describe emotions like the ones I have now.I am scared this post might offend some people, hopefully not. I am sorry if I am offending anyone in any way because I genuinely want to help and this is the way I could think of with my limited vocabulary. As a creator, it takes lot of effort and commitment to come up with a project and build something. And then someone doing something like this to their own project and also hurting people's trust. It's unimaginable to me.   --- Overall, it's really disheartening to read and see what happened yesterday. I understand your pain. I also have a set of halving coldkeys and I was following the situation last night. Mine were not impacted (hasn't yet) but it was really stressful and I can imagine how all of you who were affected must be feeling in the aftermath.No words I say can help people. But I want to help the community because I cannot see this community being so stressed.So, to bitcointalk users** impacted, I will give away unfunded Orange 0.001 BTC coin as a way to help with the morale. Even if it is a small morale boost.If you are impacted, please PM to this account with your delivery address.This is the best I can do apart from wishing everyone that they stay strong in these testing times. Warm regardsFounderRC**T&C- Limited to 1 per person - Your account must be at least one year old with at least 1 positive trust rating- Please send some proof that you had the Coldkey (e.g. usual btctalk image with date, or add a comment on Cygan's post )- Limited to 25 people max.",
