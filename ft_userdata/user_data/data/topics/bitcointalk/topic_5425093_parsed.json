  "content": "When using an exchange, it is good not to focus on one, because it can be hacked one day, the money left on an exchange for trading should be an amount that you can afford to lose. While looking at exchange ranking, we know that Binance is manipulating all things, Binance or CZ is the own of Coinmarketcap which rank Binance as number 1, Binance is not ranked number 1 on Coingecko which is better because I have used some other exchanges which have instant liquidity to fill your order, with many altcoins of choice.Presently, I am having four exchanges, Kucoin is the recent one, the exchange is good, I like the spot trading on the exchange and I just do not want all mt trading money on just one exchange. I have Binance, OKX, Huobi Global and Kucoin now.But I do not like something on Kucoin, about their derivative trading.I transferred $100 to Kucoin, I used it for future trading, to open a long position with 2x leverage, which means the position opened supposed to be $200, but it was $167. If it is like that, the liquidation price supoosed to be far from 2x liquidation price, but the position liquidation price was the one of 2x leverage. In the other three exchanges I have mentioned, I do not noticed this, either 2x leverage is filled, if not up to that is filled as in the case of Kucoin, the liquidation price will be farther away from the mark price. Why is Kucoin like that, I see it as cheating.",

If you take a look at https://www.kucoin.com/futures/refer/baseBTCPosition, the position opened with a slightly lower fund so there might be some fees at play, but I doubt it would eat more than 20% of your initial fund. Better call for support and clarify it I guess.",

But I will try that again when I transfer money to the exchange to see if it is due to what you said, but I doubt that.Quote from: joniboini on December 03, 2022, 12:35:02 AMTheir tutorial doesn't really make it clear either, but I don't think that's supposed to happen. If you take a look at https://www.kucoin.com/futures/refer/baseBTCPosition, the position opened with a slightly lower fund so there might be some fees at play, but I doubt it would I do check all these but I think it is not the case. I will use Kucoin to open another position once I fund my account on the exchange, to make things clearer. What I do not remember is if I did not use 100% fund, I do change it to 95% when using market order for it not to bring error on exchanges like OKX, (but I do repeatedly do that until the money used is 99.99%). Maybe I did it like that on Kucoin too, but I doubt that I did something like that that I did not use up to 99 to 100%. I have closed the position long time ago, so I could not check again, but before I can come up with this, I think I checked the total amount of money used and the leverage it opened.",

Try asking on their Telegram or social media maybe, they are more active here. If this is indeed the expected behavior maybe you should try other platforms, asking for more than 10% per trade is quite ridiculous imo.",

I did not message the exchange yet, I want to see how the upgrade will be first.QuoteDear KuCoin Futures users,To further improve the performance of the contract trading system, KuCoin Futures has scheduled to perform a system upgrade at 06:30:00 on December 7, 2022 (UTC).It is estimated that the order cancellation will be available at 09:10:00 (UTC), all trading and order matchmaking services will be available at 09:15:00 (UTC) the same day.The upgrade will take about 2 hours and 45 minutes. During this period, the order-matching, order placing, take profit/stop loss features, as well as the auto-deposit margin and other contract functions on KuCoin Futures website, APP and openAPI will be temporarily suspended.During the upgrading, users canâ€™t create or stop the Futures Grid trading bots.

      "body": "I later deposited money today to try Kucoin futures again and see how it is working.I went for BTCUSD perpetual with 2x leverage. Because I used bitcoin for it directly as it is not USDT or any other stable coin like USDC, that would assume it being 3x leverage. Entry price was $16784Dividing it by 3 would give $5594$16784 minus $5594 would give $11189 which should be the liquidation price.Liquidation price on Kucoin is $11238 which you can see in above image in red. Very similar to my calculation. There would be transaction fee charges too which I did not calculate along.It is working good. I will still later try it for BTCUSDT to know how it is.",
