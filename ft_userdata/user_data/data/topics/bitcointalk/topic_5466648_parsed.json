  "content": "Scammers are all over the world and they keep using different method everyday to scam people. In Nigeria, most people have fall victim in one way or the other. Let's share our most painful scam here for others to learn and to avoid people from from falling into such scam. Below is my most painful scam:ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰This happened like 5 years ago, as a sport gambler, I got carried away by a Facebook advert that promise to give a fixed match. After seen some of their fake match winnings, I decided to subscribe. During subscription, I mistakenly made double payment. What made it painful is that I made payment twice to this guy after which I discovered they are scammers.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰I was introduced to crime alert by a friend. Crime alert is a branch of DHIL company that promise 30% returns on monthly basis on any money you invested with them. After much pressure by my friend, I decided to make some finding about them. I observed this with my findingsðŸ’¯They are registered company under Nigeria governmentðŸ’¯They have a famous, reliable,humble and honest person as one of their ambassador.ðŸ’¯They claim to fight crimeðŸ’¯They do things to support people's security e.g they bought patrol cars for police.ðŸ’¯They have been paying for years.All the above points prompt me to later invest in it. These are my prove of investment.Â Immediately after I invested, story start changing and it was later discovered to be a scam.CONCLUSIONScammer always look around for loop holes that can easily attract people to fall into their traps. They then sit down and take their time to perfect their plans. At this time where inflation is high and no much money in circulation, one needs to be very careful not to fall into their traps.",

Try to reduce your anxiety to make wealth or to become rich over night, I think one that causes this is whenever you looking at somethings and said \"oh my God\" this is a life changing opportunity then just remembered that this is scam falling opportunities at this point you may mind how fast and quickly you wanted to invest that site or platform. In general term, know that nothing good comes so easily whenever people promised you something first think what could be their benefits for doing such thing or for offering you something at a very cheap rate, then you will remember that there is something phishing around such things, do not allowed greed to engulf you so easily and quickly without having to think twice.",

Anoda tin wei dei cause dis tin na greed of our own people. Even wen we know say d tin dei too real to be true, we go still say make we try our luck to cash out sharpaly before dem go scam us.

Just like nwada001 said that those people be like who get PhD for psychology because Dem dey always know how to enter people. When them know say the update Don cast Dem change format. when MMM come people fall victim. And after MMM many other related scam come out and people also fall victim up till date. Those guys the dey take advantage of the hardship of the economy. Because people dey find possible way out of the hardship of the country naim make them dey fall victim. If you discover there way, what about the domb ones wey no go ever get sense?And moreover scam of this days dey Cary jaz. Dem go remotely control you ontil you don fall victim before your eyes go clear. The perten dey broad beyond your imagination. Them dey come as follows:1) house and land agents.2) Custom agent.3) fakeÂ  Visa agents4) fake prophet5) fake car dealers6) fake advert 7) invest 40k and get 80k in 45 munits8 ) get paid by doing nothing9) pos hacking10) fake sport subscription and registration11) fake business name registration12 fake navy, air Force army and Police form13) online recruitment for working in Canada Etc.there are many of them out there but this are the ones I can figure out for now.I was once a victim of number (6) fake advert. Phone of 80k was given an offer for 35k discount of about 55%. And I was so happy that the phone I was creaving for is now on my door step. I chatted with the admin he said yes that the phone is ready. Dey made me believe that it was delivery before payment for me to see them as trusted machants. After a week I still chatted. They told me that it's still available but I will have to pay part of the money that people who ordered for phone disappointed Dem, so dey don't want to be wasting tp. So I said ok I bergain price with them 10k which I sent. Dey received the money and later sent me a message that my goods is packed and ready for delivery that I should expect it before some hours later and sent me the number of their agent that is bringing it. after some hours later, the agent called me that he was detained by some cleaning agent. That I should send the remaining one to discharge the case otherwise the money will not be refunded and phone will neither come to me.Â  Hmmmm at this point I knew something was fishy. I call and call at that point I just knew I was scammed. Emagine those fools sending me Bible quotation that will make me finish what I started.. e no easy oooo.",
