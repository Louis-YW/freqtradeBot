The growing internet penetration and rise in the use of mobile phones among users for playing online games is increasing the demand for online gambling. For instance, in 2022, internet penetration in the U.S. was 92% of the country's total population. Furthermore, cultural and legalization approval, easy access to online gambling, celebrity endorsements, and corporate sponsorships are also helping market growth.SourceQuoteBased on type, the global online gambling market is segmented into poker, sports betting, casinos, and others. The sports betting segment is expected to gain a substantial market share in the forecast period due to the growth of the sports betting industry driven by the effective use of computers and cell phones to place wagers on sporting events.SourceWhen you summarize it, it all goes down to the \"easy access\" of the gambling sites in the world. Cell phones/smart phones - If there is no application available for the gambling site, you can always use the browser of phone instead, if it won't work in mobile view then, you can use other browsers that have the feature of \"desktop view\". It's actually easy nowadays to create a solution for small problems like this.Desktop/Laptops - According to ACS (American Community Survey) 89 percent of household today have a desktop or a laptop in their place. Internet connection is not a problem anymore because they are offering cheap prices for 10-25 mbps speed. Gambling sites doesn't need a super speed internet just to access it, most of them are text-based websites so loading a page won't be that long. Marketing - We can now see celebrities endorsing the gambling sites. Even our heroes in the sport can now be paid to put the name of the gambling site in their shirts or jerseys or if they want more money, they can use their tongue and say the name of the site. Sponsorship. Every time we watch a sports event, any sport, you name it, we see their names being flashed on the screen. According to the articles shared, sports betting will have the highest market gain in the next few years.What do you think?",

If online casinos and gambling on electronic devices have proven to be such a success, does that also mean that classical brick-n-mortar casinos have also their on online varians to offer their services worldwide? I ask because I have not seen any advertisement in the Bitcoin gambling community asking people to check some platform by the most famous casinos in Las Vegas, for example, the Golden Nugget.They decided not to go for this new market or I have not heard about them because they only deal with FIAT and are restricted to the USA market?",

Sports betting is already popular even when online casino is not yet popular. People love sports while having an easy access on sportsbook while watching sports on TV will be a perfect match.But I think live casino and slots will be having a momentum same as sportsbook in the next few years since they are the fast phase games which many gamblers typically wants. I believe sportsbook will become trending first followed by slots then last is live casino.",

People can gamble using the many devices they have and they can even gamble by secret, making it easier for people to gamble. That also makes the gambling industry big because the number of people who gamble is increasing and the money owners see it as a good opportunity to create a new casino that can provide the best service for gamblers.",

Celebrities are the most reliable place for promotion because they have a large following under their name, so companies are starting to see their marketing potential.The trend of online gambling will expand and this is in line with the wishes of many people, because when they want to gamble, they don't need a third party as a link and they can freely gamble without being known by many people.

Another as in line with convenience is being easily accessed to whenever time is preferred by the player.

Before we didn't hear about sports betting like we hear today. It was like games were more restricted to traditional casino's categories, like roulette, slots, blackjack, plinko and dice. Even in crypto industry it was a noticiable reality about 7-8 years ago, since we had many casinos, but didn't have sports betting as a hot topic yet.Then slowly gamblers started switching to sports, probably due to the belief they have superior winning chances when predicting events' results, instead of playing against the house on table games.The tendency is that sports betting gets more popular yet, however I must say it won't last forever. After the currently hype another one will come in gambling industry and I guess it will be related to video-games.",
