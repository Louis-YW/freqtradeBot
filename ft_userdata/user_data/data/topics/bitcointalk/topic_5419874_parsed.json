  "content": "It's no longer a rumor about the news of appropriation budget for 2023 Fiscal years dropping and many are taking to the. States house of Assembly for auditing, confirmation and approval,now that is not the matter,the thing that pist me made is that why is it that the states that are developing fastly with visible infrastructures and constructions always have lower budget than the smaller states that are not developing.It's true that Ebonyi and bayelsa are created the same year by late Sani Abacha in the year 1996 Oct first,but today Ebonyi is more developed than bayelsa.Now Ebonyi has 13 LGAs while Bayelsa has 8 LGAs,and looking at 2023 proposed budget, Ebonyi has 138b while that of Bayelsa is About 389b.And you noticed at the end of the Fiscal year,there will be no tangible project to account on in bayelsa rather than abandoned project,but with the little Ebonyi has,there will be tangible project to account on.Now in this case,is it the mis use or abuse of public fund by the leaders,or politics of poverty has taken it's place.please let's buttress on it",

If more money is equal to more development, then countries like Nigeria, Congo,Gabon and Ghana would have been well-developed. Effective and efficient utilization of both human, financial and natural resources is the pathway to national development. Bayelsa state have always had the most financially reckless government in Nigeria that is why they are backward infrastructurally. The State House of Assembly of some of these states are just rubber stamps that always do the bidding of the executive because they have been bribed. The Judiciary is not independent because they are financed by the executive arm, that is why they must always give the government favorable judgement. The common men are just living in poverty and bondage because they don't have a voice in the government. This is not just the case of abuse or misuse of public funds, but the rape of political power.",

      "body": "Let me start by informing you that every country has it own way of running their government because we all have different cultures all over and also the kind of leadership practice were different from each other, but I don't think there's a need to elaborating this much since we all know that corruption is something common to almost every political settings but what do these people receives at the end as a consequence to the act? many of them hardly faces the court of law because they will still use money to bribe those in charge to work on their favour and at the end of the day you discover a poor man stealing a bread loaf and been sentenced, each state has their their own IGR yet they receives monthly or yearly allocations from federal government but no difference with the bad road network, no free medicals, no constant electricity and no proper and genuine audit to how this budgets are being led to appropriation in full.",
