      "body": "It's normal thing because this is not the first time things like this is happening and issues are being raised and discuss about it for many times here in the forum. The bot is having problem giving accurate merit count some time but it will definitely catch up in the coming days. I have experience it before and even yesterday when I received merit too. You have nothing to worry about since the merit is intact in your profile. The developer of the bot is doing a great job for the maintenance up to the moment else we would have been missing some important updates.You may consider locking the thread since you received explanations and suggestion.",

      "body": "You can use the forum as your most reliable source to check your earned merit stats.Bookmark your profile page and check it anytime you want to see your merit. Even you don't log in, you can see the stats but if you need details like merit transaction, which post merited and from who, you must login your account.Using third party tools like Telegram notification bots or websites like Bpip.org or Ninjastic.space means some more inaccuracy or delay for updates. Those tools rely on their data scrapers in Bitcointalk. Sometimes data scrapers can not work or issues between scrapers and their Telegram bots.If you notice well, even earned merit stats in Bitcoin has delay visually. Sometimes it takes like few seconds (10 seconds perhaps or a bit longer) to update and show.",
