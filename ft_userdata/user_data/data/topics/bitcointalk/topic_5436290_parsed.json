If you have other better options you can add, I know of LCX which is better and I've already invested in the project, what other good ones you have in mind I've never heard of Chainge before. After checking out their website, I noticed that their daily trading volume is quite small, often not even reaching $500,000. Not interested in buying until they start generating more volume. However, I do think CHNG has a better tokenomics compared to WOO, with regular quarterly token burns. Also, WOO has stopped all burning mechanisms currently as they're revamping their tokenomics.If you're looking for CEX token, I would recommend going with Binance Coin (BNB). Binance has been dominating the CEX space with notable growth. According to CoinDesk, its market share went up to 67% in December 2022 from 49% in January 2022.For DEX token, I would definitely go for Mango ($MNGO). Yes, they were exploited in October, but all users were already made whole. They still have $27 million worth of USDC sitting in their treasury, which is more than MNGO's current market cap ($20 million). Additionally, the new v4 is already in alpha and they're also building a mobile Solana wallet, which is also in closed alpha. From my point of view, it seems like a no-brainer buy considering the $27 million USDC treasury they have.",

If you have other better options you can add, I know of LCX which is better and I've already invested in the project, what other good ones you have in mind For me going on with top exchange coins are the better and safer one especially they are been used for a long time and you can feel the benefit of holding on their tokens. Examples are binance and kucoin tokens, usually these have a lot of privilege if you check it out. Though the reward ratio for investment isnt that high anymore since its really far from new platform that has a very early price now. But the trust for these platforms are solid and gone too high now.",

MX token has an infinity total supply and its listed on very good exchanges also. But I suggest you buy on the MX exchange because it has good volume there and you can also convert assets tokens to MX token. My main reason is, MEXCglobal global might start working on thier own blockchain anytime and token holders will surely benefit from that.The infinity total supply of thier token is also an hint that there will probably be a MX chain as time goes on.Just search for MX on coingecko to get more info on the token.",

I guess it could be even more profitable for me if I sold when it was over $20. Well, the Kucoin price is moving between $6 and $8 for a while... I like Kucoin more than some other exchanges, and I will probably get into KCS again. I think it has potential to rise in the future.",

Woo is a good exchange site and the potential to be a big exchange site someday. I rarely heard people talked about change and investing in such token was biggest mistake that you can make it. You shall make comparison between both but woo token is far popular compared with chainge. I think that you can see that based on how many daily trade volume that owned by both. Volume means demand for the exchange site.,",

Yeah, there's the known BNB and many are invested on it. If you're for the exchange tokens then you should the one that has the market already and huge volume.But instead of buying them, why you don't want to buy bitcoin to add to your portfolio. It's the best choice that you can ever make if you're thinking about huge profitability because bitcoin is no doubt that's going to be profitable for the next bull run.",

If you have other better options you can add, I know of LCX which is better and I've already invested in the project, what other good ones you have in mind Sadly i don't own any Binance myself but i think most of us will agree that Binance is the biggest exchange with the most influence in the crypto space. For some people Binance even has to much influence already and i agree with that. I think it is never good if a single company becomes to powerful in a certain area. Also i think it is already pretty late to invest into Binance. For 5 years or so, you could buy BNB for 1 Dollar or so, so i always have a pretty hard time to buy it now for 300$.I also think, like many others in this thread, that kucoin is also a very big and also reliable exchange and it only has less than 1/50th of the market cap of Binance.",
