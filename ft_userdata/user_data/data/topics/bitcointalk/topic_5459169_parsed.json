I did made similar mistake today and even submitted one reply 5x but I deleted four and left just one.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

Donâ€™t refresh your slow loading post or else it will keeps posting new duplicate post. The forum situation is messed up.",

You got your question answered, so I'm not going to try to restate it but I just started browsing the forum a few minutes ago and yours was the first thread that caught my eye--so what problems are we having today and why are people trying to reply twice in a given thread? Â Quote from: dimonstration on July 09, 2023, 02:40:47 PMYou can always delete any of your post anytime. The only board that you can delete or edit your post is on Archival. \"Anytime\" doesn't necessarily mean \"immediately\" though, because as was pointed out you can't immediately delete a post in certain sections. Â Dr.Bitcoin_Strange mentioned campaign threads, but I also seem to recall it's true in auction threads as well (but I could be wrong, and to the point of OP's concern it probably doesn't matter much).Edit: LOL, I just had to delete duplicate posts so I see what's going on here very clearly.Â  Jeez.",

I'd our post is always been deleted then we need to ask ourselves a question because there might something we are doing wrong which we need to fix.Â In some cases if my post got to deleted, I do check to see if there is something I am not doing right that could have warrant my post not to be of the forum standard or if it contains derogatory words that can be very offensive to other people that read the post. It is also good for us to write natural posts so that people reading them will see it to be of an epitome that others coming up can emulate.",
