Apparently, the DeFi market, which lets people trade crypto without a big cheese watching over them, has turned into a hangout spot for sketchy people doing sketchy things like money laundering and terrorist financing.Now, the Treasury is telling everyone to tighten their belts and get tough on DeFi activities. That means making DeFi platforms follow the same anti-money laundering rules as banks and giving regulators more power to keep an eye on everything. They're also telling companies to keep the riff-raff out of DeFi services.But, let's be real here, all this regulation could make the already-insane crypto market even more bonkers. Who knows how the industry will react to all these changes and what kind of impact they'll have on the future of cryptocurrency.",

      "body": "I assume it was just matter of time before the Treasury continue to make noise about Defi. The problem is that they want for decentralized platforms to have some kind of mechanism to enforce their rules but we all know that as soon as those mechanisms and triggers exist in the DEfi space, those protocols would be considered not to be decentralized anymore and would not be as appealing towards legitimate users anymore.Curious to see how the Defi community would react to further pressure from regulators, if the DEfi community refuses to comply and does not alter their protocol, I can see the United States issuing executive orders which would forbid any American citizen from holding Defi tokens, do swaps or even provide liquidity to those protocols.",

Nobody has money for anything. Banks are failing left and right but they sights are set on Crypto. There are more important things that the US government needs to worry about right now.Like preventing the US economy from going into a hyper inflation state. Even though inflation has cooled, its still there. We got 0.5% MoM inflation, that is still 6% a year, far away from the 2% target. The fed should work on improving stability of the economy instead of working about crypto at the moment.",

Well, new technologies are coming to make it possible to deploy technologies even tokens on the BTC blockchain but that's just concepts till now, a topic covered by Charles-Tim-->If bitcoin go towards DeFi primarily, the possibility of centralization begins gives main ideas of threats towards BTC if DeFi is being restricted or treated with bad influence overall it could effect the market (BTC) but probably for the short term.

At the same time, their financial system isn't doing well. Has any government ever blamed their own self? No!Reality is that yes, while these problems really exist, it doesn't mean that if we block DeFi they don't exist, they exist and have always existed. The reason why they say that DeFi is a problem and accused, is that DeFi takes financial control and power away from them. FED wants to know when, where and how much you spend, everything in details to tax you more, to learn your psychology and take away more money from you by manipulation.",

The U.S. government is in desperate need of tax revenue but they're afraid of the political ramifications of raising taxes. So they'll hire more IRS agents and look for other ways to raise revenue. Rich people have the funds to hire professionals to find those loopholes for them. The middle class have no remedy. So when the middle class use Bitcoin through decentralized trading avenues, the U.S. government wouldn't resist keeping their nose out of it. Once again, they use the normal scapegoats of \"criminals and scammers\" as an excuse to ram down more regulation which target law abiding citizens first.",

Using your already earned money from you bank to purchase crypto (Defi since that what's in question here) after that very step the Bank and the US Treasury loss control over taxing those assets again, since they now move on decentralized protocols, no way to task the money movement, no way to know what kind of interest they exact money which left the bank a while ago has accumulated. So all they are after is for money to keep on moving on centralized ways which they can have their eyes on it, they don't care how it's being used all their interest is on the much that amount is going to generate for them. Which are task for movement, task on interest rate etc. So they are after the DeFi because to some point they are blocking them from achieving their main purpose.",

That report from the Treasury Department is showing us some real talk about how risky the crypto world can be. It's true that without the right oversight, some bad apples can use DeFi services for dirty money laundry and other illegal activities. But let's not forget about the potential good things that DeFi services can bring, ya feel me? Like the Treasury undersecretary said, we gotta address these risks so we can get all the benefits of DeFi services.The private sector needs to get their act together, like yesterday. We can't let those sketchy folks take advantage of DeFi services, it's just not cool. The companies need to play by the rules, plain and simple. That means no money laundering, no funding terror, no dodging sanctions. And they need to be on top of things, coming up with ways to stop DeFi services from getting abused.Even though the report sounds like a bummer, I still think that with some good regulations, DeFi services can help bring financial inclusion and innovation to the masses. Governments worldwide need to work together and establish some international standards and beef up their regulatory powers to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, so we gotta make sure they're being used the right way.",
