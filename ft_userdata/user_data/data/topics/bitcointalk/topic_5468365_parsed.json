If you do not react to such behavior, then you tacitly agree that AI is allowed here.

The user who red-tagged you dropped a neutral tag on you, first warning you and the general public of your involvement in using CHATBOT to generate text and replies for you. Wow, I think this is the first time I've seen red trust handed out for the use of AI to create whatever it is OP created.  And I have to say: Well done to the members who tagged this unwanted, spamming, cheating shitbag.  While the use of red trust for such a purpose reminds me of a time prior to the merit system when shitposters were getting doses of paint that made their whole wretched families squirm and eventually became frowned upon, you'll never see me complaining about it.Really, what other way is there to deal with the likes of OP?  If Theymos doesn't raise a stink I say keep at it!  Now I'll have to click on some links to figure out what actually happened.  I knew AI was going to hit this forum hard, but I'm glad there are some members here on the lookout for the shady shit that's obviously already going full-force.Edit: Ah, I see nutildah summarized it quite nicely above.  Reading is fundamental, kids.Quote from: Poker Player on September 28, 2023, 04:53:16 AMI trust lovesmayfamilis although in this case I think the red tag is unnecessary. There is no trading risk and it adds nothing to the neutral tag. Going to have to disagree with you there (which I already did with my above post).  Sometimes you have to use the only effective tools available to combat crap like this, and if our boss doesn't like it he can come up with a more creative solution.  Like I said, it's just like we're back in 2015-17.",
