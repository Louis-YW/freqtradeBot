      "body": "You say that 1PYwTzZZhMdaCh1QtU8LY61taUnFhuUMkX has already been compomised, which means its private key should already be know to the public. If this is the case and you have signature, message, message hash, you can calculate a signing secret which was used to calculate signature values.Use this formula:Code:k = (z + d * r)  / swhere z - message hash d - secretr, s - signaturePlease note that in order to calculate private key, you need to have a signing secret, and the opposite is also true: in order to calculate signing secret, you need to have private key which was used to sign message. The following formula can be used to derive d from known signing secret, signature and message:Code:d = (s * k - z)  /  rwhere z - message hash k - signing secretr, s - signature",

      "body": "Thank you for taking the time to reply. All information is appreciated.I am more interested in why the math \"doesn't work\" .  My reading and experiments show that given the same R value and different S values,we can work out the private key if the public keys are the same. Private key  =   ((S * K) - Z) / R) % N. (Old news I know) .  So, for this transaction, which has the same public key, so must have the same private key and K value, the only thing I can imagine is that the data in the RSZ values must have been calculated differently?? Does anyone know how?You can play with the values in this online calculator.http://rawcdn.githack.com/nlitsme/bitcoinexplainer/aa50e86e8c72c04a7986f5f7c43bc2f98df94107/calculator.html#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Thank you",

If (r,s) is a valid signature then (r,-s) is also always a valid signature because of the way ECDSA works. However, you have no way of knowing whether the signer negated s value or not by just looking at the signature.",

Using the same public key/address there is also this transaction5D212D7AB71598B9A97E21B8A608713C97F46BE4E410BD1B6A03B3BF2B1AC574It also has duplicate but different R values (so K is different) and different S values. Accepting that K could be calculated as per witcher_sense post, let's assume we don't know K and have to calculate the 'usual' way. We should still be able to get the correct key and new K from the matching R values and different S values by the usual process but the values do not produce the correct result.I have tried with my new knowledge, (r,s)  (r, -s1) (r, -s2) .However I notice the second transaction DER is slightly different and is missing the usual length byte after the 02 for the S string.46304302205c89e3bcf8d3d25ed2be7071d086590394d912fb16e5c14643b1aba3b7668fda02 <- usually a length byte follows1f0cf57aee36c510f83741416e9330a21bbc06d09d34af3243e5ff4197c6a23801I have tried with S being as above and  0cf57aee36c510f83741416e9330a21bbc06d09d34af3243e5ff4197c6a238.Any ideas why this does not produce the correct values?Thank you",
