These scammers only know deception and plunder innocent people's money without rights. They even do not stop promoting their schemes. Unfortunately, you find them promoting them everywhere.

I am sure that an active bitcointalk member could not be victimized.

I hope people manage to wise up and start avoiding going anywhere near websites that claim to have unbelievable ROI otherwise they will lose the funds they sent to the scammers.That website gave me flashbacks of the first time someone approached me about bitconnect and sent me the company link. The piss poor grammar is baffling to me..it’s like they aren’t even trying. The return charts are a joke of course etc etc. Sadly, the VAST majority of people are clueless and remain clueless. I’m an FA, so I see this ignorance all day every day. I get asked about crypto a lot..most own utter shitcoins (knowing absolutely nothing about them) and never once has a single client even known what a hot wallet or hardware wallet is. They sure as shit don’t understand cold storage, forks etc. I recommend Trezor like crazy but I’m willing to bet maybe 25% of them actually heed my advice. I sent a spare ledger wallet to a buddy I worked with (a fellow FA) maybe 3 years ago. Explained how corrupt Coinbase is etc. He texted me when FTX went down and said “this is why you told me to use ledger right, but isn’t Coinbase safer than FTX”. Once again I explained..still hasn’t moved his coins.  People in large part are extremely lazy and immune to good advice. So sadly, these obvious scams have plenty of scamming opportunities to look forward to.",
