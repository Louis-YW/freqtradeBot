  "content": "‚öΩWelcome to the UEFA Champions League Football Predictor Pool - 2024/25! The biggest club football tournament on the planet returns with a brand new league format on 17 Sep 2024.BC.Game sponsors this season with a matching sponsorship -- whatever amount collected in fees will be matched by them: current prize fund is now 80mbtc (approx $5000). In addition, $50 in freebets will be awarded every round.Quick Links:Pot A: Superbru PoolPot B: Matchday 13 Submission AreaSince 2018, we've had a Bitcointalk predictor pool. The concept is simple: participants pay a fee that goes into a pot. Players predict results, winning points to climb the leaderboard. Winners then share the entire pot among themselves + sponsorship prizes.Since the 2023/24 season, we introduced an odds-based prediction event so there are now two concurrent events with prizes split into 2 pots.How to Join?‚û• The entry fee is 0.001 BTC or approx. $60 (Aug 22nd 2024 estimate). Payment should be sent to: bc1q3rrxzuknzfvlclprprjshqruvjhp5tettcthea. This is an escrow held by buwaytress.‚û• Participants will be required to create a Superbru account. This is for the score prediction event (Pot A).‚û• Participants no longer need to create a Google account. The odds-based predictions event will be managed on a self-hosted platform (Pot B).‚û• After you pay the participation fee to the BTC address above, I will send you an invitation to the Superbru pool (Send me a PM with tx ID and Superbru + Forum username).How to Play?Scores-based prediction eventScore predictions will be made using the Superbru sports prediction website. Why Superbru? It's been around since 2006, has one of the most reliable servers able to handle huge loads, and accepts players from any country. They use a simple leaderboard system awarding points for correct predictions on each game.The more accurate the predictions, the more points. 3 points for exact scores | 1.5 points for close scores | 1 point for correct outcome | additional 1,2 and 3 points for reaching 5,8, and 10 correct outcomes in a MatchDay. New player? Read about Superbru scoring system here.Leaderboards are automatically compiled by Superbru. Tiebreakers are automatically calculated -- players higher on the leaderboard are ranked higher.Odds-based prediction event- Each Matchday all participants will be assigned 10 points. Think of this as your bankroll to bet on football.- You are free to assign these 10 points to any outcome available in the Matchday.- A maximum of 4 points can be staked per outcome. Unused points do not carry over to the next Matchday.- Points are won if the correct outcome is selected. Points Staked * Odds and added to a Total. The Total is cumulative for all Matchdays.- Any player with 0 points won in a single Matchday will incur a 5% penalty to their current Total.- Points won for every Matchday are accumulated on the Leaderboard. Those with the most points accrued on the Leaderboard after the final win.Click here for full instructions and rules.What are the Prizes?All sponsorship and entry fees constitute the prize fund, which will be split into two pots, tentatively with 5 (five) winners each:a. Prize Pot A: Classic score-based prediction on Superbru - 30% of the prize fundb. Prize Pot B: Odds-based prediction - 70% of the prize fundü•á 1st place - (30% of prize pot)ü•à 2nd place - (25% of prize pot) ü•â 3rd place - (20% of prize pot) üèÖ 4th place - (15% of prize pot)üèÖ 5th place - (10% of prize pot)*Tx costs, including possible consolidation, will be borne by first-prize winner's portion of player fees.==Paid participants for 2024/25==Code:AB de Royse777ajiz138arallmuusBABY SHOESbuwaytresscryptofrkaCryptopreneurBrainbossdarxiaomidittoupel cheexecijutierefamososMuertosgoodpuntHarkoredeHhampuzicopressIgebotzjaycejeremypwrjoker_josuelogfilesleea-1334KanapkaKTChampionsLFC_BitcoinLittle MouseLTU_btcMahdirakibmv1986nelson4lovnotblox1OmikifuseRikafipSaint-loupslaman29StrongkoredswogerinoTrofoUlvenvd309====ARCHIVAL: Past season details, pool winners, and prize distributions are archived here.",

Needless to say I will participate in this pool as well. Damn, this is gonna be one hell of a season. If my count is correct I am already in 6 pools, this will be the 7th. Really interested to see how much I will learn from the pools if anything. I think I will probably have to do some excel spreadsheet to keep track of it.Still a lot of time before CL starts, I'll probably pay next week, when I get new campaign payment on my hot wallet. I am on holiday so limited access to stuff.",

I'll join definitely, there is plenty of time left, so I'll send funds a bit later. I already lost count how many pools I'm playing in and how much money it costs, but I planned to join CL pool anyway. Ok, I'll try to count - EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Champions League, F1 and I'm sure that we will have pool for World Cup too.

Maybe 30 more realistic number. Due to nature of tournament, Champions league pool won't have bigger interest than EPL.",
