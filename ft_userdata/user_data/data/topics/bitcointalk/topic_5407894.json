      "body": "Do you really think realizing $500,000 every month is possible? Well, there's something you need to realize about the whales which is that they're incessantly given money that is earmarked for one thing: buying stocks. This is simply in the sense that, \"they have to buy.\" It is part and parcel of their job and they are competing against each other and the S&P 500 to outperform. This is among the reasons why the bull market has been so wonderfully strong in the past few years after successful recovery back from the 2008 meltdown.",

The whale's own analogy when it comes to the surface is to expel moist air in the lungs, at least that's what I've heard in several explanations.From this analogy, it is clear that when the big holders come out they begin to beat the heat, draw in fresh air to fill the lungs, eat the small fish and then drown again. Filling entire wallets with millions of profits from frantic little sellers. No need to pay, you just need to hold Bitcoin and once the whale appears it is marked bullish then take enough.",

Technically this is not a trading anymore. Grayscale surely have their own analyst , they have the money for this one and I’m sure they only trust the best analyst alive so their money will continue to grow.

It’s like you’re giving those big whales much appreciation with what they mostly done in the market. And it’s look like relying in them could lessen our job here, is that what you think OP. Big whales are always smarter than they think, but actually they can never make correct predictions with this unpredictable market. All of us here only follow what’s on our minds, maybe through educational guesses, and big whales are not an exception to that.",

If you are now confident about your trading skills, then you can hire asset manager or broker where they can handle your assets and even trade that in the market though of course you have to pay them big since you are rendering their services. If you are a small time trader, I suggest to do this on your own, learn everything about how trading works, this can help you make trading decisions in the future and its really worth it.",

Actually, it would be better if you learn how to trade because you can have more chance to make more profit in the future if you know how the market works and knows some trading strategy that can actually make a profit. If you are a newbie to trading then I suggest you read this source \"Awesome Crypto Trading\".Then start learning FA and TA then test your skills in any trading simulator available from that link before you enter live trading. I'm sure you'll stop looking for whales to pay $500k for a small tip.",

Merit for sure good innovative idea hereEven if you could contact several whales they will never accept a deal like that, the reason? Because that is nowhere near enough for the information you want to get, besides if you could get 500k then that is more than enough seed capital in order to produce great profits as long as you know how to trade the markets in the traditional way, so stop looking for shortcuts and just learn how to trade as that is the only realistic way to make profits in this and any other market.",
