  "content": "I was reading the bitcoin whitepaper bit by bit and I understood the idea of satoshi, why he created bitcoin. The whole idea is eliminating the third party and to avoid trusting a centralized authority. This is financial liberty.But in this forum and also in exchanges, I have seen where third party holds fund (escrow agents, exchange P2P). And the third party has 100% power to do anything with the fund. This is centralization and big trust on the third party.I read something called multisignature escrow, which should be what Satoshi stood for. Why did we abandon the Satoshi idea of escrow?Check the first comment for Satoshi idea of escrow.The satoshi idea is using a Bitcoin wallet that requires multiple keys to release the funds. The buyer, seller, and an escrow agent (third party) each hold one private key. To release the funds, two out of three must sign the transaction, reducing the need for trust.",

I have never come across this post, I got the idea of satoshi escrow in an article by 99bitcoin if I am not mistaken. 2 by 2 escrow as Satoshi said can make honest person still lose. Because the honest person getting their fund depends if the other person wants to be honest. A dishonest buyer can get goods for example and still burn the BTC in escrow.QuoteI like the idea but I will prefer 2of3 multisig.

But from the explanation of it, it doesn't look like something that will be so difficult.",

It will start with what people picked to be co-signers. They must be reputable people to be add as co-signers of the funding wallet.Quote from: _act_ on October 07, 2024, 11:39:38 AMThis is the Satoshi post that you are referring to: EscrowEscrow in Satoshi Nakamoto post, his idea years ago is very different than Escrow nowadays.",

I have read a little about it and I think it is the best thing that has been invested. When it comes to a being honest with money or in this case bitcoin, it is like pouring grease in a bucket of water they never mix. I think that this idea may have even been in existence long before it became used by Satoshi. And even in ecommerce, it is still being used in some form. Anyone who is interested can read up on this decentralized P2P trading network that uses BTC, called OpenBazaar. That's how they work.",

This is centralization and big trust on the third party.Its because you have chosen to go through such, to start with, centralized exchanges are not compulsory for us to use, you can make use of a decentralized one, while the meaning of p2p is what does not require for kyc or any centralized authority for permission.lastly, when it comes to the forum affairs and those who manage campaigns and hold funds, there is no any kyc information left on them from here, all you do is to make use of your bitcoin address for receiving payments, its now left for you to make use of a centralized exchange btc address or a non custodial wallet address, but there is no bridge at the cause of this, the forum make sure you have your privacy right from the point of your registration when joining, your email was not verified and no further personal information concerning you was required from you.Quote from: Floxynice on October 07, 2024, 11:24:13 AMI read something called multi-signature escrow, which should be what Satoshi stood for.

The buyer will have the coins sent to the escrow while the seller will have the coins received after the done deal. Which means if escrow is used or not used, the coins will still be with buyer at some point while the coins will later be transferred to the seller. This makes your point to be pointless. Anyone that will make his wallet vulnerable to attack should not use crypto at all. Also no one will know his coin is vulnerable unless his coins has been stolen.",

      "body": "I do agree with OP that Bitcoin still relying on third parties like exchanges or P2P platforms, even though Satoshi’s vision was all about minimizing trust in centralized entities. The multisignature approach does align more with Satoshi’s goal, as it spreads control across multiple parties, reducing reliance on any one entity. However Multisignature escrow hasn't really seen wider adoption yet because it comes down to either complexity or usability.While these multisig setups are more cumbersome compared to a traditional wallet, losing one party's key could mean irretrievably locking up funds forever. For casual users, too, it's easier to implicitly trust the centralized platforms automatically perform these processes behind the scenes, as the latter goes totally against the ethos of decentralization. Still, multisig is used on HodlHodl and Bisq, though not as widespread because many people prefer convenience over control.So IMO the idea of Satoshi is not fully rejected, it's just that it hasn't reached mainstream adoption because people still prefer ease of use, even when that comes at the cost of more trust in third parties.",
