  "content": "Time for the rest of the Ukrainian people to move out of Ukraine. It seems that the young men of Ukraine are being forced into Russian roulette. But there is one difference. More and more of the chambers are being filled with rounds before spinning the cylinder. What will they do when there is a serious and complete crackdown on all the people of Ukraine? It's death either way. The choice is joining, and being killed by Russians, or fighting conscription and being shot by Ukrainian recruiters.Young Ukrainians Scared To Leave Their Homes As More And More Videos Emerge Of Forced Conscriptionhttps://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/young-ukrainians-scared-leave-their-homes-more-and-more-videos-emerge-forcedRecent videos of young Ukrainian men being conscripted across the country have circulated in popular encrypted messaging apps in Ukraine, and those fearful of being sent to the front are actively engaging in evasive and, in some instances, illegal tactics to avoid such a fate.The brutal mobilization by Ukrainian military recruitment officers of young men has been occurring for a year and a half now, Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet reports.\"Many conscripted men are taken straight off the street by uniformed men,\" it states. \"Most recently in Subcarpathia, a surveillance camera recorded the overreach of the authorities as a man trying to go to a store was kidnapped from his bicycle in broad daylight.\"The man was abducted right on a street during the day by police and conscription officers in a small village in the Municipal District of Munkács, with his bicycle left in the road....",

Will Nato really start being reduced? Might as well. Most of the European Nato countries don't have squat for militaries any longer. So, who cares about Nato any longer?The Incredible Shrinking NATOhttp://ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2023/july/17/the-incredible-shrinking-nato/I've been waiting for the hubbub to die down since the NATO conference in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 11-12 July 2023, waiting for someone — anyone — to point out the obvious reason for why the Ukraine's cocaine-sniffing mascot-president Zelensky, having been lionized only a year ago, has suddenly fallen into disfavor with this organization.Yes, the Ukraine might still some day be invited to start the long and arduous process of joining NATO, but only after some undefined number of NATO members decide that it has done enough to comply with \"NATO standards\" (I'll explain what those are later) and various other vague things. Keeping in mind that back on 20 September 2018 the Ukrainian parliament approved amendments to the constitution that would make the accession of the country to NATO and the EU a central goal and the main foreign policy objective, such a turn of events is most embarrassing for the mascot president and his backers and handlers....Was it that the Ukraine was losing the war? No, the Ukraine wasn't losing; it just wasn't winning. In particular, its attacks on Russia's defensive lines, which the Russian troops termed \"meat attacks\" because of the huge and useless losses they incurred on the Ukrainian side, seemed rather futile....",

Sure, we can bomb the hell out of them or provide fancy tech and weapons systems, but we can’t match their small arms ammunition stockpiles or manufacturing capabilities.",

If there are actually whistleblowers, then the job of prosecuting Hunter Biden and his family should be easier.",

Then when they took Zelensky out, they could blame Russia, and they would have somebody even better to take over in Ukraine. I almost said, 'put in place' rather than, 'to take over', but that is just what might happen... Put-in place when the Russians formally win.",
