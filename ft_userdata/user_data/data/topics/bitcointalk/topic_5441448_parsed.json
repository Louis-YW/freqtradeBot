I know it won't eliminate the risk of trading, but I think using Stop Lose in trading is enough to reduce the losses we can bear. it is very useful for beginners who often lose in trying several types and trading techniques.",

Scalping which requires few minutes to like an hour, day trading that requires hours to like a day or 2, swing trading that requires few days to weeks or a month. But there are other forms of trading like arbitrage. Quote from: Maus0728 on February 28, 2023, 12:09:08 AMDid you mean types of trading? We have:- Day, Swing, Position trading- Scalping- Algorithmic Trading- Options Trading- Futures etc..What is the difference between position trading and future trading? Aren't they the same thing. Option trading is also part of future trading. Algorithmic trading is not what should be considered as a trading type:Quote from: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_tradingAlgorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for variables such as time, price, and volume. This type of trading attempts to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to human traders.

Now, knowing how this different market works and how to trade and make profit from them is a different thing altogether, and I personally would suggest you do some research on this yourself. Options and future trading are derivatives. Margin trading is never in the category of future trading, they are very different but just that they both make use of leverage, but how it is done is different and the leverage you can go up to in future is far more than in margin trading, both should be considered separate.The types of trading that I know are scalping, day trading and swing trading. But in crypto, it is worth knowing derivative trading which is what traders are using to scalp, day trade and swing trade.",

Just understading the type of trading wont make any difference because at the end you will have to understand what it is and how it works. For example, scalping, it is not everyone's cup of tea however an arbitrage trading might be! It's not easy job when it comes to the advance techniques/types of trading. Considering what you have experienced in the past it is better to avoid the advance crypto trading. You should really start very small, for example hodling portfolio of 5-6 coins which are strongest and close to the #1 that is bitcoin. Try to gain the profits over the time and see what you learn from that. As long as holding is considered you are just doing long term trading and gaining profits only if you sell your portfolio. The advice is coming out of experience and also the volatile the market the more risky it is to trade. Better keep it low and play safe.",
