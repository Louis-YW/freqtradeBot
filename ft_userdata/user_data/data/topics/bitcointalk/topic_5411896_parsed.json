  "content": "Some Chinese miners announced they will be forking the ETH blockchain after \"The Merge\" in order to continue with the PoW consensus algorithm. If the fork goes full speed ahead, this means existing ETH holders will obtain \"free\" coins on the forked chain (ETHW). It'll be just like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) where Bitcoin (BTC) holders received the exact amount of coins on the other Blockchain network. While I believe making another ETH fork based on PoW is highly unnecessary (especially when we already have Ethereum Classic (ETC)), this could prove to be a profitable opportunity for those who cash out during the initial days of the fork. That is assuming ETHW will be worth some money after it's listed across major cryptocurrency exchanges. If it goes to zero, then why bother?What do you think about the new fork? Will it be a success or a failure? Is now a good time to buy ETH before \"The Merge\" happens? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

Imho the whole PoS fud is coming from these miners in the first place, they are the ones actually losing something in this. And funny enough they are claiming that eth will be more centralized and only rich people will get to vote. That doesn't even make sense as this same thinking applies centralized in PoW. And in PoS holders actually get something from holding. Miners making the decisions was always kinda weird mindset to begin with but maybe i am not getting the idea.",

In my opinion, the best solution in this case is not buying, but borrowing coins on DEX or CEX. In this case, you only pay a commission, which will surely be compensated by the profit from the sale of ETHW.",

Selling off the coins isn’t option since it would be in loss and won’t be enough to recover hardwares cost too. By the way my second question (I might not be Updated), chinese miners are still doing the mining operations after the strict bans? Is that true or the whole thing is running under the sink?",
