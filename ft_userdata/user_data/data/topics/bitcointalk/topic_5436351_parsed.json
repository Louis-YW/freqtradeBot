  "content": "I've been mastering this philosophy for over a year now and I decided to share it with you guys because I think it may help you in some ways. This thread is based on think and grows rich by Napoleon Hill where he learn this Philosophy by studying the most successful businessman, artists, individuals, and other persons in his era. Napoleon said that if this philosophy is taught properly in universities and schools, it can change the whole educational system where the time spent in school can reduce to half. A lot of people think that getting rich is just by luck and they really don't know that there is a formula behind it. I'll explain all of the steps that Napoleon Hill created on how I understand them on my own.  My life has changed since I studied this philosophy and I believe that this could be a very big help to you guys. If we mastered this philosophy, we will find ourselves swept on to success.DESIREDesire is the starting point of all things. If you do not know what is desire, it is basically the strong feeling of wanting something in other words; our goals, dreams, and vision are just DESIRES. It is the most crucial step in the philosophy of success. Because if we do not want to have desires for something else then there is no point in improving our lives. Having a desire is not enough because we should have a definiteness of purpose in our desires. That is why Lack of Ambition is the weakness of the human that has no Remedy. Remember that weak desires bring weak results. Make sure that your ambition is really high where in other people will laugh if they will hear your ambitions. FAITHThe faith that I will talk about is Faith in your own ability. They say that faith is the strongest emotion. If we don't believe in ourselves then 100% we will fail that is the reason why we should trust our own ability because they say that the world loves a winner and the world has no time for losers. Believing in our ability all the time will carry out a plan that encourages us to follow which may lead to financial success. AUTOSUGGESTIONA lot of people do not know that we are always doing autosuggestion in our daily lives or what they called self-hypnosis in this current era. The words that come from our mouths are basically self-hypnosis. If you said that you are not good then you are not good but if you always say that you are the best then you can become the best. This where many people falling off because they are not aware of the words that they are saying, I'm always telling myself that I'm gonna become rich someday. It is a form of affirmation that is considered self-hypnosis.SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGESpecialized Knowledge is important because we can have potential knowledge that can help us to transmute our desire into money. That is why a lot of successful people keep telling their followers to invest in their knowledge first because we are the ones who can make these things into reality. Are you guys aware that successful people never stop acquiring specialized skills? Look out to the multi-billionaires and multi-millionaires. They keep acquiring specialized knowledge regarding their profession or their business. IMAGINATIONThe best ingredients for a successful business are basically Imagination + Specialized Knowledge. They say that we can create anything that we can imagine. Look at all of the things around you, all of it is just the imagination of someone else. If we practice our imagination skills, we can create something special and beneficial not only for us but also for everyone. The ideas that we can get from just imagination can help us transmute into monetary value.ORGANIZED PLANNINGSpecialized Knowledge and Imagination will not be enough if we do not have organized planning. We can track our improvement, mistakes, and many more through care and organized Planning. Those successful people don't just rely on luck, they build an organized plan for how they do it. Look at the current multi-billionaires, their organized plan is the reason why they are on the Top.  Intelligence is not enough because without organized planning they will fail even if they are the most intelligent in our society. Organized planning is essential for success to accumulate riches so we should take note of it. DECISIONA decision is something that we should give a lot of care to, most of the rich accumulated their wealth through their decision-making. They understand how decision-making works where they know the risk and the reward ratio before they made their own decision. If we fully master our decision-making skills then the path to becoming rich will become easier for us. PERSISTENCEPersistence is the most important characteristic that we should have, it is considered an essential factor that transmutes our desire into monetary equivalent. This is the quote that is really memorable for me \"EVERY ADVERSITY, EVERY FAILURE, AND EVERY HEARTACHE CARRIES WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT OR A GREATER BENEFIT\" Through persistence, we can achieve the desires that we want but if we just surrender or give up to our desire then 100% we will fail.  Without any persistence, we will be defeated even before we start. With persistence, we will surely WIN. I do not have any give-up mentality and I'm really sure that I'm a persistent person and I can overcome any obstacle that I may face. If I give up before my goal, I'll be called a quitter and I do not want to become a quitter. I want to become a WINNER. POWER OF THE MASTER MINDLet's discuss first what is a Master Mind, it is formed of individuals who have the same ideas, vision, mission, and commitment to the same goal. They say that the Master mind is the highest order of thinking by a group of knowledgeable people. People think that they can reach the TOP with just themselves but it is not true. You need someone that can help you to achieve your goal, the only problem is it is really hard to find someone who has the same ideas, vision, mission, and commitment wherein you have the same goal. I'm lucky because I found my Master Mind group and I'm grateful to them because they are the best out of the best. I will not be here if they did not help me. Energy is contagious, that is why I only spend most of my time with my mastermind group. I avoid some people who don't match my personality, vision, goals, commitment, and energy. Just Follow this Steps and we will achieve all desires that we have. These are the Master Key of success and all of it are really powerful!",

      "body": "QuoteThe Philosophy of Success and the Steps Required to Achieve ItIn theory, the playing field is level. Everyone has two arms and two legs. But upon closer inspection, there is more to it than that.Some ethnicities such as polynesians spent centuries if not thousands of years living on islands with their favorite pastime being recreational hand to hand combat. As a result they have become optimized for it with denser bone and body structures which can be better suited for hand to hand brawling. Africans are known to have denser muscle structure on average, which contributes towards them having greater average explosiveness in terms of athleticism.Yet despite these advantages, we see that other ethnicities can compete and overcome some of these disadvantages by having a better work ethic, better diet, smarter gameplan or being more disciplined. I think these precedents carry over to success in the real world. While some ethnicities might have better genetic disposition towards certain tasks such as sitting in an office all day and doing paperwork. The difference between success and failure might be determined simply by who wants it more. The door of success is open to everyone, people only need to choose to walk through it. Where things get complicated is many believe in their heart and mind that success is not for them. Success is for \"other people\". A big part of it could be learning to rationalize and think about things in a way which allows for people to believe they deserve a better life and deserve to do better for themselves.",

A big part of it could be learning to rationalize and think about things in a way which allows for people to believe they deserve a better life and deserve to do better for themselves.Those people who mentioned that success is not for them, their brain is automatically shutdown where they cannot really become successful. The door of success if always in front of us but not all of people want to become successful, that is the truth in this world. They think that they \"want to become successful\" but in reality they really don't want it. They just want the idea of success and not be part of it. You can verify someone who can reach the door of success by knowing and looking at their mindset, habits, lifestyle , personality and the things that come out from their mouth.Having the idea of \"success\" is not enough because you need systematic approach in order to reach the door of success. The systematic approach that I was talking about is consisting of the steps that I mentioned above.",

      "body": "It's all just a strand of definition that is nothing more than a theory. In philosophy, you are only trying to open up the initial layer of implementation which you have not really mastered. If the definition of success that you are talking about makes listeners bored, then how does the philosophy of success work effectively in everyday life? The word is the simplicity of language that is easy to understand and then you are able to describe it in your own words.Get out of the limited zone and do it with the basic philosophical values of your own life and determine which way you will navigate the path of success.",

If you have it, it can be said that the percentage of success in your life is high.",
