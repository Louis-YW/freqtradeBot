I think they cost between $30-$100 it is only important for you that the developers make regular upgrades and updates.About exchange, I assume you don't mean starting a full centralized exchange with accounting. that job requires a lot of money and a very good technical team that will do and maintain it all. again, if you don't have good prior knowledge, then I advise you not to get into it. The idea is not unique, plus the competition is very serious.Maybe you can consider services like Changelly, where you can use their API and very easily integrate instant exchange widgets on your site. cash in, send money is something completely different and think about it when you reach some reputation and trust.",

I'm just asking. Because you will need a team in an exchange, then in remittance, that also requires a budget allocation. It's easy if you're a rich person, but if you're going to get rich, it's a bit difficult I think.",

That's fair, but I believe starting so many different businesses at the same time is not gonna make it. Not to mention what you're looking for might cost a lot, which might not be worth the cost compared to expanding your existing business and making it more profitable. That being said, I'm not an expert on business management either so you do you.I think there is no other option other than following what has been suggested above. Ask for the price on the freelance marketplace or Services board if you don't know the market price. Don't just believe one source, wait for others to bid. Also, I suggest you keep it open to the public unless someone with a trade history sent you a PM. A lot of scammers are sending phishing links or even fake prices (which are usually very cheap but they don't accept escrow as a guarantee) nowadays. At the very least others can verify if someone is asking for ridiculously expensive prices or suspiciously cheap prices.",

If you want what you mentioned in the opening post, and also want to make more expansions later on, then you will probably need a pretty high budget for that. Developing costs along with resources and other maintenance expenses will surely be costly.Quote from: rat03gopoh on February 26, 2023, 09:16:54 AMif you want to be cheaper then hire novice developers.Hiring novice developers wouldn't be a good idea for the long run.
