  "content": "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lithosphere/Lithosphere’s vision is to connect all blockchains and break the barriers between blockchains by allowing them to transact with each other. The end goal is to create a connected network of blockchains, a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way. With Lithosphere, blockchains can maintain sovereignty, process transactions quickly and communicate with other blockchains in the ecosystem, making it optimal for a variety of use cases instead of being limited to one blockchain network.Diluted market cap is 2 mil+Predicting 10-100 mil mc+\"Probably\" 1 bil+ ..QuoteSign up with Coinbase to stay up to date on Lithosphere and get notified when it becomes available on Coinbase app.https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/lithosphereDirectly from an almost generic message off coinbase site.Compare it with other coins, they might say if but not when.https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/litIdk what lit is but its a different coin and look at the way they worded it vs litho",

      "body": "It's the most common mistake to think that if an exchange mentions a coin and tells you how to buy it or send it to a stake, someone is bound to think that it will cause that coin to grow. No, it won't. Binance also had similar guides about various coins, but in the end, almost 2 years passed after they were published and no listing happened. You can talk about listing only when exchange announces this listing and not when they just write about how to buy this or that coin. Do NOT try to look for any connection in these events. There is none.",

There is none.You clearly don't get it its like you didn't even read before making a rude comment. This isn't a \"common mistake\" this is pointing out a very clear difference between litho vs lit and other similar coins coinbase has logged.When vs ifPeople like you shouldn't post at all, trolls of the internet.Its okay its common for trolls like yourself to troll.  I'll repeat the article says WHEN they list litho vs other coins do not say WHEN at all. So the common mistake your even talking about was already considered obviously. EDIT: Also common for trolls to try and sound smart by making false assumptions then making an ignorant post. Assuming I believe this project will go up purely on any listing of any coin is just you being ignorant.",
