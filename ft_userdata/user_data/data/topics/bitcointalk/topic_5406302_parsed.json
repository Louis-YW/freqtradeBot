The super bright colors  and the cartoon art style of the fruits are quite similar to Candy Crush franchise games. It makes it more enjoyable imo.",

Although I will admit that I'm biased with the animal theme slot since I hit a massive win the the 50 lions. And then there is this Marvel theme slot that I used to play in a land base casinos and then the old but classic Egyptian theme which is one of the first slots that I played years ago.",

I rarely play on slots but having a great reward system is a must, but sometimes having certain themes on slot games makes the experience much more enjoyable.",

Say I am the adventurous kind, It will be natural to be drawn to the Adventure-themed slot, If you love animals normally, you will be drawn towards Animal-themed slot, you love movies, your preference will be TV series and Movie-themed slot, If you love Myth, preference will be Viking/Asgard/Norse Mythology-themed slot, If you love music, your preference will be Music-themed slot, and if you love sports, your preference are the sports-themed slot etc.From these analysis , we can say also that casino's that offer a variety of slot theme options for players with different personalities will have high patronage compared to others.",

Also I look for the bet, specially the minimum bet, because there are machines that has big minimum bet for me, so I just stay away from that machine.",

Even so, I'm really going to try some of the changes lately and explore them one by one. As a casual gambler, I mostly play classic slots.",

When someone says the word slots they see those 7s spinning around and hear the sound of coins hitting the metal slide. Yeah, even before I got truly exposed to slot games, I was already familiar with the 777 number denotation. Perhaps it's not the most colourful but it by far had a place in the slot games as its one of the most used in movies too. We even had a 777coin gambling site on the platform, I suppose they are still around and active although, the campaign promotion they were running has calmed following certain events.Well, its important as to what team is used to present a slot game as these themes becomes click bate and some real source of advertisment. Egyptian and Old Roman themes gets me too as a lover of ancient history.",

Doesn't have any big reason for that but it feels like, I really attracted to a specific themes, and even think that I feel lucky when I choose my preferred one. One reason also why I became like that is because of winning experience. Luck comes with me whenever I play only my favorite themes. Nothing technical here.I always prefer Fruits themes and Chinese-based slots (classic Chinese that involves dragons, CN coins, etc) are those that I preferred.

I like those flashy graphics whenever I'm hitting the free spins bonus and multipliers. Much more entertaining if the total profit after free spins is totally decent and a big win. Sometimes, I even disregard any factors just to play in my favorite slot themes.Nice effort compiling the list but there are themes that are not familiar to me or even exist.

Not particularly picky about it nor do I believe that one slot theme is better for luck than the other really.
