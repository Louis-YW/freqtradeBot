  "content": "Dear community,I am currently writing my master's thesis at the University of Vienna about the effect of psychological characteristics on investment decisions (where bitcoin BTC plays a major role) and I am looking for participants for my online survey. You would do me a huge favor if you could spend 5 min of your valuable time and participate in my study: https://sosci.univie.ac.at/master_thesis/Of course, the data will be collected anonymously. If you are interested in the final results of the study you can optionally provide your mail address at the end.Many thanks in advance! ðŸ˜ƒPS.: I hope this is not considered as spam by moderators. If yes, it would be great to work out a solution without getting banned.",
