And, up to this point, the Ukraine people (who don't want the US and the Zelensky coup) have been a problem for Russia. The problem was, how to get rid of the Ukraine coup without hurting the people of Ukraine.Ukraine isn't that big. A person can walk across it rather easily. So, why do the people still sit there rather than getting out? They know a war is on. And they know of the power of Russia. So, why do they still sit there?If the people are supporting Zelensky, they are part of the war. Civilians who support Zelensky are supporters of the war on the side of Zelensky and the US. They are stating that they are enemies of Russia through their support, even if that support is only cheering Zelensky's army on. And since this war was started by the government of Ukraine back in 2014, the so-called civilian supporters of Zelensky are part of the war.Those Ukrainians who are smart, already walked (if they didn't drive) out of Ukraine long ago. Those who are/were in favor of Russia, moved to Russia long ago. Those who are left after the recent bombings have a choice. What will they do? Stay and support Zelensky and the US? Or move out now before the bombing gets really heavy?",

I'm sure the citizens are very familiar with why this is happening as they've been living through this conflict a lot longer than we've been reading about it in the news.  In short, his conflict is about who is going to profit off of and benefit from Ukraine in the future.  Things start to get sloppy when you look into the Biden family's personal ties with Ukraine, but then it starts to make sense why they were pushing the lie that Trump and Russia were allies.  They needed you to think orange man bad and friends with Putin so that you wouldn't question why we're going to pour so much money into Ukraine.",

Because when two countries are in war the non actor countries' citizens should be a neutral body to settle the dispute so that there will be peace among the conflicting parties. Now, you are saying that Ukraine citizens should left the country because they are not party to the war. One of the duty of of a citizen is to defend her or his country whenever there is an external aggression to the country. It is not only the military is to defend a nation but the citizens are also on the contract. And also the citizens can not leave their country otherwise they are cowardice. And it is not easy to go start new life in another country. I don't think the people are supporting Zelensky, nobody support bad thing (coup) but it is inevitable to humanity and you cant let it die. Ukrainians have to defend their country to the last person blood dropped. In a war not everyone can stand and defend, some have to run while the brave ones have to stay.I am not supporting Ukrain and Russia. Let their be peace amongs.",

Ukrainians have to defend their country to the last person blood dropped. In a war not everyone can stand and defend, some have to run while the brave ones have to stay.I am not supporting Ukrain and Russia. Let their be peace amongs. When citizens of a country at war decide to uphold their country, they have made themselves part of the war. They should expect that they might become victims or casualties of that war.In the case of Ukraine, it is really the US against Russia. The US is simply using the Ukraine as the battlefield. Most of the Ukrainians recognize this, and are in favor of Russia kicking the US and its puppet (Zelensky) out. All that Russia was doing was finding Russian sympathizers who have been living in Ukraine for decades, and attempting to protect them from the US.Since Russia has stepped back in parts of its work in Ukraine - mostly because its goals have been reached - when the Ukraine military attempts to attack the Russian positions, they can expect that Russia will fight back. Many Ukrainian citizens have moved out... some because they fear Russia, but many who don't like what the US and the Zelensky puppet government are doing. If they stay and support US/Zelensky aggression, they can expect that they might be hurt.Let there be peace. Let the US depart, and let the people of Ukraine elect their REAL leader.",

On that aspect, you got a point. But I don't really think Putin is actually provoked that Ukraine wants to join the NATO alone, I also think the reason for his attack is for selfish reasons and his obsession for control. Putin resorting to dropping airstrikes is his way of showing how desperate he is grasping at straws to not lose the fight. Consideration for human life? Meh! I guess it's one of the casualties of war and and our dear fuhrer Putin doesn't give two cents about it.",

I am of no angle except for the angle that the war has gone beyond the ordinary and daily human lives are lost, many stranded and this war deep down is not just affecting the two countries at war but the globe.",

      "body": "Putin is acting on behalf of loads of Ukrainian people who are in favor of Russia. That's why the recent bombings in Kiev haven't come until Russia was sufficiently provoked by Zelensky's military. Remember, the Russian military even pulled out of Kiev near the beginning of the war, because bombing Kiev wasn't really part of the plan.If Zelensky hadn't provoked Russia through harming Russian people, and through bombing of the power plant, and through bombing of the bridge, Putin would have merely used his troops to fight Zelensky's troops. Putin's 300,000 military build-up shows that he understands that Zelensky will probably continue the fight to the end, all the while bringing more troops from other countries.Yet, Putin isn't the one who was aggressive. The Ukraine government was hurting and killing both Russians and Ukrainian people since 2014 or before. Everything that Putin did was an attempted defense for the people the Ukraine government was harming.",

Things are really simple here and you don't need to be a strategist or a politician to see what's going on. We have a sovereign country that was recognized by the whole world, including Russia. Suddenly Russia crosses its borders with an army, which means we are witnessing an invasion, but claims there's no invasion because Ukraine is not a country as it was once part of the Soviet Union. This means that The Baltic States, Kazakhstan, Armenia and so on, also don't have the right to be independent and should be a part of Russia. This is like listening to Hitler 80 years later.",
