  "content": "Hello all,What really intrigues me about Bitcoin is being a true owner of your money, only you having access, being in total control of hard money.I want to really take advantage of this and store my wealth in Bitcoin, and store the private key/seed for my wallet safely.I however struggle to find a right wallet to do this with, and I'm also slightly confused in some aspects.For example, a wallet like Exodus allows you to save private keys of your wallets, but it also allows for saving seeds.Let's say I save the private seed of my Exodus wallet, how can I be sure that in 20 years from now, Exodus wallet will still be a working product, that I can download from a new computer perhaps and import my seed into? This never made sense to me, I'm depending on the creator of the software it seems to me.The private key of my Bitcoin wallet is different ofcourse, but I do wonder, will this private key allow me to import the address into other wallet softwares? Or do I have to import it on Exodus?One thing that also slightly confused me was the fact that when I request my private key from the Exodus wallet, it shows me multiple private keys and public wallets. Two public wallets starting with 'bc1q', and one wallet starting with '157okQ'. Which one would I have to save? When I make a request to receive funds in the wallet it shows my deposit address as one of the bc1q addresses. Will this be the address of which the associated private key is practically my money?Thanks anyone for taking the time to help me.",

      "body": "bitcoin.org has a wizard that helps you chose your wallet:https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-walletIt seems like there is some confusion about the basic concepts... I'll try to give a very simplified explanation about what is happening between seed/mpk/pk/address/derivation path/... mind you, this explanation is simplified.Most recent wallets are either custodial (meaning: don't use those) or non-custodial. A custodial wallet usually doesn't let you access your private key(s), you're not in controll of your funds, so i'd advice against using those.A non custodial wallet is usually a HD wallet nowadays.Usually, they generate a seed phrase you can write down on a piece of paper in order to restore your wallet afterwards.The seed phrase goes trough an algorithm to create a master private key.Following a derivation path, private keys get derived from this master private key.Usually, a public key gets derived from the private key, this public key gets hashed and the hash is actually the address.Over the years, we moved from \"default\" wallet type. In the very beginning, we used pay to public key wallets. Then we switched to pay to public key hash \"legacy\" wallets, then to pay to Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash segwit wallets, and in the future even pay to taproot.The thing is: the last 3 types of wallet (legacy, segwit and taproot) can be derived from the same master public key. That's why the same seed phrase shows wallets whose addresses begin with 1 (legacy), bc1q (segwit) and maybe even bc1p (taproot)so, now, let's dig in to your OP:Quote from: Discounted on July 04, 2022, 09:45:09 AMFor example, a wallet like Exodus allows you to save private keys of your wallets, but it also allows for saving seeds.Let's say I save the private seed of my Exodus wallet, how can I be sure that in 20 years from now, Exodus wallet will still be a working product, that I can download from a new computer perhaps and import my seed into? This never made sense to me, I'm depending on the creator of the software it seems to me.I'm not an exodus user, but if you read the above explanation, you could note that if you write down the seed phrase and use a wallet that supports the same \"type\" of seed (for example, a bip39 seed), the \"other\" wallet should handle the seed phrase in the same way, so it would generate the same master private key, and if you use the same derivation path, it should create the same private keys and addresses.Quote from: Discounted on July 04, 2022, 09:45:09 AMThe private key of my Bitcoin wallet is different ofcourse, but I do wonder, will this private key allow me to import the address into other wallet softwares? Or do I have to import it on Exodus?If you have the actual derived private key, you should be able to import it in many different wallets... not all tough, they have to allow you to import single private keys, and some wallets only allow you to restore a wallet from seedQuote from: Discounted on July 04, 2022, 09:45:09 AMOne thing that also slightly confused me was the fact that when I request my private key from the Exodus wallet, it shows me multiple private keys and public wallets.

Most wallets which generate seed phrases,* Exodus included, generate them following the BIP39 process, which is well known and well documented. You can take a BIP39 seed phrase from any wallet and import it in to any other BIP39 compatible wallet and recover the same wallet with the same private keys. Even if every piece of wallet software on the planet no longer existed, and for some reason you could not access an old version of any wallet software, then the process to turn the seed phrase in to private keys is still well document and it would be fairly easy for you to recreate your private keys if needed.Quote from: Discounted on July 04, 2022, 09:45:09 AMThe private key of my Bitcoin wallet is different ofcourse, but I do wonder, will this private key allow me to import the address into other wallet softwares? Or do I have to import it on Exodus?You can import a private key in to any wallet which supports importing individual private keys. Private keys can be used to generate different types of addresses though (most commonly legacy (P2PKH), nested segwit (P2SH-P2WPKH), and native segwit (P2WPKH)), so you'll need to make sure the wallet you are importing to will generate the right address for you.Quote from: Discounted on July 04, 2022, 09:45:09 AMOne thing that also slightly confused me was the fact that when I request my private key from the Exodus wallet, it shows me multiple private keys and public wallets.

The addresses which begin with \"bc1\" are native segwit addresses. It is preferable to use the segwit addresses as they result in smaller transactions and therefore lower fees. In terms of saving your private keys, I wouldn't at all - I would just write down your seed phrase and be comfortable in the knowledge that the seed phrase can recover all those private keys in the future if you need it to.*Electrum is the most significant outlier here, which uses it's own seed phrase and derivation method. But again, this is widely known and publicized, so even if Electrum no longer exists in 20 years, it would be easy to convert the seed phrase back in to your private keys.",

This never made sense to me, I'm depending on the creator of the software it seems to me.You don't have to rely onto a working product. You have to rely on existing standards.If you generate a BIP39 seed, that should work also in 20 years. If you save a private key, that should also work in 20 years.I agree with LoyceV. For long term holding I recommend you generate the wallet in a safe offline environment with no persistence/storage. Write down (onto paper) the seed or private key, write down the address (or, if it's HD wallet then any address), verify thoroughly what you've written down (maybe use a wallet to recover from seed or private key and see if the address obtained is the same), send your coins there, watch your wallet on online block explorer or import the address as watch wallet. As long as your private key or seed never touches anything online, it should be safe/safer.",

Just one thing I do not like is that we all talk about some standards, the fact that mnemonic phrase is standardized and could be used anywhere - on you phone, on your laptop etc. You may print paper wallet and then import the key in majority of wallets - you are not forced to used the program which was the source of your key.
