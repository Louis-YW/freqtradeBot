Metamask is the \"native\" wallet if you want, metamask is a wallet app and no ETH only wallet, this wallet app can connect to different networks, if they are compatible. ETHW is a ETH fork, so metamask is compatible.I see no point for doing this, if it is really needed, than the Developer of ETHW should do it - but as said - no need for this.Guarda Wallet and Trust Wallet have ETHW support also, Ledger too for example.",

I will have a look in those wallets,I know Trust wallet but it is the first time I see this Guarda Wallet.I am asking this as I want to exchange the ETHW directly to ZIL in a wallet for example Atomic Wallet would have been the perfect choice for me as I have staked more than 5000 ZIL so far and I intend to keep staking them as much as I can,that 15% reward yearly is great for me and if the price of ZIL increases that is much much better.Unfortunately Metamask does not do this as they have not a built in exchange which does even small amounts like Atomic does (Exodus crushes you with huge fees and needs bigger amounts) and that is why I was asking.",

There are a few POS in the top market cap.After BTC and ETH there are a few moderately successful coins like LTC, DASH, but almost all are on a steadylong term decline compared with either BTC or ETH. ETH is the only real challenger to BTC's dominance and it's POS.The BTC clones slowly faded, The ETH clones are doing the same. Previously dominant POW coins are barely inthe top 100 now. New challengers like ZCASH and ZCOIN, that apeared with much hype and marketing have fizzled.They may not be dead but they are not thriving either.But again I stress POW is not the main factor in determining a coin's potential for success.",
