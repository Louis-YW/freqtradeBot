But even when I click on \"unwatch\", the topic continues to come again and again in \"Show new replies to your posts\"Any way to avoid it ?",

You can configure the watchlist to be exactly the same as \"show new replies to your posts\" by configuring your posts to be auto-watched and adding your posted-in topics to your watchlist. After this is done, you can unwatch topics that you don't want to see.If I click Show new replies to your posts. after years of using Watchlist, it looks terrible!",
