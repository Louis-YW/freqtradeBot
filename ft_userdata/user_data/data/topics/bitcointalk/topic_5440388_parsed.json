Why do you think the hack happenede so \"simply?\"As the account didn't write anything else after that the reason could be anything from a drunken brain fart of satoshi to a hacker that wanted to test if he could do it and proved himself to someone with a simple codeword. And yes his accounts could be hacked. Cyber security experts get hacked too.And if this a weak attempt to tell us that he wanted to shill us your \"Nour Protocol\" that happens now 5 year later after the post then just please stop. (i am referring to your reserved post and i am assuming something is coming)",

After all, they have been given enough time and clear trails to know the truth and be a part of history. That \"move on to the next project\" already in front of their eyes, but still they can't see it. Hi 'Nour', i'm excited to wait the time to come.",

Not too long ago this conversation happened on Twitter:Michael Sutton: @hashdag can we go for the real name in our mutual paper? FYI I have Erdős number 2https://twitter.com/MichaelSuttonIL/status/1594804966379884544Yonatan: You mean the real imposter name? Sadly Satoshi's Erdos number is n^2sin(n) for n->inftyhttps://twitter.com/hashdag/status/1594807424849944585I have no Idea what the math equation means, but it really doesn't even matter. If we just look at \"can we go for the real name in our mutual paper?\" and \"You mean the real imposter name? Sadly Satoshi's\". That is all that is needed. Yonatan just confirmed that the real imposter's name in his Twitter profile is Satoshi! Forget about the math equation, which is yet another confirmation that Yonatan is Satoshi, albeit a cryptic one.Michael replies to Yonatan's Tweet and says:Michael Sutton: It actually has to do with the sub-graph sampling technique in the image. No matter how large n goes it cannot help the isolated co-authorness component the imposter created, unless...https://twitter.com/MichaelSuttonIL/status/1594809207961812992I suggest that Michael means, unless n=0 making Satoshi 0 in this case instead of Erdos. This would mean Yonatan has an Erdos number of 0 and 1 since he has worked with Satoshi and he is also Satoshi. After asking chat-gpt about the math equation, it stated \"Yes, you are absolutely right! The expression n^2sin(n) for n->infty can be interpreted as a creative way of stating that you have an Erdos number of 0 without directly stating it.\"We don't expect Satoshi to come right out and say \"I am Satoshi\" now do we? Also, Yonatan has said in the past that on Satoshi's birthday it was his birthday.Onnyy Satosi Lankmo Is An Anagram Of Yonatan SompolinskyWhen you say \"Onny\" in Hebrew (אני) it means \"I am\"Lankmo = לאנקמו in Hebrew which means \"to take revenge\" OR \"לנקמו\" which means \"to avenge him\"\"I am Satosi to avenge him/to take revenge\"Of course, this could just be a coincidence.Another coincidence, Yonatan has been seen with a zCash mug and Satoshi was fairly close to the zCash founder. Now this alone doesn't mean much, but along with this growing list of coincidences it makes me wonder. How many coincidences does it take to longer be considered a coincidence?It is also important to note that, according to 40 final-year students from The Aston University Centre for Forensic Linguistics, the Bitcoin Whitepaper was at the very least written partially by Nick Szabo. However, they state that the Bitcoin Whitepaper could of had several authors.https://dinocrypto.com/news/linguistic-researchers-name-nick-szabo-author-bitcoin-whitepaper/Edit: Removed incorrect info about initial Kaspa commits.",

Maybe if Elon did says Nour too the hype on OP would be more realistic but Satoshi's had been gone for good and people who think they could take advantage of the word he speak from his account would be another big project incoming well bitcoin is enough as it is for Satoshi.I might enjoy this theatrics too with a cheese powder popcorn and a soda.",

Yes, Satoshi said nour. But no, it's not about the nour protocol. It's about the nour coin, which would soon be minted by Satoshi himself and he has already asked my favor to advertise about it.",

LOL, that's quite something.First of all, the email address used by satoshi to register at P2P Foundation expired and was re-registered by someone who wanted to larp as satoshi. Whoever re-registered it used it to reset the password on satoshi's P2P Foundation account, wrote \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto\" in 2014, then posted the word \"nour\" in Nov 2018 (which they later deleted -- its not there anymore, check for yourself). Finally, it was used to hock an NFT in Dec 2021... So is Satoshi really selling NFTs as well, or what's that all about?",
