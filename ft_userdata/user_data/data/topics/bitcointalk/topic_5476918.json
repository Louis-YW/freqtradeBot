A true bitcoiner can know Jamie is wrong without to receive any message from any big celeb like Michael.I think Jamie even is not thinking wrong about Bitcoin. It is only his words of mouth is wrong but in deep of his brain and mind, he can think something differently.Jamie reminds me about Barry Silbert.Crypto Firm DCG, CEO Barry Silbert Seek Dismissal of Gemini Lawsuit They Dub a  SmearIn Bitcoin's Barry Silbert, A Prosecution Waiting To HappenIf Barry engaged in ETC pump game, how did he ignore Bitcoin?I can not trust Jamie Dimon because of similar reason.JP Morgan's Dimon says bitcoin 'is a fraud'JP Morgan to give all wealth clients access to crypto funds.",

Definitely, they are providing analysis for crypto; they even created their coin, etc. This gives a clue that all this is info is for manipulation.They want to outperform Bitcoin, but they can't!",

      "body": "Personally, if I were Micheal I won't have taken Jamie's words to heart because it actually doesn't count. People have their different opinions about Bitcoin and from the onset, Jamie has had a strong one against it but it's funny he gives financial advice to wealthy clients to include cryptocurrencies in their portfolio. The same Jamie Dimon in 2021 said  Bitcoin is worthless , but from what I see, he'd accept anything that makes him richer. For me, he's just trying to make himself popular by bad mouthing Bitcoin but that won't change anything.",

There will always be a few outlier stocks that would out pump bitcoin in specific years.",

That's why I still believe in Bitcoin.And we know better what Bitcoin can bring to the lives of many in this field of industry for the majority community here in the crypto space, to be honest, right? Bitcoin will remain at the top of the market and will become a role model for all other cryptocurrencies as well.",

He is allowed to say what he feels and thinks but just because Jamie Dimon said it doesn't make it right. We are not subscribing to it neither are we even considering discussing it as netizens, we condemn it in strong terms and we are telling him to go regulate his house first cause I believe he has one of his extended family member using Bitcoin.",
