Not bad!Quoteyou'd be sending users to clearnet to get the DNS resolution and the redirect.So you'd need a separate, decentralized \"lookup system\" for .onion links. I can imagine this would be something that can be done with a blockchain: all users download all blocks, and once a short name is in there, it can no longer be changed. Then \"duckduckgo.onion\" would expand to it's full URL, but only if they're the first to claim it.",

Thanks, I will check out how Tinyurl works.One potential Tor alternative I found while researching about this topic is i2p, because it supports short links, but question is how many people are using it and I never tried it.There is no easy way for me to say someone to visit onion website I want, so I guess I could say visit clearnet version and than find onion links in footer.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 10, 2023, 09:50:56 AMany URL shortener service does the job.

Seems like they aimed for that message to pop up solely on the \"clernet\" domain, but somewhere along the line, the dev had a little slip-up.But that doesn't matter. I don't think \"Onion Names\" is related to SecureDrop directly. They're simply using that feature for their own services, and I stumbled upon their article that explains it. As an example, you can access their SecureDrop instance for CNN at either qmifwf762qftydprw2adbg7hs2mkunac5xrz3cb5busaflji3rja5lid.onion or cnn.securedrop.tor.onion addresses. This means that the Tor browser is somehow capable of translating the \"<name>.securedrop.tor.onion\" URL into the correct real .onion domain. I'm guessing that's the part that dkbit98 is interested in.",

QR code works fine on computer/laptop, but user need to take few extra steps depending on which application they use. The only remaining idea i have is showing image which has both QR code and onion link.Problem with QR codes is they are not always compatible when generated with different programs.I remember I tried to share one Bitcoin address from one app and it was not working because second app was not registering this custom QR code.Quote from: FatFork on August 11, 2023, 04:32:48 PMI haven't been keeping up with the Tor scene recently, so I'm not up to date on the latest developments.
