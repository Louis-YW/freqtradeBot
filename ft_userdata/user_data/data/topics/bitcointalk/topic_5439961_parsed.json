According to the USDC's reserved funds [2], it's full of short term US Treasury Bills, not like BUSD where it's mostly about long term US Treasury Debt, so if BUSD want to de pegged to Dollar, they can't they can't directly sold the US Treasury Debt or they will suffer losses [3].[1] https://blockchainreporter.net/stablecoin-issuer-circle-files-a-complaint-with-new-york-regulator-about-binances-busd/[2] https://www.centre.io/hubfs/2022%20USDC_Circle%20Examination%20Report%20December%202022.pdf?hsLang=en[3] https://paxos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BUSD-Monthly-Stablecoin-Reporting-January-2023.pdf",

For that, some sort of stable coin, preferably accepted by most exchanges, is a must.For all the other cases, yes, the \"good old\" fiat would be better.

It's an unfortunate reality we should not deny.While the migration to bitcoin standard would have been much more beneficial for the citizen, ... that old wisdom you posted tells the story.So we'll get CBDCs. However, as you said, the largest, the \"fittest\" will survive. And we know that the current stable coins are not so fit and, excepting Tether, they're not large either. So.. I don't see why they're bashing them already... unless they really want to implement into CBDCs all the bad features we're afraid of and we're talking about every time CBDCs come into discussion (full control of the state on people's money, from history of transactions to seizing the funds from inside people's wallets).

They just want to get rid of competition before unleashing the horror of their dictatorial digital currency. What they unfortunately have no realized is how futile their attempts will be since we already have Bitcoin. And they will not be able to destroy Bitcoin or its value.

And I don't imagine it would be practical to have two different issuers/operators of the same token.But, at the end of the day, they could also just ditch BUSD altogether and replace it with some other existing stablecoin that SEC/NYDFS don't (yet) have a problem with.",
