  "content": "Hello. If I am almost positive that a person on this forum soon will scam somebody, what should I do?The problem is that the person has not scammed anyone yet! But I am pretty sure it's just a matter of time.The account is a newbie account, so of course won't a person that know how this forum works fall for a scam.But its still bad if a new user get scammed in my opinion.Not long time ago he (thechin0s) scammed another person (newbie).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452318.msg62226312#msg62226312If people look this message : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452318.msg62230136#msg62230136This person have done this before with many other alts.thechin0s: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3506957I think this is thechin0s new account:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3554014 - Madhatters. Why?- Same day and time thechin0s got accused for scamming Madhatters showed up.- And when I look around this Madhatters seems to be able to offer people many things. He answer in many many threads where people is looking to buy stuff.- They talk the same if you look how their messages.- From same speaking country- thechin0s  have sent two merits to Madhatters for random posts.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447572.msg62259924#msg62259924https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452484.msg62255417#msg62255417I don't have 100% proof but I think its kinda obvious that this is the same person, of course I can be wrong then I will apologize and remove this instantly.What should I do? Just leave it? It looks like he have done a lot of scamming on this forum and it would be great if that ended.Since Madhatters has not scammed anyone yet it's wrong to give any negative feedback, but I want people to be aware and careful.UPDATE 19/07-23Now MadHatters got his first feedback, it's negative and a bit strange. - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=3554014Seems to have some kind of been with a Full member that in his feedback got accused for some kind of account selling/buying.Post-Cosmic just did (the one that gave him the feedback)This user's password was reset recently.This user recently woke up from a long period of inactivity.( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458374.msg62498489#msg62498489 )",

I haven't looked deeply at the coincidences you have shared. However, this isn't enough to call someone other people's alt. So, it doesn't make sense to tag someone.

I cannot prove anything and that is right because i just suspect so the thing I can do and did is to warn people. You have 100% right  But just I thinking like this is better to prevent a scam from maybe happen instead of wait until it happen and then post that the scam have happen, because I think this scammer wont care, just create a new account and not pay back the money he/she scammed the victim of, this seems to be a person that has create many alts and scam a lot of people to get this one out of the forum could do a little change to the positive.If the account MadHatters have honest intentions then it should be no problem to show that in the future trades with using a reliable escrow provider or go first with a member that have good feedback and if so happens a couple of times, this all will be removed and apologized.",
