  "content": "I used to think donating to a bitcoin reserve was a dumb idea. I was wrong, it's powerful as hell, not at all a sad second place to redenominating gold reserves or something. The debt worries everyone in this country, crossing political lines.Ask people to compete to erase it, by contributing bitcoin (directly or in $).Gamify it with leaderboards. By individual. By city and state. By company.A high ranking is a public signal of giving back, and of wealth. That is worth $$$. What company won't want to be top 10? 100? Number 1? Number 1 in their state, or city? They will compete for it.Everyone gets a ranking. Everyone can boost theirs, with just a few $.Rankings are denominated in bitcoin, not $. Contributing early is key!Allow DCAs, even if only a few dollars a month.Give every contributor a page showing their contributions and gains.This will also expose the population to participating in bitcoin, and to its value add over time.This could be a perpetual sat black hole.Even if other countries don't pick up on the idea. If successful, they certainly will!What do you think of this idea?And I know, I know, it would be rich for this administration in particular to ask citizens to help pay down the debt, when they in particular are one of the chief contributors, with the reckless and corrupt cuts/giveaways to the rich and corporations. As always, one works with what one has.",

Fed gov downsize its employee roster. and put savings into paying down debtb. Fed gov sell derelict public sector buildings (due to less staff/less departments)c. when fed makes $$ demands on states. states use their BTC reserves instead of state taxes to pay fed costsd. use non tax income such as DMV permits(+other public services not free) at state level and entry visas/passports at fed level to buy more BTCthis would allow:there to be more treasury funds to pay public services and not require adding more debt(a+b+c)more BTC shifting to the fed bitcoin reserve without costing taxpayer(c+d)oh wait.. dang it i just stole trumps ideaummm.. ok heres an idea that trump has not mentioned about debtif the US owes china Z billion in US bonds. and china owes [other country] Y billion in chinese bondsand [other country] owes US X in [other country] bonds.. how about a triangular deal whereby if:US writes off [other country] X debt[other country] writes off the X amount from Y to china then china can write off X amount from Z to the US. bringing down the debt that wayand as for the BSRwhen the us gov puts a sanction on another country. make it a requirement for other country to give the US BTC",

Maybe it's not the taxation or donation that the government should focus on to, rather they need to make an efficient money spending and cut the really unnecessary things.",

I don't like asking everyday citizens either. But the wealthy and corporations share a huge portion of the blame. They donate and lobby for tax cuts for themselves, which has blown up the budget. They enjoy the benefits, and we enjoy the resulting debt, which now threatens our currency and national security. They can give the most, and benefit the most, with a positive press release issued at every donation.",

(not having to pay $20k \"tax\").. realise you already paid the $20k tax as a \"donation\"so you gained nothing you still only have $80k left....the only time a donation to charity is beneficial, is if YOU OWN said charity too..EG clintons pay 20% into the CLINTON foundation to then not pay the government 20%however.. if you are paying government 20% donation to offset paying the government 20% tax.. you gain nothing",

If so, many of our countries would not have debt. QuoteAsk people to compete to erase it, by contributing bitcoin (directly or in $).Gamify it with leaderboards. By individual. By city and state.

The government is now too corrupt to the extent that everything they do that involves finance is considered a trick to swindle huge amounts.
