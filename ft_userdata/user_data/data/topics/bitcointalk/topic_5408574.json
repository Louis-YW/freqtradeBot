Is this good to hold? I'm not really sure, but I heard that staking this coin is dead already?And then there are people saying that the people behind is not that active. And looking at the price in coinmarketcap, just like the majority of the coins that we have right now, it is down 78.88%So just be careful though, it can go up in price, but it might not be natural and could be a simple pump and dump scheme.",

If you aware with the history of cloud mining site in crypto was really bad. So many cloud mining became scam and gone. This token is a high risk token. Backed by hashrate that you didn't even know whether that was real or pure a ponzi scheme. This token is also being used as pump dump token by some whales. It's better avoid to deal with this kind of token.",

I think it should not be bought above 10$ because we have seen other coins like Bond and Wings which were spikes to 40$+ and then down to origin value below ten.Btcst was trading at 8$ price and then Suddenly whale pumped it to 40$ and now it's trading above 20$ but I deal fear that very soon it will go down to 10$ again.",

If a project is not getting a enough attention, the volume of trade will reflect it because whether supply is fixed or not, it should attract buyers that like that project based on the need.

You can invest in these low-cap projects, but there is no guarantee that it will be safe even if it is listed on Binance.

You must not be surprised about that. Some people were thinking that was a shit token that has not yet listed in big exchange sites. Some people may pass this token once he was seeing the name from this token. Bitcoin standard hasrate token. That name looks very unfimiar for people. im sure they are thinking if that was a fork coin like bitcoin gold.",

Never get stuck with tokens that have a relationship or name with bitcoin, because for sure they will not be able to do what ever happened to bitcoin itself, usually this kind of token will lose popularity along the way, and personally I just found out about this from you, these numbers may change as they travel in the market.So you should be careful in taking part in the coin, analysis and self-observation are needed for decision making",
