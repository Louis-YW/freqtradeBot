How was it became possible that you weren't eligible for their airdrop? You said that you've spent transacting on their chain but you got nothing? Did you provide them with liquidity as that's one of the main tasks for those that want to be part of their testing? I just saw them from someone on other groups that have posted about this airdrop and it seems that this still doesn't get old. But it's also risky just as what happened to you, it's like those airdrop receivers are like lucky because finding a project like this is hard these days.",

People just lucky to have those money spent just to take part in during the early supporters time period, now all those are being paid off. I have doubt it will be a dollar price when listing comes.",

Some market experts say that the price of this token if compared with Optimism. Here if compare the price of ARB and Optimism, Arbitrum is much higher than Optimism on Daily Transaction . And  If we talk about active Address, Arbitrum is also more active Address on daily basis then Optimism. Arbitram has hyped in the market at the moment and looking at the Diluted Market Cap, it is estimated that its price will be close to one dollar. Some experts say that Its price is  to be from $0.50 to one dollar. As far as buying is concerned, when the token launches, many people who got free tokens will sell it. And the price will crash. When the price falls.  You can buy it there.The lower the price crashes, the better price to buy۔",

I have got an allocation of  4850 ARB coins. I started doing these mainnet tasks in January 2023. But when I checked with my friends, they have been doing these tasks since January 2022. But they did not receive the ARB airdrop. When it comes to your point, you have to do a market cap analysis to predict the price of an ARB coin. My price is around 0.25-0.35 cents for now.",

They prefer to keep airdrop a secret because if everyone knows the rules, we know what can happen next. Yes, that's right,  it will only be abused but I wonder why the OP already know that he can't get any airdrops? Is there a verification or something to tell if someone is qualified for the drop or not?If there isn't any, you guys shouldn't lose hope and just continue interacting on arbitrum during the last minutes before the airdrop distribution starts. 10 billion tokens is already huge but if it's only an initial supply then the price expectation for this coin is lower than usual but if one owns a significant amount and then the coin pumps even just a little, that might still give us a decent profit.",

With a hefty 10billion in max supply there will be dump, 1$ price per token makes sense more than a 10$ per token, too unrealistic in this type of market condition, Arbitrum is big but do not buy at insane price, some people did this with OP token and it dumped later to 0.5$ per coin.",

I'm not familiar about this project that much, but it looks like a good one since its supported by many. I'll just monitor ARB this week and see if the it lives with the hype, if ever congrats in advance to those who have this already.",
