Most old graphics cards will probably not be much inferior in profit to new graphics cards like RTX 4060. My plus is that I will turn my equipment back on if mining is profitable. The maximum investment is a new SIM card for the Internet. My equipment has already paid for itself. But new miners will need to buy new video cards again.",

But new miners will need to buy new video cards again.Old gpus will be inferior in profits, but if we get a bull run + a mineable coin pumping, maybe we'll have a chance, like until last year people were making profits with Polaris cards, 2 generations older.It's a pain to buy all the cards again, and hard to predict when to buy, but last time I was lucky, I bought at good time, I paid MSRP prices, mined some time, and I was able to sell most of my cards in profits.That was a time when I sold some cards because the profits I had I would need to spend 1 year mining, so I prefer to sell and have some cash in my pockets  Quote from: Crypt0Gore on December 23, 2022, 11:03:07 AMBy 8 am in the morning I already have 1200 watts available and by 1pm I am always at 5600watt in a not too sunny days , my setup is 6000 watt combined and my graphic cards don't consume much energy, I have been running the rigs since 2022 January, I don't bother you mine at night I use the backup for other thing, not worth running on battery since it's not even profitable.
