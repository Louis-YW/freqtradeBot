CryptoPlatz it is not a wallet, it is a storage to save you seed recovery phrase. CryptoPlatz it is compatible with Trezor, Ledger, Exodus, TrustWallet and any other wallet that demand you to save the seed recovery phrase on a paper. Thank you for your view, help us a lot!",

But if you store your seed in CryptoPlatz Card, he can't ready and stole, because is encrypted.\"Card on this video doesn't look like it's made from stainless steel to me.\"1) Yes, you are correct. This is a prototype in PVC. Because that we are on https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cryptoplatz-card to manufactory in metal stainless.About competitors I agree with you too.I will lock the other topic, tnks.",

The card is not to spend crypto, there is another options to this, like Coinbase Card and Binance Card. CryptoPlatz Card it is to save you passphrase or mnemonic on a device more resistant than a piece of paper.The password is optional, if you use, will be encrypted.You can use PGP and others ways, you are right again. But CryptoPlatz App are focus on the end user, that need to keep his \"seed passphrase\" store safe, but don't have the skills to do this alone. Let me know, where you save your passphrase today, on a paper?",

I agree with you, it is important to have more than one backup of seed recovery phraseWhen compare with metal plat, there are a lot of benefit, but the most important is you can save the passphrase encrypted with AES-256. So if anyone put the hands on the card, they can't read the passphrase.Take a look in the post comparing the pros and cons: https://www.cryptoplatz.ch/post/safe-guard-your-crypto-assets-with-fool-proof-seed-phrase-storage-1https://static.wixstatic.com/media/25ca25_a9bb756c121d4f05ac282ab6793706e7~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_1130,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/25ca25_a9bb756c121d4f05ac282ab6793706e7~mv2.png",

Is it a plain text (words) or for example entropy (as seed words <-> entropy are exchangeable). But it would require an algorithm inside the application which would \"understand\" the seed words (verify checksum etc). And I suppose it would not support seeds other than BIP39, maybe would be even limited to English dictionary. Much simpler would be to store any text provided by user, without parsing it.",
