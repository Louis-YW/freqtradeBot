If this was 8 years ago then I would have agree to this but most people dont even look at all those provably fair games anymore but rather most flock to the 3rd party slots. All those provably fair games are totally boring in exclusion to some games like the original crash game from moneypot/bustabit but we could take an example like roulette thoughRoulette has its own version of provably fair and 3rd party providers but normally most people will always choose the 3rd party roulette especially live roulette because its more entertaining at some sense",

Virtual games have Risk, and it's always understandable that most virtual games are  pure luck, so to a large extent you might have a point in saying some of the games are rigged to favour the casino companies but on the other hand you should know that this game is purely on your  prediction luck.I think the government  might be a bit handicap on this issue, if you decide to take it up. Because it can be argued that, you knew how volatile the virtual games are, but yet you choose to go for it.",

Even though the casino can cheat, they won't be too serious about it, especially if the game comes from a third party. Casinos know that everything can be proven, and they may welcome people to try to prove the proven fairness. And it will depend on each gambler, but most gamblers won't think too much about it. To avoid scams from casinos, we have to gamble at trusted, proven, fair, and reputable casinos for our good so that we can avoid these scam casinos.",

I think it is not the case because most of the popular game providers and developers do not seem to care about it, and casinos do not want to start to restrict those providers, out of fear of their platforms not becoming as competitive as others. It would take many casinos to get together and pressure those providers onto making their games probably fair. I doubt they would go as far as making them open source, which would be ideal for us, but not so much for them",

How can it passed and who will decide? So there are a lot of grey areas for this proposal though.

I agree with you it's a pity that a decade has passed and things haven't really changed about that matter. And to be honest I don't understand why slot providers don't try to implement this technology if they're honest and transparent. Are they afraid to lose players by proposing things too complex for the average Joe? Do they think users will play less quickly and then fewer rounds at the end if they check the outcomes or if they often change their client seed? Or they are afraid to make them more concerned about their PnL and the RTP of the game? I think things could change in the coming years when people will become more familiar with cryptos thanks to the adoption of CBDCs in some countries.But meanwhile if you want to play almost provably fair games at casinos, the easiest way is to play live table games, especially card games or dice ones.
