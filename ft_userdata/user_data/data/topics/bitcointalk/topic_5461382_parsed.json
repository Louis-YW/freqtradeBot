  "content": "Right now, there are a bunch of fearmongers, fun ruiners, fat guys like Eliezer Yudkowsky, and chlurmcks who know absolutely nothing about anything who want to ban AI because they think that AI will destroy humanity. There are also a lot of AI corporatists who do know stuff about AI but they want everyone else banned from using AI so that they can have a monopoly. The only sensible way to deal with this madness is to innovate as fast as possible so that as much AI will be let loose before anyone can ban it.Here is what we need to do.1. Invest in reversible computation. Reversible computation is the future of computation (mainly the hardware, but reversible algorithms are also important), and it will be the future of AI. You should start by learning about reversible computation.2. Be careful who you listen to. Do not listen to anyone talk about AI who has not gone on the record about the virtues of reversible computation. Reversible computation is the future, so anyone interested in AI who is unfamiliar with reversible computation is a crackpot. In fact, you should not listen to any news or anything like that because it is all hype. All clean energy, nuclear fusion, quantum computing, and most AI is hype. If people really cared about innovation, they would be just as interested in reversible computation.3. Innovate or at least invest in innovation. Develop your own AI algorithms. Invest in those developing their own AI algorithms. And by innovation I do not mean replacing ReLU with a continuous approximation of ReLU or changing a few hyperparameters. I mean trying to replace neural networks with something else for at least some ML tasks.4. Improve AI safety just enough to keep most the cry babies at bay. You cannot please all of the cry babies because some of these cry babies have lost their minds. But some of them are sensible to respond and by satisfied by innovation in AI safety. Of course, not all AI safety research is suitable for our purposes. We need to invest in AI safety research that helps us understand and improve our AI systems so that we can have more fun (but do it safely). We should not invest in AI safety that just amounts to fearmongering, imagining scenarios that will never happen, and making scary stories. We should invest in AI safety research that allows us to understand and control the AI systems more.5. Improve yourself and humanity as much as possible. This is probably really hard for most people because most people are absolutely disgraceful, pathetic, and exceedingly evil, but take care of yourself. Think about it. Who is the most afraid of AI? Pathetic people. That is right. Pathetic people realize that they are too incompetent to stand up to an advanced AI system. People with low self-esteem are the most afraid of AI. But if you realize that you are pathetic and cannot improve yourself, then you should just humbly admit that the AI is better than you. You should therefore rejoice that you are being replaced by something that is much better.Don't work for OpenAI since they are scamming people with cryptocurrency scams. Don't invest in FTX. If you put money into FTX, then you are one of those pathetic people that I am talking about. Don't take money from FTX. If you did, then you took dirty money since you are one of those pathetic people I was talking about. Good bye.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

Good bye.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Since the emergence of AI, there has been numerous opinions and debates about this technology. I, personally, believe that AI is actually a great invention that we can put into good use. It's only a matter of how can we utilize it- properly. Afterall, everything has its boons and banes. And you're right, we just need to improve AI safety and AI researches, and maybe in the future we can add up AI policies so we can make sure that AI are being used properly and accordingly.

      "body": "All of the AI safety crybabies need to open up their wallets and give me all of their money except for what they need to buy the basic necessities. They can sponsor my work on AI safety here where I will use my mathematical expertise to develop safer AI algorithms. The reason the crybabies have not done so is that they really do not care at all about AI safety. They instead just want to yell at people and control other people because they are psychopaths.https://github.com/sponsors/jvannameI have been working on AI systems where the gradient ascent generally converges to the same local maximum. My AI systems also satisfy several other properties. For example, I have just been observing AI systems where the eigenvalues of a completely positive superoperator are symmetric under 120 degree rotations. Yes. The machine learning learned symmetry. If the local optimum that we get is always the same thing and just depends on the data and if it behaves mathematically, that means that it is SAFER to use. My AI can also be used to interpret other AI systems. Have you ever thought of finding a cluster of dimensions in a layer of a neural network? Being able to cluster neurons inside a neural network is kind of important, so you should give me money so that I can continue to do the necessary AI research.I agree that bans can only work in specific parts of the globe. They will not be effective world wide unless there is a world dictator, but we don't want that because it is better to die. The next best option is to support AI safety research.",

And most of them probably will.Bravo for you! My TV died about ten years ago, and I never went back. You've cut off a large piece of the Internet. You've been fasting for a whole 'month'! Of course, if you watch TV, the fast isn't very beneficial.",

They are just being rude and wanted to kill the joy that we have right now despite they know the benefits that it could give us when we used it for good. What they want to emphasize is the other way around when others wanted to develop it to use for deadly weapons which will not gonna be alright for the future. It will cost us lots of trouble and might be ended up to the point the human race will be extinct because of it. refer to the game Horizon Zero Dawn, you will have a glimpse of the future they are worried about.",
