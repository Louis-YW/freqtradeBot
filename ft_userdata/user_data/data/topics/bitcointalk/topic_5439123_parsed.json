  "content": "We know that USA control oil trades through USD.We Also know that USA financial instutions want to get more in to btc and crypto.For example CME benchmark added more crypto currencies like ltc,avax,sol and more.In order to run currency you need to connect currency with something wich Are sacred the resource wich is limited either gold oil or btc.Yes it's de-dollarisation of USD from oil but it's in dollarsation to BTC.People talking USA empire lose but they don't realise USA will have more control over the world through crypto.20-30 years Ago most wealth the oil kings Made becouse they got early in to oil.Now from here the most of the wealth Will be Made not with oil but with crypto the next 20-30 years.The joint operation of UAE and USA moving in btc and crypto now it means big guys invest first before the crypto becomes Even bigger then it is now.The instutions actions show us what are the big Money guys real attentions.Whoever runs the country of USA he or she is very smart while all the world Will de-dollarisation of USD they don't realise that move is the check mate in this chess game on favoure the USA off course most people not smart like i am who can see and analyse everything.The sad truth is all other Industries Will collapse and crypto Will be only what Will shine.And while people move out of USD and oil they move in crypto and btc they dont realise that's the USA new plan becouse it's the USA markets and Fed who control crypto and btc.",
