This is die to the fact that ethereum made available, the first open source and public turing complete system for blockchains which solved an inherent problem with Bitcoin — which is the ability to write native applications on top of bitcoin. As someone who writes and reads solidity code and have played around with the EVM and other nitty gritty details of the technology, it is easily my most loved crypto (Bitcoin is #1). Ethereum pioneered the development of at least 80% of the top 100 cryptos right now on coinmarketcap since all of those are either EVM-based, an improvement to EVM, L1, L2, etc.",

These has been posted here already so no need to duplicate several related topic but to concentrate on a particular one and make it more attractive.There are thousands of alrcoin out dere. But depending on the individual different. Despite the low quality review of Many people on altcoin I think there are still useful ones with great future like I said before BNB is a good altcoin because it has been funtioning as a fuel in many wallet, meaning it serves as a transaction fee in coin swapping as smart contract.",

The reasons I likr it most is its strong and robust use case, unrivaled by any other altcoin. It is the leading coin of alts market because its network is utilized for deploying smart contracts, creating dApps, digital arts (NFTs) and many mores. The problem with Ethereum network is its comparatively high transaction fees, which is likely to come down after upcoming upgrades.",

You are absolutely right, there are lot of other. coins in meme coins sector those can potentially yield good profit in the bull market, such as meme, floki and shiba inu. However, there is prevalent perception  that meme coins are generally associated with pump and dump schemes, as they are primarily used for fun purpose. In stead, I would recommend to invest in those alt coins which have strong use case, such as Ethereum, Chain Link, Solana and Dot.",
