But then, why the edit? I'm not sure how moderation worked back then, but this post seems unlikely to have contained a spam link or anything objectionable.Any insights appreciated!

But I'm not sure if that was an old forum (SourceForge) thing or not, which would predate this post, I think?Either way, I don't think it matters much, because I can find examples of posts that were both made and edited by \"Anonymous\" or made by \"Anonymous\" and then edited by \"davidonpda\" (like this one). But this is the only example I could find (so far) of one edited by \"satoshi\", although I admit I haven't looked thoroughly/carefully.",

Well, I am kidding. Yeah, I agree with you. As long as founders and developers have control over their coin, they can make it better and worse. In most cases, It will be worse because everyone wants to do business in this market. Bitcoin is different in this case. No one can control it. At least, not a person. Am I going off-topic?",
