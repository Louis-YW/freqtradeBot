Considering April - July, Bitcoin sold sharply in April, May and June, it is July that is experiencing a bullish market, and it is almost impossible for it to be bearish anymore this month.Some investors must have lost a fortune due to this development, yet Bitcoin might recover it soon. Also, as an investor, one should get prepared for the worse, and it is not reasonable to leave your investment unattended for four months if I must say. Regular checking along with regular analysis that could guide on better decisions making is the best.",

      "body": "You will see the market is very good if you look at it after 4 years, 8 years. It helps you to skip all pumps, dumps, crashes, fluctuations, etc. and you will be able to hang out, enjoy your life.4 months is too short and if these 4 months are in a bearish market, you will likely get negative emotion and maybe do stupid orders that will cause loss.Market can have minor and major psychological cycles but focusing on major cycles will be better. Like now, we don't have to be headache with what happened in whole of 2017 year. We will consider it the same in 2024 or 2025 when we look back at the market in 2022.",

      "body": "I guess all of us will agree on that last picture. We all have different sentiments during the bear market, those that don't like it because we want only to see the market prosper. While there goes the people that like seeing the bear because they're always stacking at these times.Some odd moments for those that haven't checked their portfolios not just for 4 months but for years and they've bought earlier than 2020 and for sure that out of coincidence, they're in profit. I guess there's some story on this board like that.",
