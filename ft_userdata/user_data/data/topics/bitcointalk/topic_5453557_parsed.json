  "content": "The feelings is bad as a newbie when I would have been enjoying an article but suddenly the image will not show because the forum is not working with Imgur anymore. It happened again today when I was reading an article, but I found a simple solution to it if you so are so interested since the authors are not bothering to replace the pictures.N.B: The example is just for an explanation, it is not targeted towards anyone. I again removed the / from [/img] to stop it loading like an image.How to view the image:Click on the edit bottom on the image, it will show a thing like this: [img]https://i.imgur.com/d4bQG17.png[img]Just remove the [img] and [img] from the left and right sides.It will look like this: https://i.imgur.com/d4bQG17You should go ahead to copy and paste it on your browser to view the image.---Simple but some suffers from not been able to view such---",
