The page will reload with that post's message number in the URL (the last 8 digits). Copy these digits, but don't close this window yet.2) In the thread you want to post the quoted message in, click on \"quote\" on any post. Once that reply page loads, paste your copied 8 digits over the 8 digits in the URL after \"quote=\". Hit enter to reload your reply page with the locked post quoted.3) Go back to the window from step 1 containing the message you want to quote. Copy the 7 digits after \"topic=\". Go back to the window from step 2 containing your new reply, and paste these 7 digits over the 7 digits after \"link=topic=\" on the top line of your reply. This is to ensure the quote links back to the correct thread if someone clicks on it.",

The extension can technically read any data from your BitcoinTalk session, including your PMs, but it doesn't do so. It collects user IDs from the page you're looking at - e.g. a list of posts in a thread - and sends that list of IDs to bpip.org to get info about those users, and only does so if you turn the optional features on (these features are off by default).The extension works even if you browse BitcoinTalk.org without being logged in. The source code is not obfuscated and can be examined by anyone with sufficient JavaScript knowledge using developer tools built into most browsers. Same tools can also be used to check network traffic to/from the extension.but it's very effective when login if not Quote to clipboard is disappear.",

Apart from this extension, are there any other extensions that can be added to this forum? and of course for other uses.Another way to quote posts on the locked thread (manually):- Open the post link you want to quote (not the thread link).Examples of post links on the locked thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.msg61293646#msg61293646- Quote any post that is still active. For example, I take by quoting your post:- On the screenshot above, change the code in red box A with the code in red box 1, then press Enter. - Finally, change the code in the red box B with the code in red box 2.Here are the results of the quote:Quote from: theymos on November 15, 2022, 02:36:52 AMWhen you log into an exchange, yield platform, or other site, and it says that you have a balance of \"1 BTC\" or \"1 USD\", this does not actually mean that you have 1 BTC or 1 USD. Rather, it means that the company showing you this balance owes you that money. In other words, you've given a loan to the company. Maybe the company will pay you back, but history is littered with defunct companies which accepted deposits and were widely trusted for years, but which ended up not paying back their depositors in the end.To the greatest extent possible, you should always avoid keeping BTC (or anything else) in online accounts. This is especially important right now because a very large exchange went bankrupt recently; this has already caused a contagion effect which has taken down other companies which accept deposits, and this contagion may continue to spread and affect more companies.Ideally, you should keep as large a percentage as possible of your crypto assets in a wallet where only you control the private keys. Electrum for Android or desktops is one good option. For iOS, there's BlueWallet. If you have a large variety of different crypto assets that you need to store, there's Unstoppable wallet. If you have never used your own trustless wallet before, using a mobile app is probably safer than using a desktop app. An even safer option, which you should definitely consider if you have a lot of crypto assets, is to use a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger.Also, note that many altcoins, tokens, and DeFi projects are either fundamentally centralized and therefore about as risky as online wallets, or they are still potentially vulnerable to the recent wave of insolvencies due to the way that they're designed.Click the link in the title (Quote from: ...) to ensure that the post quote is correct.",
