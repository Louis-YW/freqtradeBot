Old luna never reached $40 billion, but that did not change that it can be compared with Bernie Mardoff ponzi scheme which he was sentenced to life imprisonment for but Do Kwon created Luna 2.0 and airdropped those that had old luna. I am not sure if old Luna holders have been airdropped or not.About altcoins, there is nothing hard about them, people have invested in altcoins during bull run, there can be bear market that may last for long, if bitcoin price can reach $20k, altcoins will dropped more significantly. Which means it is not good to hold altcoins for now. Wait for the next bull run can be good for someone not to fall into the trap of a coin that will not reach the price when bought.",

It is amazing that there are hundreds of thousands of people who follow the social networks of such so-called experts, who make loads of money by selling you fairy tales. Furthermore, what does a decision in Portugal have to do with anything somewhere in Africa? The idea that Bitcoin should be anonymous or not taxed is meaningless, and Portugal is among the few exceptions, it is only a question of how long it will be able to maintain the law.As for Kwon and the comparison with Madoff, it's not something to compare - although I don't mind this narcissistic hypocrite and cheater going to jail for a very long time. However, South Korea treats such cases quite lightly in my opinion, because as far as I know, he is charged only for non-payment of taxes. I can’t say for sure, but Kwon seems to be some kind of privileged caste in his country, as he obviously doesn’t come from an average family if he could have studied at Stanford (US).@Agbe, please reduce your images to an appropriate size, it is very simple and many will appreciate it.Code:[img width=400]your link here]",

So you wouldn't be forced to sell BTC (hence get taxed).",

To succeed, you must skip short-sighted thinking and ignore inaccurate prediction in short- or medium-term. Because if you strongly believe in short term prediction and set your own speculation and portfolio in, you will get panic when the market turns its direction oppositely to what you think. Worse, if you over-use leverages, you will lose most of your capital by liquidation.Let's focus on Controlled supply",

Random things found on internet shouldn't clog our mind with ultra bullishness which are more harmful. It's better for all of us to be realistic and stay on the ground. Crypto definitely has a long term impact on the mainstream economy. The potential to go much higher than the current level is also justified. But having a timeline around it, is a speculation that may lead to disaster.",

They seem to have discovered the receipt to attract new investors and more funds to their country for the own good of their economy and life standards of their people. If this stance towards bitcoin is kept, they are going to become a very popular destiny for crypto enthusiasts who will be harassed by regulators on their native countries, as new laws are being created and introduced to restrain and difficult the usage of crypto.That Portugal may become a safe and friendly harbor for crypto adopters. Signs are pointing this way since the Madeira region's authority declared he believes in the future and believes in bitcoin. After that, lots of news appeared saying bitcoin was going legal tender at archipelago of Madeira, although the idea was discarded and even considered unecessary by enthusiasts, since bitcoin is already considered \"legal\" there (informally speaking).",
