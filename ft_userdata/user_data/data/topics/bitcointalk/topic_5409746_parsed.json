      "body": "China as a country is different from China as in people. The government is against Bitcoin but the people in China make use of Bitcoin they are many miners in China and they have lots of investment in the ecosystem. Just that volatility made the government ban cryptocurrency to avoid massive number of citizens to suffer from loss of money. I don't think China will regret banning cryptocurrency because the people of China are into the technology and trade on exchanges too. I think the government will regret but the people in China that use and invest in cryptocurrency has nothing to lose. However, I don't know who you are referring to in your post if it's the government or the people.",

And what I really don’t like about China is their censorship activities and having too much control of what the citizens are trying to get in to. Their citizens wanted freedom of speech, but the government prevents that. That is why before the crypto ban, they’ve already implemented the great firewall such as banning Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.",

The fact that lots of Chinese miners started the trend of BTC mining was a threat viewed by their government due to the freedom BTC provided. Due to this, they implemented stringent regulations to the point that it ultimately prohibited cryptocurrencies in their country.Japan, a country known for its technological advancement, is taking advantage of cryptocurrencies by its lenient regulations. They allow its utilization as they see its value in the long-term standard of payment.",

I don't say no effects at all but much smaller and less dramatic than in the past.That nation is a dictatorship so you can not expect their governments do things for goods of their citizens.

They are not the same and you can't call all of it \"crypto\".- Both China and Japan (and almost every other country) have banned token scam schemes including but not limited to ICOs one way or another.- Both Japan and China and many other countries aren't recognizing altcoins and they have placed many restrictions on trading them. In China the exchanges are banned while in Japan they aren't but there is a huge tax on trading altcoins.- Bitcoin is not banned by either one of these countries.- Bitcoin mining is banned in China- Both countries (and almost every other country) are interested in the underlying technology and want to adopt it for themselves like the CBDCs that China has created using the technology.",

So when you see this, you will learn where the China's hatred for bitcoin's come from. I only said  bitcoin because there are crypto that they love specially those home grown or even the latest craze.QuoteChina’s non-fungible token (NFT) industry has published a “self-discipline initiative” that promises identity checks for users, adherence to the country’s ban on cryptocurrencies and a promise not to establish secondary marketplaces to fight speculation.Platforms that sell digital collectibles, the term used in mainland China for NFTs that cannot be traded using cryptocurrency, “shall require real-name authentication of those who issue, sell and buy” the assets and “only support legal tender as the denomination and settlement currency”, reads the 14-article document endorsed by many of China’s biggest tech firms.https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3184021/china-nfts-tencent-and-ant-group-join-industry-pledge-banThey will allow it, but somewhat it will be in close lense, so they will have control of it.But bitcoin? it's a different story, Chinese people can used it to hide their wealth or even could be viewed by the government as tools for \"capital flight\", and obviously, they don't want that outflow of money from their country.",

Of course now they're so called people's party, suggesting that the people are the most important and the people decide, but the idea is exactly to do the opposite. Cryptocurrencies allow you to be independent and that's something the government will never support. Ultimately it's the choice of the people. If they wanted to change the government they'd be able to do it like many other countries in history did with their oppressors but they're too brainwashed thinking they must support the government that protects them from the West.",
