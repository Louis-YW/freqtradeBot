This is the reason why in most cases activity is less than the post count.Quote from: theymos on June 18, 2013, 08:44:42 PMThe activity number is determined in this way:time = number of two-week periods in which you've posted since your registrationactivity = min(time * 14, posts)Rough summary of what this means: If you post once per day on average, then you will eventually get the maximum number of activity points that you can get. Posting more than once per day on average is useless for increasing activity. The maximum number of activity points you can get is 1 per day, but your activity score only updates every two weeks. Therefore, it will take about 100 days to get 100 activity if you post once per day on average.Activity is updated every hour.Calculator created by @TheBeardedBaby: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1khSA28Ab6miwyknp3JvStcL0Yu05SIbGBDZDKcOLO6s/edit#gid=0",
