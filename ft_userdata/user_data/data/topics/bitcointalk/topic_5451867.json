Yes at first cheaper coins with the hope of the coin rising some day can seem to be a smart move, but in reality it’s very risky. So many coins has fell to dust and investors has lost their money investing in those cheap coins.I would rather go for proven coin, a large amount of the money I would put in Bitcoin and the remaining part I would put in Bitcoin again. Bitcoin is the safest option especially when you hate taking risk. (This isn’t a financial advice always do your research).",

As a beginner of the crypto world, he might split it into 50/50 Investment and when he has gotten enough knowledge about the system then he can invest the whole #100,000. That is the low risk management system I can recommend for now.",

Well in my summary, I think the writer is a novice and never had a good knowledge towards bitcoin, for leaving what would change his life for good.

My only potential option if I have N100,000 to invest will be to buy and hodl Bitcoin. My reason is that I have an interest mainly in long-term investment since I already have a trade that gives me daily income. But to answer your questions. Low risk investment: I will consider buying cheap land in a rural area and keeping it for years. I will resell it when the price appreciates. Some farmlands in the interior area of my state can cost less than the amount stated above.Medium risk investment: I will invest the money in buying of raw matreials such as cassava and using it to process garri that will be sold. Garri can be sold profitably in urban areas. High-risk investment: it will be investing all in Bitcoin. Since the price is volatile, the coin is a high risked business. But it will be my first choice because I am not seeking instant profit.",

But if I have a careless 100k that I don't need for a long time, I could possibly put 80% into Bitcoin and the remaining 20k will go into other altcoins, because cryptocurrencies are the only investment that you can possibly dive into with such small capital, Other investments may require structural development which is impossible with such an amount of capital, but once you can calculate the risk of cryptocurrency and can endure through the hustle of holding Bitcoin you can set up such an investment by just buying Bitcoin and holding then keep your DCA calculation accurate keep taking profits.",

While this is true, if someone already has the right knowledge in let's say crypto trading and investment, forex, digital graphic skill, vocational skill, or any other great practical skill that has the potential to yield profits with consistent effort; this #100k could go along way in advancing this course. For me I would invest #100k in this manner;*Buy BTC and trade, if I have the knowledge or HoDL trying out a DCA strategy till after the halving with 40%.*Get an affordable equipment/tech piece for online business with 30%*Use 20% to stock up on utilities, toiletries and groceries mostly in this weather of constant rain, while the balance 10% goes to savings.",
