Sports games can easily be predicted and what makes them predictable will make room for some sort of fixing any way their all gamble the outcome is always based on luck.",

In Italy this happens a couple of time also in Serie A with \"correct score\" betting.As soon as you see a completely out of market odd (lower/higher than normal) on an outcome that has yet to occur, you are clearly facing a fixed match. Personally I don't bet in such event or such odds because \"it's not clear\" what it's going on...",

Most of the time they are right, and even gets the correct outcome of the game down to the last score but it could also be just luck. I mainly spot match fixing events on Dota 2 tier 2/3, especially on the Chinese region where this practice is still rampant. Lost too many bets in trying to get that single win on Chinese qualifiers and tier 2/3 events, and have since avoided events on that region and on that tier like the plague.",

I agree if you are keen on details and you know players and participants and their statistics and have seen them play many times you expect the same performance in every game, but if you see something like intentionally missing the shot and intentionally making mistakes then there's something wrong if a player is having a bad night the coaching staff will replace him but if they insist that he stay on the court, then there's a possibility that even the staff is participating in fixing the game.",

You can easily spot the game fixing if you are very familiar with the members of the team. Because you will know if they are not in their normal performance and just throwing the game.Usually, it is because of the big bets involved. When it comes to boxing, you can also see it how the boxer is doing his punches inside the ring. If you are an enthusiast of a particular sports, spotting the unusual movements of their players would be easy.",

So I will say there are tall tale signs that it is fixed. Could be different at first, but you know when sports bookies notice some swing of bets, that's where the investigations starts specially in basketball, wherein what they call point-shaving. There was one player caught with it and his career was over.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevin_Smith",

What they do though is the obvious, if the horse is known to go on the front at the starting gate, the jockey will simply place them behind and then they will do just leisure holding, meaning they are not going to push the horse unless they are closer in the finish line. Or they will loosely, just hold the saddle and then pace the horse, in short break the horse rhythm or at least not play with the horse strengths.",
