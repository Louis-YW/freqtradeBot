  "content": "I'm making this new thread to focus in support issues and not get derailed with off topic things anymore.Remember that this is by my own initiative, official support is provided by opening a Support ticket, or in the Telegram Group.Official web page is here: https://braiins.com/os/plusVersion changes are here.** Remote install method ** Optional for BeagleBone Black and Zynq, required for AmLogic and Cvitek:- Download the latest Braiins Toolbox for your OS:Linux x86_64 (Intel / AMD PCs, etc).Linux aarch64 (Newer Raspberry PI or clones).Linux armv7 (Older Raspberry PI or clones).MacOS x86_64 (MacOS 12.4 or later).Windows x86_64 (Windows 10 or later).Example downloading, unpacking and running from a Linux terminal in a PC:Code:wget https://feeds.braiins-os.com/braiins-toolbox/assets/latest/braiins-toolbox-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && tar xvzf braiins-toolbox-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && ./braiins-toolboxRunning without options starts a local web server: http://127.0.0.1:8888 point your web browser to it and use the web UI.Run it with option --help to see more options and CLI usage.If you want to access this from another PC in your lan (example you are running it in a headless Raspberry PI), add the -g option to allow access like this:./braiins-toolbox -g 0.0.0.0:8888 and then point your browser to the IP address where the toolbox is running, same port.** Micro SD method ** Optional for BBB and Zynq:- Download the image for the micro SD (max 16g):x17 Zynq/Xilinx/7007 (22.05).S9, S9j, S9i Zynq/Xilinx (22.05).(S9 only) move jumper jp4.- Flash the image from a pc with BalenaEtcher, Rufus or dd.- Insert the micro SD card and reboot the miner.- Log into the miner with a web browser: user root, no password.You can find its IP with bos-toolbox listen + ip report button, or AngryIP / Nmap.â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€”- (Optional) Install to NAND from (System > Status >) System > Install to NAND (Only 22.05 with S9/x17 control boards).(Old) bos-toolbox for S9/S17: Linux x86_64 - Windows x86_64Braiins OS+ is a full replacement firmware made from scratch. Braiins has to figure out hardware support without any aid or documentation from manufacturers, for this reason the number of supported ASIC miners is limited. Braiins takes no shortcuts like others that illegally mod existing firmware and infringe cgminer's intellectual property (see Section 8), therefore its impossible to support new miners that have been just released. It takes countless hours of research and development to support each new variant or model in a manner that is clean, safe and efficient.Braiins OS+ is made in Czechia part of the European Union with the highest standards of excellency.Unlike others who don't care about burning your miners, Braiins cares. Only Braiins OS+ prefers to stop using what it doesn't like, others are \"do it no matter what\" mindset. Long time farm operations save with extended hardware longevity and unrivaled uptime because of this, which is what makes profitable what others lose in downtime and repairs. Also your company won't be liable for the use of pirate software that funnels money to an OFAC sanctioned country. Braiins OS+ is CLEAN, nothing from the manufacturer, nothing from cgminer, designed from the bottom up, not patched with a gazillion holes, mem leaks or a reckless uncaring and ridiculing attitude. Those incapable of writing their own mining software are no competitors, but pirates.Braiins as a company exists since 2011, 13 years of unparalleled experience; and it shows, the industry knows the truth.Since Braiins OS+ release in 2020, the results have always been the best efficiency, often resulting in a \"generation leap\". For example:People who use it with the S9, can make 74 J/TH, same as S11 with stock.People who use it with the S17, can make 29 J/TH same as S19 with stock.People who use it with the S19j, could make 21 J/TH same as S19 XP with stock.People who use it with the S19 XP, can make 18 J/TH same as S21 with stock.People who use it with the S21, can make 15 J/TH same as S21 Pro with stock.Top user provided results so far (dm me on telegram if you want yours added):BM1370 12.2 W/TðŸ¥‡PhrogðŸ¥ˆDmitri KataevðŸ¥‰Seth @ Mott MiningBM1368 17.15 W/TðŸ¥‡Ale!ðŸ¥ˆStanBM1366 18.25 W/TðŸ¥‡Wilson MiningðŸ¥ˆNick â‚¿ä¸°ðŸ¥‰Torsten GoettelBM1362 20.98 W/TðŸ¥‡SadnudbiðŸ¥ˆWeng Hon FongðŸ¥‰Dragos GiuraBM1398 22.01 W/TðŸ¥‡LOCHERðŸ¥ˆPaulo LoboðŸ¥‰MineBTC, NotYourBTCClean, safe, efficient. Braiins OS.For most of 2023, you could have made your XPs achieve the so called 1XJ/T ahead of the manufacturers newest models, by simply using Braiins OS+.Even if you subtract the dev fee, you still get better than others with \"zero fee\". For example 101.2*0.975=98.67 1856.3W/98.67TH=18.81J/T (normalized against \"zero\" fee). By using Braiins OS+, you support the development of a truly independent and clean alternative developed from scratch.The reason why Braiins always achieves the best efficiency is because of its unique autotuning, a deep and continuous process others aren't able to imitate no matter what they claim, since they don't get it and take shortcuts which are inefficient and never adapt truly to your hardware. Its not who does it first, its who does it best. Worldwide market adoption has been overwhelming, and for good reason. Think of cars, what quality you get from Europe, America, China and Russia...And on top of that, enjoy the 0% pool fee by using Braiins Pool. Since you are already paying for Braiins OS+ you get the benefit of using Braiins Pool for free!

      "body": "QuoteActually Frodocooper complained about these bespoke psu's back in 2018 when the s15's came out.And as I said back then: There are 2 reasons for it.1. Using more PCIe connectors to feed a multi-kw mineris a bad idea. Too bulky and already proving needlessly unreliable because of the connectors being pushed to their limit and adding insult to injury them often being plugged/unplugged many times over the life of a miner and or PSU. PCIe connectors have a very small number of mating cycles before they begin seriously degrading.2. Wall plug power efficiency. Today's best Platinum 12vdc PSU's are what - 95% maybe 98% efficient? Now that 12v was being dropped down via a final regulator on each hash board to whatever Vcore is being used. Typical string voltage was what, 7.5 to maybe 9vdc? At best the on-board regulators were *maybe* 85% efficient so...End result is that by losing the 2nd stage Vcore regulator losses using integrated PSU's that directly set the voltage results in more TH/kW plus by using bus bars it eliminates the high current connection problems. Oh, being able to use a higher string voltage lets ya use longer strings of chips so more TH/Current drawn through the string.The main tradeoff is that the PSU is setting the Vcore string voltage for ALL of the boards. Um, since we all know that the ideal voltage for any single board can vary a fair bit, that means the tuning process ends up with the best *compromise* voltage to reliably run the weakest board even though the other boards may perform better with a different voltage.Now as to *why* BM, Â Canaan, et al can't seem to have a more reliable PSU built is a mystery to me. It ain't rocket science to design a multi-kw PSU...Looking at the APW8 schematics posted at https://www.zeusbtc.com/manuals/Antminer-APW8-Power-Supply-Repair-Guide.asp it looks like they use I2C to talk to the PIC in the PSU. Yes the PSU also seems to have two distinct ranges for the DC output: They describe it as 15.9-16.3v and then give an upper range of 19.92-20.5v. Point is, assuming it *does* use I2C and you know what format the commands are sent to it are, it should be easy for some 3rd party to make a compatible PSU. Just have your firmware be able to identify what the hash boards are & need for voltage and talk to the PSU...",

If anyone is like Me, Discarding the PSU and Replacing with a new one seems to be a far better way of doing things than pulling machines apart, sending a single component, waiting (IF they repair them) and having the machines offline for weeks sometimes (Being in Australia is a Pain in this case) and losing out on Hashing.If there is a need for it, I would have no issues getting them produced and stocking them for such cases, and for the Communities to at least have an option to go elsewhere (to Us at CWI as an option) to source PSU units at a reasonable Price and actually being stocked with them - as long as demand is not too great of course.I would be happy to supply a few for testing if that is the case.Just an idea, and I hope I am not pushing an issue here. I know how We are with our machines and it is usually the PSU not the ASIC that dies WAY before anything else does. We have replaced hundreds of them in the last 12Months, which is why I started sourcing 'decent' ones for our Farms.As for the OS - where would one go to request features for the FirmWare?#crysx #cwi",

      "body": "That old trick for the fans no longer works, the script was changed, besides it can't prevent fans going 100% after power is cycled anyway. You could just switch to silent fans from the likes of Phantek or Noctua, make sure the S9 is configured for low power limit.Quote from: philipma1957 on October 21, 2022, 05:38:07 PMso I am looking to do a s19 pro 110th with this hashboardhttps://vmssecuritycloud.com/product/new-authentic-bitmain-oem-s19-pro-s19-t19-control-board/it does not have bugle bone it is xlynxso what is my firmware link to run this and load an sd cardI did an 8db sd card with the x17+x19 firmware and it only mentions s17 and will not allow for programing .so do I load it with the one that say bugle bone.to be a person that does have some interest in running a lot of s19 prosit would be easier if the file just read s19pro rathe than seem to be able to do both s17 and s19.so for now no s19s are using braiinsS19 Pro 110T works perfectly fine.Why would you care what the file is called? Its the same file for both families, of course it works. Beaglebone is for beaglebone only.If you plug the C52 or C49 you can even use it from NAND. If you have the others, you must use it from SD. Others meaning: C87, C84, C71, C55 they all work fine from SD only.I don't like BeagleBones, they work (from SD) but the OS is more crippled, for example autotuning takes longer due to its low spec cpu.S19 XP will be supported in a future release, it doesn't work yet, and its not a mere control board issue.",

      "body": "S9 w Braiins OS+ - haven't been able to connect to Zergpool. I think I'm missing some bit of syntax in the pool info. I am currently running a gekko setup with CGminer, an Apollo, and a couple of CPU's with XMRig - all on zergpool successfully. S9 is currently on another pool and I've mined on CK solo with it before. I've tried everything I can think of to move the S9/Braiins+ to zergpool and it always comes up Pool Dead. I think I'm just missing something with the syntax. Has anyone else experienced this? Interested in assisting my troubleshooting? currently Pool URL: stratum+tcp://sha256.mine.zergpool.com:3333username: bc1...(wallet addess)....zw3gsPassword: c=BTC, ID=ShaRightS9",
