  "content": "Hello, I want to create my own cryptocurrency from Litecoin. I want to change everything to litecoin. Well, I want to ask how to change the blockchain, so I will create a new one. I've seen tutorials on YouTube, but they use version 0.8. I use version 0.21. Does anyone know which files I need to change in order to create a new blockchain from litecoin, put my seed servers there. For several days I have been looking for what and how to change, but so far I have only changed the name and port. If anyone can help, please let me know. Thanks.",

Well, I want to ask how to change the blockchain, so I will create a new one.If you don't know how to create a new blockchain and want to base on Litecoin blockchain, you intend to copy the Litecoin source code and fork it.You don't change everything. What you change can be a coin name, total supply, coin specifications but in basics the source code is the same and is from Litecoin.Time for shit altcoins like that are 2017 or 2018. Nowadays, you won't succeed by copying source code and creating a new coin with no value, no effort of development, no value creation.",
