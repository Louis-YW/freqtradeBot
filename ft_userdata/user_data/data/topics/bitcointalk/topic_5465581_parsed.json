The body camera from the police officer shows how he was asking her to get down from the vehicle and comply. I wish she would have obeyed the police officer's orders so that did would not get killed. Instead, you can clearly see when she stepped on the gas pedal to run over the police officer and avoid being taken to jail. Truly hard to hear that a young mother and her unborn child are dead and now leave 2 children without a mother to look after them. I try to also think about what must have been going through Ta’Kiya’s mind when she was being pointed straight with a gun. I know the police could have also handled the situation differently. Being a police officer is a job and run the risk of getting killed in the line of duty.",

      "body": "This is really heartbreaking news. I can't help but feel deeply for Ta'Kiya Young's family and everyone close to her during this incredibly tough time. Losing a young life and the life of her unborn child is a tragedy beyond words. This absolutely needs a thorough investigation and accountability here, and I genuinely hope justice comes swiftly. This loss reminds us how urgent it is to push for reforms and better training within US law enforcement to prevent such devastating incidents in the future.",

The police represent the law and it is necessary to obey their instructions. Based on the video, it appears that the woman attempted to drive away before the police officer fired the shot. My condolences go out to her family, and I hope they find the strength to cope with their loss.",

      "body": "There is no doubt that the police is doing their duty because the police is responsible for our security, but the police opened fire and he died.Police or other security personnel should be more aware and aware enough of their duties so that any serious accident can be avoided.I also agree if he is not killed It is very sad that their families would not have to see this disaster Only one knows what the state of a mind of the police was when they fired the gun, but for a duty, many things are forced to be done.I am very saddened by his death and the loss of the family.Thank you very much for reporting such a tragic news, we came to know through your link.*mich(op)*",

There is police in the world to make sure the citizens follow the laws.And they do represent he law and we must respect them for their job they do. I think it just makes the story more sad because of the unborn child that will never get a chance for life.",

Officer responded in kind. Tone? Please so stupid, she was approached normally, her failure to comply lead to the escalation and in kind response. Stop defending criminal activity. If that was you family member attacked with a lethal car you would feel different. \"Oh I am glad my son died being run over by a criminals car, at least he didn't yell at him, what a good biy he was\"",

I wish she just would comply and then we would not even have to talk about it. It could be just a ticket or some small time to spend in jail. This is better then death and death of the unborn child. It is sad to call her a 'criminal'. But it is what she was acting as. If you do not listen to the police instructions well then you are being a 'criminal'.",
