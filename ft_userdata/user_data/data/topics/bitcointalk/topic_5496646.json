The Party wants everything for themselves and close to nil to the billions of people in the Mainland, they can't care less as long as Mao's decrepit legacy's is intact, that's where the CCP will try to go.",

That is why it is using it's satellite HK to deal with everything related to cryptocurrencies. What this news media is discussing is just speculations and nothing of that will happen in the future in the mainland. The CCP has placed a ban on everything related to crypto still they are trying to lure the community with friendly rules and regulations. They are benefitting with this approach then why will they change their policies, you should question yourself?",

What do those ETF have to do with a decentralized p2p currency and being your own bank?Oh, yeah, it has to do with money!",

Nothing can surprise me when it comes to China, but I think that Bitcoin has finished its story there, at least for a long time.Quote from: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lacking-access-mainland-chinese-investors-201738822.html“A lot of people are banking on wealthy Chinese locals, but, officially, you cannot buy this ETF if you're a mainland Chinese investor,” said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg. That’s because it must be listed on something called the Stock Connect, which allows Chinese citizens to invest in certain Hong Kong ETFs, and vice versa. “This will never be available there,” says Balchunas.",

It is not new to read threads like this, were people believe that the policies the governmnet of China has about BTC and crypto could be changing for the better, but it always turns out to be false, just like this present case will.The etf approval in HK isn't even a big one, and people should not expect the price to pump like it did in reaction to the approval in the U.S, the inflows are very different and incomparable.",

They have seen clearly that even if they banned btc or crypto, its market still continue to proliferate outside their country. So even if they say they are one of the powerhouse, they have no control of what will happen to cryptocurrency market. And that we can't deny because btc continues its adoption when they shutdown their doors to this market. They thought the world of crypto will stop but the opposite happens.",

Trading crypto is banned in mainland China, and there are still a few other crypto bans in China that so many of us do not know, or that is confusing to us because of how the country runs. However, none of this will be lifted because of what is going on in HK, and citizens in mainland China cannot take part in it.[1] https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-bitcoin-etfs-mainland-china",
