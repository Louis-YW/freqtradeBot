Trading and hodling are all good investment in the cryptocurrency space. If the person is very good in trading, knowing well when to close the open the trade and when to close it them trading is good because it will be giving you daily income to your wallet. But there is no way you will succeeding in the trade everyone. There are sometimes you will also loss so I will prefer taking hodling for a specific years and reap it in the bull market.Though many people will choose trading over hodling because of the risk involved.",

Trading is good, but if you are doing it, let it not just be where you see it as your only source of income; otherwise, you might put emotion into it and want to make profit all the time, and that can cause one to experience more losses.While trading for a short-term profit, it's wise to have some Bitcoin held in your portfolio because it'll give you more profit if you hold until a bull market. I don't have time to keep analyzing the market and improving my trading skills; that's the reason I just took some breaks.",

Yes you are correct trading and holding are both very good but the need for knowledge is what Distinguishes the two because trading is not just something to rush into because it requires a lot of knowledge learning and developing a strategy that will be well suitable for him, and also the knowledge to understand the fundamental and being able read the technical analysis of the market because unlike holding the possibility of losing your funds on trading is very high. However holding doesn't require much knowledge because all he only needs is just the basis, so for me I belong to the group of holding.",

Through trading, you will miss the real profit. For instance, you can buy Bitcoin at a low price and sell back when the price goes up to make some profit, for you to buy Bitcoin again you will have to wait for the Bitcoin price to retrace so that you will buy at a low again and sell when the price goes up, unfortunately, the price of Bitcoin didn't dump and it kept going up to the extent of were you can not buy it. This is the reason why I'm for hodling Bitcoin because it is through holding you can see the real profit and holding doesn't require you any knowledge of mastering your TA and FA, unlike trading.",

Or at least how many of you are intested in trading?You will only get opinions from people who don't even trade than few people that do the trading. To be honest with you, I'm not too good with trading and there is not shame in admitting that, because of the time needed which I have less, it doesn't bother me much. I prefer to hold with less stress of analysing the market.What you need in trading is more of technical analysis and the fundamental but sometimes when volatility take over analysis, people forget about technical analysis. What they do is gamble not especially when there is continues increase in price. Solana was pumping some days ago, I was surprised how even people that don't know much about trading bought some without any research and planning on selling at the top.QuoteDoes anyone here already have some experience with (own) Trading Bots and writing trading strategies with chatGPT?I would like to exchange some knowledge and experiences with you.Anything that is too good to be true, try as much as possible to avoid such things. I'm not saying trading bots doesn't work or ChatGPT. These bots are program by someone and if indeed they are making $$ everyday, there algorithm will never come public for one day, they will keep the money to themselves and never for once talk about it. However, I learned they profitable in bull run which might come later after halving.",

      "body": "Trading is good but very risky and it is time consuming and can be affected by emotions. It is better that before you go into trading, you should have acquired a good amount of bitcoin in your custody. The reason why I said this is for those people that thinks they must trade, instead of buying your bitcoin because you want to trade. Most people that goes into trading is because of greed, they feel that they can use trading to accumulate more bitcoin for themselves which they end up losing the little that they have. I am a hodler and a long term hodler because I have a bitcoin target which I am more focused on to achieve. Hodling of bitcoin has a great advantage over trading, this is because hodlers are investors and investment is something that yields good profit after a given period of time. While traders are only after their daily bread. This is why I chose to invest and hodli bitcoin as my investment to be financial buoyant in the future, rather than trying to gambling with my bitcoin through trading when it is hard to predict the price movement of bitcoin. I see trading as a waste of time from my own end.",

Why I like the tow be say, trading is something that can give you money instant if you can trade well and investment is a long term something which you will be hodling for years before the profit will come. And within this period you eat, you will pay your bills and do other expenses so if you rely only on hodling they you go see sege be dat. So if anyone can do trading make im no leave am and invest only on bitcoin and be hodling do oda things to support yourself. Even di hodling if you use small money even the bull market na small profit you go get but if na big money then u go reap big one. But if u say make we select only one then I go select hodling with big amount.",

The german board has a strong hodl group.I wrote a lot of trading articles over there about:- how to calculate common TA indicators as a basis to create own ones- how to set up simple 24/7 trading infrastructure with an HDMI Stick PC (like Intel Compute Stick) + TV- how to automate Trades via Tradingview + Autoview + Kraken or just Tradingview + Binance- how to let ChatGPT write code for some own Bots -> e.g. DCA-Bot- how to backtest a strategy to find out if its a good one or not- how to setup an arbitrage strategy- how to discuss trading strategies without revealing to much details (if strategy is not scalable in volume)Even when i offered a kind of contest, were i provided trading infrastructure and cash to test strategies without any risk for participants the attendance was very lame. Afterwards i gave the international trading board a look, but it seems to be very superficial and flooded by spam. While having a look at the nigerian board and the local economic difficulties described here i thought this could be a match due to complementary circumstances. The idea in my back of head was to form a (small) group of trading enthusiasts to create a bunch of different trading strategies together and profit from each others strategies. But right now i don't know on which basis i could build on, how much \"training\" would be neccessary and if it would be worth the effort.If you would be interested in such a group, just take part in the poll. All but the first group are interesting to me.",
