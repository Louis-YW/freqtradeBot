Also since it's a highly reputable casino it won't be hard to find buyers off this forum, why bring it on here? I doubt anyone will have interest, I also believe its hard to pass casino ownership to new buyer. Lastly, this is coming from a new account, is that why you don't want to disclose the name? Maybe people will do research if truly the casino is for sale or not? If you really want to sell it's not something you should hide. There is no proof that you are the real owner, it's going to be hard to trust you.",

There is no proof that you are the real owner, it's going to be hard to trust you. I think your answer is off topic. I don't want to sell the casino on bitcointalk public auction, I want to find one or more buyers. The project I want to launch is also in the gambling industry, I'm not retiring from the industry, I'm just going to another branch where I can collaborate with all casinos, but that's less important in this topic. I don't think it will be good for the brand to post its name or other more important details, these details will be offered to those who are really interested in purchasing it. The proof that I am the owner will of course be given to the buyer, it is logical! I'm not selling the project because I need money, I'm selling the project because I want it to continue, I've been dedicated to this project for several years. I can very simply suspend the deposits and the players withdraw all their funds, but that is not the goal. I created a community, I have friends in this community and they are people of excellent quality and I don't want to close the project.It is also possible to buy only a part of it and I will still remain in the project for a certain percentage, but my time for this project will be minimal.So I am available here for information that can be offered to the general public, for more detailed information I am available privately.",
