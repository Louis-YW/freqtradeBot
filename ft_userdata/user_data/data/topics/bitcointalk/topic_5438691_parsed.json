I was also once a student and had to experience the same thing. Unlike today that there are so many jobs that can be found online, before you literally need to do physical hustles or sometimes work during weekends to to have and extra income. I have some acquaintances too that are working part time, but what's hard that time is that, those extra odd jobs we were doing are not even paying decently around 3-4 dollars per day and it feels like your effort was not paid accordingly. There are even friends of mine who are forced to work evening shifts because there's nobody to provide him food or allowance to sustain his education, luckily he's a scholar so his education is already covered but his food and shelter? nah it's not for free. You should still be grateful since you still have a roof over your head and a food on your table, just continue to search for more opportunities in your area.",

Hope you know if you don't save, then you won't have enough capital to start a reasonable investment that can help your financial situation. When people say saving is wasting without specifying the reason behind a wasteful saving, it sends the wrong message outside. You're a student and surely won't always have enough money to take care of all your school needs and at the same time have money available for investing but that's where savings comes in.You can start saving for investment purposes and such saving won't be wasteful, don't let anybody deceive you that saving entirely is wasting instead saving for spending is what is wasteful while saving for future investment isn't. For example if you didn't have an savings available for purchase on bear market then you won't be among those profiting in the bull market.",

The main reasons I don't encourage people to save is due to the issue of money(or whatever you are saving) not put into good use. The money should be used for solving problems and not lying around doing nothing while there are problems to solve.In regards to investment, it's important to know the right people or things to invest in. Things or people you invest in should be profitable for society which includes you",

I mean, it is still the same money, but if you use it to purchase items, those items are more expensive than previous years. They just point out that you need to invest it like you can gain something, e.g., by putting it in a bank for a time deposit (which most people won't recommend) or by buying bitcoin and holding it over time. That is an investor's mindset on how he will earn more money while at the same time saving his money for future purposes.",

I am also still a student like you and most of us probably experience the same thing in this case. If you still have money that can be saved, it's better if you save it for an emergency fund, because indeed anything needed during school time can occur and force it suddenly and it's not in your spending plan's monitoring. Regarding the many activities that you do and spend most of your money in my opinion it is a form of investment that you do for yourself so that in the future you have the ability and understanding of what is your current experience, it will really help you in the future future if you have a lot of experiences that shape who you are today.",

Well, imo i'd say you should work according to your risk appetite, because there is practically risk in everything. Saving might carry a lower risk anyway, because you could basically just leave your money in tbe bank and earn tiny interest on it every year; the only risk with that method is the effects of inflation. Whilst investments are quite risky, though some are more risky that the other; if you are to buy Bitcoin as an investment for example, you'd have to learn what the risk concerns are, and how to imbibe the responsibility of being your own bank so you don't lose your coins to scammers or sheer negligence, but if you can do things right you stand the chance of earning a very good ROI in the long term.It is your future, and only you can decide, you just have to look at the pros and cons of it all. Better still you can split your money and invest some, whilst you save some.",

If you have free time, balance it between sideline jobs and enjoying yourself. Do not get stressed a lot unless your parents are also struggling to provide for your basic education wherein you really need to focus your extra time on getting sideline jobs. If you have savings, you can divide it been investing in bitcoin and keeping the other half on fiat because the crypto market is not that easy to predict too. Investing is not a guarantee to earn income nor can keep your funds from losing. So always keep the balance as if you are also diversifying.",

Build a plan base on your priorities.You said that you're a student then prioritize your studies. Prioritize going to school. Prioritize your needs for your school. Prioritize your school requirements. Don't stress yourself out because of money or saving in this case because for me, getting a degree and getting a job after studying is a better thing to do than stressing yourself out because of money. If you can get a good job, money will come to you then that's the time that you will think about it.When I was a student, I didn't think about investing, but I focused on my studies. Studied hard and fortunately, graduated from college. After that, that's the time where I thought about money. I saved money at the start because that's what the older people taught to us, but as I studied investing, I realize that I'm wrong. Not wrong literally, but I was wrong that I saved all of my money in a bank account. Cut the story short, I still save money until now, but that's money is my emergency funds only. There's nothing wrong with saving as long as you are doing it for emergency funds.Focus on your priorities first. You're a student so focus on studies first. After graduating, get a job then put a portion of your salary in investment and put a portion of it in emergency funds. Save money for emergency funds only, and don't save for the sake of saving (well at least that's how I think).",

If you are saving assets like stocks, real estate, land, commodities etc then you have nothing to worry about. Especially real estate and stocks are capable of producing passive income they are pretty much the best choices when it comes to making investments. Crypto and other commodities are good choices too. You can make outrageous returns with crypto especially. What are you going to do with your money if you are not going to invest them anyway? Spend all? That's not wise unless you are retired.",
