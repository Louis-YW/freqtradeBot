  "content": "Hey guys,I'm finally able to finish the vara quest on coinbase, but I'm short about 6 bucks CAD (Canadian) worth of it as I sold some back when the quest first became available and coinbase shut it down for a while.I get paid on Friday, so I'll happily send you the 6 back plus whatever fee you'd require.KuCoin transfer(if you don't use coinbase) or Coinbase internal transfer would work as it'll be free that way.I can accept any coin that these exchanges support, I'll just convert it to vara. I'll also pay you back in whichever cryptocurrency you prefer. If you want straight cash and are Canadian I can etransfer it to you, or I can PayPal it. I know it's a really small amount, but I'd like to finish this quest and get the 10 bucks from it before it expires or coinbase takes it down again. Feel free to respond here or pm me. Thanks. Cheers, MrC",

Don't know why I didn't think of that earlier, I thought coinbase would have taken longer.I know you didn't want any interest but I'm sending you 9 cents extra for the hour long loan.Â  Thanks againMrC",
