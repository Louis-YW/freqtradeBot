  "content": "One of your most important roles is to guide the red king when he takes over. I believe he is a better choice for Babylon/World compared to the other who promote Godlessness and all sort of wickedness openly. Expect persecution from the one who you will guide, but still pray for him. It's not easy to be normal while focusing on the \"system\". You should be constantly praying for GOD to purify and guide him. You will notice he wakes up, realize his wrongs and fall back to sleep, once in awhile. So don't be too surprised when you see him doing things we believe should not be done.  He is a better choice nevertheless.",

      "body": "If you mean Trump when you say the red king, he already set half of the NESARA dictates in place, although Biden may have changed some of it.EDIT: JEREMIAH 29:4-7:Quote4This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5“Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. 6Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. 7Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.”",
