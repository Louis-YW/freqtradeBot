Because that's was the last one on your wallet which means it was compatible with your wallet's firmware.thatOr another way is to compare your wallet's firmware with the version of your wallets, which is recommended by the company while you are installing it is best practice to do but if other options are visible then compare your firmware version with the version you wanted to install and select the one which is compatible or was compatible before.",

So what I would like to know is if there is a way to tell the actual version of ledger live to use with the specific firmware on the device itself.",

The version of Ledger Live doesn't matter. The version of your installed crypto apps are also of secondary priority when we are discussing the Ledger Recover code. I see no problems in keeping your crypto apps and Ledger Live updated. If it's a trust issue, why keep using your Ledger hardware wallet in the first place? Switch to something else and abandon it.",

Updating your udev rules is probably the step most people missed, but after that, everything should run smoothly. If for some reason you failed to make transactions due to your firmware being too old, you can check the log and see what is the cause and report it to the GitHub page. It would be better if you can provide more details on how the \"work and then would not work again\" process happened. At the end of the day though this doesn't really mean you are safe from the risk of Ledger forcing you to update. Especially if you want to store other coins that needs installation from the Ledger Live app. CMIIW.",

Electrum is a Bitcoin only wallet and you need to use another software for altcoins.At some point, you will find that you have to update the firmware to send a currency or for critical bug, and using old firmware may not be a smart move.Whenever you start to doubt your hardware wallet, do not panic and start a careful search for alternatives.

They chose not to fully scrub the Ledger Recovery service from their timeline, which, in my opinion, would have been the appropriate action to partially repair the damage it caused.
