Older forum users are already used to forums where they spent years (that probably have crypto subforum) while younger audience prefer other means of communication. Quote from: robelneo on July 05, 2023, 10:12:47 PMAnd do you have a local Cryptocurrency forum in your country?We did have several attempts, but none managed to get any traction. By far the biggest and the most active crypto community (when it comes to forums) in my country usually hangs out in an already established general type of forum that's been around since early 2000s and that has dedicated crypto child board. That's where I heard about Bitcoin for the first time back in 2013 and where I used to discuss crypto related stuff until 2019 when I decided to join this forum.",

However tho, I don't know why people would want to discuss about celebrity and sports on a bitcoin forum, there are so many places you can discuss those kind of thing.",

I guess the local community can contribute much better as compared to the threads like off-topic etc.I do not know about other local boards but I will agree that you can discuss non-crypto stuff in local threads, and moreover, in local boards, it will be more easily to classify topics as different threads can be made there.Also, in a local community, you can attract the non-crypto people to your local thread with generic topics and from there groom their interest in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.",

Because as a forum, you have to moderate it and if you add so many things in one forum, you have to moderate different things which overwhelm your knowledge, skills and time too. It also makes that forum like a mess and it does not serve any specific user type. For instance, I did not join this forum to learn about gold, how to invest in gold, how to secure my gold bars.Quotewe all know Bitcointalk is an international forum dedicated to the promotion of Bitcoin, and being the first makes them the number one forum about BitcoinThis forum is a biggest one for Bitcoin community, not because it is a first one. It is indeed because it has big brains behind, first Satoshi Nakamoto and later some other head admins, moderators and users. Strict rules are other contributors for the forum success too. Like when they saw a spam wave in 2017 ICO, they raised their voice and theymos considered a few months before a merit system was kicked off.Forum admins, moderators and members are resources, precious ones for its success.",

But there is not a big demand on them. If we turn bitcointalk into Reddit, we won't be able to increase the number of customers because Bitcointalk is very old in terms of web design and functionalities. 99% of young people aren't going to leave Reddit or Twitter and come here for that purpose.I think the aim of forum owner is to let it be alive on its own while it can. If this forum becomes a combination of Reddit, Stackexchange/Stackoverflow and Slack, then it will attract a lot of people. This will take a lot of money, time and intellectual resources.",

Not sure if it's can work because many users are actively in this forum because of the signature campaign, so you need to have such marketing to make people interested.Maybe the forum administrators will not really mind about it since they said we have freedom to speech and there's no rule they will delete anything about competitor related stuff.",
