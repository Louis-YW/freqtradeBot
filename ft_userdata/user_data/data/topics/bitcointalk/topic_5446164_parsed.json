  "content": "Some months back, I created this thread \"Has Bitcoin transaction double charged You?\" because of the incident that took place then, but lately, I have encountered different banks transaction issues.I was making payments to a client for my goods, but after sending him the money on the 8th of March, he complained not to have received the money the whole of that day, so I had to pay up again, hoping to go and complain in the bank for the one he is yet to receive, but luckily the next day, being the 9th of March, the first money I sent to him got reversed to my account around 5:00 pm, and I tried sending the money to my company account because it was from my personal account that I conducted the first transaction.I sent the money to my company account on March 9th after it was reversed, but I did not again receive the money in my company account (at a different bank) until March 14 before it was also reversed to my account (the account I sent from). This may not be a general problem with banks in most countries of the world, but these flaw with bank is not encountered in Bitcoin transactions. {To use this as an example,} Bitcoin transactions fixed such flaw in banks. A Bitcoin transaction is irreversible. When you send Bitcoin for payment to someone, it doesn't reverse; as long as there is enough fee to settle the transaction and confirmation is ongoing in the blockchain, the transaction cannot be reversed. At least Bitcoin transactions don't have these flaw that are demonstrated by the banks. Bank APP Receipt Debit and Reversal (Rvsl) SMS Alart",

This is a common feature of all currencies.However, Bitcoin has an added benefit in that exclusive control over the value can be transferred between people electronically, whereas most currencies can only be exchanged physically. When you send an electronic transaction using the traditional banking system, you are NOT sending currency. You are simply asking a 3rd party to update a database. This weakness is possible with Bitcoin as well if you choose to use a 3rd party, such as Coinbase or Binance, to handle your transactions. Quote from: Die_empty on March 24, 2023, 02:49:36 PMThis feature could also be a weakness, especially when we are careless.

      "body": "I guess how well the banking system works depends on a country and a bank. I've heard many complaints about Germany with online banking often lagging well behind the transactions, the amounts of money being inaccurate and delays being pretty common. But in Ukraine, the banking system of the most popular banks works really well: you can see the transaction instantly, the balance is updated instantly as well, and I've never had a problem of a transaction not reaching me fast enough (unless it's something like an international transfer). But the op is right that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and you just need to wait till the first confirmation of a transaction to be sure the receiver got it (although some recommend to wait for more confirmations if the amount of money is big). But that also means that if you somehow make a mistake in the address name or decide to make another transaction because the first one isn't getting to the recipient fast enough, there's no authority to give you your money back. While it's not an issue for me, I know it can be stressful for some.",

Let's say, for instance, you want to send money from United Bank of Africa (UBA) to Monipoint, Opay, Kuda, or any of the other online banking systems. (Nigeria Banks): those transactions will be debited from the sender's account, and when the receiver's account is having difficulty receiving money, the bank (sending bank) will have to withhold the transaction for some period of time because they want to be retrying it if it will eventually go through that's matching the transaction amount, time, and date with every transaction. If it was not successful at the time of accounting, then money is reversed into the sender's ledger account, which is recorded as an uncleared balance, until a dispute is filed by the sender to explain to the bank what really happened. It's different with Bitcoin transactions because they are operating on different technologies and the Bitcoin Blockchain doesn't need any manual matching to confirm if the transaction was successful or not, or even charge you twice when you want to send something twice. Have you tried sending some Satoshi from your wallet to another, which will be showing as pending, and then sometimes trying to send out the same volume with the same transaction fee? Sometimes you will get an error warning of a duplicated transaction. I don't really know if this works on the Bitcoin Blockchain, but I can recall this incident on Eth transactions.",

Don't accept the deal if transaction has yet been confirmed by miners.This is for me the most accurate and important answer of this topic for now.It is important to wait for at least 1 network confirmation, and ideally 2 or 3.Bitcoin transactions are irreversible once confirmed, otherwise with a few clicks it is always possible to cancel it by double spending. Of course, the author of the double spend will pay more network fees as the name suggests, double fees, but if you consider a transaction present in the mempool but not yet included in a block as final, you run the risk of losing your funds.But apart from this aspect, once confirmed, this is definitely a great advantage of Bitcoin compared to FIAT currencies. No bad surprises, as long as you have your seed and it is stored in a safe way, you will never a bad surprise with Bitcoin. I guess we've all had the unpleasant surprise of discovering hidden fees, unknown transactions, or a balance in our bank account that doesn't match what we expected, and all of that is totally obsolete with Bitcoin.",

      "body": "I can say confirmed Bitcoin transaction is irreversible but those that are not are reversible.  One reason is that transactions as long as no confirmation can be cancelled, or double spend.  This is another reason why most centralized services require at least 2 confirmation to credit the account of the Bitcoin transaction.  What I mean is there are conditions for the Bitcoin transaction to be irreversible. While many centralized exchanges only need 2 confirmation, it is said that 5 to six confirmation is needed to make the transaction irreversible.[1]QuoteBut a transaction with a single confirmation can be reversed if you have the computing power necessary to do so. So How many confirmations do I have to wait to consider an irreversible transaction? For example, in the case of Bitcoin, It is recommended to wait 5 to 6 confirmations to safely consider a transaction. Once this point is reached, we can say that the Bitcoin network has irreversibly validated our transaction.Honestly, I believe Bitcoin is more on being merchant friendly because it solves the problem of merchant where customers reverse their payment after the seller send the item.  Thus it somehow raises some problem for customers if the merchant does fraud, delivering fake items or not delivering the goods at all.  So irreversible transaction has their own weakness too, IMHO.[1] https://academy.bit2me.com/en/que-es-transaccion-irreversibles-criptomonedas/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20in%20the%20case,has%20irreversibly%20validated%20our%20transaction.",
