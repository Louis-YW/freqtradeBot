You absolutely right. Thanks for correcting me. I'm selling it because I was enthuasiast as many there ..  but to run casino bussiness you need to have a big bankroll for the start and finding a investors it's not a easy work. Resources are the most important part of this bussines which I lack entirely. That's very sad from either to drop it from hands, but maybe someone who has team already or willing to try venture on his own will be interested..Appreciate for kind words dude, things hurts..Regards",

Ofcourse it easier for beginning just offered all I have because I will anyways throw it away and will lay unusabale so potential buyer may take and have it as a gift for the project... well the system ir self has no \"major\" issues, the issue is like connecting slots over api - requires money.. trying to run some giveaways - requires money. Some better unicum design - requires money. I ran it alone, spent about 15,000$ on everything, searched for people to join, but was unsuccessfull, not because site is bad, just that it's hard to get trust from people you never met.. We live in world full of fraud, and because of the people doing type of this things loyal people who actually looking for real help suffer at most...Regards",
