Do you have a good reason that massive sales will occur after the merge? I don't think the merge has anything to do with the massive sales you're referring to. If you have a clear reason for what you are asking, it never hurts to try based on your estimates.",

But here is my advice if I were you, sell all your altcoins and convert them into BTC, for sure if there is a massive sell it is easy for you to divert into a stablecoin that can avoid losses but if you prefer holding into a long term don't mind of what I have said to you. It is hard to have a prediction now, I don't have also any idea about merging ETH, but bare in your mind holding in long term is safe than selling at an early stage. If you made a decision, don't regret it because nobody knows what will happen in the future but it is also worth it to try with a small amount that you can afford if you really believed it.",

If you have made a deep research about the topic and you know that you are a profitable trader and this is what your system is telling you to do then you need to follow whatever conclusions you have come up with, just make sure that in the case your prediction is wrong you can reduce your losses as much as possible, because that is the main difference between the traders that really become successful and those that have short term success but later on they are unable to keep up with that success and lose their money instead.",

That makes sense and that's the usual trading that we do.If you see that you're in that much profit and you're analyzing that there's a sell off after the merge then just do it. It is your plan and that's what you can see.You don't need for others validation to say that you're doing the right thing because it really is the typical action in trading.",

The main purpose of ethereum merge to fix the total supply that is still remain unlimited and how can you call that as a thing to trigger massive sell off? People are thinking to hold their ethereum in their wallet. They have more ability to stake their ethereum to get passive income as well. As a miner and you shall move to the another coin like etc and leaving ethereum but are you sure wanna selling whole of your ethereum to buy at the bottom price? You must remember that your prediction was not actually true and it's being determined by the market itself but you must see fundamentally how good ethereum merge is.",

Much better if you read the whole context about the upcoming merge so that you will get enlightened and will not be fud by people who want to made fun on situation them scare those people who don't do a research. And also its up for you to decide what's best for you since if the merge gives you stress then sell it off since peace of mind is more important rather than getting afraid on certain situation.",

As a newbie, I suggest you not be greedy, cause actually, the crypto world is really unpredictable, what you think will happen sometimes won't happen as we want.

It's a simple idea and most traders follow the same idea imo, but the problem here is that it's hard to identify whether a sell-off is indeed going to happen or not. If you 100% believe that it's going to happen then feel free to do so. If it were me though I'd split the part I'd buy and leave another part to hodl just in case, profits are minimized but the same could be said to the risks I'd take.",
