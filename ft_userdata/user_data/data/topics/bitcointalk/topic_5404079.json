Thank you and sorry to sound extra noobish.First, which client are you using?In Bitcoin Core, just start with with extra parameter -chain=<chain> with either \"regtest\" or \"signet\" chain.I'd recommend you to use Regtest since generating any amount there is easy.You can mine coins in seconds using the command generatetoaddress <number of blocks> <address> <maxtries>e.g.: generatetoaddress 101 bcrt1qsql8mk5839hs7rt4pmcjxq9p53x6md79eppsl2It's good enough for most tests.Quote from: randomuser22 on June 26, 2022, 01:07:23 AMWill I be able to send the tBTC to a ledger nano wallet testnet after doing this? Those two chains (Regtest/Signet) are separate from Testnet, means you're not connected to testnet nodes and your coins aren't testnet coins.So no if you have Regtest or Signet coins.",

Yes, to my knowledge Ledger does support that as you can enable the use of Testnet Bitcoin in Ledger Live. But I don't use Ledger hardware. As Ledger Live is crap in my opinion other wallets that support Ledger Nano hardware might also allow the use of Regnet or even Signet Bitcoins. Though not sure, as I haven't had the need or devices to test this myself.",

It'll discourage owner from keep running the faucet and might prevent other people from testing their software or teaching new user.",

Actually, there are some newbies selling big amounts of tBTC the only problem is there are many scammers selling that tBTC without proof that they hold a big amount of tBTC. Also, be careful with high-rank members with negative trust here on the forum I saw someone before selling them and scam.  The tops you mean is that Top-up or a payment processor?",
