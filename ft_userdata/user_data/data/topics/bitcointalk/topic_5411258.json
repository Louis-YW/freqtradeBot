  "content": "I am the victim of a catfish attempt into boiler room fraud. I made terrible choices that go against some of the main tenants of a long time BTC holder and in my heart and mind I count my Bitcoin as gone for ever as I rebuild. That said I am sending information into the ether to help people learn from my story as well as offer incentive for anyone who may have the skills or connections to help.(understand that hindsight is 20/20 and I saw many red flags right after I made bad decisions)The story:I was on tinder when I had a match. we talked over the course of a month. the conversations did not immediately lead to bitcoin and I never told the person how much I had etc. we talked about travel jobs and occasionally investing. previously all catfish attempts were crazy pretty models that have no business being on Tinder so it was easy to spot. This fake was average so I started talking to them. Eventually they invited me to whatsapp chat with 14 or so people. (could be fake copies I have no idea). They mentioned contract trading and led me to an exchange.(Caution fraudulent exchange)isgrape(.)comAfter being reassured for over two or so weeks I sent some bitcoin in and traded with them. Initially I didn't send most of my stash but after the trade I was convinced to put more on the sidelines. I couldn't withdraw my funds. the site says frozen. To be clear I thought the scam was the trade and not the website. That was my mistake and there are tons of red flags I missed. Now most of my bitcoin is with them.Facts:actual photo of website wallet:https://puu.sh/JfnT4/8d91046029.pngThe website and wallet activity do not match confirming this is an actual fraud and not just them freezing funds.Most of my Bitcoin is around the world somewhere. I can only hope it isn't going to fund Russia or something.fraud wallets:(initial fraudulent wallet) https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1QDQZTcKmY8H6snkvLtxizB18w2d9zF5mN(current funds location) https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3NWGK7FB5m7nYxRhu5rzge98656ZU49Uf9my wallet:1DKEam8egLGTre32tiW8bGUDzuDLmvhDeyBoiler room Whattsapp numbers:https://puu.sh/JfnWk/471897a597.pnghttps://puu.sh/JfnWz/4a80577df6.pnghttps://puu.sh/JfnXd/05af17add7.pnghttps://puu.sh/Ji5yJ/aa29728b3d.pngThe site is hosted at a company called majestic hosting. And the client used alipay to pay for the site. This would infer china, but without an ID or a location I can't contact a lawyer or anything.The bounty is 20K or 30% of the lost funds. Which ever is higher at the time.The bounty is fulfilled if I get the coins back to my wallet at that time, the party that either retrieved the coins or parties that together completed the deed will get a split of the award. you will still be rewarded if someone else say arrests the person but I cant reward someone without the BTC in wallet.My painful lesson has been learned.Please only post if you can help I will not answer any inquiries that require me to pay up front.",

Maybe they might help you with the information you need to get the site owner.I don't think that means much. You can use Namesilo to be anonymous, they do not require mandatory KYC. Also, they accept bitcoin payments, so it is possible to be anonymous from that side as well.unfortunately, I think that there are very few or no elements here on the basis of which something can be done. maybe only through that person through Tinder, but I believe that all information about him is fake. OP, you acted very naively and trusted a person you have never met in person. Otherwise, this is a very common scam method, and very famous, even though there are always new victims.",
