  "content": "Recent developments have brought some form of uncertainties regarding the future of Bitcoin. Consequently, several posts have been raised to that effect yet they are left with no clear answers. If we were to go back to the roots, Satoshi himself would have been in the position to answer some of the key questions such as:1. The fate of Bitcoin as regards to high fees when the block reward gets to zero2. If He envisaged things like Ordinals being launched on the Bitcoin Network. 3. If he actually projected mainstream adoption of Bitcoin in term of the features of Bitcoin such as speed, security, accessibility as cost effectiveness, base on present realities. There should be others so I feel we can make this a discussion while I expect answers from those who have.",

So Satoshi would not be able to provide input on the matter of transaction fees, and as for the next two questions, I'm not sure if they matter. I mean, Satoshi could say yes or no, but what would that change?If Satoshi were here, I wouldn't ask anything. I'd just thank that person for creating Bitcoin and ensuring that a community of those who care about it would continue discussing it and working on its development.",

      "body": "Interestingly enough many of the questions you have in mind have already been asked and they are usually answered by Satoshi in early days. For example the Ordinals Spam Attack is a concern that was raised in a different form. People were trying to store DNS information inside bitcoin (that is pretty much the same as Ordinals attack which is using bitcoin as cloud storage) and Satoshi said along the lines of \"not everything needs to be done by Bitcoin\". Which is why that idea migrated to its own project called Namecoin.Which is pretty much where we are now, if anyone wanted to create NFTs they should use a platform that actually has that option instead of using Bitcoin that does NOT and end up only spamming the chain with garbage.Quote from: Odohu on November 15, 2023, 10:12:11 AM3. If he actually projected mainstream adoption of Bitcoin in term of the features of Bitcoin such as speed, security, accessibility as cost effectiveness, base on present realities. I don't think that kind of prediction has ever been possible. Even now we can not project the adoption in the near future. If you look at Satoshi's prediction he left it WIDE OPEN when he said \"in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume at all\".",

To be honest with you, i will ask him nothing than to say thank you for developing bitcoin for us to have and this is all i could do in appreciation, then i will also encourage as many that would be interested in bitcoin to get every necessary help required for them to use bitcoin, Satoshi has made available for us what we needed, it's left for us to show how appreciable we could be towards bitcoin adoption, if you're talking about the transaction fee, is Satoshi the one being responsible for the collection or miners, other little challenges could be dealt with within the bitcoin communities among the developers.",

Satoshi had a revolutionary but not omniscient vision. Addressing your points: Zero-block reward scenario? Concern is valid, yet it. Higher transaction costs or a new consensus mechanism could change the network. Bitcoin's adaptability is its functionality.Bitcoin Network Ordinals? Open-ended, Satoshi's vision guided financial evolution. Ordinals, NFTs, and other innovations are the community pushing the limits. Doesnt that define decentralization? Mass adoption? That's a complicated question. Speed, security, accessibility, cost-effectiveness - these arent just features; they're moving targets.

Every day the Bitcoin industry is facing new threats and opportunities due to the everchanging political, economic, and social global systems. The currency has become very influential, complex, and dynamic for Satoshi to control or predict. I believe that he would have the same answers as some of the reputable members of the forum. Satoshi might not have envisaged that issues like ordinals would be a challenge because these are new threats. The future will still come with more issues that will test the strength of Bitcoin.

Every time we notice that you can send a transaction and confirm it with one satoshi per Vbyte, the high fees are a temporary problem and not a permanent one.When Bitcoin has value, every byte added to the block is valuable, and I do not think that projects related to Ordinals will add more continuous spam to the network. What would Satoshi change here? If Bitcoin is centralized, then his idea has failed. If it is not centralized, then Satoshiâ€™s role is no longer influential, and even if he expresses an opinion, his opinion will not differ from the opinion if the network were decentralized.",

Maybe in the future tx fees will be crazier than this, but network upgrades won't be interrupted.
