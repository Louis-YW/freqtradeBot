Never heard from anyone the same. SSL is up to date and works smoothly. Interesting. From my research the main cause was said to be using an older TLS version which the browser refuses to support. If the SSL being used is modern and is using a modern TLS encryption method/version, then this might just be an odd anomaly. I have never experienced this before on my browser personally hence I thought it was an issue on your end. Sorry about that.",
