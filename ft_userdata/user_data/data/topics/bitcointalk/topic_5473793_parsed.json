Namecheap really has good and fast support to take down phishing websites knowing scammers usually use their service due to cheap/discounted hosting and domains.When they deal with complaints and reports, they take positive and stringent steps to take down phishing domains. This is because the persistence of hosting these phishing domains can harm their reputation and also go against their policies. I have previously submitted complaints and reports to the domain registrar NameCheap, and their dedicated team reviewed the complaints I submitted in less than 24 hours, closing down several domains. The positive aspect is that anyone can contribute, no matter how simple the action, to disrupt the schemes of scammers. This is what makes the cryptocurrency community secure. Despite the simplicity of the idea behind these phishing domains, beginners may not notice the phishing link, mistakenly thinking it's the official domain of the project, becoming victims. The reason for the spread of these schemes is that they remain a cost-effective method for defrauding beginners.",

Personally, I use DNS encryption with a phishing block list to help avoid websites like this. It will take a lot of effort for this domain registrar to put a website under them. As far as my experience goes, most of them response time is quite disappointing, others never replies, why there are companies who are just bouncing off with their supposedly email address that I think they are doing it intentionally.Namecheap is one of the domain registar that replies so fast. However, it might take a toll on their business models. So I guess it boils down on ethics, if the business owners are going to take down this scam sites or continue as they are making money out of it.And this cycle will go on, taken down and in matter of days, the scammers are going to just recycle and look for new websites. But at least someone in our community are still active enough to chase this scam websites and report it here.",

Usually scammers use namecheap, to report them you can just go to their report page[2] and select \"Abuse reports\" then you can choose different options together with phishing, scam etc.If the registrar/host is different, you can just google using this keyword \"registrar_name  abuse report\" say \"godaddy abuse report\" or \"hostinger abuse report\", google with show it's support center or contact page where you can submit and file the report. Usually you only need an email, either its a temp email or not, but using gmail or reputed mail services is recommended then include even a short explanation why the domain is scam.[1] https://www.whois.com[2] https://support.namecheap.com/index.php?/Tickets/Submit",
