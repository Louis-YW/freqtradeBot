      "body": "Let us say the present resistance is at $25000, this is because bitcoin increased to $25000 two time recently, first on the 14th of August, while also in the follow day which was 15th of August. Bitcoin could not reach more than $25200 and the daily down trend began again, but just two days now.This is just a short time speculation, the resistance could be strong around $25000, but it was noticed that the support was also strong around $20000, people are not really selling more around that price, people are holding. I do not know about short time speculation, but if you can just hold your bitcoin for a long time, $25000 will have no option for bitcoin than to be a support level, leading to a time bitcoin will never fall below $25000 again, just like $2500 of the past, when bitcoin was around that low price if compared to today's price.",

If $23k was such a good deal, people would be buying it up cheap.Waiting for some Signal before buying again, if Bitcoin can beat the resistance most probably it will go back to its support level which can be a good signal to buy again. The market is getting better it’s just that many are still not confident about the Bitcoin trend and that’s why there’s still a huge resistance, eventually buyers will dominate the seller and that’s a good confirmation of a bull market again, just have more patience for now.",

      "body": "Sounds good, hope you are correct.   If 23k has so much resistance we should not pass through it easily, confirming 23k as a low is definitely better then the alternative.      Ideally we would not have come close to 23k like this but I guess if we consider weekly bars, it can still we turn this around and recover to a bullish recovery.23k was first found as resistance to the 'dead cat bounce' first attempt upwards on June 14 and its been doing sideways slide ever since.   So more of the same isnt too much of a shock, disappointment is the gruel you get dished regular  till the day you break free.",

If you are talking about resistance then it's the $25k that is the biggest barrier we have right now. And we might as well call $23k the support line for now.Although we have touch $25k or at least broke it, we didn't sustain that run. Just like in the past 2 days, we goes down again after around $24k-$25 levels.",

Aside from that, the main issue I can see is the $25k region as the bitstamp chart says we've already bounced away from there after being close to it. Yeah, and its been a long time before breaking that tough resistance of 19k and as far as i remember which it had been broken when the market sentiment tends out to be positive which did really drive the price to breakthat ceiling and even reaching out prices which we didnt even expect that it could really hit up into those levels.When we do based up on technicals then it couldnt really be ignored that there are things which we canpresume and tell that it would be the reason but we do know overall that market sentiment and possible upcoming events and fundamentals could really drive out possible price movement.",

Maybe the OP didn't see the latest price movement and just check the current price as we have now on the $23k'ish. But recently we have a lot of movement, even getting as high as $25k, but it just dropped down.$25-$30k is the big resistance for us. We've seen that if the price reaches $25k-$28k then we might see another sort of mini bull run in the last week of this month or enter the 'ber months.",

After the dump from it's all-time-high, I can feel the correction is already done and we are now creating a very long horizontal support around $20,000 - $30,000 level.",

Every time the price is rejected at $25,000, the correction would remain to be mild. If it ever falls down below $23,000, there will be a strong rebound that would push the price up to once again challenge the resistance at $25,000. I think with the overall traditional financial market starting to recover, Bitcoin would also follow. It's a matter of time before this $25,000 resistance would be converted into a strong support.",

And as we can see in the last month, we moved from $20,000-$25,000 and that has been our price action.Quickly glancing at the price, we are still in the $23,500 range, so not sure if we will retest $21,000 again. I mean the support at $22,000-is very weak. Unless some negative news again affecting investors mindset and sold short term.",

But with the right thought and analysis, I am sure if Bitcoin could break the present resistance price moving upward would be that hard anymore.As you can see now in the market, Bitcoin is a little difficult to rise and break through bigger resistance except for only $25K. But Bitcoin is still very strong in the market and is also in demand by many people so it still has the potential to realize a bigger increase this year even if not for the new ATH. But it can still be at a better price than the current price and everyone should still store Bitcoin better before releasing it into the market at a better price.",

So it's also a cycle, resistance and then it will become a full blown support level, then goes up to the next price. So it's just a matter of time, it could be days, weeks and months for a certain price to be overcome like in our present price $25k. I can't remember how many times we get to it and then it went down very fast, maybe twice or thrice. So we will see how it will be in the next try, whether we can break it easy and then we will have a momentum run and then it will become the support.",
