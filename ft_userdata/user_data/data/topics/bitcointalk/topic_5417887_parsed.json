I have a registered business in IOM and do not need to do any KYC checks on sellers (or purchasers for that matter!) Happy to do it on LBC but I can offer a better rate offline - as the business I'd ask you to go first... (maybe its better we stick to LBC for now and use their Escrow service!!!) You can contact me on WhatsApp +44 7494 032839 to discuss.Many thanks, Ryan.",

(I am happy to KYC to them in they so wish) Make sense but you can't convince someone to go first since you don't have enough trading reputation to consider as trusted members so the choice is escrow so there is fee which depends on the trade value and with minimum amount which is likely higher than 1% trading fee of LBC. So even if you calculate you are going to buy higher than market value at the end of the trade.If you're concerned about the KYC requirements on LBC which requires sensitive personal data for tier 3 members because it has huge annual trading volume but you're ready to do KYC here then why not on KYC.Anyway good luck finding the partner.",

If OP is dealing with someone on localbitcoin, they should get their escrow there and if dealing with someone on BTT; they should get their escrow here. No two ways about that. Trust isn't transferable from one platform to the other. Another issue – OP is a fresh newbie account registered less than a week ago with only five posts. It doesn't speak well when it comes to financial dealings.",

It doesn't speak well when it comes to financial dealings.All the trades on LBC comes with automated escrows and 1% trading fee so there is no need to worry about escrow there cause chances of holding without a valid reason can be simply broken by the proof of payment made. But we need to be careful while choosing the person who we wre trading with most people ask KYC these days and no third party transfers,and more restriction to avoid money laundering.",
