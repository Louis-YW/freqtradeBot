I will just received a generic responses from them but no concrete actions on their side. If they do like shut down this kind of website, it could be detrimental to their business and maybe this scammers will look to other registrar.",

Well, most victims can be considered as fools for being greedy of money when the offer is an obvious too good to be true, simply a scam.
