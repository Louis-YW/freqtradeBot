      "body": "Well First and foremost, welcome to the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. And I guess it's my first time hearing about the physical Bitcoin. I barley had any idea of what it is, not until now. From my research, the physical Bitcoin is a like a representative of Bitcoin and usually holds within it a private key which will give you access to the Bitcoins. Here's a quote of Bitmaxz from a similar thread. Hope it will help you a long way too.Quote from: BitMaxz on April 14, 2020, 09:13:39 PMYou can redeem the BTC from your physical coin you just need to peel out the sticker on the back to find the private key. You can use it to redeem your BTC and other fork coins but you should make sure to transfer BTC first before you import the private key to the different wallets to take other fork coins. Watch this video guide on redeeming BTC from the physical coin.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1yydfYJFwAAlso, I suggest you redeem the fork coins one by one and don't forget to start on major fork coins to redeem like BCH before you redeem the other fork coins.If you want to take your fork coins on the single wallet I think you can use coinomi wallet. Look at this guide below.- Claiming your forked coins",

To avoid possible scams while you're new to this crypto world, it's better to read the Bitcoin Whitepaper so that you'll understand more about Bitcoin and that isn't physical.As above said, if that is similar to the Casascius coin, which has an amount of Bitcoin inside, you must have a private so that you can verify if that's true and transfer it into a hardware device that is safe to store Bitcoin in the long run.",

In fact, these sorts of things are one of the worst things for bitcoin because they confuse new users and lead them to believe that bitcoin is somehow physical. All that you can really do to make bitcoin physical on a coin is to write private keys in some form onto a physical coin but you wouldn't be able to send it on the blockchain without a bitcoin wallet that connects to the internet. If you have a coin with a private key (long string of numbers and letters) or a series of 12-24 words, then you can import it into a bitcoin software wallet and spend it.",

You may start here: https://learnmeabitcoin.com, it's fun there!If it's a Casascius Coin and stil has the hologram sticker on it, don't peal it. Don't tell anybody and never post or enter a private key anywhere online, even if users here ask for it. A Casascius Coin would've a so-called minikey under the hologram sticker with which you could redeem it's denomination as long as it's still funded.But Casascius Coins that are still funded are quite valuable. The gifter would be quite a generous person to you.Relax and welcome to the forum and your journey in Bitcoin land. Whatever you got as physical token from whoever, don't do stupid things but rather embrace a whole new thing for you. I don't quite see an urge to get in some hurry. Read, learn and hopefully love BTC!",

As I believe there are not many physical Bitcoins that are truly encrypted with something on them, at least not in this part of the world, as I myself have not seen any unless just reading about them. You can either use the suggestion given by the above members to verify if the coins actually have any private keys or phrases on them that you can easily import with a supported wallet and move those figures to a safer destination.",

If anyone wants to buy it it is because of its scarcity, similar to a movie poster or a fiat coin that is no longer in circulation and is often more expensive than BTC stored in a digital wallet. depending on the rarity, quality, materials and uniqueness.",

But you most probably have a physical Casascius coin with you. You could have made a description of how it looks like and that would have help us determine if it's a usable coin or just a fashioned coin.Regardless, the Casascius coin has an embedded sticker or something like a piece of paper with digital Bitcoin value. It has a tamper-resistant sticker placed over the hologram. You should also know that if you are the first person to redeem it's private key, it's only you that will have the digital value, afterwards, the Casascius coin will have no digital value.Please next time, make the question more detailed and specific so we can have a better understanding.",
