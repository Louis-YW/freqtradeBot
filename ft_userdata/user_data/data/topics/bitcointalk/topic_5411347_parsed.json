Apart from this, the decline in oil prices in the last few weeks is also good news for the market But most importantly, if the interest rate increases, then the market can see bearish. Markets may move bullish if interest rates are cut or not hiked further, but the odds are that a 0.75% rate hike could happen Because the Fed has said that every possible method will be adopted to deal with inflation.",

Who bought above the red line price, he must lose money and sell his bitcoin cheaply. When the manipulators redeem these bitcoins, a new pump will begin. I don't think they will let the hamsters get out of their positions with a profit. And to prevent this from happening, the price of bitcoin should not rise above 30-32 thousand dollars.",

So it is a long time since we are in a bear market although we are expecting a bull market, I don't think it's going to happen very soon. Most of us know that because of the world's economy is collapsing day by day due to various reasons. So we cannot say when the market will recover. I have seen some people predicting the market would go down.",

When the market has been bearish for several months now and hopefully we will see a bullish market in a few months then you should hold your coins until BTC makes a new ATH If you can't wait that long, at least wait for your investment to come in profit.",

Really, have you to sold some of them and made you loss?  if token in your portfolio is like crypto in top 100 market capitalization, better wait until the bull run arrives at least if you sell it later you will get a profit. Also already much answered above \"we don't know when the bullrun will come\", for long term investments at least you have to be patient for a few years and it's better to invest with only money you can afford to lose.",

This might change but bear markets mostly ends after bitcoin halving and bull markets starts not immediately but just within months after the halving.But have it in mind that anything can happen at anytime because the market is speculative and everything is changing with time.",
