No matter how cheap an item might be it's dangerous to patronize as you stand the risk of short life-span for such product as it's durability is questionable and you have to spend more in getting another again whereas you could have just bought an original and move on for longer years and less risk.This also applies to cryptocurrencies, as a trader avoid cheap coins it will only end you into loss unlike bitcoin that has been well tested and trust for year now.",

Cables that comes with cheaper parts are too flexible compare to premium parts, try buying a PSU with Chinese names on it and a Corsair PSU you will see what I talking able, the flexible cable is what mostly cause fire or start melting.",

I am not a crypto miner, but I had kept this in mind for plenty of years of doing my hobby of PC building. Usually when getting PSU, I stick to reputated brands like Corsair, EVGA, Seasonic, though that does not mean that you won't have bad PSU, the chances of your PSU being a ticking time bomb is just unlikely.I can still recall back in the days when my 4 pin ATX power connector burned then I realize that it was like one of those flexible cables that you're talking about there. Good thing it did not take my whole rig with it.",

Also don't forget to do monthly maintenance by checking your lines so that you can avoid any such incident.

That's why frequent maintenance should be done to make sure that your miners are in good condition and its better to separate it few meters to your house so that if there's something trouble that may cause fire to your units you can avoid getting more damage since your house is safe compare if you put it on one of your room where risk is so huge just like what happen to OP. The only key on that is proper maintenance and if you can do it daily much better since safety is important thing to make your money continuous flow on your rigs.",

If you are going somewhere for a long time, always disconnect all unnecessary devices from the socket, so not only will you prevent a possible fire or damage from a lightning strike, but you will also save some electricity because the devices consume even in standby mode.When it comes to mining, some may cause a fire, while others lose their lives, which reminded me of a case from a year ago.Translated from SourceQuote37-year-old police officer Maja MarkoviÄ‡ died due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances - namely, on the glazed terrace of the apartment, she and her husband kept several computers that were used for cryptocurrency mining. On that day, it started raining in Belgrade, and the unfortunate owner wanted to move two computers from the open terrace into the apartment.In the process, as it turns out, she touched the power cable of one of the computers, suffered an electric shock and died on the spot.",

I do follow mining groups and they always tell that never to be too cheap on the parts because for each part that you try to be cheap, you'll never know if it's just an imitation and low quality. Good thing that you are safe and you can still go on with your next builds and this is a lesson learned not just for you but to those that have plans of setting their budget too low and try to pick the cheaper ones but unknown qualities.",

Good thing that the fire did not burn your whole place down- though it is very unfortunate to hear that your video card got burnt.A few questions on my mind: is your place properly ventilated? Where is your mining rid also located? How is the climate on your country? These factors affect ultimately the outcome of your mining rig as it directly affect the proper temperature required for the rig to properly function. But you are right, there are no shortcuts to mining and purchasing cheap products to substitute for some parts would likely cause the issue of this.",
