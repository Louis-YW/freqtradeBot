  "content": "Some users have complained about some instability when using TalkImg, because they use Tor.The site works correctly in any browser, just due to the server's protections against hacks, those who use Tor sometimes have some difficulties accessing the site.The only way I can resolve this issue will be to upgrade the server again, which would allow me to make other types of configurations. But, that would mean almost tripling your monthly server costs. This type of upgrade is only expected to occur within 3-5 years, when the project is actually on a much larger scale. I think that so far, the service has fulfilled its purpose, despite this inconvenience for some users. Therefore, I would like to understand how many users use Tor, so I can make a decision on the matter. I therefore appeal for your consideration on this topic, and whether it is really relevant at this time to make this upgrade or follow the plan in order to ensure longevity.Appreciate your feedback.",

That's to make things easier for them. I don't think just a few seconds that will be spent uploading images there will cost them much harm, as they are so concerned about their privacy. My suggestion is that, for now, considering the cost and time it will cost you to do this upgrade and knowing that the site is not making you any money and you are using your personal funds to pay for the expenses and a few donations you get from fee forum members and projects on the forum, I will suggest you let it be the way it is for now, as it is still helpful and useful to most of us right now. It should be a major concern if up to 30–40% of its users are complaining.",

So I don't think OP is doing anything unreasonable. Honestly, in many countries even pedestrian stuff like gambling or political speech can lead to jail.

The timeline for the project only foresees this upgrade in 3 to 5 years.Regarding other image hosting services, which deal well with Tor, I don't know how to answer.

On the other hand, Contabo does not have great technical support to help me with the migration. It's not problematic, but it would involve more caution.It's true that I don't need processing power. But, I need recording speed, space and bandwidth.
