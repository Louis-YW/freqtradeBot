Something that gives yourself a personal brand and has a portfolio of projects you've contributed to in the past. In today's time with all the no-code website builders out there, anyone who is a Freelancer or actively seeking work in a personal capacity online should have a personal website that they can share. It helps you stand out from the others.",

It will better to create portfolio of your work so that client see your previous work before contacting. anyways if you really want to manage bounty then you should do some hardwork to start good business. first of all you should make some followers on Twitter page and bring some good community to telegram group. now you should also have a good conversation skill to talk with project marketing team. To find new projects you can check twitter or https://icodrops.com/ and then contact through their email or telegram.

Also ask me any questions if you want to do more about a bounty campaign.You have preached a lot of bounty campaigns, but you do not care to list any one of them here ? Why ? How would one know that you are speaking the truth and you really have that much experience?Also you said that according to everyone you promotion method is different, so can you care to tell that according to whom you are referring here ? Also you do not tell your unique promotion method ?I am afraid based on the details mentioned, you wont be able to get any bounty manager manager work here. Better be more professional and write your detailed experience.",
