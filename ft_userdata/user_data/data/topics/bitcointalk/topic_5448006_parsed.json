I am a supporter of work in manual mode, because it is more profitable and correct. In addition, it allows you to make good money.Why use a computer when you can do math on a piece of paper with a pencil yourself?Why use TradingView charts when you can check the price once a day and draw the chart manually on graph paper?Every strategy you have (like crossing moving averages, support and resistance and RSI and 10 more indicators all together) you can code into one buy signal and use this bot to track all trading pairs on all time frames 24/7 and alert you about perfect buy scenario, or even perform this trade automatically. Not even mentioning about MM and arbitrage bots. But yea ... its superfluous ... we can do it manually, but it does not give you real-time information and only takes a few hours a day...Back to OP. To anyone who will contact the author of the post. I recommend caution so that it does not turn out that an attempt to help will end in hacked wallets",

I am a supporter of work in manual mode, because it is more profitable and correct. In addition, it allows you to make good money.I can not judge someone based on their likeliness but I think, bots have their own benefits which manual work lacks like we can set order limits and can sleep and can do whatever work we want as the bots will automatically initiate our call to trade, whenever certain decline or incline will be reached.Can you tell how Manual trading is more fluent to you rather than not trading? I don't think manual trading provides more profits because sometimes you are buying and forgot to take an entry or exit the market accordingly and could miss the opportunity. But by using bots we can do our analysis firsthand and can input our entry and exit points into the hot and wallah we don't have to sit there and stare at screens for a long time. Coming back to OP I think this topic belongs to the service section, secondly, did you add malicious code in your bot, because you did not just share it here but instead ask us to come in ib, BTT does not tolerate spam(if you are doing I am not accusing you just sharing the fact if you do not know) so be familiar with the rules.",

More than that, you will have to have a highly refined bot to be successful in selling it. If you need someone to try our your bot then I would suggest you run a campaign on the forum with the help of reputed managers here. I have seen people rolling in hundreds of numbers if you have paid a trial. This way you can collect as much data as you want and refine your bot on the way. There are also popular bots and their developers on the forum itself. I would suggest checking out the Development and projects section for a more detailed review of them. More or less we also have ChatGPT now and there are rumors they are already building trading-based GPT projects. It is going to be very competitive. So brace yourself for the same. Good luck mate.",
