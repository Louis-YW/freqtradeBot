However, there are also potential risks associated with this shift, particularly with regard to China's growing economic and geopolitical influenceOP, it's not overreliance on the dollar that's making its value decline; the value is declining with respect to the inflation shift, which is a result of the high volume of the dollar that's being printed.The volume of dollars that are in circulation is really greater than their demand, and if those dollars are retracted, they will add more value to dollar and not have to greatly affect the economic.Inflation increased by 9.1% last year, and it was said that that's the biggest increase in over 40 years. What really contribute to these inflation is because the money supply has increased by about 7.7% per year since 2008, and the cause of this is still the higher growth of bank reserves and the money that is controlled by the Federal Reserve.At this point in time, the current cause of the devaluation and inflation is because the money in circulation has grown faster than the goods produced in the economy. The citizens of countries that use the dollar cannot use any other country's bank note in their country, so what other currency can they utilize to purchase things and also do other things if not dollar?The problem here is the high volume of dollars that are printed every year, and if the money is retained,dollar purchasing power will strengthen and cause deflation on the price of things as well. If the federal government so desires, it can exert control over the process.Bitcoin is the solution. OP, you can still read these threads to get more insight into what I have said.",

      "body": "In my opinion, the weakening of the role of the US dollar as a world reserve currency is connected with global world events.  Currently, there is a slowdown in the growth of the world population.  Until 1976, the human population grew exponentially.  However, after 1976, the population growth of planet Earth began to slowly slow down.  Currently, we are already seeing negative population growth in many countries of the world, only some countries in Africa and the Arab world are maintaining population growth.  Very soon the number of people on our planet will stop growing.  This has global consequences, since capitalism, as a social system, is based on a constant increase in the number of people (potential consumers of goods, works and services).  In addition, uniform (very high) consumption standards were established almost throughout the planet Earth.  These standards are based on the consumption of the most developed countries on Earth (USA, European Union, Australia, etc.).  At the same time, the resources of the planet are not able to provide such standards of consumption for 8-10 billion of the world's population. As a result, an irresolvable contradiction arose.  Capitalism, as a social system, is no longer able to fulfill the dream of 8 billion people for a better life.  Accordingly, the United States, as the leader of the Western capitalist world, is losing its former leading role.  And many countries are seeking to distance themselves from the US dollar and try to solve their economic problems on their own.",

What this countries are political after is to cut the power of the dollar and look for means to trade internationally in many currencies to avoid a single currency crisis. That is why countries like Saudi are looking at the possibility of accepting other currencies for their oil trade and not just the dollar.It is not even dollar alone that is facing the much depreciation almost every currency is having a bad period and that is Also why we have seen countries have shifted from holding their reserves in fiats and have moved towards assets like the Gold for reservations",

Yes, sticking with the dollar can restrict a country's ability to trade internationally with other countries that use various currencies. Do we really need to diversify?Not so fast, there are risks associated with China's BRICS expansion that must not be ignored. Rising Chinese economic and geopolitical influence may inflame international tensions and even lead to war. Who knows what economic conditions China might impose on countries that adopt the yuan?Scepticism and critical analysis are two of my favourite things. When it comes to the global economy, it's crucial that we weigh the benefits and drawbacks of every potential action. Rather than relying on many currencies, perhaps we should create ways to do so. Although we can't know what is ahead, we can always count on the benefits of being cautious and sceptical",

You just spoke my mind. It will be better to have a common currency that every nation will use for international trade. Alternatively, let all the nations of the world be willing to accept the local currencies of others regardless of the economic power of the such nation. China's and BRICS' intention is not to help developing nations but to make them rely on their proposed common currency. China is also seeking to make its currency as powerful as the dollar. If you analyze the intention of these anti-dollar forces, you will discover that they also have a political undertone. Developing nations remain the prey to these big nations. But smart leaders in these third-world nations could use this power tussle between these world powers to secure favorable bilateral trade deals.",

However, there are also potential risks associated with this shift, particularly with regard to China's growing economic and geopolitical influenceAnd I'll explain You are missing a very important point. You do not notice one very subtle nuance. While some are rejoicing at the supposedly \"accomplished punishment of the United States\" (though it is not clear why), in fact, a process is taking place that not everyone has realized yet. And when they realize - the way back will be very difficult and thorny.China, having taken the place of the second superpower (Russia turned out to be a complete fake), decided to gather vassals / servants / raw material appendages around itself, who are very excited about the idea of \"destroying the dollar\", and in their fantasies it means the USA China is smart, it is now simply manipulating less intelligent \"guinea pigs\", and removes them from dependence on the dollar, which is used by the entire civilized world, and makes them dependent on ... YUAN!With all this, China itself does not refuse the dollar! He is not an idiot - to lose the opportunity to interact with the world market and the leading economies!I think that in the wake of the “we will destroy the dollar” hysteria, China will be able to very quickly drive all “friends in the fight against the dollar” into a stall, I think these unfortunate people will lose the dollar in the gold reserves by 2024, and will become complete, obedient slaves of the yuan The funny thing is that these unfortunates are pushing themselves to this, deceiving themselves with some stupid fantasies",

Alternatively, let all the nations of the world be willing to accept the local currencies of others regardless of the economic power of the such nation. A common international currency is essentially the spirit behind the Bretton Woods system, the very system that established the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. Precisely, it was proposed by John Maynard Keynes that an international currency be created. He wanted to call it the Bancor. However, it didn't happen, and instead of a new international currency, the USD was assigned the role.As to the alternative that you mentioned, it simply isn't possible at all, because of how unstable other local currencies and economies are.

Yes, of course, developing nations are always at the receiving end of the world's power struggle in which the major players are the most powerful countries.

The BRICS coalition is not playing games and indeed already has great strength plus their invitation to the Middle Eastern countries has been very convincing. The weakening US Dollar proves that Biden is too soft to deal with threats in the West.This will be a challenge for the US to be more aggressive in the economic sector. BRICS is already running well and other Asian countries will also join in, especially since there is an inextricable relationship with trade contracts with China.",

I gotta say, I'm loving how the BRICS are shaking things up. It's about time we diversify our reserves and make ourselves less vulnerable to fluctuations. Plus, who doesn't love new opportunities for trade and growth, amirite?Personally, I'm feeling the Chinese yuan as a dope alternative reserve currency. China is already killing it in exports, and if they start promoting the yuan, it could be a game-changer for trade and investment. But let's not ignore the fact that China's getting more and more powerful, and that could cause some problems for other countries.Basically, countries need to do their homework before jumping into the currency game. Sure, there are risks involved, but I think the potential gains are worth checking out.",

Currently, more nations like China and others have built their economy and they also want to control some segments of the world's economy. I expected more from you. How could you say the USD has risen to its status because the US always control the world's economy? They can't do the magic, they rose to the level by actions and inactions. You might have an influence on the world's economy and through your policies cause havoc. I don't know how people like to heat up the polity for no just reason, but thankfully, the world's economists always see it differently and see the US as deserving, which is why I laugh at critics.Any country can plan their affair and flourish, which is what the US did and is doing and attracts more investors in the economy and their currency, so it's practical.In other words, the USD is reliable due to the US's wisdom of getting things mostly rightly done, not because they are superpowers or controlling. Other competing countries are free to do the same.",

They have been leveraging this for years after the WW2 using economic sanctions and it seems this is also the reason why other nations are shifting or applying to become part of BRICS.We soon going to opt out from the era of the US dollar which had been given countries unnecessary sanctions if they don't do what they want. US is always proud to call other countries corrupt when they are the major problem why the Russian Ukraine war had not ended. Why would the US sending ammunitions to Ukraine gingering there moral not to negotiate with Russia to end the war. So many things are happening and we seem not to understand what is going on. When I would not be that happy if the US dollar is dumped by major countries of the world because of the irregular activities of the US to have major control of the world. I am already in free mode to accept whatever happens if the US currency end up not having any values. Quote from: Flexystar on April 11, 2023, 12:05:54 PMChoose any other country but not China for sure. I am using products in my office which are mostly imported from the USA or European parts because of the quality they provide. We tried a few imports from China but they are horrible in quality and reliance. We can't even go for the Chinese currency if we are going to have opinion to go for strong and stable currency. We would prefer the Euro to be use than opting for the Chinese yuan.",

If I would have been in any of those countries, I would just shift to the country where USD is accepted. Lolz. Anyways, China can not take over OR compete with USD for sure. USA has been in the business for ages and it can not be shifted just like that. Imagine the chaos that other countries will have to bear during such reserve. The list of countries, by a strange coincidence, fully corresponds to the BRICS list, plus a few more unfortunate ones The currency can act as a reserve only if they are really backed - for example, the Dollar and the Euro - are provided with the most powerful economies, leadership in technology, high incomes, an excellent consumer market, political and military weight. Or be \"unique\" like the Swiss franc. If the country does not correspond to the one described above, the status of a reserve currency can be made only for a small group of countries, and then only by force or deceit. The second way was chosen by China.I do not want to offend the Chinese industry - but in most cases the products are not bad, but ... Far from high quality. And as a rule, these are niche products and products.And as you understand, the current situation with the Chinese economy requires URGENT measures to save it. Due to internal processes, this is almost impossible to do. But in the presence of \"dependent\" markets - this is easily and quite qualitatively solved.And let me remind you once again - despite the fact that China in every possible way supports the movement \"abandon the dollar\", he himself does not refuse it - oriental wisdom and the ability to manipulate not very smart \"partners\"",

This can lead to increased transaction costs, as well as make it more difficult to negotiate favorable trade agreements.Almost all countries have and use a different currency and has been trading with other nations before now. I don’t think it would limit the ability of a country to conduct trade internationally like you think. There would not be any limit cause the dollar is still very much backed and still accepted for trade by major economies of the world. I think being solely dependent on a single thing(currency or oil as a energy source) isn’t a good thing. When change finally comes sweeping in and it would surely come, it would be difficult to switch or adapt to a new alternative.",
