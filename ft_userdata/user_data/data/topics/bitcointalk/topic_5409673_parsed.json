  "content": "These days news about Mt Gox releasing of funds to its creditors is spreading on Twitter and seems very alarming to the BTC price action in coming days, as BTC price has not yet gained any momentum towards 28k which most of the so-called technical analysts predicted. I think we are most likely to hit <15k BTC in the coming days due to the release of almost 140k BTC from Mt gox.If you search for the #mtgox at Twitter you will see how tense is the situation: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mtgox&src=typed_queryThere is this report by BRL; https://twitter.com/lab_blockchain/status/1557330341139972104There were 22,560 creditors share total claims of $17 billion with an average claim of ~39btc. Do you think they are going to hold it ?",

I don't think that they will hold these bitcoins or are willing to hold them. When Mt gox was hacked, the price of bitcoin was nothing as compared to now. These people are lucky to get that money back and they will dump it right away as first of all it is free money for them and secondly, they have waited enough.",

But once again, BTC's going to recover from that a week or two later, and will eventually reach these current prices after about a month.Why? Because Gox crashed sometime in 2014. 8 years later, and I doubt that all those creditors still want to hold BTC, so many will probably liquidate them.",

After such awful experience no one will blame them for selling and fleeing, so most likely there will be pressure on price if more than half of the victims have this opinion but on the other hand, it is possible some will decide to hold base on the fact that their assets has appreciated since the mt gox incident happens. If it was me i won't be selling knowing what the future holds for btc but different strokes for different folks.",

Uh...what all of the creditors will do with their money when they get it back is unknown, but it is impossible that all of them will sell it instantly which will cause a mega-dump, some of these creditors will hold, while some will sell it, and that will tell the type of dump that is to come, another thing that will determine how bad it is going to be is how the money is going to be paid, would all the creditors receive a lump-sum payment of their money, surely people will request for alternate means, all of these will slow down the pace at which people will liquidate and reduce the effect on bitcoin price. QuoteSome will choose the later payment option; some will want a cash-only payout; some will accept the mixed payout. And once people do finally get their bitcoin, there is no reason to assume that everyone will dump all of it anytime soon.This snippet is from this news, it is from a month ago, but a good read on the topic.https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/14/no-mt-gox-payouts-arent-going-to-torpedo-bitcoins-price/",

Yes, there might be some of them that might be waiting for the next All-time-high price.. but we will definitely see a sizeable sell off of some of those coins. I hope a lot more of these people will hoard their coins, because they were some of the early investors that had the balls and the vision to invest in something when it was still unknown and a very high risk.

While the funds being released can be seen as a threat (assuming that people will try to sell immediately, that is), it's also a very positive thing because those who were wronged a long time ago in one of the most famous crypto scams/hacks are finally getting some reimbursements. I think that FUD over a lot of money entering the market will be balanced out to excitement that something good came out of it when most probably did not expect to get anything and came to accept their losses. I also don't think all of those people will sell their BTC immediately, given that the price is still fairly low and they can hold the funds long-term, properly this time. We'll see, of course, if something like that truly happens.",

Sooner or later, very few people will be fearful about such riskSEC reject for Bitcoin ETFs in 2018, 2019: previously people thought that the market dumps because of SEC-related news. Later, such news did not bring negative effects.Consumer Price Index, etc in the USA: we are witnessing it but in last two times of such announcement, not dramatic fear and price dumps on the market.Choose a good asset for your portfolio, understand about it (basics at least) and be strong!",

But I am even more surprised that people in some sensationalistic way try to present the situation of refunding funds to damaged clients and that this has been going on for months.From some previous topics it was possible to find out that 3 payment options are available to clients - cash to bank account, Bitcoin or BCH. It is also known that the payments will be made gradually, that is, not everyone will receive their funds on the same day. When these facts are taken into account, why does anyone expect that around 140 000 BTC will be dumped on the market at one point and that this will cause a new crash?I read some comments from the link posted in the OP and one comment caught my attention - if there is anyone who is expecting payment from Mt.Gox, can they confirm that they haven't even asked for BTC addresses to return BTC?Quote@TheZadokPeople continue to talk #mtgox as if they know. Point to false articles. Nothing this month. They haven't even asked for a #bitcoin address yet. It's just fear to fit a narrative. Maybe I should start an ask a creditor thread lmao 🤣  relax. Will post when it's coming #btc $btc",

Do you think they are going to hold it ? Well somethings not quite right here, as we're talking about 140K bitcoin that's worth $3.4 billion as of typing, not $17 billion. Unless $10b+ has already been claimed as part of the earlier payout scheme? (I just realised that the amount credited is lower than the amount claimed, hence $18.4 billion in claims with 140K Bitcoin credited)Quote from: CoinDeskcreditors were asked to choose between receiving an early, partial lump sum payment or waiting until the end of civil rehabilitation on the off-chance there will be more funds available to be disbursed, meaning they’d recover a larger sum.There are so many unanswered questions about this case; Have creditors already received their cash settlement for those who chose this option, given that Fortress were offering to give early payouts for 20% discount when price was around $60K? How many actually opted (sort of gambled) to wait for their Bitcoin in the hope it would be slightly more than the earlier cash settlement, and is it? Doesn't look like it...One thing for sure is that 140K is a lot of coins, but is only around 10% of daily volume, which in contrast sounds like nothing. The selling can be absorbed a lot easier than most would expect, as long as there are buyers waiting to buy, as opposed to speculators shorting the price. Even if all the coins were sold on the same day, we're talking about an extra 10% of volume, so might only lead to a 10% dip in reality if price remains relatively neutral up until that point. If price starts breaking above $25K towards $30K with high volume, any creditors selling could become barely noticeable, depending on market sentiment.This is no longer the extra 850K liquidity disaster that could of happened, it's now only around 0.66% increase in available circulating supply.Quote from: PrivacyG on August 13, 2022, 01:33:55 PMI am almost convinced a large part of them will dump everything simply due to Bitcoin currently standing somewhere close to the All Time High of 2017. Why would these creditors be choosing to receive Bitcoin over cash if they want to dump the coins? Makes no sense.",
