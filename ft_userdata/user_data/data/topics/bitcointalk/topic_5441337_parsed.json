He is restricted to an algo -> Ethash, but you can mine every Ethash coin (etho, ethw, ethf, etc, zil, clo..... - all coins on this list = https://miningpoolstats.stream/ethereumclassic). Etchash is only slightly different to Ethash, but it only needs some changes in the software.Is 7GB really enough for the next 5 years? ETHW for example - the 7GB is only good for the next 3 years. But sure it is enough at the moment. It is the same like BTC miners. This miners can also mine hundreds of coins, the only restriction is - they must use the sha256 algo.I switched all my old AMD cards to kaspa+zil - squeeze the last shit out of this cards   - and also started to buy newer cards - i get 6600xt around 180€ sometimes",

They take a small loss on the ZIL side of things but subsidize the loss with their ETC revenue gained and massive hidden fees. It's a conspiracy!But seriously you can see our pools hashrate going up along with our ZIL round awards which are onchain. Not to mention that we've been around for years, have a legal address in Canada, and at one time had $25+mil of unpaid miners funds in our wallet and if we were unethical that would have disappeared. We're not going to start doing unethical things over the couple hundred dollars of ZIL we make monthly. If we really were unethical there are a lot of things we could be doing to competing pools.I invite people with E9 Pro's to test for themselves the profitability...ETHW pays around 10% more than ETC while ETC+ZIL pays 30% more.I know the person claiming its technically impossible, its the pool op of Crazypool and his staff/miners, just because he can't get it working doesn't mean we can't. He couldn't get his ZIL pool working properly and we're the ones that told him what to do. Without our technical support he would not have a ZIL pool and he's done his best to make us regret helping him. So obviously we know more than him when it comes to ZIL. We're the ones who created ZMP (Zilliqa Miner Protocol) that allows for ZIL mining past Epoch 0 and makes dual mining standardized. We also created a bunch of other things, for instance we were the first pool publicly to have MEV on ETH. We made our own mining program for Chia called FlexFarmer. Flexpool is more than just a simple mining pool, we innovate as well. There are no hidden fees, we charge 3%+costs for ZIL as ZIL servers are expensive. Any miner on Flexpool knows this as we disclose it under Get Started. In return, miners receive more ZIL per round. You can compare how much ZIL Crazypool makes per round per GH/s to Flexpool. We make significantly more ZIL than them per GH/s because we didn't cheap out on servers. Even with charging for costs our miners make more. And that data directly contradicts your theory that we're faking the E9 Pro working as quite a bit of our hashrate comes from E9 Pro's so you'd see our ZIL per GH/s going lower if so.I know who you are and I know you don't like us but please don't say weird things like us faking the E9 Pro working and generously airdropping miners to fake it. By that argument any pool could be faking, maybe they are just millionaires buying crypto and giving it to miners out of the generosity of their hearts.What doesn't lie is onchain data and you can clearly see onchain that per ZIL round we make 10%+ more ZIL than Crazypool. Crazy is not a competent developer, he even had his home address up publicly and we gave him a heads up to remove it before he got attacked (he lives in South America and you can imagine having millions in crypto plus your home address online is not safe even in America). Our ZIL pool setup is technologically superior because we have better developers which leads to more income for miners. And its because we have better developers that we figured out how to get the E9 Pro working. It took us a lot of work to do this, you even know the person who worked with us to get it working on his E9 Pro over a few days. If we were faking it we wouldn't have put so much effort into it and gotten the help of someone in the community. The E9 dual miners +ZIL fine, the newer E9 Pro is capable of doing the same. Bitmain locked the E9 Pro to Antpool (other pools have hacked it to get it mining ETC elsewhere) and doesn't want people moving pools which is probably why they want to hide that it can mine ZIL. But given that the E9 Pro is newer than the E9 with the same hardware and software (to people's knowledge), is it really so hard to believe it can dual mine +ZIL the same as the E9?Note: I know Rabid ran a test comparing pools which showed that Crazy pays more than us. Rabid lives pretty close to me in Canada and we chat often so I'd say he's a non-biased source, hell he may even be biased towards me. That being said, a short test using different devices isn't a good test. We ran a 7 day test using 1 gpu on each ZIL pool and we came out ahead for ZIL (but behind Ezil for ETC which we assume was just luck).",

ZIL round rewards are more than 100% of what you'd expect from our hashrate.In ETH terms, if the blocks a day are higher than the pools hashrate should get, there are no problems. Accusing us of faking that it works then ignoring that we're making more ZIL (which means it must be working!) is a funny way to do things.Crypto is transparent, all data is on chain, we can't fake how much ZIL we get per round.
