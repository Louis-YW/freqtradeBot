The first person I heard this from is the Cardano CEO lol, I never thought you are thinking the same thing.. My target is 13,000$ and I think its very possible.2020, BTC never hit that CME gap at 9600 usd. So I said when btc was 10k and trolls were expecting it to crash below 10k and I said that BTC will go to 79k then crash to hit that CME gap of 9.6k. BTC hit 69k which was 10k lower than what I thought it would be, so that was 15% margin of error, maybe this time will be another 15% of error too? I wonder. I know when to buy and this will get worse worse and worse before it gets better. I still think will be a last bulltrap before btc crashes and we see the true bottom.",

And which altcoins would you rather mine and hold for 2024 and 2025? The plan is simple.As long as you can mine with your setup do so as Ethereum PoS is long far away from us no matter what you read in the news and no matter that they did the merge testnet as of late.The Ethereum developers know that if they move to PoS may be a deadly move against Ethereum so the minimum they will do is to extend the PoS as further away as possible.Mining now can make you huge amounts as I have said many times in this section in different threads,I was mining at a big loss at 2018 but those amount of Bitcoin I mined were precious to me in February 2021,I am repeating that plan,keep mining at a loss and wait a couple of years to get huge benefits.",

Very simple: mine. the. most. profitable. coin. then trade it for the coins you want to HODL.I think the end of the bear market will ultimately come when the next economic crisis happens and the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to 0% again.Quote from: swogerino on June 15, 2022, 08:07:39 PMI was mining at a big loss at 2018 but those amount of Bitcoin I mined were precious to me in February 2021,I am repeating that plan,keep mining at a loss and wait a couple of years to get huge benefits.That is the lesson I learned last time.

I see exactly the same type of market since ETH PoS will happen and it will be almost as devastating as the ASIC revolution was in 2013-2014. We won't see a repeat of 2019 as long as ETH switches to PoS. If it doesn't switch, I expect another 2019 market where GPU mining profit was OK on GRIN/RVN/BTG with nVidia cards.",
