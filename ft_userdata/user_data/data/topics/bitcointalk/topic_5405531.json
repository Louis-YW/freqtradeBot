I don't think most of those who are victims of hacks are even necessarily careless. It's just a chanced thing upon them.",

The user was a controversial persona. I'm not sure any forum drama escaped their attention. However, I don't agree with your angle of a user eliciting any perceived great quality of another should be seen as an attempt to fish for merit. For instance, I've come to associate you with good intention and your posts are pleasant to read too, should I be accused of merit fishing any time I admire your attributes too. Again, my intent study of mankind suffices that no individual can be so bad that no single person likes them. My point in the last sentence is this – even with the perceived bad nature of Lauda, there were users who still admired them and felt bad when that account was \"self banned\"",

I was still in my beginner days when this user @Lauda opted to live the forum. It was a sad episode for sure to have such a reputable user that has integrated the forum in many ways opt to live based on her personal reasons.She left behind a legacy worth protecting as you can see in the great deal of effort she did put in to ensure there is no returning to the account and DT's also made there mark to caution other forum users. It wa something memorable!When it comes to unsolicited PM's you've got to be very skeptical with the advice and links it contains. Best advice, read and ignore so long as you didn't have no trouble with wth your account. You'll be good!",

But I like people that do a great job for the Development of a community. Like most heroes in the past even our communities, countries plus freedom fighters did a great things.
