  "content": "Hey,569 days ago, 4 november 2021, it was the worst day of my life, I accidently sent Binance USD 11,564k (ERC20) instead of (BEP20) tx id:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1015f59623eef678b482cf95a1455f22d3cd652f9b1ae9716e9a97392474dbd7Totally my fault especially when the deposit page said: (ONLY send Binance USD (BUSD) to this deposit address.Do NOT use BEP2, ERC20 or other network standards as you may lose your deposit. ONLY make deposits through the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) network. The use of contract addresses is not allowed!)I knew it was over, but I tried to send a mail to their support to support-en@1x-bit.com, they replied: Dear User,As stated on the deposit page of the BUSD currency of our website, do NOT use BEP2, ERC20, or other network standards as you may lose your deposit. ONLY make deposits through the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) network.Your deposit has been made through the ERC20 network. Unfortunately, the funds will not be credited to your account. Please be careful next time.I accepted the loss like a pro and moved on with my life, but it hurt. 11,564k is a nice sum, but it was probably the happiest day of my life because I had been careful since till I got on etherscan today and discovered the money were retreived and transferred out 88 days ago!!!!page of my ethereum deposit address:https://etherscan.io/token/0x4fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6e7a623c7c53?a=0x90b5cd0a271a393ba5c54aa9b13c9687aa28e330TX of the funds transferred out: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcccdabf00305d3ccd467dd2fc96bed7586150c3677533369d7518a87370740a7Looks like the funds were transferred out to the owner of 1xbit: 0xd7e56d3A509639ef53F7b08711F672A1A8567825 (I know this because that address is constantly getting cash from the 1xbit main wallet and transferring them to Binance.)I tried texting them, but they are not replying; nonetheless, if someone can help me, I would pay $3000.Thanks!",

Or better yet, the OP could report the matter to the authorities. The amount is not insignificant and it could be worth the effort.",

Someone can commit suicide for losing such an amount of money.To be a newbie, it is never justified to send an amount of that size to any site even if its reputation is confirmed, without doing the necessary research. And through the way he raised the issue here, he never seems to be a newbie, since he can differentiate between networks and track transactions.He was not successful in choosing the network, and this is a mistake that can happen to any of us in cases of lack of attention, but he is wrong and guilty of himself by choosing that platform known for its very bad reputation.Quote from: Zlantann on May 29, 2023, 04:49:00 PMQuote from: albon on May 27, 2023, 08:10:40 PMUpdate: I tried contacting Binance customer service regarding your case, reporting a scam, and getting assistance returning the stolen funds.

Thank you for this uncommon selfless service. I don't think that the Binance support team will be able to help him in any way, since there is nothing to prevent 1xbit from using Binance in a manner that does not violate any of the stipulated terms of use, and I also do not think that it will venture to stop the account that received the stolen amount even if it is proven that it is associated with 1xbit.In the most extreme cases, even if Binance takes a position against the account after it proves its involvement in suspicious activities (related to 1xbit or otherwise), it is never expected to compensate OP for the amount that was lost from 1xbit, as this is not one of its tasks in the first place.",
