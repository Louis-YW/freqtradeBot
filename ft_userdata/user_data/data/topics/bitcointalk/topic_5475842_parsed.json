Using color patterns to make the carving more vivid and coated with varnish to make it more luster and the color of the wood comes out. Actually, this is very suitable for wall displays and placed in front of the door when in winter.Regardstaufik123 VIDEO REVIEWFull Album Carving Processhttps://www.talkimg.com/album/UwqCRoobet Username: taufik123bech32 BTC address: bc1qcqf82ys3afxx04ga89rgew7hhn75e0hz6cnxcu",
