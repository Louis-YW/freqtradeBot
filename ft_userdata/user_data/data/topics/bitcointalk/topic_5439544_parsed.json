Polygon doesnt do mining like bitcoin. It has a total supply of 10billion , but already has 9 billion circulating supply. So only few left from its total. Probably some release from the team or potential reserved funds. It is a binance ieo project that has been introduced before but now its own chain L1 which is also a compatible evm. It has consensus mechanism of PoS so its feature not allowed to do mining like in PoW.",

This distribution is planned to be completed by April 2025. By then, the total supply of MATIC should be at 10 billions.",

Price is based on supply and demand which is impacted by addoption, project use-cases, project user base, market conditions, short term irrationality of investors, amount and condition of competition and many more.",

Is Bitcoin finishing by February 2028?Where did you get the February 2028 Bitcoin End Date? are you just guessing? You should know that Bitcoin will finish mining on May 7, 2140, at block 367,500 assuming mining power remains constant going forward. This is not an exact date, but at least that date is the closest to the final mining process of bitcoin mining and will reach 21 million BTC. You can learn about it at this link. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supplyand for Supply Polygon the detailed explanation is like this:Polygon (MATIC) Tokenomics AllocationThe initial distribution of Polygon (MATIC) tokens is as follows: 12.00% is allocated to Staking Rewards 23.33% is allocated to the Ecosystem 21.86% is allocated to Foundation 4.00% is allocated to Advisors 16.00% is allocated to the Team 3.80% is allocated to Private Investors 19.00% is allocated to Binance LaunchpadMATIC Supply Schedule The initial token launch date for Polygon (MATIC) is 26 April 2019. The max supply of this token is capped at 10,000,000,000. The supply of Polygon (MATIC) is expected to be fully vested by April 2025.Source: https://forum.polygon.technology/t/a-deep-dive-into-polygon-matic/1826",

Is Bitcoin finishing by February 2028?No. In Bitcoin, new coins are issued and rewarded to miners who successfully mined a block. The reward for each block is currently at 6.25 bitcoins. This reward halves every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years). It's hard to estimate when the supply cap will be reached, but it's definitely not going to happen in Feb 2028. By 2028, we're likely still seeing block rewards at 3.125 or 1.5625 per block. Here's a page if you want to see the historical supply, previous halving date, and the short term forecast https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply",

I think the price will be less than 10 dollars.",
