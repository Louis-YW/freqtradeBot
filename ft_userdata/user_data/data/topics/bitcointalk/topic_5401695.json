But as soon as at least a small amount comes to your address, then on the blockchain (for example, using something like blockexplorer.com) you can immediately see that the address is active.

Quote from: serjent05 on June 11, 2022, 10:46:57 PMIsn't the created address already registered on the Blockchain even without receiving any coins?Addresses are not registered on the blockchain - once an address receives coins for the first time, then it will be recorded in the blockchain. But every valid address already exists and can be sent coins at any time by any person, without any prior interaction with the blockchain.Quote from: serjent05 on June 12, 2022, 08:34:43 AMWhy can I search and find a newly created address on the blockchain explorer without any transaction if you say that it only gets registered on the blockchain if it has carried out at least a single transaction?Blockchain explorers will generally allow you to search for any valid address. If it can find no record of that address on the blockchain, then it just displays an empty address.Quote from: serjent05 on June 12, 2022, 08:34:43 AMHow can a newly created address accept a transaction if it isn't recognized by the block?  If it isn't recognized by the block shouldn't the transaction be invalid or rejected?The blockchain has absolutely no way of knowing if someone has generated any specific address. All that happens is that nodes will check if the address is valid before accepting the transaction. Addresses can be invalid if they contain characters or symbols not in the character set, have an incorrect checksum, are too long or short, and so on. As long as the address is valid, then your transaction will be accepted.For example:The address 1serjentserjentserjentserjent is invalid, and if you try to look it up you will return an error.The address 1serjentserjentserjentserjenasRA4 is valid, and if you try to look it up you will be shown an empty address. The blockchain has no way of knowing if anyone actually generated that address in their wallet or owns the associated private key.",

As I mentioned above, there is no such thing as \"registering\" an address.Here's an analogy. Let's say I run a delivery business, and I keep a database of all the addresses I've delivered to in the past. Obviously I don't generate a database containing every possible address in the world and then tick the ones I've delivered to - that would be crazy. Instead, whenever I deliver to a new address, I create a new entry in my database. If someone asks if I've delivered to an address before, I can just open my database and do a quick search operation. If nothing shows up, then I know I've never delivered to that address. But my database tells me nothing about when that address was built or even if someone is living there.In the same way, the blockchain does not keep a record of every possible address, it simply records which addresses are receiving deliveries (outputs). If you try to look up an address and find nothing, then it shows you an empty database entry.",

These rules are different for different address types. For example, legacy addresses must begin with 1, must use Base58Check encoding, must have a valid checksum, and so on. Native segwit addresses must begin with bc1q, must use Bech32 encoding, must have a valid checksum, and so on. If you break any of these rules, then this address is invalid. If you try to look up an invalid address on most block explorers they will return an error, and if you try to send funds to an invalid address then almost certainly your transaction will either be rejected by your wallet or rejected by the node you try to broadcast it to.If, on the other hand, an address passes all these rules, then the address is valid, even if it has never received any coins. Such addresses are simply unused, rather than invalid.If you look again at the two address examples I gave in my earlier post in this thread - the first one is invalid, while the second is valid but unused.",
