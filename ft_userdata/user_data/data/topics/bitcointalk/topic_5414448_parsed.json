When this happens, you as a owner of those coins, will not have access to those coins. The other things is.... if you store all your coins on the casino, then you will be tempted to gamble with it. My advice... keep most of your coins on hardware wallets and determine a gambling budget for every casino that you use... and only deposit those coins onto those casinos.",

It's pretty random I think but pretty small most of the time (less than a $100). So I guess I've never really withdrawn directly, but indirectly it did reduce the amount I deposit to play with, hence \"indirectly\". If I do stop to play I just leave the money there (not that it's much in the first place) and do not really withdraw it till the day I want to play again.",

With that money, I can directly play any gambling games without a problem. But if I can win much money, I will immediately withdraw my win and still leave some money, maybe less than $25, in my account. But it is rarely I can win much money playing gambling because I do not see good luck in me while gambling. Besides, I only play occasionally and do not use too big money.",

For a casino with a good reputation and long-standing I would only keep a fixed amount that I have resolved to use for gambling for say that period in my casino balance just to ensure that I can keep my gambling activities in check.",

We'll have to pay for the fee again to the network although it's not that a lot but sometimes, it's really making us think that it's a lot of effort to do so. Not just much for me to leave, maybe around $50-$200 would be the ideal for me. Unless I want to add more but I don't want to leave that much there.",

So what i does after having such experience was to leave some funds in those casino site, which is from $10 to $30 ~ NGN 21k at 713 per $1.",

I have only seen free withdrawal while using fiat.

So I'm currently not leaving any amount on betting platforms for now. My one account even got deactivated for being inactive and the funds taken. I'm not sure why such a policy. Back when I was active, I used to keep several hundreds or even a thousand on gambling accounts. I particularly intended it that way because I loved live betting and I got annoyed a number of times for failing to make the most of fleeting odds because I got easily drained of funds. Anyway, even if you're not leaving significant amounts, your platform should be reliable.",

I am sure that I have lost 1 BNB, because accidentally havent switched it to other crypto and accidentally played all-in in dice autobet. Besides that, maybe only couple of hundred bucks worth crypto. I mainly either use faucet money, or gamble low bet, because I seek joy of playing, than aim to win big. I prefer to keep just an amount I can allow to lose - that will be less than 50 bucks.",

For me, it's not a problem to leave $100-200 in casinos for gambling, everything over that would be too much! I never had any problems with any of the reputable casinos around regarding my bankroll or something similar.",
