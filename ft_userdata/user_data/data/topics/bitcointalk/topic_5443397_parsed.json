There's been no real developments in bruteforcing, since it's literally the least effective way of attacking something. Are you looking to brute force a password that you've lost or are you asking about certain encryption? If you're looking for a way of recovering your password, there's services out there or there's btc-recover. However, unless your password is very weak or you know most of it, bruteforcing isn't going to get you anywhere, and will likely be a waste of resources.",

Brute force attacks can in theory end up with ... stealing, hence in most cases they're shady, unless you indeed have lost your password.Anybody with some more experience in Bitcoin knows the brute forcing wallets is meant to end up only with wasted resources and nothing found.Then, brute force attacks are often asked for bought wallets which are usually a scam, i.e. wallets created artificially and that don't contain anything useful.This leaves only one brute-forcing related endeavor on the forum I know about. It's Bitcoin puzzle transaction ~32 BTC prize to who solves it and maybe other threads too related to the same addresses.",

Doesn't worth it. But if you still want to try it I would recommend projects like brainflayer.https://github.com/ryancdotorg/brainflayerThere are a lot of videos explaining how this tool works.And here the question is why do you want to use python for this? and if you are good with python why not to build your own bruteforcing tools?",
