Remember that your coins ownership is on your private key. So regardless of what wallet are using to stake the coins, You can still access your stake coins on other wallet as long as you use same private key or seed phrase.Quote from: hack3rcon on May 19, 2023, 03:54:48 PM3- Can I use two wallets simultaneously?Yes",

I currently use Safepal Mobile Wallet + Hardware Wallet, Bitkeep Wallet, and imToken. Of the three wallets, both have advantages and disadvantages, but maybe for a more complete network you can use Safepal because it is always updated with many new chains, and also for BitKeep has many features that other wallets do not have such as complete crypto security features.  I also installed many types of wallets that support android to find out the advantages and disadvantages.I used imToken for a long time but then I switched to a trust wallet before finally completely forgetting it due to several problems that occurred.For a while, the unstoppable wallet was very comfortable with me on android although there are several other types of wallets that are just as good.So far, the wallet that I use to store assets is the Electrum.",
