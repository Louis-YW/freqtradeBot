I have exposed many such fake scam exchanges but scammers are still using the idea of â€‹â€‹this exchange, since they are getting their victims, they are bringing these fake exchanges one after another to scam.Crypto users need to keep in mind that nothing is free, some stranger is suddenly giving you access to his thousands of dollars account to withdraw those funds. It doesn't make sense. So using comsense is most important to stay safe from such scams.",

True. They even send notification type emails to download updated versions of various wallets, and add malware to the files to hack the crypto user's entire system. Scammers create those emails in a very creative way that many unknowingly click on the link added by the scammer in that email and become victims.And when the bear market starts, the number of such scammers increases enormously. So at this time, if any crypto user receives any kind of email, he should only click it after verifying it properly to avoid being a victim of scam.",
