      "body": "Ending racism starts within yourself, it starts with oneâ€™s approach into life, and openness to humanity itself. If all can start to think like me there would end racism. However, a lot of the world has been founded on separation by race, there was no understanding other cultures which is sad. A never-ending circle that continues for generation after generation, that evolves into a bigger type of racism. I believe that it is about equality and knowing that your next door neighbor is different, and that neighbor should not be judged for who they are. If we all start to put this into awareness, we can make a difference.",

      "body": "Racism is a deeply ingrained and complex societal issue that has been present throughout human history. While it is certainly possible to reduce and mitigate the effects of racism through education, awareness-raising, and policy changes, completely eliminating racism from the world may be difficult to achieve.There are a number of factors that contribute to the persistence of racism, including a lack of understanding and empathy for people from different backgrounds, structural inequality and discrimination, and implicit biases that can be difficult to recognize and overcome.Efforts to combat racism typically involve working to educate people about the harms of discrimination and prejudice, promoting diversity and inclusion, and working to dismantle systems and structures that perpetuate inequality. Additionally, it's important to listen and elevate the voices of marginalized communities, who are often the ones directly impacted by racism, to address their needs and perspectives.",
