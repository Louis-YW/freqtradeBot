What i believe is that no amount of people can bring down Bitcoin irrespective of any amount of money they are being paid, the more they tries they more the famous and popular, higher in price it becomes.",

A guy who gets paid to publish anti Bitcoin papers since 2018 and did nothing else since then, because he probably wouldn’t have any relevance without it. I read trough some of his bs and he already comes to the conclusion that any energy Bitcoin uses, is wasted, before even doing any research, or looking into the whys. He even still quotes papers that have already been debunked long ago1, just because it fits his narrative and creates panic. He has competing conflict of interests, because he runs some weird low quality “news” website2, that’s only goal is to “expose new digital trends”. This guy made it a living to talk negatively about Bitcoin and gets paid for it, if he would stop his career would be over. That’s the kind of people we’re dealing with. It seems like they just scrapped together some people with any kind of title to push some propaganda into the population that makes it seem more legit. Its a first sign of desperation, their baseless talks wont change anything, no matter how hard they’ll try.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8[2] https://digiconomist.net/",

We know they are nothing if they are not heavily funded.I totally agree with you on this note, however, I saw what will happen to Bitcoin and the entire crypto sphere in Nigeria when the central bank of the country banned Bitcoin and crypto related transactions, there were very few persons who were actively involved in crypto before the ban was announced, but few weeks after the ban, the number of crypto users in Nigeria skyrocketed and today, over 30 million Nigerians are actively, investing and trading Bitcoins and other crypto coins. So what does this mean? it means that more this people go about and speak ill of Bitcoin, the more more people are noticing Bitcoin and getting involved, its a free advertisement for Bitcoin and the  entire cryptocurrency sphere.",

That is the only thing, like not even a bad or a mediocre or whatever, I can't believe that there are people who think that it is not awesome, anything lower is wrong. Let alone understanding how awesome crypto is, there are people who call it bad?I mean even \"good\" is not enough to explain what bitcoin is, and these people think that is bad. I agree that the truth will come out, and we are going to see plenty more people go in. 10 years algorithm when I said it was awesome, not many people agreed, today more and more people agree with us, and that number will go up higher and higher.",

I expect this to happen by 2025, because that is enough time for the traditional economies policies fail due to inflation, so investors will have to come back to crypto investments in order to protect their funds against devalued fiat currencies, including dollar. Moreover, bitcoin halving is going to have a major impact on price, as always.I also see a considerable increasement on the demand for crypto services and financial platforms, which will completely replace traditional banks' services for many people around the world. Not because crypto is a trend, but because the features and advantages offered to customers here are much superior.",

There have never been a smooth path to the top. The more the critics the more publicity it gains and the more stronger it gets. I am no in any way worried about it because I know fir sure that Bitcoin is only preparing to bounce back and coming back with full momentum.Never the less, Crypto has come to stay and it is the  only way to the rescue now. I think in less than no time the world would be well acquainted with it and many would start seeing the importance of blockchain and Bitcoin in the making. Blockchain was never a mistake in any ways.",
