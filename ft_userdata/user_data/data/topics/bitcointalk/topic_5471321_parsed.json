True to its name, the Innovator Chain is at the forefront of blockchain innovation, presenting a comprehensive ecosystem that invites third-party projects, users, and developers to unlock new realms of utility.At its core, Innovator stands as a level one blockchain, offering an array of developed utilities that grant users direct interaction with the widely acclaimed Metamask wallet.This unique feature caters to both EVM and Substrate-based products on the Innovator Chain, setting a new industry standard. Gone are the days when Substrate users had to rely on Polkadot extensions; Innovator redefines user convenience by seamlessly integrating Metamask throughout its ecosystem, promoting interoperability between both EVM and Substrate.What truly sets Innovator apart is its ingenious approach to asset management. When depositing tokens from any EVM network, these assets are securely safeguarded on a one-to-one basis within the Innovator Chain asset pallet. Simultaneously, Innovator creates an ERC20 Substrate-based token on its platform, a ground-breaking concept exclusive to Innovator and Substrate-based chains.This innovation empowers users with the unprecedented ability to freely navigate an array of assets from different chains, trading, and utilising them within the Innovator blockchain.Imagine having Ethereum ERC20 tokens and Binance Smart Chain BEP20 tokens seamlessly integrated into the Innovator ecosystem, all transformed into Substrate ERC20 tokens. This transformation enables these tokens to interact harmoniously as if they originated from a single chain, eliminating the need for tedious bridging to access your favourite tokens across multiple networks.In addition, Innovator offers a user-friendly dashboard and wallet system that grants users the ability to monitor their assets across all EVM chains from a single, comprehensive dashboard. So bid farewell to the days of network switching just to keep tabs on your holdings across different chains. This approach not only streamlines the user experience but consolidates all your assets in one convenient location. Innovator Chain truly represents a bold step forward in the world of blockchain innovation, bringing an array of novel features and capabilities to the forefront of the industry.Innovator Chain also introduces a revolutionary ecosystem integrated into its runtime, setting a new standard for blockchain platforms. This decentralised approach offers projects a superior foundation for launching their products. Innovator brings forth several unique components, beginning with its exchanges. It boasts an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where NFTs play a pivotal role. Projects can harness the potential of generating passive income for users who hold these distinct Non-Fungible Tokens through trading fees generated by the project’s pool.Additionally, Innovator provides a robust Decentralised Exchange for Limit, Market, and Stop loss orders, offering all the advantages of a centralised exchange but in a decentralised manner, also token listings and pool approvals on Innovator are determined through community voting, thereby minimising the risk of fraudulent activities and ensuring that only the most reputable projects can utilise the ecosystem provided by Innovator.Furthermore, Innovator presents a game-changing NFT Marketplace. Leveraging the capabilities of Substrate technologies and limitless scalability, this marketplace offers unprecedented utility for projects. Projects can utilise the marketplace in their own native tokens or facilitate the creation, sale, and management of NFTs in multiple currencies. With features like #ReferralProgram, sharding, and the option to reward users with loyalty tokens, Innovator’s #NFT Marketplace stands as a frontrunner in the industry, providing developers, creators, and users with enhanced functionality compared to more conventional platforms like Opensea.Innovator X, the launchpad, adds another layer of innovation to the ecosystem. This unique product disrupts the blockchain industry with a novel concept akin to a “Dragons Den” pitching event. It enables individuals from diverse backgrounds and industries to present their ideas to the community, which are then vetted and, if approved, proceed to the launchpad. Where, these ideas are matched with developers eager to bring them to life. This fresh and collaborative approach positions the Innovator brand as one of the industry’s leaders, set to inject new, inventive ideas into the blockchain space and drive true innovation in the industry. Keep an eye on Innovator as it emerges as a key player not only during the upcoming #bullrun but also in the long term.Chain SpecsAlgorithm: Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)Block time: 6 SecondsEpoch: 3 hoursERA: 6 hoursInflation: Ideal 10%Genesis Release Date: 13th NovemberSubstrate: EVM: Full EVM Substrate /Solidity compatiblePremine: 6 Million INOV8Useful Links and MediaWebsite: https://innovatorchain.comDiscord: https://discord.innovatorchain.comTelegram: https://t.me/Innovator_chainTwitter: https://twitter.com/INNOVATORCHAINMedium: https://medium.com/@innovatorchainReddit: https://reddit.com/r/innovatorchain/",
