  "content": "I have one never listed, loaded 2013 Cassacius Brass 1 BTC. This is not an auction, but I am going to test the price to see if it is worth not peeling and selling blank. Buyer can feel free to use escrow. If there is a buyer close to Seattle who would like to pay cash and meet at Chase Bank where it is in a safe deposit box, that would be my preferred method of sale. Otherwise I am willing to use recommended escrow in this forum and take payment in BTC. I will take down post when an agreement is made.  https://imgur.com/wdwzksLhttps://imgur.com/MJHNrluhttps://imgur.com/FFcKJ0h",

      "body": "This forum typically isn’t for cash sales as you request, but Crypto. You are better off listing on Ebay or an auction house for cash. I will let Miner Jones speak for himself, but I doubt he would get involved in a cash transaction for various reasons including safety. Be careful of fraudsters, as I’m sure a few have tried to reach out already.  Good luck with the sale, nice coin.",
