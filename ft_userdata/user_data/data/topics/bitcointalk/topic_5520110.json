Any questions, theories, research or just anything related to improving the ethical development of Bitcoin is much appreciated in this newly opened topic. I believe that the future of Bitcoin existince is based on its intrinsic values. Many of these values are being jeopardised by greed, power and controle. If the OG Bitcoin community and Bitcoin core developers fail to execute.. it could mean the end of what Bitcoin was intended to become by Satoshi and members of the cypherpunk manifesto. I also like to note that in this topic you are freely to speak about religious doctrines, philosophical doctrines, spiritual doctrines, atheistic doctrines etc. Your opinion is valued regardless of your religious or non religious views, ethnicity or color of skin, gender or gender preference and social class. Hope all is well and let’s start this journey together.",

And I think there is a lot of room for improvement for Bitcoin from a usecase point of view.When the narrative of Bitcoin shifted in 2014 from the usecase of p2p cash into ‘digital gold’ the dynamic of what Bitcoin can possibly mean for the world shifted. Satoshi named Bitcoin a Peer-To-Peer Electronic System and not ‘digital gold’ with a careful reason. When mankind believes and treats Bitcoin as a vehicle of investment it creates the possibility for humans to promote inequality. A Peer-To-Peer Electronic System instead creates the opportunity for humans to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or economic opportunity. Power dynamics are less involved with the latter goal. The paradigm shift that took place this year in Bitcoin’s adoption from a global governmental and tradefi markets point of view showcases the importance of Satoshi’a message embedded in the genesis block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” A message referring to the headline of the London newspaper, The Times, on the noted date. The U.K. government was bailing out the banks for the second time during that period. Satoshi’s message should remind us all how important it is to govern Bitcoin in such a way that Bitcoin’s usecase is separated from any power dynamics within government and state. A significant change is happening as we speak. Thusfar my response for usecase and trajectory of Bitcoin. My second response is regarding the governance point of view:It is widely known that various contributors and maintainers of Bitcoin core have their personal world views from a religious, spiritual and ethical standpoint. If the OG and the new contributors and mainters of Bitcoin truly want Bitcoin to become adopted on a continuous global scale it is important that those involved with its governance are aligned to make it work for all of humankind. It takes hard work to get people aligned for such a manifestation. A team of humanbeings working together for the all of the humanrace is a team healed of all the indoctrinations of hate. A team of peace.Let me know if you have any questions?",

While these aspects are important for the broader understanding of Bitcoin's potential, its true strength lies in its technical foundation and decentralized nature. By emphasizing the robust security, scalability, and innovation in blockchain technology, we can foster further adoption and integration of Bitcoin in the real-world economy. It's crucial to prioritize solutions that address challenges such as transaction speed, energy efficiency, and regulatory frameworks to ensure that Bitcoin remains sustainable and accessible to a wider audience. This balanced approach can help Bitcoin evolve and fulfill its potential as a global financial system.",

For the technical proposals that are currently on the table like scaling UTXO ownership and new self custody capabilities I actually don’t have much to comment.Yeah, I guess hard to comprehend for you that humans actually also use their religious or spiritual indoctrinations within development. And if it is not religious or spiritual there should be a set of norms and values to go into it for any developer. Yet avoiding unethical practices helps out a lot in the longterm.",

I don't know if I am reading it wrong because no one seems to notice that OP didn't say the development of bitcoin has been unethical but it could be if greed, power, and control continues to prevail through people. OP understands the values that are built into bitcoin and to me it seems like just wants to protect it. For me though it is less about the ethical concerns but more of how the greed, power, and control can affect the development of bitcoin. Bitcoin was made for the people. For a community to have something. If further developments no longer cater to the community due to greed and selfishness then bitcoin will crumble. But OP, I do not think it will happen or at least any time soon because as much as bitcoin is made for the community it is also built and operated by the people in said community. Bitcoin not having one single entity allows it the \"power\" to be distributed hence why a single authority will not turn selfish and turn bitcoin upside down. Bitcoin will be fine.",

Was just curious.We had a situation similar to yours — a small business that needed a solution to automate accounting and communication with software development services. We thought for a long time whether it was worth hiring a whole team to develop from scratch, or it was better to go the way of ready-made solutions. In the end, we decided to turn to https://digiscorp.com/, because we realized that if we limited ourselves to only standard tools, we would not be able to fully take into account all the features of our business. The advantages of this approach are, of course, an individual approach and flexibility. DigisCorp has a team of developers who fully immerse themselves in the problem, analyze how best to customize the system to your needs. In my opinion, this is not a very mature way out of the situation, a block instead of a dialogue",
