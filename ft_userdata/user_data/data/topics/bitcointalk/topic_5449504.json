The Bitcoin protocol uses a binary format to serialize transaction data, which is more efficient in terms of storage and processing. The hexadecimal string provided in previous responses is the serialized binary data in a human-readable format.",

I've been told by developers (am not one myself) that ChatGPT can also come up with novel coding solutions to problems, capable of putting things together in ways that traditional programmers wouldn't consider, as its free from innate human bias.I asked it to perform a similar task for the JSON format and it almost did it, looks just a little wonky, and then it put an incomplete BTC address as the second output.

      "body": "What's so special about this?!This is basically taking a JSON string which is literary the most common way that block explorers serialize transactions when their API call is used [1] and converts it to a XML representation which is a very straight forward and basic operation [2]. So for example instead of using \"\"version\":1,\" it is using \"<version>1</version>\".There was no need for \"AI\" here. There may even be some block explorer API out there that directly returns an XML serialization of the transactions without needing to do any kind of conversion![1] https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/raw/transaction/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16[2] https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+json+to+xmlQuote from: remotemass on April 19, 2023, 09:28:43 PMShow how a signed bitcoin transaction would look like if all its structured data was using XML to be structuredKeep in mind that XML and JSON and other similar formats are not the way you \"structure\" a data, they are all text-based formats for representing data (ie. human readable format).",
