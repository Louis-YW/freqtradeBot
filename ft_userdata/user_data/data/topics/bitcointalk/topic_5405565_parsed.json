If you really saved it, then it should appear in the History list as a \"Local\" transaction. However, if you just closed the Transaction window after signing, then your transaction is not saved anywhere and you have to create it again.Quote from: Redgate888 on July 08, 2022, 07:48:48 AMI tried your recommendation. The only thing in the history is the deposit coming into the wallet. The time stamp is notably different. Check the total balance on the wallet. Electrum should show the unconfirmed transaction amount in square brackets.",

That was too easy, but I have a Mac so the right-click isn't as intuitive as it was on windows.If right-click is troublesome or there're too many of them, you can use the Console (View->Show Console), open the console and type: clear_invoices()All the invoices in the send tab will be gone the next time you open Electrum or after a refresh (F5).Quote from: Redgate888 on July 08, 2022, 06:50:41 AMI want to delete the transaction because I have lost confidence in my having the correct address in the pay to line.There are \"details\" and \"copy address\" options in the right-click menu where you can review the recipient's address.You can use that the next time you need to review the address that you've pasted/typed in the pay to line.",
