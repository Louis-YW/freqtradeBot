  "content": "Last week I faced a very weird problem with my hot wallet and the problem was my own created anyway in this topic I will explain the problem which I faced and then I will suggest some solution which is possible in similar cases that might help the newbies. For my problem understanding you can visit my topic Need Help & My advice after this incident! Metamask extension.So while searching for the solution I learned many new things which might help you to recover your key or seed, YYoursituation might be different so I will explain different situations and solutionsActually what happened was quite weird, So My browser got auto-updated and my all data was lost including my Metamask Extension. After that, I realized that I haven't backed up my key. So First I tried to find the restore session of the browser profile but unfortunately, after finding it I realized that it didn't work. I will explain solutions and cases. case 1: You have your Extension but You Forgot the extension password. So, in this case, you lost your password and you have no backup to recover your wallet, in this problem you can recover your seed there is still a possibility to recover your seed and key. Note: This won't work on android.Solution: In this situation, if you have any hind about your password you can use tool this might work for you to unlock your vault.Case 2: You don't Have extension Data and Didnt back Up your keyThe Situation is agitated there is 50 50 of recovering your wallet if you want to recover an account added below another account such as You can recover your account at least there is hope. But it must satisfy these conditions.Account Should not be importedIt should be created under Main account SeedYou Must have the Main account seedIf Luck is with you then dear with the seed of the Main account you can recover your wallet as it's created under the same seed. If you don't have a main account seed too then bro nobody can help you in this case.Case 3: Your Window Crashed and You Have a backup of your browser extension data In this particular case the condition which should satisfy is You Must be using Chrome BrowserYou can recover your wallet exactly by replacing the new browser profile for that you need to follow Support Turtorial in this method we will use Vault extraction and decryption instructions from the support. You can follow some Youtube videos for manual extraction if you are facing any issues.I know Mistakes happen sometimes but remember you really can't recover your wallet in any other way there are just a few things you can do if you are lucky enough then you can get back your Wallet. Back-Up your wallet always because things never go in your favor always, if your case is different you can ask the support team of the wallet you are using but the chances are low in other cases. I will recommend to if you cannot recover your wallet then be calm and take it as a lesson for the future it can be your motivation to rise again.In my situation, by luck case 2 worked and after that, I immediately backed up my all wallets and rechecked again if any were left. If you know any other methods then please share as this thread is particularly created for helping the victims.",

      "body": "When you learn from your mistakes, they cease to be mistakes. I really appreciate the work you did; I never thought of restoring wallets because I've never been in these situations, even though I save every key phrase on time, even if I only have $1 in my wallet account. Maybe that's stupid, but I'm just making it a habit so that if I forget to save one key in the future, my instincts can take over.Quote from: Hamza2424 on March 21, 2023, 06:00:32 PMAccount Should not be importedIt should be created under Main account SeedYou Must have the Main account seedIts like Child and Parent relation of processors, nodes etc. i think to some extent that is beneficial for those who faced the same situation like you faced. But this feature has its downfall too, like if i make a child account under the parent wallet account, and my main parent account got hacked which in result give control of my all child accounts to hacker. Is it possible? i think it seems possible. i have done a little research after observing your discoveries (well these are discoveries for me) This mechanism of Metamask is known as hierarchical deterministic, in which we can use Master Key to unlock every wallet under that wallet acting as child. i was not familiar with the existence of HD wallets before no doubt was aware with metamask but not with its HD nature. Thanks to you.",

      "body": "I do update my browser (Chrome) when it runs out of date; I usually update it immediately, and the update will reflect on all my duplicate Chrome accounts. But I have never experienced a data loss before.This year alone, I have updated it more than twice, but my Metamask extension and others are functioning effectively without requiring me to do anything. If not for this post, I'm not aware that one can lose his data if it's not backed up just by updating their browser. I will have to revisit my notebook and check all my metadata to be sure they are all back up to avoid any future losses. Thanks for this update, though.",
