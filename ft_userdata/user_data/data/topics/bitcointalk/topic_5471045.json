Hopefully that's something we can all agree on!When do you think price will break-out of this range (see poll above)? What direction do you think price will break-out in (up or down)?Personally I have my own opinions expressed elsewhere that we'll remain within the range until the end of the year, or at least another two months similar to the 9-month range of $15K to $25K.Bears were confident that $25K would break as support twice over and were wrong. Bulls were confident that $32K would break as resistance and were wrong. Likely the bulls will be wrong again.Also think it'll be to the upside after breaking the long-term structure of moving from support to resistance, such as holding support around $28K after a re-test of resistance, sometime in Q1 2024.Also well aware we could break-out any day now and this topic & poll will be irrelevant, in which case will lock the topic & poll, but otherwise still think we have some time left within the range.",

There are so many variables that can affect, such as the start of another war or rate policies that you never know. There is a saying in the stock market that I am going to reproduce from hearsay, something like, \"I don't know if the next 100 points will be up or down but I know the next 1,000 points will be up.\"This is more or less my outlook as well right now. It's likely we re-test resistance level now we're not far away, but also more than possible price re-tests $25K before the end of the year as well in order to remain range-bound. Eventually it'll break out of the range and I believe this will be to the upside, but breaking out of the range at present seems like it'd be news-orientated, such as rate policies as you suggested, or otherwise ETF related. I say this as I don't see the momentum in either direction at present with bears failing to break $25K and bulls unable to keep prices above $30K. That much remains clear. With that said I get the impression that the range is also somewhat fragile if significant news could cause a break of it, because clearly at present buyers & sellers are unable to move price outside of it. This is why I think (as well as hope) it'll take a few more months, in order for their to be more fundamental reason to break-out like the upcoming halving, rather than a news-style break-out that could easily result in a fake-out and therefore return to the range, as well as break it in the opposite direction thereafter. I'm certainly not complaining about the stability at the moment, especially if it indeed turns out to be an accumulation zone.",

History might just be getting set to repeat itself. Well, it is too early to conclude, but the market has shown great reluctance to go lower. Indeed, coming weeks will really show the face of where we are going and I am optimistic we are on the right track. The moment the $32k resistance is shattered, the coast is clear for a decent sail towards the north.",

The Palestinians are going to fight the occupiers possibly for a total of 55 days so that would mean till December 1. This is why I voted for Jan next year.During that time we can see a wild energy market with possibly big swings (oil is already on the rise) that will affect the inflation and in turn affects the bitcoin market positively, which means it would help price go up.As it is right now.This would also affect the gold market which could restart other markets as investors start to come back and invest in gold and by extension in bitcoin. Which is again positive. In other words it eliminates investors \"shyness\" and \"uncertainty\"!However, with inflation rising we could see another wave of idiotic interest rate rises that would not only worsen the recession but also it sweeps all the money from other markets like a vacuum. This is the only negative scenario I predict that can affect bitcoin price negatively.BTW I consider other things like ETF to be smaller news that could only act as catalysts not to mention that I don't think it is going to be approved in US anytime soon...",

For all those who aren't ready to hear the truth, here is one, this whole ETF approval drama won't be in favour for crypto in the longest run, we haven't seen real manipilation yet, this ETF thing will give power back to centralized organization, what is coming will change everything for crypto.",

The only relevant aspect that came out of all this bullish intent was establishing a long-term range between $25K and $32K however. Your reasoning sounds like hopium though rather than fundamentals. Eventually speculators will stop falling for the rumours of an ETF getting approved anytime soon, and simply wait for it to be confirmed, knowing it could be months away still.",
