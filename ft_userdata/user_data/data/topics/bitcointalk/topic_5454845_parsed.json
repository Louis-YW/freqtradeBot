I'm planning my YouTube channel at the moment, and it seems to me that a dedicated Bitcoin channel is not a good idea. I very rarely watch them any more, as they seem to be contradictory, and often over complex, and many of them seem to show a lack of understanding of the purpose and technology behind Bitcoin. There seem to be 3 main categories of Bitcoiners ( apart from undecided newbies of course), and these are speculators, businesses and weath protectors. I don't want to target the speculators, as those are either gamblers or highly technical statisticians. My advice to business users is to embrace Bitcoin as an efficient means of international payment, but they may be advised to sell their Bitcoin receipts to avoid losses as a result of its volatility. My target audience is van dwellers, and others living offgrid, and who are considering Bitcoin as a form of saving and wealth protection.So, should I accept that Bitcoin has now become an established medium of exchange and savings, and just include videos about it in a general offgrid camper channel?  The alternative would be to create a dedicated Bitcoin channel, and thus have to compete with all the established Bitcoin channels. I've also got a problem with the new GA4 Google analytics. Should I include my Bitcoin websites in my Offgrid Camper property, or, again, would it be better to have a financial property for Bitcoin? My preference is to keep things simple, and include bitcoin in the broader social channel in both instances.",

Just talking about the fundamentals of Bitcoin won't help your channel gain traction as you've already guessed. You will either have to come up with sensationalistic clickbait titles and stories, out of which you have to invent 99% of them, or simply deal with the fact that you can't get hundreds of sounds of subscribers and cater to a smaller community.

Making a separate channel isn't a mistake though, it's just that you have to work double your normal workload to pump out videos for your van dweller videos which I think is nice given that nomadic lifestyle is gaining traction right now and then you have another channel that's totally different, so it's on you. If you don't mind the workload then create a separate channel but if not then stick to your first choice. Good luck with your channel.",

You have to choose a category for a property, and I forgot to check if you can have more than one cartegory. Van dwelling may not be a financial category in Google's eyes, even though it is in the eyes of most van dwellers. You can have more than one property in a Google account. I can't be more informative, as I'm struggling a bit with the concept of GA4. It seems to be more oriented towards the selling of ad space, and that is not relevant for me. Well not at the moment anyway.",

The reason of most YouTube channels not getting much subscribers is as a major of the level of entertainment in the video presentation, too much of the same stuffs kinda bore people so making diversification to your channel interms of presentation would probably help alot when it comes to gathering the viewer target.",

The way I see it you are narrowing down the potential target audience a bit too much and that could affect the type of contents you push out or optimization strategies you use.  For the type of channel you are considering you should not expect massive traction or views as @stompix pointed out you can just focus on doing what you like and improving the quality of your contents, eventually you would get some audience, particularly those who are tired of the repetitive nonsense available online now purely designed to be as sensational as possible.You will never know how it would turn out until you try.- Jay -",

I think you will find a niche in which the community itself will become a strong marketing tool for your brand. And by the way, you seem to have done your research on this topic quite extensively, so I am sure that your audience would rather watch your channel than the channel of just another so-called speculator, who has no love for such details. After Youtube, you can find a larger audience by other means, such as those you have mentioned.",
