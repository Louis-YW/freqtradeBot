At the center of the earth is no gravity. Why? Because mass is wherein gravity actually lies. Objects at the center of the earth, have the mass of the whole earth pulling at them evenly from every direction. This cause them to have no weight at all. Think about it. You would be weightless in a room at the center of the earth, floating in the air.Try this idea. There isn't any gravity at all. There is only inertia. In addition, everything is accelerating away from everything else with a reasonably slow acceleration. The whole earth is becoming farther and farther apart. Every subatomic particle in your whole body is becoming farther and farther apart. All the stars and galaxies are moving away from each other... expanding universe.Things only feel like gravitation, because the inertia in them makes gravitational feeling, as everything accelerates away from everything else.You could make a whole working science out of this idea if you wanted to. And, it would probably make more sense than an E=MC2 universe.The only reason why this isn't a science already is, the people who run the universities through their massive donations, would rather have an E=MC2 universe rather than an expanding universe.",

Only a tiny fraction has been observed by humans so far.The universe is continuously expanding ever since the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. It is getting bigger, colder and darker over time.There are trillions of \"rogue\" planets not attached to any stars roaming interstellar space throughout the universe.Supernovae explosions happen when giant stars die; these can briefly outshine entire galaxies and produce massive bursts of energy and matter.The Mysteries:Dark matter makes up about 27% of the universe - but we don't know what it is. We can't directly observe it, only detect its gravitational effects.Dark energy is theorized to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe over time. The nature and cause of dark energy remains unexplained.Life outside of Earth - we have not conclusively detected intelligent or even microbial life outside planet Earth, but many believe the size of the universe makes other life inevitable.Black holes continue perplex - their interiors seemingly disconnect from the normal rules of space and time. We have much still to understand.",

      "body": "what you have to learn is if you put a ball on a piece of string and then you spin around in circles..you then although you have the string gravitationally linking you to the ball. cause the ball to orbit you this centrifugal force on the ball tries to push the ball away from you, you feel the string tucking on your hand trying to get more distance which it gains if you loosened your hand a bitif u had a drone recording this from above you would see the ball actually do a spiral. if you imagine the orbit of earth around the sun as not a complete circle but instead a spiral. where each orbit, earth is slightly further away, allowing less gravitational power from sun, thus allowing earth to get further away on the next orbitnotice how the early loops (center) are small millimeter distances apart per cyclethen as the orbits continue the distance greatens each timethe sun does the same with its relationship with the milky wayand thats why we are increasing distance(increased radius) from the governing force(milky way->sun) (sun_earth)enjoy that thoughtthere is a reason why they say the earth is 4.5 billion years oldbecause at a 1.5cm radius increase per year which is 0.00000000001% of todays earth-sun distance, it took the earthbillion of years to have, once cooled into a crusted rock billions of years to reach the distance earth has reachedbut we are gaining more distance slowly (unnoticeable with the human eye even at the measure over a century)but in the big cosmic measure of billions of years. they do say we are \"speeding up\" and moving further away at an accelerating speedoverÂ  4.5billion years the sun has lost 0.03% of its mass via conversion to energy. which has meant it has less gravitational control compared to billions of years(it has loosened the string attached to the ball)as for dark \"matter\" pfft..in space there is no \"matter\" in the OPEN SPACE.. energy(plasma waves) is not formed into atoms yet* to become matter, it remains in its plasma statethink of all plasma as frequency waves of different frequencies..we only have machines to view/observe/record only a certain range of frequencies magnetic spectrum of (sound-xray)dark \"matter\" is just the plasma outside of out instruments ability.and frequencies can do things to other things. like resist, refract, reflect... interfere ... coalesce, attract and so on*the right type of frequencies need to interact with each other to cause different reactions. some of them can cause atoms to form and some do the opposite",

They expand along with the bubble and will eventually get ripped apart with great explosion and great burning. there is no bubbleinstead imagine the sun is on a string tethered to the centre of the milky way. however the exertion of energy from the centre reduces the mass of the centre, thus weakening the hold of the string, thus loosening the string to allow the sun to move further distance per rotation in a spiral orbit effectas does the earths string tethered to the sun. the suns exertion of energy uses mass meaning less sun mass loosens the string tethering the earth in a spiral orbit effectso you see the earth is a bigger distance away from the milky way centre due to its spiral orbit of the sun, due to the sun spiral orbit of the milky way centre",

Since the impacts of space expansion are felt on a far greater scale than at the atomic level, they are not directly witnessed. It is also very true that the behavior of matter within stars and galaxies is still dominated by gravity; hence, the space expansion is not stretching the particles that comprise those formations.Â Still, it's an intriguing thought to wonder what would happen if space were stretched to the point that atoms were literally being torn apart by it! Physicists have obviously thought about that possibility, but it's unclear if it will truly come to pass. Considering the fact that we really do not have a complete knowledge of the rules of physics, it is difficult to make any kind of predictions about the long-term future of the universe.",

What you said may be true and the current scientific understanding of gravity and the expanding universe is supported by extensive evidence and studies. While it's valuable to explore different ideas, we should consider that the prevailing scientific models have undergone testing and validation frim scientists. But nothingâ€™s constant in this world except change right? Thats why science examines and refines theories based on new evidence. It's necessary to differentiate between speculative ideas and scientific principles to ensure a reliable understanding and not fake news.",
