If you got some lithium batteries, everything could run on 5VI wonder if it would be better to take any money you would have spent on batteries, and just buy more miners and solar panels — and just mine during the day.Either way that sounds like a great project!

I was thinking the same as the expense should be very high. And you won't get the maximum output as good as actual electricity. Maybe someday we can do it with solar-powered energy. I have seen some news about next gen battery which could hold up much more powers and are metal instead of liquid inside to transfer the current flow.Maybe that could change the game somehow.Here's the news article if anyone is interested.

Difficult choice but definitely better.Even in norway where there are 6 months of sun you would only have 50% efficiency if the sun shines every day, but this is not the case, fog and rain clouds drastically reduce production.",

Above so I will correct what his 600 watt panel could do.@mikewith Not exactly what you or I said , but here goes a longer explanation. Most of the world averages 5-6 hours full sun.  WTF am I talking about?Sunrise 6am your charge rate sucks.  9am or 10 am your charge rate gets better.12 noon it peaks.2 or 3 pm it dropsyou sunset at 6pm so right before that it sucks.So even though it was 12 hours of sun most of the world average 5-6 hours of 12 noon full sun.That is how I got my 5 or 6 factor.so 600 watt panel x 5 = 3000 watts of chargeor 600 watt panel x 6 = 3600 watts of chargethis counts charging losses.Now for doing ac to dc  some invertors  are really good they do 95% even 96% but they cost $$$shitty invertors do 85%so a 600 watt panel at best is 3600 x .95 = 3420 wattsat worst it is 3000 x .85 = 2550 wattsnow do 2550/24 = 106 watts constant draw3420/24 = 142 watts constant draw.and as you said this will be very hard on his battery since drawing down to 0 fucks a battery up.So he could run 19 hours a day to save his batteryand do between 106 and 142 watts.at best he can do a few usb sticks and a rasp pi   with his setup",

He would get scrap dead golf cart batteries and refurbish them.Basically this battery was one he could get at a 90% discount https://www.batteryequivalents.com/group-gc12-batteries.htmlhttps://www.batteriesplus.com/product-details/golf-~-scrubber/battery/magna-power/sligc12vtthey run 330usd new. the dead ones can be refurbished but they may have 1 cell missing so they are 10 volt not 12 volt.he would string 5 of them to get to 50 volts and 150ah about 50 x 150 = 7500 watts.  and run them done to 3500 watts then recharge.even at 80-90 percent off they are about 50-60 bucks apiece say 300 usd and refurbing them is about 50 more. so 350 .They don't last long since they are old and died once.Battery solar is a hard road to do.We are Grid tied here in NJ much cheaper to do.",

It would be cheaper to get 2*150A batteries instead of 3*100A batteries, it would also be easier to set up and requires less cabling since he is going to need to wire them in parallel, although I think it would be wise to run them in series and get a 24V inverter instead of the 12V, a 24V system has a few advantages over 12V system, with the exception that you can't expand your batteries with 1 battery at the time, you will always need to do them in twos.",

Maybe 4? times to cover the losses.i.e. a single 3.3kW miner would require more than just 10kW solar generation.The other, requires putting enough of it back into the grid to cover the 16+ hours of mining without solar, but again is only possible if your solar generation is multiple times what you use.That will depend on your electricity supplier, if they meter it out fairly - i.e. what you send to the grid = what you can use - or how much more you have to send vs what you use in those 16+ hours without solar.There's other options to source power like wind and hydro, but you need to see how much you can generate to cover that 16+ hours a day needed.And of course if you have that extra source, it may well be better to use that 24/7 anyway.Of course if you simply reduce your power bill by using solar + grid, that's another option that may fit in with what you can afford.",
