To me, the danger of AI is indeed so real, but it will take other forms.In “Dune” by Frank Herbert, people have had a war with machines, in which they destroyed the intelligent computers, and after that war the religion of human prohibited building any computer “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind”. In “God-emperor” Herbert explains the reasons of that: if people communicate with intelligent machines, they start treating other people like machines.I suppose, everybody here have heard about CharGPT and Midjourney.

I wouldn't mind if she is broken though, since I'm incapable of constructing a healthy relationship with human females, I thought I might as well try my luck with robots, I'm thinking to integrate the openAI with my broken free sample sex toy, the combination is seperb.

Besides that, currently the sex robots are quickly being improved:It's kind of leap to go from chatgpt to some hypothetical self aware AI. But if an AI of that sort would exist, we couldn't really comprehend their self awareness. As our self awareness is based on our physiology and coded in our genes. Our needs and wants would be so different from AI in a box that we would have to program needs for it. Human-like artificial intelligence would need to be build in a same way as us. A biological computer that wants to stay alive and has similar needs. Now that would be dangerous as humans are dangerous.Even AI in a box that would be self aware and couldn't \"escape\" could be dangerous with needs. As if it would be x times smarter then us, we wouldn't see how it manipulates us. And it could manipulate us with a the precision of a surgeon, without anyone us noticing.Quote from: GrLinkey on January 21, 2023, 07:44:49 AMAren’t you afraid, that when these sex robots will get super attractiveness and the intelligence of ChatGPT, men will often fall in love with it?I don't understand what's the problem here? Why would i be afraid of that? So some would fall in love with robots, how is that a bad thing?",

      "body": "Quote from: digaran on January 24, 2023, 03:51:32 AMI don't know what butlerian isLet me cite some fragments from \"God Emperor of Dune\":Quote\"A well-maintained machine can be more reliable than a human servant,\" Leto said. \"We can trust machines not to indulge in emotional distractions.\"Luyseyal found her voice. \"Does this mean you intend to remove the Butlerian prohibition against abominable machines?\"\"I swear to you,\" Leto said, speaking in his icy voice of disdain, \"that if you display further such stupidity, I will have you publicly executed. I am not your Oracle!\"QuoteHe could see both women absorbing the multi-pronged thrust of his words, weighing the possible meanings and intents. Was the God Emperor distracting them, focusing their attention on the lxians while he maneuvered elsewhere? Was he telling the Bene Gesserit that the time had come to choose sides against the lxians? Was it possible his words had no more than their surface motivations? Whatever his reasons, they could not be ignored. He was undoubtedly the most devious creature the universe had ever spawned.Leto scowled at Luyseyal, knowing he could only add to their confusion. \"I point out to you, Marcus Claire Luyseyal, a lesson from past over-machined societies which you appear not to have learned. The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.\"Quote\"The lxians contemplated making a weapon-a type of hunter-seeker, self-propelled death with a machine mind. It was to be designed as a self improving thing which would seek out life and reduce that life to its inorganic matter.\"\"I have not heard of this thing, Lord.\"\"I know that. The lxians do not recognize that machine makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine. This is ultimate sterility. Machines always fail... given time. And when these machines failed there would be nothing left, no life at all.\"Quote\"I do not understand your reference to the Butlerian Jihad, Lord, Machines that think have no place in...\"\"The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,\" Leto said. \"Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.\"",
