This is what politicians do and specialize in. they have no idea about anything other than social engineering and manipulation mechanisms. They specialize in how to speak to influence as many voters as possible. Unfortunately, this is what democracy inevitably strives for - populism. And this is exactly how we should look at all election promises. For carefully calculated statements intended to target a precisely calculated group of voters who are not yet decided.",

It won't be achieved after a night, day or week and we must be realistic that to gain it, people as citizens must create enough pressure on governments.To do this, we must have more education about Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining to enlighten people about benefit of Bitcoin against fiat currency inflation and Bitcoin mining is not dirty, not environmental harmful like governments try to say.https://bitcoincleanup.com/https://endthefud.org/energyReports from Bitcoin Mining Council can help them to have more knowledge and information about Bitcoin mining network too.H1 2023 report from BMC.",

But I understand why this politician aka Sergio Massa state this, he want get Bitcoin enthusiasts heart to choose him in the next residential election lol.Quote from: https://cryptoslate.com/more-than-50-of-bitcoin-mining-uses-renewable-energy/Almost a quarter of all Bitcoin miners use water to power their setups. Hydropower makes up 23.12% of all energy used in mining.Additionally, the wind is used to generate power for 13.98% of Bitcoin mining, while nuclear and solar account for 7.94% and 4.98% of all power used in mining, respectively. Other renewable energy sources are used in about 2.40% of Bitcoin mining.All in all, roughly 52.4% of all Bitcoin mining relies on renewable energy for its power needs and the trend is expected to continue growing in the coming years as traditional energy sources become more and more expensive.",

Bitcoin mining using surplus natural gas from oil production fields may lead to an economic benefit as it reduces waste, provides job opportunities, increases taxes, with the possibility that the state will use the Bitcoin that was generated as a reserve in the central bank or in an investment fund, but it is nothing more than part of the ideas to improve GDP is not something the presidential candidate will defend if he wins the election.",

Everything can change because politicians' mouths are very sweet when they utter a series of words[1].No one has dared to act like Nayib Bukele in El Salvador towards Bitcoin even though there are groups who are against his decision.I would be happy if Bitcoin was campaigned in various spaces so that people who don't want to care about the convenience of Bitcoin in the payment system can judge for themselves the fiat currency payment system.[1]. https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-presidential-candidate-vivek-ramaswamy-to-accept-bitcoin-for-campaign-donations",

They were done with the intention to show bitcoin in a negative light. They were lopsided and filled with bias and attacks. The power consumption rate of bitcoin mining activities is overestimated to suit their lies but it is good to know that miners are seeking for green alternatives.",

I am also glad that OP included that people should be allowed to choose between fiat and cryptocurrencies. yes this topic is about using the waste gas thats usually flared. but right now they are still trialling it.. where only a few flare pipes have been adapted to go to a generator which then powers only a small container of asics.. until they expand the experiment to convert thousands(of the many many thousands) of flare pipes, its not really a time to celebrate. its still a PIPE  dream, but a possible step in the right direction.the reason its still a dream/experiment. is because they need to put a gas-electric generator onto the flare pipe to power the asics.. but if these flare pipes were able to efficiently make electric in the first place, they would have done the generators and then cabled the electric to nearby villages/townsso right now they are trailing a few flare pipes to mine small scale to then look at the cost/reward bases after Xmonths/yearmeaning it may not actually end up cost efficient to even do on mass scale.. so too soon to congratulate/celebrate",

This is something new because, no doubt, many presidential candidates have shown their interest in BTC, but AFAIK none of them have shown interest in coming up with better ways to do mining of BTC blockchain. By better ways, I mean with some idea that is also not very unique in its nature, but it is what it is, and at least it is something that we have not seen or heard from others.This will really streamline the adoption of BTC, but to be honest, these presidential candidates just lost their ticket to become president by going in favor of BTC because the financial market doesn't want it to be adopted at such a level because they are not making much money from the banks. But thinking from another angle, they might want to give a chance to such a a president to streamline its adoption, but in a centralized manner.In the end, this is good for BTC and for its price,, and yeah, the people in Argentina will be encouraged to use BTC by the act of Sergio Massa.",
