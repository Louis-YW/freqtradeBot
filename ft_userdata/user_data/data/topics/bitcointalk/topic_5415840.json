  "content": "QuoteThe top U.S. financial regulator has charged celebrity Kim Kardashian for touting a cryptocurrency on her Instagram account without disclosing that she was paid for the promotion.The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday Kardashian has agreed to pay a fine of $1 million, although she did not admit or deny the S.E.C.'s findings. She will also give back $260,000, which includes her payment from the company with interest.\"Ms. Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities,\" said SEC chair Gary Gensler.Kardashian, who has around 330 million Instagram followers, was paid $250,000 to promote cryptocurrency offered by EthereumMax called EMAX tokens.According to regulators, her post also \"provided instructions for potential investors to purchase EMAX tokens.\" And that violates an \"anti-touting provision\" in the federal securities laws.As the popularity of crypto has ballooned, companies have spent millions of dollars on marketing. Many of them have hired celebrities spokespersons, including comedian Larry David and actor Matt Damon, to promote their products. But after the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies plummeted, many of them have been criticized for boosting them.As more and more celebrities promote products online, regulators have started to take a closer look to make sure that they're following rules.The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, has cracked down on celebrities and social media influencers who don't adequately disclose their connections or that they are paid by the products they promote.Two years ago, the FTC fired off warning letters to several Internet influencers and celebrities, like the recording artists Cardi B and Jordin Sparks, reminding them of their legal obligation to disclose their connections to the products they promote.While Kardashian didn't admit or deny the SEC's findings, in an agreement with the regulator, she agreed to not promote any crypto asset securities for three years.https://www.npr.org/2022/10/03/1126526883/sec-charges-kim-kardashian-for-unlawfully-touting-crypto-on-her-instagram-accoun....I hadn't realized Kim Kardashian has 330 million folllowers on instagram. There could be a twist to this case. If I remember correctly ethereum, upon which ethereum max was built, as an ERC-20 token. Wasn't classified a security until after it adopted proof of stake recently. Kim Kardashian promoted ETH max before the transition to proof of stake. Technically a claim could be made that Kim Kardashian did not promote a security, as eth's platform ran upon proof of work when Kim Kardashian promoted eth max.The concept of disclosing cash and incentives to promote products, platforms or narratives is an interesting one. It is clear many youtubers and internet influencers publish sponsored content on behalf of advertisers. I have seen youtubers promote questionable programs claiming a person can legally become a Lord or Lady by purchasing 1 square foot of land in scotland. As well as other questionable content. Could society benefit from internet content creators being more forthcoming about what they're paid to promote?Deregulation is my preference for business, finance and internet marketing. But surely there must be some way to promote good faith reporting of sponsors, without introducing tons of bureaucratic red tape to everything.",

Precedents observed over the years, would appear to indicate securities are the main asset class that is affected.",

I heard that every time I mention a product on my blog, I have to say whether I got it for free or paid for it myself. Is that true?No. If you mention a product you paid for yourself, there isn’t an issue. Nor is it an issue if you get the product for free because a store is giving out free samples to its customers.The FTC is only concerned about endorsements that are made on behalf of a sponsoring advertiser. For example, an endorsement would be covered by the FTC Act if an advertiser – or someone working for an advertiser – pays you or gives you something of value to mention a product.",

About the last statement though regarding that she agreed not to promote any crypto asset for 3 years, does NFTs count? And what if she just recording a video visiting the NFT booths? Would that still be considered as promotion? Or maybe “indirect” promotion that still counts in her “sentence” of not promoting for 3 years?I imagine that it would be hard living as an influencer in the US due to cracking down on this kind of stuff for those with a huge following. But yeah she should have disclosed it though to avoid paying the fine.",

This is my personal preference as well though the ad disclosure space seems like the wild west. Is it actually required that someone displaying an advertisement explicitly say they are financially compensated for said ad? I don't really think so. If someone suspects a conflict of interest, I figure it would be the consumer to immediately assume there is one unless explicitly stated otherwise.",

I think her team perhaps also did a good job of covering it up. While it's only a few days old, if you look at news in Google when typing Kim Kardashian, it gives you sets of news about sections. The first is Kardashian and Kanye West, then about her and Pete Davidson, then about her not knowing what a tortellini is, and only then comes the 'fined by SEC' section.",

We can say its just too early for talks about election but they're shutting him already before BLM makes him win. Kim is under circumstances where she has to do something for politics or else the crypto issue will get worse but this is probably just a conspiracy theory.If the shitcoin just didn't turned out to be scam but just something like SHIB, she could get away.",

Yeah, I've been seeing quite a few Youtubers shilling that scheme.  It's pretty obvious that those Youtubers are being paid, and if it wasn't already then most if not all of them tell you that they're being sponsored by this or that.I didn't see what KK's Instagram shilling looked like (and I've never used that site), but I would think it might be much less obvious when someone is being paid to promote something.  I could be wrong, but on Youtube it seems very transparent.Look at all these fines the government is handing out, eh?  I'm not saying they're wrong in doing so, but it seems like they're cracking down on people and/or institutions that they probably wouldn't have a year or two ago.  I see that as a sign the country realizes it's going broke and needs to do a little fundraising (lol).",

I agree on this, why her legal team didn't disclose any when in fact they should fully aware about the law especially with SEC since cryptocurrency are quiet the trend recently and SEC actively monitoring it. That may be a small amount of money for her but still, the case has serve and she should be more careful next time. She's very influential, having that huge of followers can really affect one's live, so she better be careful on sharing any projects next time.",
