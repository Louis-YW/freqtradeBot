Read this: Re: bitcoinpaperwallet.com - scam still alive?Advice:It is better to use HD wallet like Electrum to generate seed phrase and wallet on an airgapped device and use it as a paper wallet instead. You can extend your seed phrase with passphrase which is an alternative to BIP38 encryption on paper wallet, although it is not encryption but called word extension, which can generate different keys and addresses from the same seed phrase and makes your wallet safe like encrypting it.",

So there is no way to recover your BTC from the thief.Another thing is why you store your private key to KeePass they always have vulnerability issues like the news recently hackers can retrieve your master password in clear text.Always keep your private key on offline devices generating private key on Electrum or Bitcoin core are safer than using other sites that generate keys.",

There's no way virtually at this point, the site you just visited and entrusted your bitcoins with is a known scam and people have fallen for it in the past, much to no avail. You might wanna sit this one out and find other ways to earn that 2.03 bitcoins back because well, since there's been a few months of inactivity on your part no doubt the coins have already changed hands multiple times, may even be untraceable now at this point. Moving forward, do not entrust your money or your coins on anything that can be connected over the internet, even if it promises security, only transact specific amounts you would need and don't pull your whole investment out, and ultimately, invest on a hard wallet that is not connected to the internet to make sure that your coins are safe. Let this be a lesson, and I know it's a really expensive one, but I gotta set your expectations here in regards to earning your BTC2.03 back from these scammers, which is nigh-impossible since they jump-shipped a while ago if I'm not mistaken.",

Sorry for your loss mate.You would have little success with a suit against the new owner (scammer) and as you pointed out it would cost you more in finances and stress. You could instead start building your Bitcoin stash and using better security protocol, like only using a reputable, non custodian, open source wallet (hardware or software).",

I'm not saying that the chances of you succeeding are high, but if that scammer has scammed a lot of people and if a large number of those people do the same as you, it is possible that someone will be interested in trying to solve the case. On the other hand, if you don't do anything, you've admitted defeat and all that will only be an expensive lesson for the future. Whoever is behind it surely hopes that you will do the latter.",

I'm not rich but I am aware that if there's just a small chance to recover my funds, it won't be worthy of my time and effort. I'll be just looking for other way to earn money to somehow compensate with my loss.

It is your fault that you deposited bitcoins there without verifying the site. This site is a scam site and this topic has been discussed before in this forum. this happened to you because you were not careful with your bitcoins. But later always use some trusted wallet to store bitcoin like electrum can be in trusted list.  And if you have a large amount of crypto you can use hardware wallet. This will keep your funds safe.",

You shouldn't use an online service for the safety of your bitcoin and password to your wallet,because the platform will end up scaming you. When last did you checked your bitcoin before you checked again two days ago to find out that your bitcoin is no longer there. As you said that reporting to the police will cost you more,I suggest that it is better you forget about your lost bitcoin because,you will never get it back after much stress that you will pass through to see that you sue the new owner of the company. They have scammed not only you but more people like you,maybe that was why the former CEO had to sell out the company because so many people might get him arrest.",

I went through the thread created by a member and posted by Charles-Tim and it became clear that you are a victim of a scam site. I have never come across the website but it is clear that the owner of the site is scamming people. And the site is still operational and more people will still be scammed. Sorry for your loss but it has become a lesson for others to avoid generating keys from online platforms. There are claims that the former owner of the website Canton Becker is still behind the name Sarkis Sarkissian. So it is an intentional move to defraud people of their money. Reporting this scam to the police will be a good move because it will be on record that you lost money using their services. Maybe in the future, the scammers behind this website might be unraveled and arrested.",

But I'm not sure if the OP wants to use this approach which might be inconvenient because the police are bound to ask a lot of questions before the case is handled. Apart from that, I also believe that the handling of cases like this will not be free, but it all depends on who is handling the case and how clean the hands of the police in your country are.Stolen bitcoin cannot be recovered, unless the thief himself wants to return your bitcoin. This will definitely be a very expensive lesson and experience for anyone, but I don't think you should stop here. Do something better, and I hope you'll get your money back some other way.",
