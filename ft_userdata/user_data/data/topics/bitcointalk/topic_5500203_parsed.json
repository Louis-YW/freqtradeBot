      "body": "Lots of words there but not much detail.  If T-Mobile have their own Lightning nodes then adding a network integrated Lightning wallet would be a good way to introduce people to Bitcoin.  Especially if they could create a good, easy to use UI.The OP mentions Polygon which I don't know anything about but I don't think it has anything to do with Bitcoin.As far as this mining joint venture goes, it could be good for T-Mobile if they want to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet but do it by mining rather than purchasing.  Perhaps they already have some technical infrastructure that could be adapted to mining Bitcoin.  I don't see how that involves their phone networks or customers though.  Big firms going in on Bitcoin should be seen as a good thing as long as they aren't just dropping press releases with crypto buzzwords to get some media attention.",

      "body": "@NotFuzzyWarm is right, any links that would support your topic would be a really nice touch, people are already doubting what you're claiming so I'm not sure whether it's a good thing that you ignore that plea for a link. I do think so that you need to provide a link that would help with your claim because who knows if it's really true and you're just spreading fake news which is a likely thing to happen when you're doing this kind of thing. It wouldn't just be any news article too as you're going to be needing to provide a website that people will trust like Coindesk or Cointelegraph, if it's not there then highly likely that you're sharing a fake news.",
