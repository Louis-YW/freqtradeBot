  "content": "Elon who was on the internet for having agreed to a fight with Mark Zuckerberg is one of the worlds billionaires with a networth that's more than Mark's Metaverse.He has followed a trend of acquiring some of the world's top assets in form of largest shares and ownership of the companies.In 2021 he purchased huge BTC, in 2022 he acquired Twitter. This is 2023 and he is yet working on huge space exploration project to Mars among others like Neuralink, the boring company, Tesla.My question is, what big purchase could we see Elon Musk likely make this year?",

He could probably be planning on buy a planet or even build a country of his own.(an ai advanced tech country) But I know, that what ever it is, it  be would be something we haven't seen before.",

Tesla had Bitcoins, but the company sold them(or a part of them). Elon probably has dogecoins, maybe that's why he was constantly shilling dogecoin in the last 2 years.3.So you are saying that Twitter is \"a world's top asset\"? Are you kidding me? Buying Twitter was a mistake, but Elon Musk is rich enough to afford such mistakes.It baffles me how many people around the world still think that Elon Musk is some kind of self-made genius. In reality, he's a product of the US government and the Federal Reserve.",

Elon and Mark's disputes are only limited to jokes but if they are considered serious, both will attract attention that competition has the highest place to increase the price of each asset. After many dramas for the sake of people's drama, people are fed up with this, because it often causes price movements to rise and fall dramatically. Manipulation is clearly visible and Elon Musk position still has a big impact.",

And about thinking on what he could acquire next, is all left for him to decide, he is a business man and all entrepreneurs knows what their targets is, what they need to see in a project before they could make a move on acquiring it. There is no doubt that for him to remain on the top, their should be some sort of commitment on the things he should possibly do and all of that. One thing is for him to something that he wants and the other is for him to go for a buying proposal, but not everyone is actually willing to sell off their projects, so if he gets his eyes on projects that the owners don't want to sell he will have to back off or better still build a similar thing to that.",

I think the closest company that Elon next big/notable purchased will be an AI company that will succeed first on the advancement of AI. Elon really likes a company with crazy idea that will give huge leap for technlogical advancement of human.ChatGPT is the number contender for the next company being privately owned by Elon Musk. I'm not updated on how ChatGPT ownership status now but I'm sure ELon is really interested to acquire this project.Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/elon-musk-says-hes-the-reason-chatgpt-owner-openai-exists.html#:~:text=Musk%20was%20an%20early%20backer,emphasis%20on%20safe%20AI%20development.",

Let them do what they wish to do, you have to do something that is opposite of what they are doing to be able to take advantage of the market.For example, when they bought doge and started shilling it, you should be selling your doge to profit. When they are buying twitter, sell your shares if you have any.In either case, you would not always have the upper hand of owning the asset before they make their move, in which case just relax and stop following them.

I think what you talking is something an investor would ask on the daily basis, the media would be asking Elon whenever they see him. This is much interesting question and a question for which world wants answer for. You can't say for sure but you can always follow him on his social medias and get hint from him. But dont get dragged too much since they are sometimes just his imagination and sometimes they are real hard investment ideas. The question is how trustworthy those little tweets could be or posts could be. The better idea? Invest in his existing companies, buy some shares and be happy about it in ten years of time.",

Buying Twitter was a mistake, but Elon Musk is rich enough to afford such mistakes.What makes you think buying Twitter was a mistake by Elon? Is it because of the recent loss of social networks? So what do you think when last year Facebook also had a lot of difficulties, but this year they are gradually recovering?

There will always be conspiracy theories with all the stories in the world, especially stories about billionaires, and they are always the subject of conspiracy theories that they are government people or just puppets of the underworld. But in the end, there's no proof for that, and it's just speculation in the minds of some.",

He like dogecoin as he has made obvious, but it is likely that he has dogecoins together with Bitcoins.
