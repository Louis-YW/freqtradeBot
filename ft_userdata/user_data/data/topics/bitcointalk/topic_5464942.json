These days, it's easier to see newbies create threads and ask questions and seek enlightenment about things on the forum, but I doubt if they usually come back to their threads and see if they get what they were really expecting from other members, as I can see that newbies have turned this pattern into a means of introducing themselves as having arrived on the forum. Adding to what others have said, the forum is very simple to explore, just like a normal gathering will be; you don't expect everyone to respect your opinion, and you are always entitled to your own opinion, so just be yourself, and if you come here with good intentions, you are definitely going to enjoy this forum. And last but not least, you have to grow some thick skin as you might come across some comments and opinions from other members that you might consider a direct attack, which it might not be, but for you to be able to survive here, you don't need to worry about those and always pick out any vital information from where necessary and leave the rest.",
