      "body": "AFAIK, Mycelium does support bech32 addresses. Maybe there's a problem with the iOS version cause I know it's not as stable as the android one. Or you simply didn't update your app for a long time.There are multiple workarounds for this, one of them: Go to your electrum's wallet console and type: Code:make_seed(seed_type=\"standard\")The above will give you a seed which you can then use to restore a new wallet with legacy addresses (start with 1). They should work with Mycelium.Or: You can also restore your Mycelium wallet on Electrum by following this guide: https://medium.com/brute-brothers/step-by-step-guide-restore-your-mycelium-seed-phrase-to-electrum-8b785be1b384And then send the funds wherever you want to.I also believe (maybe someone could confirm this) that it's possible to export your private keys using Mycelium. If so, you can do that and sweep the private keys directly to your Electrum wallet: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/sweeping-your-private-keys-into-electrum/",

I'd say the problem is with your Mycelium, the address itself is fine.Any chance your Mycelium wallet isn't fully synced? Or a very old version from before Segwit?",

I recommend you to try to solve the problem with mycelium and use segwit addresses. The problem should be solved with updating mycelium to the latest version.",

      "body": "I believe this is because of your iPhone IOS version because the apple AppStore won't allow you to download the latest version of the Mycelium since your ios version is not compatible with their latest one. It only allows you to install the last Compatible version with your current IOS version. Updating your IOS and updating the mycelium again should fix this issue however if you are using iPhone 6 below they no longer have any updates their last version is IOS 12.5.5. iPhone 6s and above support the latest IOS version which is iOS 15.6. So it's because of version compatibility version. I have a suggestion mycelium is pretty problematic I'd like to suggest switching to another wallet like edge which is way better than the mycelium wallet.",

This. Coz using that console command will generate legacy address.For you to enable the segwit address, you can follow the medium link given by @OmegaStarScream and choose \"native segwit(p2wpkh)\" instead the \"legacy(p2pkh)\" after checking the \"bip seed\".- using native segwit (bc1) will give lot of advantage including lower transaction fees than legacy.",

The problem with development for android phones is huge fragmentation, there are dozens of OS versions used by people all around the world and at some point developer must decide for which versions he wants to target his soft - as a consequence some group of phones with older OS will not have access to the program.I guess something similar we have now. OS 12 is already quite old and developer decided to target only phones with newer OS. Nothing to blame Apple for. And in fact I would not blame Mycelium too much too, as I know how annoying/difficult/time consuming could be maintaining old versions \"just to have them\". Adding critical features only in the new versions? so-so. On the other hand - the latest iOS 15 is used on more than 70% of phones, the latest android on 25%.If phone allows - update it, it could be only better.https://www.xda-developers.com/android-distribution-numbers-2021/https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/ios-version-fragmentation/",

But it's a bit risky because you will need to jailbroken your phone with cydia and install mycelium .ipa outside appstore. Just like android if you install malware your data is risky.For those who don't know you can jailbreak new or old IOS version using ch3ckrain.",
