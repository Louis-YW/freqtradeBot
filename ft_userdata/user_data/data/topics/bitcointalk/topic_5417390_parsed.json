  "content": "If you like watching crypto videos on YouTube this post is for you.Be careful with YouTubers that provide links to websites under their videos some are scammers and this is one of the latest ways that newbies are losing money,Â  a brother who lives close was trying to watch some videos on YouTube about how to stake EverDome token for APY returns and he almost lost it all, the Youtuber dropped a link that's not Bakeryswap.org ðŸ‘ˆ which is the official Bakeryswap website, instead, the scammer dropped this He was lucky to ask question because he was also curious.1. The fake website has higher APY % compare to the original Bakeryswap APY2. EverDome staking was never available on the Original Bakeryswap, I guess the scammer knew that people are buying and staking Everdome token on the official website and he plan to lure people with higher APY Use your brain out there famz, do not trust all videos you watch on Youtube, always make sure you do some research on the link you are provided, make sure its the official link before connecting your wallet. I did further research on YouTube and the scam links are huge in number, here is another fake link https://bak-dome.com/?utm_source=Everdome_7&utm_medium=everdome_stake&utm_campaign=1Stay safe FAMZ",

Even though a lot of warnings has been posted here, none actually listen and still do things theyll be in trouble later on.The problem here isnt about how to avoid but to be reminded and absorb knowledge that this kind of thing could eventually bankrupt them instead of earning. Well greedy people arent listening anyway.",

Most scams that I have witnessed involved adding some random links to their thread/videos where it would direct you to a poorly made website. Like what I always mentioned to posts like these, prevention is always better than cure. You have the responsibility to avoid dubious links such as what OP posted since you absolutely have no guarantee about its safety and security.Again, there is nothing free in this world. If a website claims to have some free BTCs, then always have some doubts about the giveaways that you see. If someone messages you telling to invest in a certain project, always be skeptical and alert.",

Scamming has never been a new thing when it comes to cryptocurrency, being a fast-growing industry that has been in existence for the past 13yrs, which is why I always tell people about the importance of always doing your research \"DYOR\" before investing, buying or staking any new coin, as it saves you from the possibility of being scam, just the same way O.P just saved his friend from been scam by quickly spotting the difference between the fake and the original siteAnd, secondly, always pay attention to the \"URL\" of every given website, because the difference between a scam site and the original at times may be a slight change in either 1 or 2 letters.",
