This means that we could have another lab made pandemic like the one we just had (it most likely leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology; the WIV could not be properly investigated because it did not post cryptographic timestamps of everything on blockchains), and these places will not even have the infrastructure necessary for anyone to do a proper investigation. We should therefore treat these places like bio-terrorism organizations that want to fucking murder me and you. The only way to deal with these places is to take all of the world's vessels containing radioactive waste and then open those vessels, and dump them on the bio-safety level 4 laboratories. This will be a very good use of the radioactive waste because it will prevent the next pandemic. Sure, this may make cities like Boston (which has a bio-safety level 4 lab at Boston University) uninhabitable, but that is a price that we should all be willing to pay because fuck Boston. The Bostonians have not done shit to make sure that their lab has taken the proper safety protocols, so Boston does not deserve to remain inhabitable.It's undoubtedly a good suggestion if your statement is true that these labs aren't following the safety isn't cool. But it's not right to become sentimental and suggest destroying the city. The thing is that we do not have sufficient proof that these labs are causing a lab-made pandemic.",

Wastes could be used to power automobiles for thousands of miles each.Start building thorium nuclear plants right now - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-based_nuclear_power.Besides the possibility of a rocket explosion and leaking radioactive waste during car crashes and the fact that radioactivity emits radiation 24/7 at a constant (well exponentailly decaying) rate while cars do not run at a constant rate, we also have the problem that once we send all the radioactive stuff to the sun, people can no longer dump any more radioactive stuff on BSL-4 labs. But don't worry; people can still dump non-radioactive pollution on BSL-4 labs.The cars can be made safe enough with lead shielding etc. But if you are worried about accidents, reduce these by placing the nuke unit right behind the driver. That way he will drive slow, because he won't want to be squashed between the heavy unit and whatever he runs into.",

      "body": "Quote from: jvanname on January 15, 2023, 02:00:49 AMUm. In order to have enough lead shielding, we need to convert all cars into tanks. We also need to make these tanks slow enough so that even in an accident, the nuclear waste will no leak. Of course, to do this, we must remove the weapons from the tanks. Fortunately, we can safely dispose of these weapons in places like Boston and Atlanta because those places have BSL-4 labs (and by 'safely', I am referring to the safety of everyone who is not in a place like Boston or Atlanta because f*** them).Added 1/15/2023I have a great idea. Instead of using SpaceX rockets to launch nuclear waste into the sun, I am going to start a rocket company called SpaceSex which will use nuclear powered Blue Origin (after all, we are SpaceSex) rockets to launch nuclear waste into the sun. We will perform operations in South Africa. After all, South Africa is a very dysfunctional country that produces characters like Elon Musk (who heroically lost 200 billion; oh and dumb people who worshipped him also lost a butt ton of money because they are f***ed up) and Die Antwoord, so South Africa has no choice but to approve of very dangerous nuclear powered rockets. Actually, we will just do a lot of the operations in South Africa, but we will actually launch the rockets from Somalia which will approve of nuclear rockets since Somalia is Somalia. Our plan is simple. We will get the competitors of satellite companies to pay us to release caltrops in space to shred all the existing satellites. And this will also promote world peace because these caltrops will also be designed to shred nuclear ICBMs as well. As a consequence, we will design our satellites to be resistant to our own caltrops so ours will work and others will not work. We will also design our nuclear rockets sending nuclear waste into space to be resistant to our own caltrops. Oh. And since sending nuclear waste to the sun is too expensive, we will only put the nuclear waste in orbit around Earth. What could possibly go wrong?If you think my idea of SpaceSex is messed up, just think about it. Regardless of how messed up my idea of SpaceSex is, that will be a far better idea than having BSL-4 labs that do not post cryptographic timestamps of all data on blockchains.Yes, but, think of the places you would need shielding if you enjoyed nuclear SpaceSex and wanted to stay alive!As for cars, if they are tanks without guns, think of how safe they would be. In fact, add some interior padding, and you could even make them into bumper cars. Didn't Musk send a car into space? With a few modifications, you could have SpaceSex in the back seat.",

      "body": "Adapting a nuclear reactor to a car sounds crazy, pretty unrealistic, actually.Nuclear power plants use uranium rods to increase the temperature of water until reaching its boiling point, so steam can be used to move a turbine connected to a generator. Not even mentioning the safety risk of pretty much everyone having nuclear material in their homes, lead would make cars more expensive, heavier and less efficient. For the record, I am not okey with using nuclear waste to destroy entire cities and I am more in favor of sending nuclear waste to stars, which are already pretty much made of radioactive plasma.",

Cities do not care about their BSL-4 labs that refuse to post cryptographic timestamps of all their data on blockchains, so fuck them. But yes, we should send nuclear waste to stars. I mean, that solution is not practical, but it sounds like you believe in magic, and if you believe in magic, I will always support you....We could always use this method to get the nuclear wastes to the stars.

I mean, this problem could go wrong and pollute everything, but it is worth a shot. After all, BSL-4 labs throw caution to the wind by refusing to post cryptographic timestamps of all their data on blockchains, so we should also have a radioactive waste disposal program that also takes caution to the wind. We need more people like the two heros who were f***ing around with a plutonium nuclear core with just a screwdriver and bricks. Because regardless of how reckless and stupid people can be, they are no match for the recklessness of BSL-4 labs.-FuckJoseph Van Name Ph.D.Do you know that using this radiative measure it will cause or bring a ham to the environment radiative emission and West I think that it'll have a side effect if not properly managed so I someone needs to make a research in this before making a proper conclusion I'm signing it in case of the future reference",
