Yes, most Hardware wallets are basically the same as software wallets when it comes with derivation path since it follows BIP39 standard.Although I don't know what you'll do with the master fingerprint showed in Sparrow since it's not too important when it comes with derivation of the child extended keys.",

After you have entered password device, before creating wallet, shows master fingeprint to you and asks whether it is correct.  If you see on display that some  characters differ from those that relevant to your SEED+password it means you have entered the wrong password, forcing you to enter the correct one and, thus, protecting your nerves at checking balance on wrong wallet.",
