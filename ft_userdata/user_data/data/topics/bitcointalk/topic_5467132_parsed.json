  "content": "Good day to all. I’m new to this forum and I got here through a Google search of cryptocurrency forums.I’m not good at this, and this is a new direction for me.Looking for someone to help me understand the altcoin business.For many years I was engaged in business working as a financier in large companies. For today It is very difficult for businesses to attract funding into the real sector.I have an idea to attract funding to the real business sector by releasing altcoinThat would be secured by real business. If this team is interested in discussing the possibility of a joint start-up.I’m no good at the crypt, but I have real business experience.At the moment I am considering the construction of a starch factory on the basis of the former plant that located in Slovakia. There is a project of the plant also there is an engineering company that will carry out installation and start-up of the operation.I’d like to see if it’s possible to finance a project using the release of my altcoin.Do not judge strictly. Maybe it is impossible. But I hope you can always find an alternative even in such a question.Can try it small. Ready for dialogue. I will be glad of new acquaintances.My native language is Russian and Ukrainian. English is very weak. I wrote the text in Russian then translated in a translator.There may be translation errors, I apologize for them in advance.",

We know that due to the recent economic condition, most VC and investment firms take a more careful approach toward which business they want to fund.With that in mind, there must be something wrong with the business you propose. Making an altcoin while only seeking funding would rather make your business plan decision awful. You are not solving the problem of why the business did not get financed, but instead, shifting to meaningless and unnecessary altcoin funding options or methods. Your business has no essential dependence on an altcoin, even for the sake of funding.",

I understand that it is very difficult to inspire confidence among investors andshow that the project will be a success.The cryptocurrency market is new to me. I haven't followed the crypto market before.Now is the time for digitalization. Today it is difficult to find financing to start a business. I used to use the services of private investors and bank loans. There were no other options in my practice.Today banks do not want to finance a project without collateral and participation with their capital of at least 30%from the cost of the project. Private investors are not willing to take risks given the global economic downturn.While studying the cryptocurrency market, I see that people invest their finances in coins that do not have any collateral.people take risks with the desire to receive income from purchase and sale operations or freezing coins.I want to try to attract finance from the virtual market to the real sector by combining them. I don't know if this will work or not.In order to understand, I am looking for someone who understands this.Today, due to restrictions on free movement in my country and I am looking more towards e-commerce.While there is time and opportunity, I want to learn more about the altcoin market. Maybe I'll find a partner here By combining efforts and knowledge we can get results.",

Without the proper use scenario, the altcoin would be nothing more than a meme token or just an alternative form of crowdfunding. IMO, even if you use the coin only to donate on your business, creating an altcoin and promoting it is a pretty complicated for a real world business. It would be much easier to get funding from traditional sources, just make a clear business plan, show how you gonna make the profit and investors will queue up to give you the money. It shouldn't be the problem neither in EU nor even in Russia.",

Now people understand that this is basically just an illegal security.@OP have you spoken with your lawyers? There's so much complicated stuff if you want people abroad to invest in your business, aside from the ICO issue with the regulation.

First, you will need a team because it's impossible for you to do it on your own or else it will be a mess. Marketing is next, you need another team to spread the good news and all I can say about what I see now is it's difficult to find a good team that would make a great effort and work it out, you will need to pay high to make it possible. I say it is possible but it will cost you. There are other businesses that did the same, some failed lacking mostly in marketing strategies while others were because of the lack of information given to make it sound more inviting to investors. I've seen car business-related and even electronics businesses during the ICO days, both failed but they did try. You need to think of a feature that would be attractive and also put yourself in their position if it's really worth buying your proposed plan of coin.",

Your best bet is by pitching investors if you can't afford to get bank lending.I agree with you regarding a European company or a company from a country with a stable economy.I live in Ukraine. It's not a good time for startup funding right now. Ukrainian companyhas virtually no chance of funding. Foreign companies are also not ready to work due to high risks.For example, I’ll give you one of the situations:There is a product in demand in Ukraine that is produced in China. It is possible to sell a product in Ukraine only if it is available in the country. China will not start productiongoods without receiving a 30% advance payment and will not ship the goods without paying the balance 70%. There is no direct logistics from China to Ukraine. An intermediary country is needed. Financing for suchIt is almost impossible to get a deal in Ukraine.but if, in theory, we take a coin that will be secured by a trade credit. The investor buys part of the coins, thereby financing the transactionLet's say 1 US dollar per coin. The transaction status process will be displayed on the company website. When selling goods in Ukraine, coins will be redeemed at a fixed price, for example1.1 dollars. Someone will sell right away, someone will wait. With each round of the transaction, the cost of redeeming coins increases.eventually buy them all. You can use it for another deal by first writing out a business plan on the website.If I'm wrong, please correct me. I see the possibility of using altcoin as a share in a joint stock company.My knowledge of English is easy. Translated by a translator.",
