And to OP, I don't know how long you've been in the cryptospace so I assume that you've been here for a short while, as @mk4 said above, bear markets typically lasts for a really long time. You need a lot of patience if you want your capital to grow, look at the early adopters and where they are right now except of course to those who've lost their coins somewhere.",

A lot of infrastructures, services, businesses, and other platforms are built with, by, and around bitcoin, and for sure these 'stakeholders' don't want bitcoin to go down the drain. Aside from that, the price action also helps prevent bitcoin from going down so much because a lot of traders are willing to buy x amount of coins in the current price to negate selling pressure. There's a lot more to it, really, but this covers the basics on the answer to your question.",

That means the US economy falling apart is only affecting a small percentage of the world not all of it, so if anything it should only affect that percentage not the rest of us.Secondly bitcoin has never followed any other market despite what some people are desperately trying to convince us that it does. If anything whenever all other markets are failing the capital that exits all those markets has to go somewhere and bitcoin can be a good choice.Whether bitcoin is going to go any lower, I can not tell. But one thing is certain, it will not go down because some markets in US are dumping hard.Quote from: Editbar on October 01, 2022, 02:35:02 PMthe dollar Skyrocket into I mean almost all-time highs are essentially all-time highs in many different currencies especially the pound and the Euro.You are confusing other fiats dumping with dollar going up. It did not. You can see the price of everything in US that has gone up against dollar which is a clear indication that US dollar is dumping.The thing is that other fiats like Euro and Pound are dumping more than US dollar so the exchange rate against dollar goes up creating the misconception that dollar has gone up!",

      "body": "The easiest explanation for why the Bitcoins price is not going below the 17-18,000 USD barrier is that there are too many investors in the market starting to buy again at the these cheap prices. I remember that quite a few big crypto investors stated when the price was around 30,000 USD that they would be buying once the price drops below 20,000 USD. Robert Kiyosaki was one of the investors who talked on Twitter about the 17,000 floor for the Bitcoin price. Another explanation is that Bitcoin investors are unwilling to sell their coins below such a cheap price. So once bitcoins drops below 20,000 USD again many of the potential sellers are leaving the market and reducing the supply of bitcoins at the exchange. The expectations of the buyer and seller need to match for the a deal to happen. I am glad the price is not going lower and will hopefully recover soon again.",
