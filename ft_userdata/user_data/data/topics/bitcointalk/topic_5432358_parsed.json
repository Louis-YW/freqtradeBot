You can see their plan as they are auto converting USDC, USDP and TUSD to BUSD on their exchange, said to increase liquidity. During the last panic that made Binance users to withdraw their coins to noncustodial wallet, USDC withdrawal was disabled, I do not know if it was later enabled at the time.DAI is better if you want a decentralized stable coin, all others can be freezed on noncustodial wallet, the reason not to stored them on noncustodial wallet.Quote from: un_rank on December 30, 2022, 09:03:07 AMI do not see any reason to keep your dollars in any stable coin when we have Bitcoin.Just that some people are traders, example are swing traders that convert bitcoin to stable coin and convert it back to bitcoin.

It's no secret that most of such s-coins have full custodial status, which means that they can be frozen by the issuer at any time, regardless of where they are stored - so they are highly risky.In addition, even the most famous ones had problems with the fact that it was discovered that they were not backed in the way we thought, which means that someone is printing digital tokens that are not actually worth anything while at the same time claiming the complete opposite. Therefore, it is beyond all reason to believe in such a system that can turn against everyone at any time, so it is logical to conclude that stablecoins are a far worse option even than fiat currencies.",

But even so, it is not recommended to store all assets in crypto stablecoins which still have the risk of being lost, such as the incident at Terra LUNA which made the stable coin brand, namely UST, also collapse. There will still be risks, we need to be vigilant and have a backup plan when things don't go our way.Several new projects that will make stablecoins need to be watched out for, because they are still very risky.

These stablecoins use a protocol that involves volatile asset as basis to peg the price to 1USD which is obviously turns to failure after unable handling too much sell off on the token.Also Justin Sun and Do Kwon idea is pure ponzinomics which offers there stablecoin in bargain price with a huge APY by just staking.

To issue a stablecoin that really is stable and also reliable during a heavy bear market like the one that we are in right now requires a huge amount of money. In the end every stablecoin that is minted and issued by a company needs to be backed 1:1 with a real $ or € that is owned by that company otherwise that stablecoin will not be very stable once some big hickups are happening in the crypto market.I also use USDT, USDC and BUSD as the stablecoins of my choice, even though i don't really like the fact that they are all centralized, but it is what it is.",

Among all the stable coins you mention, DAI should be the only go to stablecoin for storing of your profits while the rest can be used for trading since they have more available liquidly as they're been adopted more on exchanges. Before entrusting your funds to ang project for safe keeping do understand how that stable coins works.Many investors didn't understand how UST worked (algorithmic stablecoin) but just patronized it because it was popular and a coin from famous Terra Luna camp. Also do note that just because a project claims to be decentralized doesn't guarantee them been a good project and safe from collapsing. We have lots of Defi projects getting hacked daily and any of the so called Defi stablecoin could still fall victim and unlikely to recover, be careful out there.",

Once the new stable token will be collapse and they will make bunch of complaints like crazy people while they didn't even try to realize if they were stupid enough by using the new stable token that has not backed by USD.Quote from: Outhue on December 30, 2022, 08:41:57 AMCentralised or Decentralised you can just make a pick from USDC , USDT, DAI or BUSDSo far by using those stable tokens with real reserved funds and i never encounter any problem unlike those who have been using algorithmic stable token which was a scam token.",
