Nothing wrong with BUSD when after all you are trading in Binance. Maybe USDT will also be removed if this is a mandate from the regulators for it is easier to track traders' transactions. Every exchange I think should just have a stablecoin of thier own.",

Why not do it for USDT? Why BUSD that is developed by Binance. I can see USDC and TUSD to be successfully traded on some exchanges that I have used before, like HitBTC before I left the exchange. On OKX, USDC is the alternative pair after USDT. Recently I moved all my USDT from OKX temporary, when I login to the exchange, it popped up USDC to be as a suggestion for trading pair as I had no USDC there again, this is usual if I moved all my USDC from OKX. Successfully, USDC has been a successful trading pair on many exchanges. Only the one I do not know much about is USDP. Binance is looking for all means to strengthen BUSD and nothing more than that. I can see lately on Binance that their is now BTC and some other coins paired with BUSD in perpetual market with reduction in fee deduction. But if Binance is trying to strengthen BUSD, it should not be in a way to affect other stable coins to grow.",

There are many users of these stable coins who will be affected by this and those who are having those stable coins who leave their assets unchecked will be forced to have BUSD. Though I'm thinking why did Binance remove these stable coins? Are they moving aggressively?",

They have the dominant exchange now, Binance which they know many people are using.It's not a sector they've done that well in so far though either. BUSD has around 15bn coins while usdc and usdt were over 50bn last time I checked (for each).I guess this might be a good thing for stablecoins if it means that the spreads are low enough and they're stable enough between each other that a 1:1 conversion can be offered. But at the same time it makes busd look a bit risky (imo) that it could be collateralised by two other entities and not binance themselves.",

But if you deposit USDC, USDP and TUSD, you will be able to withdraw in the respective coins.It is another strategy of Binance to shill their BUSD and enforce their users to use BUSD more.Months ago, in 2020 when Ethereum network has very high transaction fee up to $200 per transaction or higher, people switched to use Tether USD on TRC20. Back in those days, Binance provided 0 transaction fee for USDT TRC20. Months later, when they started to shill BUSD, they stop free withdrawal fee for USDT TRC20 and if users want to have 0 transaction fee, please use BUSD.This time, Binance again applies this strategy and I am sure they will get another success. When you are on home of others, you can not ask for completely fairness and fair competition.Quote from: DaveF on September 06, 2022, 02:47:03 AMI can see other exchanges doing this.

And then every other altcoin/ 3 stablecoins?All come in -> converted to one -> choose your outcoin.DaveF has a point too. Personally it is unnecessary to have multiple trading pairs for one coin. I think only two trading pairs are enough, one with Bitcoin and another with one stable coin. Assume you trade BTC to BUSD, but don't want to store your money in BUSD, you can convert your BUSD to your favorite stable coin. It costs you a bit more trading fee or conversion fee. It gives more income to exchanges and reduce their maintenance, security costs.",

It's good that they are still withdrawable, meaning this will help keep the peg value between the stable tokens at 1:1. The problem is that if they don't have sufficient reserves of other stable tokens, maybe withdrawals will pending (and this is the main concern of users) or users will have to be forced to withdraw in BUSD.
