      "body": "What does Bitcoin have to do with real estate? It's a payment method, and there's no problem with transferring money when it comes to real estate deals.Blockchain also has nothing to offer to real estate, because it's a database, and its properties aren't needed for this sector. Even doing something like a blockchain record for registering property for transparency purpose is not a good idea, because it has awful safety for users - lose your private keys and you lose your property rights.",

      "body": "Maintaining the integrity of data is one application of blockchains. Bitcoin illustrates this well by using a blockchain to maintain the integrity of its ledger system.The success of matson and the medical industry using blockchain in open ledger systems has emboldened expansion of the technology into other sectors.As a result, blockchain has been proposed as a foundation for electronic voting systems and for maintaining digital real estate deeds and permits. I think there would always be a hard requirement for maintaining a paper trail and hardcopy written record system. In the advent of an EMP attack. Or building fire which destroys records. It is important that some of those records be recoverable.Researchers claim that data was retrieved from hard disk drives that were inside the 9/11 world trade center towers that disintegrated on 9.11.2001. It has also been claimed that data could be recovered HDDs in the space shuttle challenger which exploded shortly after launch. Digital drives are definitely more resilient than anyone realized. But still I think blockchain cannot completely eliminate the need for paper trails in real estate deed systems and other areas where record keeping are important.",
