Current its in the sub 2K region even if the extreme bull market kicks I don't think it will fall below thousand dollars unless bitcoin again back to four digit price range. ETH is good and it os expected to bring more development in the future so why not ETH? Over shitcoins with mo real use.",

IMO, I think no one knows what was the exact thing will happen in the future, and all that we can do is just speculate if the worst thing will come in a few months or not, but one thing is for sure, a bearish season will come and everyone will experience it, but I think it will be different from the previous one due to many aspects, Anyway Im not an expert on it, Im just basing my opinion in current market data because the current market size is bigger compared before.",

Hodling a coin doesn't mean you don't have to be smart about it. You need to study the coin and see if it has potential to come back after a fall before investing on it. I think the best secret for bear market is to use USDT to peg it until it is safe to reconvert and not to rely on hope that the price is to correct soon.",

If you are someone who has been through the past 3 bear market, I hope you will soon provide an analysis of why ETH will drop to $300 instead of just your sentimental prediction.I've been through 2018 too, I'm not saying it won't happen again but by comparison the market is very different now. So it is very difficult for BTC to drop to 10k$ and ETH to 300$.",

No one has seen what has happened to Luna before it actually happens.I've seen 2018 for Ethereum and luckily, I got some from that time and sold it last year.It's unknown whether it will be back there to its old price or not but just consider that everything is possible for any coin. @OP if I have any extra budget now, I'll buy.",

Not wrong try to invest on ethereum still price under $2,000 because still potential for ethereum can back to $3,000 when bitcoin have stable price.

The current price of the coin is not normal, it may fall beyond the current price. But if we trade, it would be nice to make short-term trades. I see Bitcoin if the dump is more than 10%, it means the altcoin will drop 20% to 30%.",

Ethereum is not too bad if you already have a bit of a calculation. But if the choice is Ethereum in my opinion it doesn't matter. They have long-term prospects as long as you are prepared for a bear market which at the moment looks quite dire. The turbulent market conditions are heating up and I'm afraid the bears don't end here. It all depends on your decision, so it's always better to consider everything very carefully.",
