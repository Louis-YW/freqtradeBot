  "content": "Lately, there seems lot of fearful reactions from the people about Bitcoin and how it could come to an end considering the current bear market. Literally media is taking it too seriously and showing the bitcoin as villain of the movie that too without any facts. If to date, any media really wants to understand in which direction the bitcoin is moving then they should really travel the world and understand how bitcoin is getting \"percolated\" in the world's tiniest systems and flourishing everywhere. \"My sole point of creating this thread is to send out positive vibe amongst the forum members, not to worry about the market situation because the picture is far bigger than what we think.\"Starting with, Who accepts bitcoin? we can actually see the bitcoin's real use case and how it is already on the market just like other assets/currencies.

San Francisco - There are 437 bitcoin ATMs in the Bay Area, including 65 in the city of San Francisco itselfVancouver - the world's first bitcoin ATM began operations at Waves Coffee House on October 29, 2013, in downtown Vancouver. 50+ merchants and 221 bitcoin friendly locations.Amsterdam - Amsterdam is home to mining hardware maker Bitfury and the European headquarters of payment service provider BitPay. More than half dozen Bitcoin ATM, 40+ merchantsLjubljana, Slovenia - Ljubljana has eleven bitcoin ATMs in the city and surrounding areas, and roughly 200 merchants who say they accept bitcoinTel Aviv - Nineteen merchants accepting bitcoin and seven bitcoin ATMsPortsmouth, New Hampshire - Dubbed \"bitcoin village\" by local residents, the downtown area is home to about a dozen crypto-friendly businesses, including the Seacoast Repertory Theatre and the Free State Bitcoin Shoppe. It has 21+ Bitcoin ATM'sMiami, Florida - 651 bitcoin ATMs and tellers. The city's government is seeking to attract blockchain businesses to their city, and Mayor Francis Suarez has proposed investing city funds in bitcoin and even launching a municipal cryptocurrency.El Zonte, El Salvador - \"Bitcoin Beach,\" with more than thousands Bitcoin ATM. Government directly involved with bitcoin adoption itself. New York - New York is also a major hub for crypto startups and media companies, such as CoinDesk, Decrypt, and CoinTelegraph, as well as home to Consensus, one of the largest annual events in the crypto industry.London - 50 bitcoin ATMs, and about the same number of merchantsI am not just making a list here by grabbing it from here and there but these are actual results of bitcoin in use. If people still gonna argue about bitcoin's prices, its trust based on some failed exchange or few bad set backs then I think they have not understood the bitcoin really well. Bitcoin can still be used on mega level with no price in consideration. The price will automatically follow Bitcoin once the use keep growing all the time. The price manipulation that we are seeing in the market is due to it's use just as trading instrument where millionaire and billionaires are taking it too personally and trading the volume in shorting the market. We are still at good terms if see the data above. Moreover, if we see the most recent data then actual figures are really different, and could actually let us know exact bitcoin adoption. Community, go ahead and make some positive noise on this thread. Post your local region stories and show them we are strong and we are getting stronger day by day in bitcoin adoption.

If they do not understand Bitcoin very well, then it's safer they do not invest in it at all. Creating a list to show the strength of Bitcoin is good, but anyone who cannot do a basic research to find out how the network operates and maybe zoom out of the chart to see previous oricae actions and reasons for them does not deserve to buy in at discounted prices. They would be back in a few months or years when the market is bulling and fomo in.Quote from: Flexystar on November 20, 2022, 06:32:15 PMThe price manipulation that we are seeing in the market is due to it's use just as trading instrument where millionaire and billionaires are taking it too personally and trading the volume in shorting the market. Price actions are most likely not the result of market manipulation. It's a volatile commodity, so its value would remain speculative, at least for a few years.",

The whole point is bitcoin literally gone far in very short period of time and such bearish trends will come and go. We have experienced this all the time and this is a message for the people who are always scared about the market downfall and think it's dead end.

We’ve got a long ways to go before ANYTHING is decided.  One thing I’m sure of, while one of few, is that bitcoin is anything but dead. Yes it is going to play biggest innings yet. If you look at the old analysis then \"Bitcoin is Dead\" has been used more than 400 times until now. Like it was literally proclaimed by people and various media and that is the thing we do not want from us. Now I know that we are on the forum where most of us \"Trust in the Bitcoin\", however, for those who think Bitcoin is dead then do read following article and also checkout the analysis about how many times it was dead and yet we are using it. Lol.zSource: Bitcoin is Dead (Again)QuoteSummaryFTX is dead. Crypto is not. Don't confuse the two. Reports of Bitcoin's death have been greatly exaggerated.Search interest in \"Bitcoin is Dead\" has spiked following the collapse of FTX. History tells us we're close to a bottom.On-chain metrics look phenomenal. Non-zero addresses are approaching 44 million and exchange supply is at a two year low.More to follow here: Bitcoin is Dead (Again)",

No matter how negative the point of view of the people around you towards your investment, decision will be depending on you alone. In the first place this is an industry filled with very volatile assets, from that you should already know the risks involved from engaging so. There are unexpected events that may affect your profit and losses simoly because cryptocurrencies' market value solely depends on the demand created by the community. If you percieve this industry as something which will yield to losses, then feel free to leave; save yourself from worries.",

And AFAIK, there hasn't been a company that has taken a challenge to accept bitcoins without accepting fiat (to pay for their goods/services).I agree that list will change but now more than ever no one thinks Bitcoin will come to an end.Many countries are considering to make mining legal in them,a list of countries who have just express this desire and not putting it into legislation is enough of a reason for me why Bitcoin will never come to an end because it is desire right now but most likely it can be translated to law in the not so distant future.Companies the more they are that accept Bitcoin the better but what makes a difference is when it is adopted at a wide scale like nations with El Salvador leading the way.",
