  "content": "I was inspired by fellow forum members the last time,I made a post that i taught business women about the adoption of bitcoin as an alternative payment method in their businesses. Some people said the women are too old and might not be able to add impact on the adoption of bitcoin, that I should teach younger ones and not the age range of business women. I have a neighbour who is a vice principal (academic), in a school which is 15km away from home. Some evenings or weekends, we do sit together in the compound to discuss our country's economy state and other issues. I have introduced him and his wife to bitcoin, but they are very reluctant to key into the cryptospace. Few weeks ago,I told him that,he should given me an opportunity to introduce bitcoin bitcoin to his students. I gave him reasons why these teenagers needs this knowledge, by using the present situation which Nigerians are passing through, which is a result of the new CBN cashless policy that was introduced. I let him understand that we have entered a new era of digital currency and that soon fiat will be valueless.          He gave me a YES,that when am ready to give my presentation, I should inform him to start he can do the necessary. On Tuesday,21st of February, 2023. I went to Bridging Global Link Academy to give bitcoin awareness to the Senior Secondary School students. Immediately, I entered the class and saw the students, I was shaking and sweating because of the number of students I saw. I took a deep breath and remembered my purpose of going there,I took courage and started by telling the students a funny story,to enable me be in control of them. Finally, when I have suppress the fear in me,I started the teaching of bitcoin. I only emphasize more on the basic concepts of bitcoin so that they don't get it complicated.     The students found the class very interesting and asked so many questions, which I wasn't expecting from them. Guess what,yesterday evening, my neighbour came to our apartment with a bottle of wine,he said that one of the parents called him earlier and asked him,if he has started teaching crptocurrency in his,that it is a good initiative. I have also taught so many people about bitcoin and used my hotel as a place of contact to give bitcoin awareness in my area.     After teaching these students, I found out that the younger ones loves to learn new innovations than the adults or am I wrong from my observation.... Your opinion please.",

It can be said that bitcoin investment has no age limit, as long as they are passionate about investing, passionate about bitcoin, they can invest and may be even better than us. I can teach someone about bitcoin, but I won't give investment advice to anyone, I don't want to be blamed if they lose. Even if I invest, I have no guarantee that I will be profitable, so I do not like to give advice to anyone.",

It's alwayz a dope idea to spread the word about digital currency, especially to the young who are usually more down to try new sh*t. I'm stoked to hear that the students were into yur class and wanted to learn more. And yo, major props for not letting yur jitters get in the way of spittin' facts. That's legit admirable. Your impact on education these kidz about bitcoin is huge, and I hope it inspires more people to do the same.Speaking of which, I feel ya on the younger generation bein more open to new ideas. Kids are naturally curious and love learnin new stuff, while adults can be straight-up resistant to change. But I also believe that age aint nothin but a number, and anyone can be receptive to new ideas if you present it in the right way. The key is to be honest, open-mindd, and willin to learn. Keep it up, and I hope yur efforts inspire more peeps to learn about the perks of digital currencies.",

But for now I don't think you'll be able to do so many things because of the short duration an academic session last and by so limiting them to what they can learn and I guess they won't be learning just digital currency alone in this session. But I do commend you for even having to bring up the topic alone that's going to change the mindsets of most of them and if they're curious enough they might start poundering on what lies behind the word \"Bitcoin\" what does it truly means, is it only just a digital currency, is there any other utility attached to Bitcoin? Those type of thought are definitely going to ignite a spark in them.",

I myself still can't explain what is bitcoin properly to anyone around me who wants to know about it. I'm sure you did great explaining them. That bottle of wine proving it lol.Regarding your last sentence, yeah I think younger people are open to any new knowledge, mainly about technology and entertainment. Since bitcoin or cryptocurrency is one of the most important technologies on economy now, of course young people will be interested to know more about it. They might be not interested to invest on crypto, but at least they have desire to know about this thing. Bitcoin also could be related to entertainments, which some brands now accepting crypto for their payment. It makes transaction easier and faster, where people even can send money to other country without any hassle. For elderly people, they will hard to accept bitcoin and its features, unless they work or once worked in financial business, or any economic business sector. Elderly people get used to do traditional transaction with fiat, and won't get bothered to use other payment system nor learning how to use it. So yeah, I think younger people is easier to be taught about bitcoin. Good job, Merit.s. Keep it up!",

Your opinion please.Younger people are always excited to learn new things due to the how limited their teaching curriculum can be. They are well exposed and see the things on the internet, they know that there are better things to learn that only what is being offered on their school curriculum. Teaching this teens about bitcoins, you have offered them an opportunity to be exposed and it will have a big effect on them. I hope you can keep up with these teens at least for a few more weeks. I am happy to see this.",

I've never known what the motives behind this initiative are, but if you really want to teach these kids about bitcoin with genuine intentions, then you have every right to earn their proud title of teacher someday.It's good to get lots of users taking the initiative to spread information about bitcoin even as they reach more students, but I hope this never gets in the way of their interest in learning what should not be at a more advanced stage about technologies like bitcoin.",

That's completely BS! Jesus Christ    As harsh as it sounds I completely agree with this.  Though @OP could have presented it better if he just copies what is written on the whitepaper.  I also noticed financial freedom is wrongly used since there is another definition of financial freedom and it does not mean not being controlled by the governmentQuoteWhat Is Financial Freedom? Financial freedom means you get to make life decisions without being overly stressed about the financial fallout of those decisions. That's because you're financially prepared for whatever life throws your way—you have no debt, you have money in the bank, and you're investing for the future.But still great work of having the courage to discuss Bitcoin in front of many audience.",

But i think some sentence caught my attention in your write upQuoteI gave him reasons why these teenagers needs this knowledge, by using the present situation which Nigerians are passing through, which is a result of the new CBN cashless policy that was introduced. I let him understand that we have entered a new era of digital currency and that soon fiat will be valueless.i dont know about fiat currency been valueless,  i think thats one of the main reason the cbn has stipulated this recent rules, i mean to give its naira a real value in the market and there is always digital naira and i think they are a couple of online bank which operate fully well in the country too. I mean there will less overuse of cash and alot more of it through online methods of making transfers from your fiat bank and your cards and also there is the mobile online banks for easy transaction. But non the less the initiative is still nice one in addition to the massive awareness and global adoption of bitcoin in Africa and nigeria in particular.",
