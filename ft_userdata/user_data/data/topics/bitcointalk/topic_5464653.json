If you search for transactions at that time, you'll barely find a block with more than the coinbase transaction. In block 45689, which was mined in 17th of March 2010, at 23:51, there is one transaction with 4 inputs spent to some reused address. Here it is: 31178ebd1c8815e807d660ef7e0427b64fa6c47dc16861d0b01ce920b00df841. Transaction in block 45614, could also be that one, but it seems less likely. There are lots of inputs being spent there, whereas in the previous, it's 4 exactly. I can't find any other transaction that happened in that day.",

Bitcoin.com provides information pertaining to the first transaction whereas they never wrote anything about the number of wallets doing that transaction. As per BlackHatCoiner when checking the transaction ID only four other wallets were involved. Still, it doesn't state that there were four members who were the individual owners of those wallets. I do think it is possible to find out the number of members involved in this transaction.",

Thanks! TS For people like us that are new into the system, we find these kind of stories absolutely intriguing because it is like a journey of 1000 miles and This  further affirms to us, that Rome was not built in a day. Today, Bitcoin is one special currency in the Worldwide web that people and users of internet across the world are celebrating. Because it is a new technology that have come to stay and as time goes on, we've gotten a lot of people coming into terms with this new, amazing, decentralized technology of currency. You can make your transactions on Bitcoin without having any fear of favour or fear of authority. Therefore, the impartiality that comes with this technology through the open-source feature embedded in it is absolutely sterling. It is as though each and every one of us within the blockchain has our individual country over the transactions that are going on within the chain. I have never thought that there's going to be opportunity like this in a time like this, and all I can say is that Bitcoin is a pace setter and a pathfinder in the world of money and currency. Much respect and accolades to Nakamoto Satoshi.",

Actually its a little confusing as according to this thread The first exchange rate for BTC was according to Liberty Standard (dated around 2009-10-05), and if Liberty standard was an exchange then it should be called as first exchange but the same thread has stated that the first exchange is BITCOIN MARKET (date is of around 2010-01-15). Well, technically exchange is a bit different than exchange directly with a person it mostly be like a p2p as speaking of Liberty standard they showed their rates and made deals through Paypal. And the first exchange is bitcoin market as it must have exchange-wise features in it.

Maybe it was by PayPal because it would of been difficult to get fiat deposits back then. I don't think deposits and withdrawals integration would be that much difficult plus according to the OP (dwdollar), only limit orders worked while market orders were in pending. Well, these types of topics give me goosebumps like how people could trade thousands of BTC just for $1 I mean I wish I had a time machine. haha.",
