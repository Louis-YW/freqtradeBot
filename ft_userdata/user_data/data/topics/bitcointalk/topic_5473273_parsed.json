      "body": "If it shows red light then there is a problem with your PSU.If the suggestion above does not work or the PSU isn't able to power the unit because it suddenly turns the light red there is a possibility that the PSU is shorted or might have a few burnt parts.I suggest disassemble the unit and check the board visually and look for obvious brunt parts. If you found one you need to replace it.",
