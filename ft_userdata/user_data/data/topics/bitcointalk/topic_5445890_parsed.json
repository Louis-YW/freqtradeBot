  "content": "So after long time couple of days ago Binance announced their new launchpad for Space ID token. Before that Space ID announced platform to check Airdrop eligibility for their early users. So if you are person who brought spce id domain names long ago right now you got at least 90 -240 id token airdrop. Also if you own two or more than domain names, their OATs then you may have bigger airdrop. What is this space id? Briefly it is a web3 domain name register with multi chain name service. Right now we know this only. Should I invest it?So most people are not got the airdrop. So they want to get somw ID tokens. But for me this is not a project that having long term survival plan right now. Because they only have social media hype. So my advice is don't buy it from exchanges when trading open. Just wait till the airdrop tokens are sold out. Because there can be a huge price drop future in this token as i can see according to fundemental background of this. Only good thing in this project right now is a social hype and bigger community like shiba inu. So remember to play smart not greedy. Because you are risking money that you gain by hard working.",

In respect to space id, my personal opinion will be to wait for the token launch to exchange platforms, wait for airdrop participants to dump their share; then you can ape in on a platter of Gold",

To be honest I'm not familiar with Space ID token, but anything that is coming new to the market, I would say it's good until the hype died down.And the timing though, ware in a bull run right now so obviously, market are very lively and they could get a couple of investors.As for what the OP should do, then just hold or if you really believed in this project they buy more and see how it goes for you.",

First day of trading is always a \"take profit day\" for smart money and insiders. Who else would be selling if no one has coins yet? As bnb holder i always dump new lauchpads for more bnb. Most of the cases i did a great deal because of the future 20-90% dump. Only few went up like crazy outperforming market (like axie or matic) but most of the time you can buy it with discount 1-10 weeks from listing.",

Rather trade with it, take profit and never trade again. That's what we usually do with such kind of useless tokens. The creators of such tokens create a huge marketing hype, list it in an exchange, when the price reaches an optimum level, they sell off their holding and make millions in profit. That's the usual practice you should also follow. Never ever keep your money invested in such tokens, ever!",

Its seems good waiting if price drop after all investor or launchpad participants selling their coins for getting lower price.",

You've said it right that this project and the others that have been trending lately are all based on hype. Just like what we've learned in the past with meme coins, these hypes are not going to last a long time and that's why those that have received their airdrops from it and someone eager to buy it because of seeing people making free money from it, it's better to preserve your capital and invest elsewhere which is something better. While if you'll think about it, the airdrop will be mostly dump and if you have that trust on this project to catch the falling knives then you know what's in it for you.",
