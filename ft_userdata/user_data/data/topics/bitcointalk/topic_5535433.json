  "content": "SourceLook at the M2 money supply in the dollar continues to grow every year and it will weaken the FIAT currency, in the case of FIAT currencies all have the same mechanism and the certainty is that with the increase in supply it will reduce the value of your money, and will you continue to keep your FIAT and let it lose its value, why not just keep your money in bitcoin? Even though you know that Bitcoin has fluctuations, you can still believe that Bitcoin will always fight Inflation and maintain and increase the value of Bitcoin, OR IN OTHER WORDS PRESERVE AND ADD TO YOUR WEALTH IN THE LONG TERM.Don't let the results of your hard work swallowed by this system.",

As much as we want to tell everybody to save in BTC, it's because not everyone is oriented about it and that's why we need to rely on ourselves in saving Bitcoin. We have been telling those that are not yet convinced about saving in BTC that their fiat is being lessened down by the inflation. I think we all agree with that and they need to think of it as soon as they are seeing the rapid price increase of commodities. And another reason might be that, it's just that they are not fond of this type of investment and asset. They're the old traditionals that will keep themselves safe from the trouble of how highly volatile Bitcoin is and on how they only will rely to the old investments they know. I.E stocks, gold, etc.",

I agree with this but at least I still hold a little fiat for necessity.But at least there are assets stored in bitcoin in the long run, this can be a retirement fund or for children's education later.But many parents now still don't understand about bitcoin they are better off keeping the value mostly in gold.But the younger generation is more in bitcoin.",

      "body": "Yes, storing your capital in Bitcoin is certainly a great idea. Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, meaning that over time, in the long term, its price will rise. Therefore, you can simply ignore the volatility of the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin transactions are not censored. Currently, commercial banks do not so much help their customers with financial matters as they serve the interests of government financial regulators. A commercial bank can freeze your funds, but this will not happen with Bitcoin. No government can order Satoshi Nakamoto to impose financial and economic sanctions on certain Bitcoin users. However, storing Bitcoin and ensuring the safety of coins is a personal headache for the holder. He must be competent enough to keep his coins safe.",

Still, the best advice is to save funds you would not need urgently in BTC and a long term plan is often more rewarding than a short term savings plan where the funds may be liquidated or diversified.",

It is different from trading bitcoin which is BTC/USDT and others. This thread is about bitcoin in the spot market which is BTC/USDT and others and not about the derivative market which is not bitcoin but its derivatives.As for me, bitcoin is not gambling if you understand the market. There are time to buy which will be good for holders to take the opportunity. I see bitcoin more as a speculative asset. If you are able to speculate the market very well, you will not lose but make money from bitcoin holding.",

Small portfolio owners might prefer REITâ€™s since buying the whole property is pretty costly. If the size of the portfolio is over a million usd, then it makes more sense to buy a full property instead of buying its shares.Dealing with the tenants is not easy though. Also repairs&maintenance of the property is not cheap. RE sounds good on paper but it is not for everyone.",

Fiat is damn screwed ever since the banking system decided to flaw it by introducing notes as money against gold , silver and other precious stones we used back then as money. Saving in flat is something that has actually never been profitable since we switched to notes.People saving in fiat, are actually trapped in the context of interest when in the end inflation still puts them in losses.
