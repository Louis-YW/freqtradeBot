This will not mine bitcoin profitably. If you have good electricity that is constant and cheap, you can get yourself something like Bitmain Antminer like S19 pro or stronger one which will generate at least 100 th/s.",

You can check https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ipollo/v1h and edit ur electricity costs and see ur result. If you can say which coin you are exactly mining we might get a decent pool for you.",
