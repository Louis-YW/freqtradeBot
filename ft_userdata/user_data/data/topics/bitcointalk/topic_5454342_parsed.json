  "content": "I was looking around the bitcoincore.org website1 when I noticed this text towards the end of the web page: QuoteBitcoin Core is a community-driven free software project, released under the open source MIT license.It caught my attention because I understand what open source means, but I wanted to know why it was released under the MIT License. Why not other open source alternative licenses like the Apache License 2.0, Simplified BSD License, which are also popular choices?2,3Was this a suggestion from Satoshi?1 https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/2 https://www.saashub.com/mit-license-alternatives3 https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-mit-license/",

Let's suppose if the core was launched in public domain then wouldn't that be more decentralized because in that case no-one, not even the developers could have any control over it, and anyone could easily modify and add new features to it without any permission.I'm asking this just out of curiosity and truly I don't have much knowledge related to that stuff. I know something about the licenses like they provide permissions to anyone who wants to contribute to the code, or the developers who want to add some good features into the code, and in that case isn't public domain more permissive? I think the Creative Commons Zero license would be even more permissive and easy to use than the MIT one, and that license doesn't require the attribution to the original creator. If the reason was permissiveness then both public domain, and CC0 license would provide more freedom.",

MIT license is more common in software, while licenses such as the CC0 tend to be more in creative works. In addition, the MIT license requires a copyright notice in each of its future redistributions and therefore better for the programmer, especially if developing the code for free or being paid indirectly as it happens with some Bitcoin core developers.Quote from: SamReomo on May 29, 2023, 02:18:32 PMnot even the developers could have any control over it, and anyone could easily modify and add new features to it without any permission.You have to distinguish between Bitcoin, which is a protocol, and Bitcoin core, which is a full node program.",

I don't think there has been a lot of discussion about changing it. I have seen some discussions crop up now and then, but nobody really seems to care enough to put forth any kind of effort to change it.So the simple answer, getting rid of anything that has to do with non restrictive use, more restrictive use, less restrictive use, is purely inertia. It is there and it works, so it stays the way it is.From the department of...If it ain't broke, don't fix it....-Dave",

Simply put. Perhaps, Bitcoin core aims to communicate to its vast users that it is still simple to use or navigate and it doesn't need them(users) to also be bothered about new developments that may be of no meaningful concern as long as their coins are safe and transactions are secured.MIT also has a good reputation. I don't think it really matters if it is Apache 2.0 license or Simplified BSD license. What matters is it works as it should!",

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on May 30, 2023, 10:27:53 AMOn other hand, no license could provide adequate protection when the law is partially broken or court don't care about copyleft.That's true, but brokenness never comes in an absolute form, it's always in some degree.  Better, more comprehensive terms would allow overcoming a greater degree of brokenness.In any case, the MIT terms I think are generally pretty good. In hindsight I can see ways they could be improved, but even though they failed to get us a summary dismissal (which means they failed their primary purpose) very happy to have them over having nothing at all.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on May 30, 2023, 10:27:53 AMWhat exactly do you mean by \"apache 2.0 in parallel\"? Is it similar with dual licensing where company/individual provide different license for different kind of user (e.g. GPL for most people and specific closed-source license for company)?Right.  The vulnerability of concern there is that there is a risk some contributors could maliciously submit patent encumbered submissions without disclosing it then litigate against users.  They'd be countered on the basis of that their actions were misconduct ('cause they induced the infringement) and that the MIT license is an implied patent grant ('cause it gives you permission to USE etc, which you can't do without access to whatever patents there are),  but it would be easier to get a vexatious lawsuit dismissed if the contributors all had to agree to make their work available under an explicit patent grant (in addition to the MIT license).The normal review process is inadequate because in the US patentees have a year after publication to file a patent and then there is some additional time for the patent application to be made public (and good luck finding it), so it's literally impossible for review alone to close the risk of that kind of attack. (Though I've previously advocated that consensus change proposals be substantially available for at least a year before activation to that it's at least theoretically possible to do a clearance search, if impractical).Unfortunately even a parallel license with an explicit grant isn't sufficient, since a truly malicious party could make the infringing submissions through some anonymous sockpuppet account... but it at least might help in the case of a confused/misaligned employer or a situation where someone decides to go evil after the fact.",
