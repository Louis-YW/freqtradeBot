  "content": "Tuchel was sacked on Wednesday morning after being called to a meeting at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground at around 9.30am, following the previous night’s Champions League defeat to Dinamo Zagreb.It is understood that Tuchel, who met Boehly and Eghbali face-to-face, was surprised by the news, but reacted calmly and just minutes after the meeting ended Chelsea confirmed his dismissal in a statement. His coaches Arno Michels and Zsolt Low also left.Chelsea’s shocked players were informed via text messages and gathered at Cobham before their scheduled 2pm training session that was taken by coach Anthony Barry, head coach of the development squad Mark Robinson and loan player technical coach Andy Myers.It is understood that Boehly and Eghbali addressed the playing squad and offered to answer any questions before travelling into London to meet with Potter and his representatives.www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/09/07/thomas-tuchel-sacked-chelsea-owner-todd-boehly/For a man who had immensely contributed to the growth of Chelsea, I think the decision to sack him was quite harsh. This is a man who took them to world club cup and brought home the trophy. Yea, it's true some players complained about his style which they weren't comfortable anymore with, but the board could have first called him to order in a cordial way, instead of just dismissing him in such inhumane manner as if he was a mistake from the beginning. Well this is my thought though, what's your take?",
