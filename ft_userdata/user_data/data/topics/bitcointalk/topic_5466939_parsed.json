  "content": "About a week ago, I received an alert on my iPhone indicating a potential data leak involving Cloudbet casino account credentials. The concerning part is that the email account linked to my Cloudbet registration was exclusively created for this purpose, so there's no chance of it being compromised elsewhere. While it's possible this might be a false positive, I'm taking this matter seriously.Has anyone else experienced a similar alert or issue with Cloudbet's security? I want to ensure the safety of my data, especially since Cloudbet holds a Curacao gambling license, which doesn't inspire the highest confidence in terms of player protection. If indeed there has been a breach, does anyone know if there's a legal recourse against Cloudbet for this situation? From what I've read online, it seems that the Curacao gambling license they hold doesn't necessarily translate to robust player protection or responsive support. Frankly, had I been aware of the issues surrounding Curacao licenses and the potential for crime to thrive on their platforms, I would have never used this service.Your insights are greatly appreciated.",

      "body": "Sometimes someone can never really be careful enough. I don't use Cloudbet Casino, but I make use of other platforms and casinos, not often but once in a while. I have also had situations where I happen to receive an email that turns out to be a scam, and this email was only supposed to be for a particular platform, which made me wonder about the security of that platform, but it appears that there was nothing of any kind of news from the platform about any data bridge or so, and I only found a few people complaining about the same issue.Â Coming back to your case, I just made a quick search around their social media handles, and there has not been any form of them talking about data leakage or something about any hack attack, so it might be true that they might be bridged without their concept, or there is a possibility that email scrappers might have used tools of some kind to get your email out of the casino without their notice, or you yourself might have also mistakenly placed the email somewhere else unknowingly to you that that was the exact email you used.If you know the kind of emails you expect for a specific mail box, when you get unexpected ones, it is best for you to ignore them, as it has already been proven that there are higher chances of it being a scam email.",

So it's not peculiar it's just how competition works in any industry.As for their breach or what really happen to them, we really don't know unless they acknowledge it, simply as that.Or more customers coming out and telling us about the said leak.",

I'm not familiar with the iPhone thingy (never used one), but I reckon they just used a large text file of hacked passwords then hashed it and checked if it matched your account (wait isn't that basically brute forcing and illegal?). I reckon you can just change your account password imo. In reference to Curacao, I've done my fair bit in the past and they're bad, yes but reputable nonetheless (I still have no idea how that happened). In case of breaches like this though, I don't think Curacao has any intensive background checks on casinos under their license, they're usually just submissions of legal documents and permits plus some reputation checks. Not necessarily the best place I'd use as a reference if a site is data secure or not.",

It's like they are passing this warning to all online casinos, I read somewhere on my phone where they said...The Cloudbet spokesperson continues: âWe are firm believers that crypto is pioneering an exciting new world of financial freedom, and that gaming and betting can help lead that effort.âBut we also believe that in order for us to realise that world, we have to put security at the front line of crypto.âNo matter how flashy and glamorous the Premier League is, players arenât safe to play without some very serious on-field security.â As per my deep research, I haven't seen a single complain about the Cloudbet platform, it does seem like they take security issues very serious, I think the only way for online casinos to be ahead of hackers is to always revisit their security measures, this is also why Binance security is very strong,Â  always update and add more measures to the system, if you rely on your security and failed to check always, you won't know when hackers will find a vulnerable door. Back to the issue OP is facing, not all alarming notifications are real, so be careful with them, scammers can send you notification that there is some data leak and you are hereby given a link to update your information...Find out the real CloudBet email address, get in touch with the team to verify before even clicking on any links, most times, scammers send all various of bad emails to your inbox, be careful with emails.",

No, this kind thread will not reduce or destroy Couldbet's reputation because this non sense accusation where the @OP has no proof if Cloudbet really got hacked. He accuse Cloudbet because he get notification if the password has a potential data leak, when we're don't know everything that the @OP use his phone. If he click a random link, visiting http site, claiming airdrop, joining a bounty or anything that not safe, that was the cause, not because Cloudbet got hacked.",
