And that git me interested and I want to know more about crypto and now I am here and I making post 😁i heard about bitcoin for the very first time when I driving my car back to my home from university and in the radio between songs, the presenter began to joke about bitcoin. Something like that:\"will you believe? Someone made up their money, called it bitcoin. The funniest thing is that their price has exceeded that of the dollar. What an absurdity.\"Yep. That day bitcoin broke 1$. I did nothing ... I was too focused on parties and girls.I accepted the narrative of the presenter that it is actually absurd that someone even wants to have money invented by someone, most likely centralized. Next time I heard about bitcoin was in 2017 after it broke 10 000$ and thats when I bought it for the first time.",

It was then that I was really interested in it, but I stopped at installing a wallet and then I never bought btc. Now I consider it one of my mistakes, because I didn't complete the work I started and there was a great opportunity to buy cheap bitcoin. Before 2016, I also heard about btc, but didn't attach any importance to this, not knowing anything about the technology and not understanding the possibilities that btc gives.",

I heard about bitcoin in January 2019, At that time the price is about $4,000 I bought a bit, then sent it to my own wallet until June 2019 I sold it for $11,000. I still regret why I sold it.

I think you don't need to regret selling bitcoin at that time because we are looking for profit here and you got pretty good return that bitcoin gives. Past mistakes will be lessons for us in the future, so there's no need to regret the past. If you don't want to regret again then now is your chance and all of us, buy bitcoin now and plan for the future to sell only when the set goal is reached. I got into the market very early myself but I also sold out of my bitcoins during bear season 2018 it was a really unfortunate time but it was a lesson for me when I got back into the market in 2020.",

First time I know with bitcoin is not investment way but only used for digital currency I used for investing in many kind of hype project, after another digital currency like PayPal banned using for deposit fund in hype project I move to other currency is Bitcoin.I don't know about Bitcoin is the best way for investing but after price pump drastically give motivation to make Bitcoin as investment assets not only using for digital currency joining with hype project. Not in my minds with Bitcoin can reach until higher price when first time I know with bitcoin still have lower price under $1,000.",

But will it be like this after 6 years? Of course not.And still there are many people who don't know about Bitcoin. 6 years from now when they learn about bitcoin they will regret learning about bitcoin 6 years ago just like you.
