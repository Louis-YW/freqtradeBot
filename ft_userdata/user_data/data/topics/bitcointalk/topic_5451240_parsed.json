This marks a significant milestone for our project, and we couldn't have done it without the support of our dedicated community.To celebrate this occasion, we will be launching a series of events and activities. Firstly, we will be hosting an invite contest on our Discord channel, with rewards for the first three users who bring in the most new members. The rewards will be 10,000 CRNC, 8,000 CRNC, and 5,000 CRNC, respectively. The contest will run for one week, starting from today.Secondly, we will also be launching an art contest for our community members to design the Crionic-Coin icon. The winner will be selected by the community and will receive a reward of 50,000 CRNC, with the second and third place receiving 20,000 CRNC and 10,000 CRNC, respectively. The contest will run for two weeks, starting from today.We encourage all members of the community to participate in these events and help us celebrate this important milestone.
