  "content": "QuoteBinance and its related entities have purposefully evaded regulators, moved assets to criminals and sanctions evaders, and hidden basic financial information from its customers and the public.It all started with this statement from the U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Roger Marshall (R-KS). They have very high doubt that Binance is one of the exchanger associated with malpractices and is funding the accounts of Criminals as well as those who fled the sanctions imposed by U.S. on them This is definitely one of the serious allegations on the world's most popular Crypto Exchanger. It is likely that it can cause negative impact on the crypto industry if this news came to be true and if Binance found guilty then it could damage the crypto space heavily. To prove these allegations U.S. senator has sent a letter to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and BAM Trading Services CEO Brian Shroder.They have asked for all balance sheets starting from year 2017 until now so that it can be audited and checked for any doubtful practices that are underway. The implications gonna be worst if this is proven. QuoteU.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Roger Marshall (R-KS) sent a letter to Binance and Binance US on Wednesday, calling for the crypto exchanges to “provide transparency about potentially illegal business practices.”The letter, addressed to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and BAM Trading Services CEO Brian Shroder, asks for documents and answers concerning each crypto exchange’s “finances, risk management, and regulatory compliance as it faces investigations into potential crimes,” the senators detailed. Binance and its U.S. affiliate, Binance US, are two separate entities. BAM Trading Services is doing business as Binance US.“Your actions have called into question the legitimacy of your business and the safety of your customers’ assets and raised concerns about the potential impact of these activities on the stability of the crypto market and the broader financial system,” the senators stressed.The letter also notes that Binance hired French auditing firm Mazars to perform a proof-of-reserves (POR) audit on its bitcoin holdings. However, the auditing firm subsequently “deleted the webpage containing the report” and paused its activity relating to proof-of-reserves audits for crypto firms, the letter adds.The senators concluded their letter by requesting “documents and answers” pertaining to a list of questions no later than March 16. The documents requested by the lawmakers include “complete copies of all Binance and Binance subsidiary balance sheets from 2017 to the present,” and their internal anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), and know-your-customer (KYC) policies and procedures.A copy of the senators’ letter was sent to Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Rostin Behnam, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); and Merrick B. Garland, U.S. Attorney General with the Department of Justice (DOJ).US Senators Probe Crypto Exchange Binance About 'Potentially Illegal Business Practices'",

These old dinasours do not have a single clue about how binance works and I bet my money that they are just \"advised\" by someone to say these things, and \"studied\" the reports that were given to them without having any personal understanding if everything. Of course there is a possibility that a criminal person could get away with using Binance if they know what they are doing, but not with Binances acceptance that is, it would not be possible. They just have no idea what they are talking about and trying to make noise, that's it.",

They did not.US officials link North Korean Lazarus hackers to $625M Axie Infinity crypto theftKYC is to get our identity documents and we lost those documents forever.KYC is to control sheeps, it is not to control wolves (and can not).",

What is the extent of information that they can access? Meaning, can they form an investigation committee from third parties, or will all that happen is that they will request data from users? Also, Binance Exchanger is a global company, so what data can the United States have access to?In general, I hope that the end of the company will not be chaotic, but rather some fines.",

Meaning, can they form an investigation committee from third parties, or will all that happen is that they will request data from users? No, they aren't in their current form, there was a previous case when they demand miners in the BMC group the numbers of the electricity they claim to use and the renewables partThey all went crickets as they knew it was going to be bad for them if they answered it.So no, Binance can do the same or answer with something that has no further implications, the usual mumbo jumbo!As for an investigation committee, yeah they can do that even now, nothing is stopping them but they need political support for it to actually do something meaningful.Quote from: hugeblack on March 04, 2023, 09:33:27 AMAlso, Binance Exchanger is a global company, so what data can the United States have access to?Being global or as CZ calls it, decentralized means nothing really to the US, yeah Binance can ignore requests from Toga or Madagascar but depending on what they find out from the investigation and how much they really want to bring it down you will pretty soon see a change in CZ's attitude and willingness to share everything with the feds.",

And we all have seen what the DoJ can do, even overseas, like BitMex.",

The women who said that she was native American and turned out she wasn't? The women who Bernie Sanders said should run for president in 2015 and then again in 2020 she said Bernie doesn't want women to run for presidency? The same Bernie who had a woman running mate? Elizabeth Warren who turned from Republican (family still republican) into Democrat to get more votes based on the votes of where she lived? Realizing it is more likely to be voted in if she lists as Democrat?I know that there are some corrupt and bad officials in governments, and elected officials should not be trusted, but she certainly takes the cake, should be ignored even if she says 2+2 equals 4.",
