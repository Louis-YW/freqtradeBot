  "content": "The altcoins market have witnessed alot of hype, wave and different trends and one of the popular among those trends in the last year is the Non-fugitive tokens (NFTs), which promises to give content creators the right of the owner of their work on the blockchain which right is transferable, this hyp created al9t of noise within and outside the cryptocurrency communitie.But also, just like every ofher hypes, that have happened in the market,  there have been alot of failures, exit scams and alot of ofher unhealthy situations that have lead to investors lost of money, and at this point any NFTs that want to gain promotion and visibility must first ascribe to a popular figure and this time, the Ai Baser former Manchester united player and world football legends, Cristiano Ronaldo, have been cught up in the web of crisis as the NFT he promoted to investors have failed to attain success and those aggrieved investors have approach the xourt and decided to get the player sued for promoting what they call investment failure.This lead me to ask the question of that the extent of Crustiano Ronaldo involvement un the NFT project, us he a part of the Directors or he just promited the project.But then also whichever ways, i hope cristiano Renaldo is having a good laywer to stand in for him.What are you take in all of this situation.",

The thing there was, that you buy when it started and sell when you see the trend going more up. That has been the Altcoin-Way of Life. If the trend dies off, you will completely lose it almost all.",

If the trend dies off, you will completely lose it almost all.Taking such baseless moves as an investors is likely due to igborants and greed, because none is expected to take NFT investment for long term investment,  but in this case, the NFT CR7 promoted made a promise of reaching a certain amount in value when launched, reason why some gullible investors falled for that trick, but then also the project never even get close to the speculated price but rather it fall back to below bought price which is what triggered the investors anger.But sure if the player role is just advertisement and he has a disclaimer then he may be safe after a long period of legal tussles, but if he is member of the team or afffiluated to the prihect beyong just promotion, then there will be more for him innthe comming days when the trials will fully start.",

It was so stupid when they have decided to take the risk by buying ronaldo's NFT but it was dumped so hard. Ronaldo was not making mistake here but it's pure the stupidity from the NFT buyers who didn't even know the risk before try to buy the asset. Were they expecting their NFT to increase a thousand times? Those stupid NFT buyers shall try to use their mind better. Their allegations toward ronaldo were really stupid. The court will not even try to take a look at that allegation. This is why DYOR was a must to avoid more people become so stupid coz they were investing their money on the risky asset. There may be another stupid investor to appear. Spending 77 bucks and demanding 1 billion.     Im sure court is going to laugh.",

Projects like these should provide accurate information and not make promises that cannot be fulfilled.In the case of Ronaldo, he is protected if he is just a promoter with a disclaimer however, if he has a deep connection to this project, that poses a significant challenge for him.",

Why don't they sue the US government over the management of dollars, which I use more than anything else we know of that has material value?

However, the scope of this case of Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be estimated so far, but his case will be heard soon.",

This celebrities are business people, if you can afford their fees then they can advertise your underwear for you. I'm sure that when the fans that sued Christiano Ronaldo, goes to Court, they'll surely show them a disclaimer where the superstar is absorbed of any blames if his endorsement doesn't go as expected.On the other hand it'll still be good if our celebrities will understand the risks involved in whatever they're endorsing, because their fans will buy the products just because their idol has endorsed it. It is possible that Ronaldo, doesn't understand the risks involved in cryoto investments, especially if it's not bitcoin, I hope this is a lesson to him to choose wisely before endorsing any other products.",

Elon Musk should teach Ronaldo how to run the crypto market because the multitude will only go for the trends and leave the price actions. Cristiano Ronaldo is a popular footballer and also an acknowledged figure in the world, for not just football but also in variety of important sectors. Unfortunately he didn't study enough about his project, Ronaldo failed NFT project have cost top whales and companies to record heavy loss which is absolutely not the plan he intended.",

When investing in most of this projects, there is always a disclaimer most especially on all exchanges including binance about the risks involved in investing in such coins. If there was such disclaimer which I’m sure there was for them, this lawsuit will be disregarded. Cristiano Ronaldo is a great public figure, they might want to make him repay them for their loss since he has the money for that but this doesn’t concern him at all, and a lawyer will stand for him and win this case.
