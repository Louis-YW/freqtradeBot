This is because Satoshi lacked the foresight to realize that if Bitcoin got big (which it did), then maybe the mining should be put to good use.

Right now, Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are shitcoins because they have mining algorithms that were never designed to advance science and this is because the cryptocurrency sector is really shitty.

There would be an increase in revenue that would make mining more affordable and attract more mining capacity. The result would be an increase in the difficulty equivalent to the additional value accessed by miners.In the end, the waste would not change and any value extracted from mining would have a cost equal to its value, and so there would be no net benefit.Here's a simple example.Suppose the block reward is 10 bitcoins and the cost of mining a block approaches 10 bitcoins, the value of the block reward (that's how the economics of mining works). In this case, energy worth 10 bitcoins is wasted.Now, suppose that the results from mining a block produces some kind of scientific value that the miner could sell for 1 bitcoin. Due to economic incentives, miners would then increase their capacity until the cost of mining approaches 11 bitcoins because the extra 1 bitcoin of revenue allows them to break even at that cost. Now, energy worth 10 bitcoins is still wasted and the scientific value costs miners 1 bitcoin.My belief is that the only way a mining algorithm that produces something of value could reduce waste would be to produce a public good. However, it is not clear that public goods actually exist.",

And op, I think speaking rashly about bitcoins in this forum will not help matters instead it will spike reaction. Many person have thought about same issue and you and I know it very well that bitcoins developers are still working tirelessly to see how they can improve mining algorithm. If bitcoins has maintain a good name and a high level of security standard with no incident of any bridging since it's creation, we must appreciate this great effort and look forward a better system.",

If you have a serious proposal just try to spread your message across the miners and developers and try to convince them. Such proposal might get accepted, if we have consensus. Insulting the entire community doesn't help.If you want crypto mining to be used for science, then why don't you create your own \"science coin\", where the mining algorithm will be used for scientific purposes?",
