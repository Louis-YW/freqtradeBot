I recently went to the bank to demand for my statement of account for a year due to some personal reasons.I was shocked on how often I recharge from my bank account. Over 70% of the transaction I did was on phone recharge. Then I asked myself \"if I'm to buy recharge cards in a store, can I buy as much as this within a year\"? The answer here is NO. This means I would have saved more if I buy directly from a store. Alot of people have similar issue. Buying recharge card directly from your bank using USSD look simple but may affect your savings if no concrete budget is made for your monthly earnings. This will make you load card unnecessarily and therefore will increase your SMS monthly charges by your bank. This SMS charges may be small but is something for an average man after accumulating over time.CONCLUSIONIt is highly convenience to recharge airtime from your bank account using USSD even in the midnight in as much as possible you have money in your account and you have enrol for USSD transaction on your phone but this isn't an healthy measure for your saving as it enable you to make some unnecessary recharge especially when talking with love ones. Instead of been brief with your discussion when you observed you are out of airtime, you will rather keep talking and buy more airtime from your bank after exhausting the recent airtime. It's advisable to get recharge card from a store than buying using USSD from your bank account.",

It is a feature that saves some percentage of money from your total money anytime you spend from your account. It is a good way to save money because it promotes savings. Your inability to save money and obsessed with buying airtime from your account is because of lack of plan for it. Everything needs proper planing and if you don’t engage in one, your money will crumble with time without giving an account for it..",

It's advisable to get recharge card from a store than buying using USSD from your bank account.Well, for me; recharging or not recharging from your bank is not the problem. Inasmuch as your money is left in the bank, there's no way you won't get access to your money it's just that if you stop using USSD or mobile app, it will only reduce your ability to get access to your account easily but it doesn't mean that your money will be safe because their are still people that any day you go to bank you will still see them. The only way one can stop habits that will affect our savings is to learn a good savings standard, like one needs to be discipline not every little thing you go to bank or you use your phone to make transactions as without discipline it cannot be easy to achieve good results not only in savings lifestyle but also in whichever businesses one is doing.Another factor that one can emulate in other to inhibit factors that might affect one's savings is to open a fixed deposit account; this factor is very important for any individual that wants to develop a good savings lifestyle because in fix deposit, you won't be able to get access to your account till a day that you've agreed with the bank to start making withdrawals.Again giving loans to trusted individuals or banks is another way not to make our savings accessible to us, because when you give out loans the money won't be in your custody anymore till an agreed date that the money would be refunded. This is a very good factor because most times in giving out a loan, an interest is involved so during the duration by which the money would be paid you will get the higher amount of what is loan out so if you loan out your money to a trusted person, organization or bank is the best choice is learning a good savings habit.",

If he want to save money it should be in his bank account and some portion of it should be transferred to opay account for data and call card to reduce changes from local bank.  Because to every transaction made there is always a tendency for incure charges. Apart from the 3 naira cash back given to customers at 100naira I also think there is always a daily bonus of 4naira which can be accumulated to use as incurred charges. Which can never affect your savings. Try opay and spot the difference.",

Well, it is called cash-back, both in transactions and other stuff like bill payment, you will be given cash back. It is a good resource for doing any of those transactions.But for transactions, if you have used your opay account for a long time, then your free transactions will be limited, just like 5 free transactions per day, but since I am using it, I haven't transacted more than 5 per day, so I am enjoying the free transfer till date. Lastly, the only way that they will be deducting a small amount of money from your account is when you have activated SMS alert, card alert (that's if you have the card), transfer or withdraw alert. Maybe N2 or N3 will be deducted from each SMS.",

It is adviceable that you have a separate account you do not have easy access to, your savings should be there. Fixed deposit accounts or better still invest in a profitable venture and watch your savings multiply.For your daily online transactions, you can patronize fintech companies like opay, Moniepoint, Capricorn and the rest of them where you are given rewards and commisions for every transaction you do with them. These fintech companies have mobile applications which are user friendly with little or sometimes no transaction charges.

As a smart person your savings and money meant for spending shoudn't be in the same account. Your recharge card money no supposed affect your savings because the money no big normally and the watching of your calls no just dey necessary like dat when you plan well. What if you be business person and those calls are needed. Wetin you go talk na the sms charge wey if you dey use microfinance banks like OPAY, you go fit deactivate am so e no go dey charge you for the message as Opay already sends you email notifications and pop up notification on the app so the sms dem no too dey necessary. No use one account keep all your money, you fit use our traditional banks for keeping of emergency funds and microfinance banks for spending and na there the recharge cards go dey come from.QuoteConclusion: It's advisable to get recharge card from a store than buying using USSD from your bank account.You wan just suffer yourself, dem dey bring technological advancement and you wan take yourself backwards. So because you no fit control yourself you think say suffering yourself is the solution. If you value your time, you no go dey make unnecessarily calls because time is money and when speaking with love ones I no go call that one unnecessarily calls as life is short and we should spend time with our love ones more because tomorrow isn't guaranteed. The Koko be say the world is moving forward so we supposed follow them too and not still going manual. Just develop a good habit and you'll be able to overcome wasting money on recharge cards.",

I believe banks charge around $200 each month, depending on how you conduct business with them.Let me say if you load a recharge card with 1000# he will take you a month and you will communicate with your love once if it is just for greeting and some are use to speak through social media technologies have made everything easier for us to communicate with each other except you decide to make it difficult for you so don't say because of the bank charges he will affect your savings budget and how dey go generate revenues and make profit i don't see anything wrong with that and you keep your money with them since the bank is the finest savings place where you won't have to worry because whenever you need your money back, you will get it without any difficulties and even online banking now charges you with a small interest if you perform too many transfers per day.",

However, saying that the charges removed for USSD will be a lot of money at the end of the day, if I think you are still using the local way of transacting with your bank, why don’t you use the mobile app?

No, mate, you just need discipline and a plan on how to spend your money, and you will be able to save money. The money spent on recharge is just the way we discuss it with people on the phone.

Many stores are no longer in the business of selling airtime because they know that people now recharge more from their bank accounts, so before you fit see shop wey dey sell recharge card theses days you go waka well well. In some residential areas as well, there are no small shops. Technology is advancing and you should not try to remain backward because you think you are spending more. Rather than deciding to be against technology, try to learn how to plan and control yourself make you nor dey over recharge unnecessarily. You still fit try to use whatsapp call for some kind people and long conversation make you reduce money for airtime.",

This is just why a fund saving box does not require an opening to avoid extracting of already inputted fund unless the box is broken but supposen to be at when one has reached a durational target such may be annually, monthly or weekly. Basically depends on ones plans. At a time, I considered that activating my mobile App or USSD would grease my reckless spendings because I could be offered those self financial service transactions that is possibly to unnecessity but as earlier self awareness, I could take caution to self control to sn extend.Imagine being on the YouTube or Netflix just for fun and you runs out of data and you have some money in your account. Nomatter what the money was in your bank account is budgeted for, it would take just courage not to temper the money as long the fun was interesting and was unsatisfied. And gradually you are ignorantly spending your money unnecessarily on facts that may not bring you valuable increments.Some silly Nigerians in the social media would say... \"You are out of the world without data\" and some says... \"I would even have my last card to get data\" all buttressed to having just fun in the internet.And unconsciously, this system of purchasing airtime with mobile networks is enticing to relax and  chills beyond unnecessary measures relying on data or airtime subscriptions.It is also triggered to unnecessary charity giveaways.Hence, if one can take adequate conciousness to expenses, then it is a good service because it helps run an individual cashless policy where your expenses would be  minimally economized because the more the cash at hand is inspired to more unwarranted expenses and also would save you the additional certain charges the physical purchases would charge you on the basis of using inflations as an excuse.",

Because I never hear about this one before. You buy from bank or you buy from shop na still money you go use. But let's just consider the stress, going out just to buy Airtime outside lol, why not buy from your bank instead. You spending 70% of your money on data that one na normal sha, everybody make use of the Internet always and now data no dey last again but now you're talking about Airtime for calls that one na wahala oh, now hardly people make calls even business people prefer to chat online. I don't see how buying airtime from the bank affects our savings. But most people cannot control themselves, I will support the opay method cause each time I buy Airtime from my opay I get a cash back in return",
