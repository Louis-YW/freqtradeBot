      "body": "I think Bitcoin is pulling the coins. Some are performing really well and some are those which are thinking to perform. And if Bitcoin will stable for some time so we will see some more moves. Regarding syscoin volume increased and value increased. So this is the market and we can see any pump or any dump at anytime. Low cap coins can trade in the top trading coins. And top trading coins can be in the list of low cap coins. If Bitcoin move up more which I think it will move. So I hope the other Altcoins including syscoin will perform well and I hope syscoin can go %100 percent from current value.",
