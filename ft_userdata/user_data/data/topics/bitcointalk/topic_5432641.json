  "content": "As a parent, of course I want the best for my child's future. But we need to realize and understand that there are phases in the development of our children.teaching financial management, Bitcoin and Crypto to our children is a great thing if it is taught at the right time or phase. and certainly not by coercion or pressure.There are 4 important phases that we must know in children's education.1. phase of play, freedom (live like a king).This phase ranges from 0-6 years of age. and it is in this phase that the growth and development of the brain dominates. Emotions are also more studied in this phase. and in this phase we as parents have to praise and pamper children more lovingly. let children play and imagine freely. because this phase is an important phase in brain development and also an important phase in developing golden potential for children. things that need to be avoided in this phase are yelling at the child loudly, shocking the child is also strictly prohibited in this phase because it is fatal in inhibiting the neuron cells that are developing very rapidly in the child's brain and will make the child's potential become hampered or even extinguished or suppressed . so that when an adult the child will be very difficult to develop their own potential. what we can teach in this phase is to provide games that are interesting but contain educational and creative elements to stimulate the growth and development of children's intelligence.2. Phase in the introduction of discipline and responsibility.This phase is at the age of 7-14 years. So maybe it's at phass that we can start teaching children about money management. such as setting an example to children about saving. But it must be done slowly but consistently. We as parents must set a good example. and maybe a little hard on children at this age a little bit is allowed. because in this phase is the phase in the formation of our child's personality. so we have to really make children know a responsibility and discipline in life. and if we spoil children too much during this phase, it will actually make your child a child with a weak personality. in this phase also our children must be informed about what obligations they have to do. telling children about building a future and pursuing an ideal during this phase can be a motivation for them. and we tell them where the best places to save are. Introducing investment and crypto can also be started in this phase and of course at the level of basic knowledge.3. The phase of building relationships with children (becoming friends for our children)This phase is at the age of 15-21 years. well, in this phase we have to be more able to build relationships with children like friends. so that our children remain comfortable to talk to us. and the child keeps asking for solutions and discussing with us every time he gets a problem. and we must attach importance to rationality at this stage. we give advice like a friend as well as a parent. if we are too hard in this phase it will actually make our children close to us and even our children will prefer to confide in their friends rather than us. maybe in this phase we can introduce our children to our investments and all about crypto and bitcoin that we have learned so far. because of course at this age they will need this knowledge. 4. Phase of Freedom, Independence and trust. In this phase our child is an adult and let him become an independent person and be able to solve his problems independently. But our advice is still needed for our children. be it moral advice, life or financial advice.References and basic sources of thought : Klikpsikolog.com",

If we follow this phase we will be alienated to our kids since this thing will take us 15 years before we build a relationship with our kids which is I think too late.  Relationship building must starts at an early age.  It is where we should get our kids' trust.  Maybe there are lots of parents who follow this instruction reason why many parents and children did not establish a good relationship.I also think that this is the right time to introduce financial learning.  Since in this age bracket, children somehow will understand how the economy works if thought.  This is the best age bracket for Bitcoin learning, may it be technical or economical.  So teaching kids about BTC earlier than this age bracket would be a waste of time IMO.Quote from: Merit.s on January 01, 2023, 09:10:51 PMWe should teach them at the second stage because at that stage they can buy chocolates snacks and even rum errands, to make them understand that there is a digital currency known as bitcoin,this will help them know quick about bitcoin in other to join the moving train when it is the  right time for them.

I learnt a lot whe.i was about 13 but couldn't handle things like the number systems until much later (I did an advanced physics course when I was 17 and students were still having issues with that too so that could still be too young unless you've got a good way to teach them).Quote from: Fundamentals Of on January 02, 2023, 02:15:37 AMAs a child I think I first learned about money by observation.

Yes of course, parents and teachers are also there for the guidance. But I guess many of us probably encountered money even before we went to school, even before we were good in numbers. Those games like when a friend acts as a store cashier and somebody buys some stuff using leaves as money and we also give change are like practical games. That's what's going to happen in real life. We just have to learn some math and that's it.",

But I don't think it's reasonable to introduce bitcoin at this stage, they need knowledge about life, basic knowledge in school more than making money. If you just direct them to earn bitcoins, make money, they will surely neglect their studies and may drop out to earn money. I just need my child to grow up and have the necessary knowledge, he can do whatever he wants, and as long as he has passion, any job can make money and become rich.

Let him start from the lowest and start climbing up and then let him join me to start a business together and then accept BTC payment. This is my plan when my kid is at the right age already.

In my opinion, you write complete nonsense and I just could not restrain myself from answering you.My conclusion is that you are very poor and had a difficult childhood. Because my children, although they have long passed the age of babies, still do not know the price of clothes and toys and do not know the word \"savings\".When I see posts like this, I just feel sorry for those children whose parents are depriving them of their greatest wealth. Namely, their childhood. All other little things, like bitcoin and money, will come as soon as the time of growing up comes. In the meantime, this is the formation of the psyche for life.",
