Those 5 years were incredible, made a lot of new anonymous friends (and less enemies), a lot of fun times, had a lot of fun chasing the spammies and manage to reach legendary rank!Thank you theymos (and the team) for keeping this amazing world alive and holding it strong together for so many years!I hope the next 5 years will be full with the same excitement! Thank you friends!! With love,TBB",

Thank you friends!! With love,TBB Congrats. Nice to see a member I'm older than having a higher forum rank than me. But I wonder, which would you rather have, the power to control Bitcoin price and do other interesting things or a higher forum rank and merit?",
