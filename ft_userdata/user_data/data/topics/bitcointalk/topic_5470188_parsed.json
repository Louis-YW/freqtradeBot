As the newbies rank higher, he will not experience that again. I think this applies to you also. If you start to be more active and rank higher, you will not see it again.",

This shows that I access sites that are not secure, this I believe might be detrimental to me in the long run. My question is what does the forum consider a suspicious link?What link are we talking about? If you believe that website is safe and shouldn't be tagged as suspicious link then you can report it here, post a non-clickable (e.g add spaces) or put it in a code tag.It can happen, recently links to CNBC website were being tagged as suspicious and theymos fixed it. Is CNBC blocked on Bitcointalk?Quote from: She shining on October 13, 2023, 11:36:40 AMHow can I tell if a site is suspicious?Assistance on sites I can gain information that ain't suspicious.I tried searching for a thread on the topic but couldn't find any via Google search engine.Thanks for the assistance.Regarding your question on how to check information about the website, simple answer is no you can't Still there some free website which can check and can guide if the website is spreading any malware or is it a scam website etc.But again there's no guarantee that you can trust any of the site for 100% surety. Usually antiviruses keep track of such malicious sites which helps to tag or remove links.Code:https://www.ssltrust.com.au/https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/https://www.scamadviser.com/https://www.urlvoid.com/",

I am going to mention that thread here. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470215.msg62990137#msg62990137 you should check it out and share your queries there too if any. I hope this topic will help you. Besides that, I would suggest you to not fully trust those websites results and take them for granted because those websites are also hackable and are vulnerable to attacks and who knows the data they are showing will not be tampered. In easy words, you have to be careful from your end how, follow the simple tricks that the mentioned thread's op have wrote in the last of that topic. And I do understand you are talking about links which are tagged as suspecious on this forum, well, sometime ago, I read some topics in which the CNBC links are tagged as suspecious but as ShahzadAfzal said it has been solved by theymos.If you would provide some more details like the specific ones, then I might be able to help you more specifically. Like maybe you can share the screenshots.",

Although I'd say that the average user in this forum is more educated that in social media and, why not, other forums, especially if we talk about cryptos, there are still many untrustworthy users who spam or directly spread straight scams. And taking into account that there are also many newbies that have to be protected (and not so newbies, because all of us can fall in such traps eventually), the little struggles are justified by the security in these particular cases.",

Your rank is of Jr Member which is why the mods would remove such links without any hesitation. When you improve your rank and become a full member or above, the mods will look into the links and then decide. Our forum does not have an algorithm that decides which link is safe and which link is bad. We are a community where every user has the right to make a decision whether to report a link to the mods or not. My advice to you would be to first work on your rank and then think about posting external links here.",
