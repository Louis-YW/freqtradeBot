  "content": "Greetings, I am pleased to announce the launch of Lottocryptos.com, a multi crypto lotteries website. Its use is anonymous and it supports multiple cryptos and languages. And it will be further expanded in the future.How does it work:- To participate, players just have to select the crypto they want and send their coins.- Once the transaction is verified, the player will be assigned a range of numbers for their participation based on the verification order.- The draws will be held on Sundays at 23:30 UTC, where a random number will be selected. The winner being the one whose range of participation numbers is included in the winning number.- The prize will consist of everything purchased by the players minus a commission as service and transaction costs (between 1% and 4% maximum, although it could be reduced in the future).- The prize will be sent to the winning wallet address.To know more details I invite you all to visit the website.HOME Thanks.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:How is the winning number generated?Recently, as it was suggested to me, I have recently implemented a \"Provably Fair\" system for random number generation. With this the winning number at the end of the lottery can be predicted.How the winning number is generatedExampleWhy the website has this design?The website has been designed from scratch and there is no desire to use third party libraries. The reasons are:- Efficiency, the website loads very fast and is lightweight. Link- Security, I have seen many sites designed with Wordpress or Joomla hacked due to a template or plugin with security issues. Security is important. Link- Time, being a design from scratch is not very developed, as time passes it will improve but without compromising efficiency or security.Regarding the look and feel, it's just a personal preference, I like the Windows look and feel of the late 90's and early 20th century, for it's ease of reading. I also like the gray and blue tones in the theme to give it a business and serious look.Why can it take 48 hours to pay?The cryptocurrency world is not perfect, there can be 51% attacks, or any other problem that affects transactions on the blockchain, I prefer there to be a margin of safety.Payments are made manually to avoid any problems that could arise due to hackers. Passwords to pay out prizes are not stored on the server.There are few players and prizes can take a long time to pay outI find it disingenuous to fill the site with fake players to simulate activity, although it is probably a good business strategy that some sites use. I believe that all players should be real and traceable. Each player's purchase of lottery tickets has a transaction id that can be verifiable on the blockchain of each cryptocurrency. In the same way as when prizes are sent.On the other hand, the site has only been open to the public for a couple of months, the search engines are still indexing it. I haven't made any effort to advertise it so far either.",

And I'm sure you must be familiar how crypto casinos and platforms does effective marketing on the forum, right? But If not, then I guess here is a clue. As a new gambling site, running a signature and avatar campaign will create more exposure to your gambling site, of which you can hire reputable managers such as \"Cryptoprenuerbrainboss\"  for a successful job, and equally get a copper account that will enable you post pictures in your ANN thread",

Try to look at other gambling casinos they have here an ANN thread here that is regularly updated for their regular activities, you can do the same as well to lure gamblers too. However, welcome to the forum, and good luck with your business, this is not about to discourage you but lotteries here usually do not survive. To tell you honestly because I have been here for how many years and there are too many lotteries that had passed and I hope you will catch the interest of those gamblers out there. I hope also you are active in answering legitimate questions, that is how the community will trust your casino.",

For example take it as 100 tickets as a whole, and here if 50 tickets have got sold they'll shuffle the entire 100 tickets and choose the number. If the ticket within 50 gets chosen on the random pick the winning will be the lottery house. So, being transparent is much important and to grab the attention of users with these kind of service trust is more essential.",
