  "content": "Timely Halving Event and Bitcoin ETF a Positive BombshellAs optimism remain high on Halving event and Bitcoin ETF it is important to note that Inflow and Outflow drives the prize of any commodity or asset in the globe. For Bitcoin what leave the prize from accelerating or decelerating is essentially its inflows and outflows. Bitcoin Market-Cap will remain $710 billion as long as its sell-side pressure and buy-pressure remain the same.Regarding the events already mentioned, there is no doubt that BTC has a positive future ahead of it. However, Bitcoin halving events have a weakening effect with each cycle, so Bitcoin ETFs have a larger impact on BTC than \"halving\" events when accounting for inflows and outflows.Lately, we have witnessed the movement of BTC from $24,000 to bout $36,000 which can be attributed to the Bitcoin ETF narrative. Some of the estimations that came from different sources like BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck etc. was also a factor. A clear example; Galaxy Digital in its projection which says Bitcoin ETFs in its first year will draw $ 14 billion which eventually will lead to a 74% surge in Bitcoin price. As at the now there is no guarantee yet that Bitcoin ETF will be approved but discussions and submission so far seems positive because all criteria have been met.https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/markets/major-investment-firm-galaxy-digital-bitcoin-products-could-soon-see-450-billion-inflowSizing the market for Bitcoin ETF as at now there are 842,000 BTC at $21.7 Billion currently held in ETPs and closing funds. Which implies there is already a large holding. At an eagle’s view in the long run there may be over $126 billion to $424 billion inflow. There are lot of matrixes out there and optimistic estimate exposure of 1-2% of investors’ funds. To be optimistic there awaits a huge inflow for Halving and Bitcoin ETF.",

      "body": "It looks like someone is feeding them information not to approve the ETF this fast, like they are waiting for the appropriate time, which to me is the coming year, but all in all even if ETF fails Bitcoin will still make a new all time high.Do you really think that ETF have a larger impact than the halving cycle? I think so too because after every halving cycle the price still dumps until few months later but ETF could instantly surge the price but what will be the end of that? Buy the rumor sell the news I believe. This ETFs approval will make better money to flow into crypto and that's where I believe that this is going to be good for the market but also this could be bad, maybe in future crypto market will change drastically because of the involvement of these companies we don't know. Also this can be use to manipulate the crypto market, as many now strongly believe that ETF will be approved, if the opposite happens it will cause a dump to happen and the Black Rock and co will be able to get their hands on more Bitcoin.It's better to avoid getting caught in what may or may not happen, with or without ETF, time is already running out, you are to keep dollar cost averaging and believe in this strategy only, forget what the news is saying they are all distractions.",

Only the miner rewards are getting halved. That means the inflation rate is dropping, less new btc will be issued for the next 4 years.I agree with you on bitcoin’s future potential price changes though. Those volatile days are over indeed. No more x100 price rises… Even a x10 rise seems nearly impossible. X4 or x3 seems like a more realistic expectation for the next bull run. And that will easily carry bitcoin above $100k which will make so many people happy without a doubt.",

I believe if there is no Bitcoin Spot ETF in 2024 or 2025, Bitcoin market will still get more capital from new investors who are from traditional markets include institutional investors.",

I think the recent ETF hype only helped to jump-start the growth that was going to happen anyway because of the halvening and because Bitcoin was oversold during the bear market. Because it's totally unrealistic that a rumour of an ETF approval increased the value of Bitcoin by 50% - that's just some absurd volatility that only happens to immature assets and Bitcoin is supposed to be batter than that by now.",

Indeed next cycle will see new high and Bitcoin has higher possibility of breaching $100kAs far as Spot ETF is concerned it has definitely given a boost to the value of Bitcoin, But as per the latest news the SEC were supposed to make a call by now but it has postponed the result on Spot ETF approval till early next year.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/11/17/sec-delays-decision-on-global-x-spot-bitcoin-etf/amp/",

Right now, i'm not taking this too seriously because it won't make me sell BTC for a while... my emotions are strong enough to hodl until my target price is reached.Moreover, the high transaction fees at the moment are keeping me from making Bitcoin transactions.

Breaking the $30k resistance and coming up this high is too big a rise to be attributed to such a weak news like ETF. The two main reasons in my opinion were the halving hype that is getting closer and the other one is the interest rates that mostly stopped rising which always leads to more capital coming to all other markets (other than the bonds crap).",

Bitcoin is no longer an investment that helps us get rich with a small amount of capital , but it is still an investment that brings significant profits and helps us increase our assets. People who want to get rich with bitcoin with little capital need to really wake up and have a more realistic view . But I hope this won't disappoint many people and look to altcoins as a solution . Because altcoins are very risky and most of them are just scams .",

This circle bull run is from the ETF approval that will make the price to skyrocket. If it happens that the approval is not done, we will still have the halving event and the bull run.
