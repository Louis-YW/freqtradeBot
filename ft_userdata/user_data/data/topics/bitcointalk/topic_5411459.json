  "content": "Looking at the history of bitcoin mining and how the technology behind it has progressed continuously over the years, Can we expect more efficient miners than the ASIC miners soon? Miners that will be faster, less energy consuming and will produce lesser heat.QuoteWhen Bitcoin launched in 2009 the first mining was done by CPUs. Satoshi’s idea of “one CPU - one vote” was very realistic as there were only CPU miners (software) available at the time.The first miner was the official Bitcoin miner. You can access it here. Note that Bitcoin Core is the first and official Bitcoin miner which uses CPU to mine. It is practically worthless to mine with Bitcoin Core at present time.Not long after, the first GPU miner was developed, which allowed users to achieve higher speeds with GPUs. Soon after, CPU mining was not profitable anymore because GPU miners took over.It is believed that the first GPU miner was developed by ArtForz, who allegedly mined the first block with his GPU farm on 18th of July, 2010. The first publicly available GPU mining software was released by BitcoinTalk member Puddinpop. You can find the post here.In 2012, the first ASIC projects started to emerge. Not long after, Bitcoin blockchain was taken over by ASIC miners and GPU mining became obsolete and ineffective.https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/the-history-of-cryptocurrency-mining",

I was actually wondering if they are going to go bigger and bigger for more industrial locations. 3 to 5 Kw is nice but if you could I would think larger is better.1 mega-miner so to speak. Let it take up a full rack space or 2 and you drop in 100A 220V power at the top and be done kind of thing. It is in theory a single point of failure for a lot of hash-rate which would be bad. But on the other side, it is just 1 device instead of 10 to deal with.-Dave",

As I have said a few times before, there are a lot of empty data centers out there with power and cooling and so on. If you can just roll in the miner cabinet, roll out the empty server cabinet, wire it up and go it would seem like an easy sell.I could just be missing something but it's a standard size / form that has been around for decades. Would think it would be a simple way to do it.-Dave",

I mean looking at the data it seems like Facebook which has one of the largest combinations of data centers only uses 50MW of power, where does that put the average data center at?",

I mean looking at the data it seems like Facebook which has one of the largest combinations of data centers only uses 50MW of power, where does that put the average data center at?I was thinking more about cost and simplicity. Most data centers probably can't fully power and cool everything if they were all miners.BUT, once you start changing floor layout and the high power wiring you are changing the dynamics of the facility.Once you start going down that path you hurt the potential resale value of the facility and can limit options later.There are a lot of data centers out there that started as top of the line places and still are *for when they were built* but new better ways of doing things came along. Now they are not so great but still usable. Mining is one option. If you re-do it o be better for mining the next use will cost you a lot more money to re-configure it back. As would re-configuring if you are not just using regular racks. So are you better having more spaced out miners in a place that you can re-sell later if you bought, or will not have to pay a fortune fix if you leased it. Or making it better for mining? Would need some engineers and accountants to be sure.-Dave",

Mining is a complex business at its core, it's nothing different than starting a traditional business, if you open up a bar in Saudi Arabia -- it's nobody's fault that nobody entered your shop, and the beer company has to do nothing about because that beer sells just fine in the Czech Republic.",
