You are right, this is the time to build a healthy portfolio for the next bull market, partial buys is always the best approach because the market keeps dropping and you can always dca every time it goes lower. Let's assume most of us are taking advantage the bear season in the way we can afford. I look forward to another bull season.",

It's a bit too late to accumulate as the market is slowly recovering again even so many traders didn't even care anymore with tesla who has sold 75% of its bitcoin. I guess if the dump was also getting triggered caused by the big sell by tesla as well. There's also statement if that company will buy bitcoin again soon. This bearish market may going for so long. Anyone already prepared their money to bought more tokens at the bottom price. It seems like that market was showing a recovery signal.",

Elaborate on what you mean by partial buy.Partial buy means an effort to buy your crypto in the various level of price to avoid getting trapped into the same price level due to the bearish trend. People are using this as a strategy to decrease their chance to get a lose from buying crypto. it's caused by sometime you didn't even know how deeper the coin will be going. That will be giving you a lot of confusion to pick which level that can be considered as the best level to buy in.

You must use old pattern of crypto as a way to identify how long the bearish market will still remain in the market. No body knows but anyone is not anticipating the pump that can happen anytime with it. Sometime it can also become your lose since you didn't know how deep the price of token will be going on. Can you predict this?",
