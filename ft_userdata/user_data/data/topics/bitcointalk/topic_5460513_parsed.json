My best friend Charles-Tim, I understand your point but what op is saying is not totally bad because newbies are just coming to the forum and straight to the local board and the first topic you will see them dropping is Tinubu is traveling to Ghana for ECOWA meeting, that shows that the person who brought them to the forum is did give the orientation enough. So I will not blame the op too much because from him he is trying to make some corrections and not because he wanted to create the thread but because of the way newbies are spamming the board made him to call call them to order. So my man please don't see it from the other side but see it from the good side. It has been in my mind as well do so. Though nobody is above mistake. Love you all.",

We should show more effort like we show it on the English boards. I have seen Nigerians that created a topics like this in the past on beginners and help and of more effort. Let me quote him to explain better.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 21, 2023, 06:46:28 AMPlease try to check if a similar topic has been created alreadyThey are newbies, why not also teach them how to make use of this forum search engine and other search engine in your post. This will make your post better.There are other things you can add that newbies can read and gain from your post. This would have made your post to be educative and informative for newbies.This kind of topic should be create to discourage low quality posts and spams, but also to teach about what the newbies can do to achieve the kind of quality posts that you are talking about.Please, if you can edit the topic and put more thoughts into it, it would be a good topic.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 21, 2023, 06:46:28 AMSome answer to some questions that have been made into unnecessary topics can simply be gotten from regular google search, no need to ask a straight question that answers can simply be gotten from the internet.Then why are we meeting online on this forum to help one another? We need off-topic board and we may not get it until we get politics and society board.

It is possible to tell a newbie everything needed but the newbie may still plagiarize, spam and be having low quality posts and be banned. You do not have to blame people that brought them to this forum, blame the newbies that are doing the wrong and encourage them if need be if they have not done something that you should report them for their post to be deleted or their account to be banned.",

I was also thinking that it's past time for us to request child boards. I messaged Theymos after his last response to my request to remove my Custom title, and I told him about some of our issues on our local board and what we needed. But thyemos will always be thyemos, and he prefers everything to be written down and posted on the Meta. Why do you think off-topic child board will not happen anytime soon?

I'm no longer interested in bringing or vouching for any user to be whilisted, but I still believe that those bringing users should start on the local board to try and give them the do and don't guidelines, as some may be greedy and will always try to take the short cut and end up on the wrong side. We will continue to have this problem until we stop forcing people with no knowledge of Bitcoin and who are unwilling to learn to come to the forum.",

We were all newbies and we knew how it was to us when we started so trying to culture those that are coming to instantaneously act like you and I is something that would be too difficult because first, the forum is too large sometimes it might get them confused on where to place the right post or knowing where to start.Like what I does most times, there are people who now above me and some within the range of Sr. During their time when I noticed some post they made are not up to standard enough or not directly to what the topic is saying I will inbox them on either whatsapp or pm. If I think the post is that bad, immediately they would come and edit their post. I didn't just report those posts because I knew they are up coming and needs guidelines despite they had their boss but all is for the progress of we 9ja because I love my brothers and anytime I noticed a poster is from my locals I do monitor to see if there's any lapses., So guiding and correcting a newbie is not bad rather a good thing to do to keep our board clean and pure as snow.So lets learn to correct each others without any hate or signs of hotness to our words as I believe newbies needs our attention more than anyone here and at last it will be a ++ to our entire local board. I loved the way you handled it, thank you big manLet peace lead!",

One of the biggest fears I have for local board here with all the newbies coming up with their topics is that this local board shouldn't turn to Nairaland forum. There are too many topics that are similar. Personally I feel that We shouldn't have multiple topics that centered on the fuel situation in Nigeria. We should have multiple topics that discuss about Emefiele, FOREX, Road , electricity and poor infrastructure in the country. There should be a single thread and every new thing should be discussed under it. We can take a cue from El Salvador thread in the bitcoin discussion board. I know that what is preventing us from fully able to monitor and enforce this is the fact that we are yet to have a local board moderator. If the admistrator here can make any of us a moderator, the issue of multiple topics with the same theme would be a thing of the past.",

I have no intention of spamming.I will not have to express myself again: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5460513.msg62582132#msg62582132I think we should better than this. I only expected more.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 23, 2023, 09:03:38 PMOn your own side @Charlse-Tim as an older Legendary member, you have diverted the attention from the point I was trying to make with your comment and because of that, a topic that should have be deliberated on so newbies can see the importance and learn from it, will no longer be so effective.That should be considered off-topic. You can report it and see if it would be deleted by a moderator.Igebotz asked a question and I quoted him to answer and he even appropriate the link that I included that led to further discussion about having child boards.I think a conclusion like this should be from newbies. If need be, I can point to discussion like this on the main board from well established members.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 23, 2023, 09:03:38 PMAs you identified this, you have should have elaborated more on the topic as a forum where everyone contributes to make the discussion more educative.It is your topic, not mine. Sometimes I give people hint for topics I wish to merit. I gave you the hint to help guide newbies to put more thoughts on their posts. That was why I said, newbies will imitate us the legendary.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 23, 2023, 09:03:38 PMIf you had done so instead of focusing on what I did not add to my topic, maybe there would not have been any need for you to tell this user to lock this topic- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5460816.0 because it was already ongoing.You are funny. Visit the English boards and see more of it. Where there are more discussion and more people, something like that can happen. But the best the OP can do is to lock the thread and that is discouraging enough. If reported, moderator will remove it. I do not use to report it if the thread do not build further with replies and if the OP lock the thread, but my aim of discouraging duplicate posts is achieved.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 23, 2023, 09:03:38 PMThey would have learned from this topic how to search for topics to know if they have been started before posting.Exactly, make a better effort next time.I saw you edited your posts and make it bulky, the reason I reposted this to quote what you posted.",

I am surprised that you were able to read about what we posted about child boards that is not that related to this thread, but you were unable to read this: Quote from: Charles-Tim on July 21, 2023, 01:06:47 PMIt is a good topic, but it was of low effort. We should show more effort like we show it on the English boards. I have seen Nigerians that created a topics like this in the past on beginners and help and of more effort. Let me quote him to explain better.",
