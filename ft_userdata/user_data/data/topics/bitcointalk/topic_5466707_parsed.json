I wish the reverse is the case where he's the employee, maybe he will wish for such again.Nothing has a monopoly forever, and the market will always drag itself between more jobs and fewer jobs in a sane economy. Everyone is free to jump from one to the other during surplus and even upgrade their terms as either employee or employer dominates in the workforce.",

His opinion is corporatist jabber.Employees shouldn't monopolize the labor market to artificially raise wages nor should employers do the same with job openings.",

This only occurs in the private sector. I agree with him on how employers now misuse and always want to take control or advantage of the privileges they have while engaged to work, but generalising it to affect other employers is not what I want to agree on. You are the boss of your own firm; you make the rules; they follow, they break the rules; you fire them and hire fresh staff.",

You're basically doing advertising for this loser, who would otherwise disappear into the noise and occupy his tiny little space in the universe where he could have a power trip over his own employees. He sounds like a lousy person to walk for and is most likely venting because of high staff turnover in his own company. Instead of doing a bit of self reflection, he has decided that the employees are the problem and not his management style. They do say a large amount of people with psychopathic tendencies end up in the highest positions and maybe he is an example of this.",

Unemployment is the main problem in 3rd world countries and a major problem in Western countries. This guy sounds like he wants to buy the employees with the salary and make them do whatever his company wants. I live in a country where a person works as a driver, but the employer forces him to do grocery shopping, cleaning the house and other things as well. The driver does not have other options except to do what his boss asks him to do. Because he is afraid of losing his job and thousands of people are waiting for this position. I won't work for people who want to use their employees in such ways. I have worked with international companies where a European guy was the boss. He was too humble and always tended to apologize if it was his mistake. I cannot imagine any of my local employers saying sorry to their employees for their mistakes.",

There's much to consider on both sides, therefore laying off an entire staffs and employing new won't make that much difference when the management haven't taking a sober reflection on their on path in whatever downturn the company might be facing.There certain worker's in a company that when you lose their kind of unique expertise it take you if not +5 to get someone to fill their space perfectly. Hope he the employer/company can cope with losing such staff's going by his idea of mass sack?Todd Boehly   the new owner of Chelsea football club  is a simple example, instantly sacking of all old staffs to employ new staffs and since then the resultant effect of that action on the club results hasn't been the same despite billions spent on players.QuoteHe feels that employers have lost their power and that the only way for them to get back their powers over their employees and show to them whose boss is if the unemployment rate increases and people have to literally beg to have their or keep their jobs.QuoteThe world will return to normality soon but it takes time to erase consequences of the pandemic and lockdowns, quarantines months ago.And you think that the world returning back to normalcy after the effect of the covid-19 global pandemic is by employers laying off their entire workers based on the excuse that the employees are gaining or have gained much power?  He's only heading for his company's doom as it's only an employee that doesn't know his worth would be begging for job.",

This meant a change that is now returning to the previous normality, little by little, but what he says about the fact that we need to see 50% unemployment for this to be fixed is too exaggerated.

Unemployment is one of the biggest problems developing countries are facing and it contributes to a lot more pressing matters that we face. Moreover, it will be close to impossible (especially right now) to take control of the rising quantity of work-from-home employees as it has flooded the industry when COVID-19 hits. If he wants to take back the power he feels like employers are losing to their employees I'm sure there are other ways to do so than engrave fear of unemployment to others.

So you will be surprised that if such factory workers lose their job or resign from it, they won't find it very difficult to hook up with opportunities online if they are internet compliance or are willing to learn the requirements of using a smart phone or computer/laptop. The internet has given more opportunity of assumption of unemployed people, the internet has driven people into hidden talents they never knew, like different video on YouTube teaching on different life experience, comedy skits, health talks, relationship and marriage etc.",
