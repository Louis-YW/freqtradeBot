  "content": "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created using blockchain technology. It is currently the best known and most mapped cryptocurrency. Following are examples of some notable events in Bitcoin prices and events at different times: 1. Early Price Recovery (2009): Bitcoin was first published in 2009 by an unknown person named Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder. Bitcoin value is usually measured in terms of US dollars. Generally it was still of very low value.2. First Transaction (2010): In 2010, a New Zealand man made a 10,000 Bitcoin transaction to order a pizza at Jamia. This event is the first time a mapped transaction has occurred. 3. Huge increase (2013): In 2013, the value of Bitcoin experienced an extraordinary increase. At this time, the price of Bitcoin reached the highest price for the first time. 4. The beginning of good times for Bitcoin : In 2017, the price of Bitcoin showed a wonderful flight. At this time a price hike went up to 20,000 marks until tomorrow. It was a time of incredible profits through Bitcoin and became known as goodwill in the crypto market. 5. Administrative settlement (2017): In 2017, the Chinese government issued a controversial settlement on the valuation of cryptocurrencies instead of a controversial one. This is an example of Bitcoin mean beating phenomenon.6. Bitcoin's next high (2021): In 2021, the price of Bitcoin reached a next high. It goes up to $64,000. The above data are some examples of Bitcoin prices and notable events, but Bitcoin prices fluctuate and different events occur at different times. That's why we need to keep an eye on the cryptomarket to know the current prices.The new halving of Bitcoin in 2024, we who are Bitcoin investors can expect good things.",

      "body": "What about this as a notable Bitcoin event that we should consider adding to our Bitcoin history book? ðŸ¤”Quote from: Nwada001 on June 23, 2023, 05:53:27 AMSo far we have had three halvings, and the fourth is fast approaching, and funny enough, we always do have some sort of crisis, or will I say some price dump, on or before the Bitcoin halving, which usually drops the price of Bitcoin drastically to its lowest level compared to its ATH.Â 1. As we know, the first halving happened in 2012, and during this time, the price dump happened just a year before the halving, which was In 2011, when the price fell from $30 to $2. And this was as a result of the Mt. Gox exchange hack incident, in which a total of about 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen.Â 2. The second one was 2016, and the price dump was in 2014. After the price pumped in December 2013 and reached a new all-time high of $1200, the next month, January 2014, the price fell below $550, and this was as a result of the Announcement made by China, who have always been against crypto, which states \"Bitcoin was not a currency and could not be used as a form of payment.\"Â 3. The most recent halving occurred in 2020, which was the one I experienced, but before the halving, the price had already reduced from its all-time high, which it achieved in December 2017, which was about $20k+, but within a period of a year, there was a global regulatory attack on ICOs (Initial coin offerings), just as the SEC is attacking Security tokens. Back then, the regulators requested exchanges comply with what they called \"Anti-money laundering (AML). This, I believe, was when AML and KYC became mandatory for most of the centralized exchanges out there. The pressure that came with this resulted in the price crash from $20k+ to its lowest of $3,500 in December 2018.",

From 2009 Bitcoin overcome many obstacles to came here. Bitcoins first transaction was held in New zeeland 2010. A person bought a pizz by 10k bitcoin. But we know what is running price of bitcoin. I think now near about 100000 pizza could be buy by 1 Bitcoin. What a fantastic progress for bitcoin. After creation Bitcoin many ups and down we saw. Many remarkable event held for bitcoin history. In 2021 Bitcoin price was ATH, then Bitcoin price touched $69k. Now bitcoin price $30k. Now bitcoin price is showing uptrend. Last week bitcoin price increased near about 10%. I think this train will continue and within this year or first of 2024 Bitcoin price will hit new ATH meeans All time high. My thinking Within 2024 Bitcoin price will hit $100k. Best wishes for bitcoin traders and holders.",

This is the most notable event of all. It's not something celebrated like we have in the bitcoin Pizza contest where we had the first bitcoin use case or something of that nature but, it is definitely and event everyone looks forward to.I like to remember it like the prestigious world cup tournament which comes into play once in 4years and that's just what we have in halving which affects the shelf life of block rewards, makes mining the more difficult and it's often followed with a price adjustment towards the bulls.So yeah, the halving is a worth well enough event to be taken into cognisance and we hope go see the next one come 2024.",

I think when pointing out the best side of history, it should also be noted that there were times when the price was so low that most people were even thinking that Bitcoin was about to go dead. Some time ago, while I was going through some price history of Bitcoin, I came across the picture Below, which represents the major price crash of Bitcoin, which most people seem to over look, and that's the reason why some people are unable to hold their Bitcoin when the price begins to decline; they forget that the market has even gone worse in the past.",
