  "content": "Before starting, I want to underline that to install this node you don't need any kind of computer or programming skills, anyone can really install one very easily by following these steps. Enjoy the reading.RequirementsRaspberry pi4 8gb RamRasp power supplySD card 32gb (min.)HD disk (currently the blockchain size 500GB) recommended 1TBEthernet cableUmbrella OSA PC to flash the imageIntroductionUmbrel is an operating system for running a personal server at home. Once installed you can download self-hosted open source apps like Nextcloud, Bitcoin core, Lightning core, Mempool, Server Matrix and more.As already mentioned before, the installation is disarmingly easy, which is why I recommend it to those who are not familiar with computers and with the command line. The operating system, even if it bears the wording beta tester, seems stable and robust to me even if during use (about a year 24h/24h) I had to reinstall the node on a new SD card because the other one was burned or defective.Once installed, Umbrel will be reachable from the local network or via the tor network even if we can get around this block and reach it via IP in another way which I will tell you about later. Once the bitcoin core node has been started and downloaded, after the node has been synced, the blockchain will occupy 500GB (at the time of writing) of space on the Hard Disk, which is why I advise you to take one of at least 1TB or 4TB as in my case if you want to use other self-hosted apps.Umbrel is a plug-in node that is already packaged for use without any type of setting to be done, this makes the user experience for a nerd a little narrow but totally satisfying for a simple user without too many pretensions. In addition to the Bitcoin node, you can download other ready-to-use apps that generally require many steps in a Linux environment for installation in a simple click, for example you could use the disk to host a Nextcloud or a private drive where you can keep your files , or install Photoprism where you can keep your photos and look at them with the mobile client like on Google Photos but all self-hosted.So, it offers a truly vast catalog of apps, winking at bitcoiners with many solutions.InstallationFirst of all we need to get a Raspberry Pi4 and an SD card of at least 32 GB in class 10. I'll link you to a site where you can buy a complete kit.https://www.melopero.com/shop/raspberry-pi/kits/raspberrypi4computer8gbramofficialfullkitwithofficialfansystemblack/Having done this, once you have assembled your Rasp you have to download the Balena Etcher software, we will keep this on standby for a moment.Now go to Github and download the zip file that will contain the Umbrel operating system.Once the file has been downloaded, resume Balena etcher, open it and \"flash from file\" the file just downloaded, \"select target\" the micro SD that will be connected to the PC via a USB adapter and all you have to do is Flash to burn the image.When Balena has finished, remove the SD card and insert it in the special slot of the Rasp, remember to connect the hard disk to the blue port of the Rasp and the internet via ethernet cable. Now you can turn on the raspberry.As soon as you have turned on the operating system, the installation will begin automatically in this while all you have to do is get the local IP address of the Rasp or by entering the dashboard of your router usually 192.168.1.1 and look for the entry of your device to which the router it will have assigned an IP like 192.168.1.21 or you can download Angry IP Scanner software where you can scan all the IPs that have been assigned to your devices.So there are 2 ways to reach Umbrel the first (which doesn't work for me) is to type umbrel.local in the browser or type the previously retrieved rasp IP like 192.168.1.21 remember http//: and not https//: if everything goes for the best you will have to see the presentation page of Umbrel which asks you to create a password, here is the one, write it down immediately in a safe place.It may take a while to start up but let's say that the most is done, now you just have to visit the store from the sidebar and download Bitcoin core what will form our Bitcoin node. Once installed it will begin to download and synchronize the blockchain this can take several days let's say that on average it takes 5/6 days but it can be even more.When the node has finished syncing you can associate a wallet such as electrum or bluewallet but first you have to download another application or Electrum server and by following the steps in the guide you can connect the wallet to your node increasing privacy and security.If you want to reach the node even when you are out there are two methods or activate the option reach via TOR from the settings or download Tailscale which will create a private mesh VPN network between the node and the device you want to connect by assigning an IP address.Now that you know how it works, you just have to try other applications such as the lightning node or mempool to check the transactions.Good fun!!!",

Additionally VPS with 1TB storage could be expensive, unless you don't mind using HDD or HDD with small SSD as cache.I'm sorry I forgot \"otherwise\" in any case a VPS I think should be only a temporary solution as the more performing ones are expensive and in any case in terms of privacy it is not like having a raspberry or any other home node.",
