Your response was a flimsy excuse and I think that raised more suspicions. A neutral tag isnâ€™t so bad Claiming to be a scammer",

Don't trust, verify.Quote2__what if I was the one who got scammed what will you guys think of me?Then you become a victim, nothing less and nothing more. If you beg to any users because you've got scammed, that's against forum rules. Quote1__people who read but don't understand ( these are the people who go to read the comments of others and reply the same way to the comments without reading the threads or think if the person understand what he or she read)2__people who read and understand (these are the people who read through what ever is given making sure they understand every bit of it. this set of people do not only make use of reading and understanding they also make use of thinking). Which users you're refers to? I believe anyone who read your stories are understand what you're talking about. I've read you story and you seems to be like a scammer on your post, however you've been send the money back to him. But on some people perspective, your act depends on the users suggest to you. Most people suggest to send back the money, you've send it back. What if many users suggest to not send it back?",

      "body": "My question is, why on earth will you want to make a transaction on a non Escrow service? Most especially Facebook, the bedroom of major online scams, if you are not a scammer yourself. You would have stick to your saying \"No\", but rather you went further sending your Ethereum wallet address which he sent you $300, you confirm it, and for you not to continue what you started, you came up with a careless excuse. That's not fair my guy, because at least you should have shown him that actually, there still exist some good people on Facebook, but you failed. And there is one statement you made in your previous post, which has been bothering me and i will like you to explain better what you mean by that.. and it says...ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡Code:after the presentation I came online, I was seeing all sorts of pidgin local Nigeria insultive words.that caught my attention how can an Indonesia citizen speak and write a pigeon local Nigeria insultive words then I decided not to refund him his Etherume for him to feel how others feel when they are being scammed.So please, i have got just two questions to ask you base on what you said above, and please do well toanswer them.1st.. How does he speaking the Nigerian pidgin makes you not to continue your transaction, are you trying to say all Nigerians are scammers?....( Please answer)2. Why send your Ethereum wallet address if you knew you won't finish the transaction you just started?.And, i hope you have sent back his $300 Ethereum??Â  Because who knows if your sickness is not because of your refuser to send back his money.",

In fact, the value of a transaction can turn good intentions into bad, like you when you get $300 eth and need someone else's advice to return it.",

Reasons \" why would you just go offline after several discussion with someone who chatted you for help on FB without a notice\".My question; what if you were the one who needs the help and you started all the processes he went through and lastly you sent first and he went offline without your notice don't you think you would also behaved like him?You don't need to question him for anything rather than returning back his funds even if it was me and I didn't trust him I would only send back to him the amount he sent me.Then I will only tell him that he gat to pay all the transaction fees via in every single payment I will deduct the fee from the one sending to him if he refused to send all ones.That would have been the best, he trusted you that was why you were chatted up or asked him to used and escrow account this must from you because he can get his alt account as an escrow.To cut the long story short. Return back his funds and as well show us txt id that you made a refund this is the only way to show;1. You are free2. Isn't a cooked story3. Transaction refunded.Note: If all this is not done then you are likely to be called a scammer as well and you should be tag for not being transparent.Here got all the answers to your post and when all things are done we can see all are said to be true and not force story.",

After he made his payment you would have sent him back what he payed for just to prove to him how sincere you are and not like his type. I know you will be thinking if he had successfully gotten you, you would have lost your money which is painful that is why you made decision not to return his own exchange, even if he is a scammer you didn't do right thing by getting him back. The best thing you would have done is to ignored him or give him back what be longs to him.",

Thatâ€™s the difference between you twoI completely agree. You shouldn't have created your stupid topic at all. And after you questioned whether it was worthwhile to return the money to a person, you proved yourself completely.Other people's money will remain someone else's, and you are not a judge to talk about a person as a fraudster until you are personally deceived. But you showed everyone that you did not want to return, thereby showing yourself no better than scammers.And what are those \"what if\" questions? It's too much. So far, you have been, and remain, a person who cannot be trusted. And yes, unfortunately, you don't have a negative tag. But you, I'm sure, will prove yourself in the future.",

Are you here to explain to us that you don't deserve a neutral tag, that you rather needed a red tag?LolI was about to give him negative tag before, but I think twice giving negative tag to him might be to harsh since I don't have any proof except his words. So I'd give him neutral tag instead, I think it's fair enough since he don't have any reputation yet and have such scammer mindset, so anyone who want to trade with him will need to be careful of this.
