  "content": "The platform is built on Solana because this network is the leader in terms of throughput (TPS), which gives a huge advantage in terms of transaction speed as well as fees. DEXnow.io combines AMM (automated market making) with a traditional order book, which allows you to counteract manipulation, and also provides excellent opportunities for algorithmic trading (in particular, arbitrage with other exchanges).- There are no centralized services between the client interface and the smart contract, the solution is 100% based on the smart contract in the Solana blockchain.- Simple and intuitive interface.- No KYC or any complianceÂ https://exchange-app.dexnow.io/",
