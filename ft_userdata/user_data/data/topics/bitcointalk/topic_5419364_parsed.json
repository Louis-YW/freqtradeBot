Some people who see that's post must feel weird if the user get 11 merits and you could be in trouble since you're abusing Merit system.",

This is what determines your forum rank. You typically cannot lose this merit. You have 11 sendable merit (sMerit) which you can send to other people.

The merit box has by default a number 0 inside it. If you click the box, the number 0 won't disappear or at least automatically highlighted so that it would be replaced by the number you want to put. For a number of times, I almost committed the mistake of sending 10 merits instead of only 1 because of this. Double-checking helped every time. But I think there have been a number of instances in which 10 was sent instead of 1. Unlucky for you, OP, you've got exactly 11 sMerits. Had you only have 10, it would only have resulted in an error.",

Well, you sent 11 merits; forget it.

Whilst being doubtful between sending either 1 sMerit or 2 sMerits, I ended up committing a 21 sMerit TX. Since I tend to remerit post I’ve previously merited before, I have to add an exception so as not to remerit the post again with an additional 21 sMerit TX.",

I feel happy but with a little confusion. because I saw my post that you gave Merit it turned out to be a post with mediocre quality. so if it's valued at 11 merit I'm a bit confused. then i think positive i.e. i think this person is just generous and wants to help. but then i visited/viewed your profile. and it turns out that you even only have 22 Merits. which means the 11 Merits you have given me is the total sMerit you have. I immediately felt even more confused when I saw this. after that I see your post history. and finally found your latest post on this one.and now I really don't know what to say to you. But I have to thank you with all my heart for your good intentions intending to send me 1 Merit. Even if you end up making mistakes. You must be having a hard time now that you don't have any more sMerits you can send. but your mistake has helped me by accident. so I will still sincerely thank you. Hopefully next time you can be more careful. because this kind of thing can actually damage the reputation if done intentionally and consciously. not only you will be harmed but myself can be involved. so next time you have to be more careful.Once again I thank you for your good intentions. but the sMerit that you have sent cannot be returned. but I don't mind if I have to send a number of Merits with the same total. but I'm afraid it would violate the Merit rules in this forum. unless there is a moderator or staff that allows it.I also think that you do not know about the reputation on this forum.so please study more carefully.",

That's why I'm often stressed and the way I treat stress is by exercising, listening to music, chatting and don't forget to Allah SWT.Therefore, I simply suggested what I would do in such a case when a person wants to return what was mistakenly given. We have the right to give our merits to whomever we want, right?I see the bug has been fixed. This will be a lesson for the OP.",

It's the smerit that is needed to offset an increase in merit which in turn allows one to rank up while merit on the other hand does not decrease but only goes up per smerit received.

It's hard or easy to judge a merit exchange based on how quality that merited posts are and the frequency of backscratching between two users or between a merit source and their local users.If the merited posts are not too good quality but still receiving merits, and the frequency is high, that is merit exchange.If the merited posts are good in quality, it is good to not consider it as merit exchange.My motto is \"Your total earned merit does not tell others who you are and your qualitative contribution, but your post quality does.\"",
