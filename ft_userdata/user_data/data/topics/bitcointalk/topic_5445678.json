  "content": "What happened: Offering malicious script to drain crypto from its unsuspecting victimsSuspect's Profile Link: Xdrainer543treSuspect's Website:Code:https://xdrainer.xyz/archivedSuspect's ANN thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445535.0Additional Notes:I initially hoped I understand their service wrongly, that they offered a service of blacklisted address so their user could proceed with caution, much like... that specific user who offered such service on neighboring sub-board. I honestly not sure if raising this thread would works against their favor by limiting their movement or I did a mistake by offerring a free advertising for their service, but I thought it's better be reported so unsuspecting people would proceed with caution.It might be worth mentioning that --I think-- the service looks and works like the one thread in the past where the user's fund were drained after he approved a contract [can't find it although I've spent long minutes on ninjastic and generous time by manually leafing through the scam accusation and reputation board].Some screenshot for easy view: archived source: https://archive.fo/2mkOe",

A lot of other people post on social media that they get scammed on such websites. People often get fucked up being greedy. A few weeks ago Campaign manager Julerz's wallet was drained somehow. Now they offering such a service in this forum. Unfortunately, the forum doesn't moderate scams.",

Also, having that exposed here in the Scam Accusations board would make others think otherwise. If I have to be honest, prior to posting this thread and take a quick google search after it, I was divided between thinking if this is a serious offer of malicious software or is this an attempt to scam a scammer-wannabe, i.e.: offering a dud software. Sure, I've stumbled upon several people sharing their story of being hacked or warning about the possible hack through telegram, but this is the first time I finally \"introduced\" to the software and how it works; drain-ware, is what developers and cyber-security-analysts named them.Quote from: speedy963 on March 21, 2023, 11:50:52 AMTsk tsk tsk I support the notion.

I think this guys are attacking every platform just earn money. For sure those who are newbies and unaware about this specially in social media would think it a normal extension that you'd only need to connect your wallet.I think this software is not exclusively threatening newbies, inexperienced --or even experienced-- BM and those who dealt with contract-approval of web3 frequently are also at risk, in a sense that they might led into the trap in guise of escrow or NFT welcome bonus. Reading this article and from what can be inferred from the scammer's suggestion, one of the MO seems to be duplicating an existing platform, so even when people researching the said platform before they connect their wallet, they'll led to believe that the phishing site is legit as they shared the same name.",
