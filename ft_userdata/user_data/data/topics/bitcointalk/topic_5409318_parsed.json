The surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of trade and investment flows, widened to almost $167 billion in January-July, compared with just over $50 billion during the same period a year earlier, the Bank of Russia said in a preliminary estimate published on Tuesday.The proceeds have become a critical source of hard currency for the Kremlin since the invasion in February. A collapse in imports, driven in part by international sanctions over the war, has contributed to the surplus. It reached a preliminary $138.5 billion for the first six months of 2022.When you consider how pathetic it is that sanctions have been imposed on Russia by the European Union, have resulted in things like this:LMAO: India resells Russian oil to the European Union.It is not surprising to read that Russia is profiting from this situation.",

For example when US sanctioned Venezuela they also harmed their own oil industry since it was the Americans who were running the Venezuela refineries who had to accept the billions of dollars in losses when they exited. Guess who is involved in those refineries today? The funniest thing that I learned recently was that during US maximum pressure against Iran (still ongoing) they claimed they would decrease Iran's oil exports to zero, US navy has been running and depending on the fuel that Iran have been selling them. The same navy they try to threaten Iran with",

It's funny that a multiple increase in Russia's trade surplus against the backdrop of a special operation is actively pedaled in the Western media as a symptom that things are going badly in Russia. They say the economy is exploding from the fall in imports and there is nowhere to put the money, even cry.",

Russia is strictly complying with sanctions from the US and EU by not being able to receive back the gas turbines of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Germany, because of the embargo but Germany seems unhappy with this decision of Russia. I think they should be glad that the Russians are complying with the sanctions.  It seems that the plan to fill the EU gas reserves is not on track and winter is only 2-3 months away. I am still waiting to see how they will deal with it, other than lobbying citizens to limit gas use and start taxing more gas.",

The fact that Russia has a positive export/import ratio doesn't mean that the majority of the Russian population will get out of poverty. The Russian political and economical elite plus the Russian war machine are the biggest beneficiaries from the export of expensive natural gas(and not-so-expensive oil). The \"average Joe\" in Russia will keep living in misery and stagnation.The EU sanctions towards Russia were a stupid decision. You don't impose sanctions and you don't start an \"economic war\" against your main supplier of gas, oil and raw materials. Everyone with a functioning brain would come to such conclusion.",

About a thousand Western companies left the Russian market, and this cost them hundreds of billions of dollars in direct losses (but this also negatively affects Russia's GDP figures). Is this a problem for Russia? Is. But this is not a dramatic problem and it is also an opportunity. When the market is freed, there is a free place on it for internal development or for substitution by imports from friendly countries. And most of the companies that left simply lost the market and money, like Coca-Cola. Or do you really think that without sparkling water, the quality of life of Russians will worsen? Western sanctions in 2022 did not cause serious damage to Russia, because the West had already imposed all the really critical sanctions against Russia in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea, and Russia has completely learned to live under sanctions. But Europe did not learn any lessons after 2014 and did not take care of its energy security, for which it is now paying.",

Don't believe everything that western media tells you. India's internal demand of oil is so high that they import 90% of their oil demand from various countries. India sure did import oil from Russia, but never sold them to anyone. A country only sells something which is not absorbed by their internal demand. India is clearly not in a position to sell oil.

If a country is capable of developing sixth-generation fighters, it will somehow figure it out with passenger airliners.Did it occur to you that in the same way as \"it won't be easy, but Russia will cope\", also EU will cope? Of course, it will not be easy, as it's a harsh awakening.But, as a friend of mine use to say, every kick in the ass produce another step forward. EU may do now (sadly under pressure) some moves they should have done from the first place.Right now, let's face it, it's a situation both sides are losing similarly and both sides can, similarly, evolve.",
