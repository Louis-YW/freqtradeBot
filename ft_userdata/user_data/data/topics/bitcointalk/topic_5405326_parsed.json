  "content": "This post isn't based on my feelings or mindset but on the timid ones that can't speak thier mind. I call it VOICE OF THE PEOPLE I'd like to say big thanks to the rulership of Theymos and his team on board.   We've only been following some pro's and con's, apparently it's been over a decade that someone, cloaked in the name 'Satoshi',came forth with this wonderful but indicisive coinage. I have seen several content about Bitcoin's atrophy and that of course has given so many Protestants the guts to laugh with thier mouth agape; sometimes the whole mockery, coupled with the facts that Bitcoin is still in its crescent and also the fringe losses that's experienced after every DIP,makes it incredible for  NEWBIES✓ I mean what's the point? Keeping it decentralized without a purpose is futile, don't you get it?  I have been asked series of questions and I sometimes wonder if I'm leading people Into doing the right thing.  N/B y'all are participating just as we do, with a common motive so I don't think anyone is sure enough, though having predetermined motives are imperative but does it really matter when this dude's unknown or sometimes presumed?! Only curious✓ I know  naysayers won't stop criticism, but that doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin being irrefutable! These are the reasons why most times, people say shitty stuffs on web and the rich and interested ones who could possibly sink In much more than the regular would begin to grow apathetic , and why? You keep asking why Bitcoin falls? You should understand that clearly; this isn't an individual stuff(maybe that's the reason for the decentralization) people keep pulling out alot of money and nobody is saying anything and why?Sometimes,it seems like a gamble but the thoughts are countered instantly for the fact that it's been running for more that a decade now.  The whole fact is based on irregularities and that's not gonna cut it! I believe that's one of the reasons why Goldman Sachs     was on a great doubt, recovers quickly overtime and still decided to try; Technically, there's still alot to be done!Sandra",

      "body": "I couldn't quite wrap my mind on what you're trying to say. But, it is very wrong to immediately jump into conclusion and dismiss Bitcoin as if it's just one of the thousands of technologies and innovations that sprouted up everywhere for the last few decades, many of which without real-life purpose and short-lived. There is actually an urgent reason why Satoshi worked incessantly on this thing. To sum it all up, it's all about freedom. Early adopters must have embraced Bitcoin because of its technology. Later on when the price began to rise, not gradually but rather quickly, many are already coming for the price. And knowing that there couldn't be more than 21 million Bitcoin, others are into it to keep their wealth. So, in a way, motives of Bitcoin supporters also vary.",

Keeping it decentralized without a purpose is futile, don't you get it?  I have been asked series of questions and I sometimes wonder if I'm leading people Into doing the right thing. “Decentralization” is only a buzzword to most people; the public generally does not understand it, even when they benefit from it.Out of many reasons to value decentralization, I will pick here only one:  Safety.Most newbies are unaware of the digital monetary systems that failed before Bitcoin.  They failed because they were centralized, and their central authorities failed.  DigiCash is only the most famous example.  DigiCash, Inc. went bankrupt in 1998.  Would you want to have been holding DigiCash, when DigiCash, Inc. went bankrupt?In Bitcoin, there does not exist any central “Bitcoin, Inc.” that could fail.  Any major participant in the Bitcoin ecosystem can fail.  The worst that can result is a short-term bearish market impact, as occurred when Mt. Gox failed.  Bitcoin just keeps going.  Your funds remain safe—as long as you keep them in your own self-custody wallet, controlled exclusively by your own private keys.  “Not your keys, not your coins.”  If you store your coins with a centralized party, such as an exchange, then you risk losing all of your money if that party fails.",

Bitcoin changed the lives of many people for the better by giving them financial freedom with features that were not available before (decentralization, privacy), the old system is like slavery and the new system gave me freedom What more do I want? This is what people are looking for all the time so I don't really care who is the real inventor of Bitcoin, I will say thanks to him without knowing his identity.",

I have Bitcoin and I'm keeping and spending it and nobody asked me how I earned those. When I created my Bitcoin wallet, nobody demanded from me proofs of my occupation, my regular salary, and so on. I have gone through all this with the banks and even with money remittance centers. I sometimes feel insulted every time I'm asked for proofs that I am actually able to save this much in the banks. So Bitcoin to me is freedom enough. QuoteI had a pm and it read : The volatility of btc makes people sometimes wonder if there's any progressions for the futureBitcoin's price is just a single aspect of its existence. Bitcoin is progression enough. Bitcoin is developed money.As regards volatility, here's what it is in reality:",

Hasn't it already been achieved? Freedom to hold your own money, be responsible for it, spend it globally, and not have to rely on a third party for that? That goal in my opinion has already been met, and was met several years ago. Just because the majority of people aren't using Bitcoin, doesn't mean it hasn't achieved its goal of allowing people freedom to use their money how they want. It just hasn't caught on massively yet.",
