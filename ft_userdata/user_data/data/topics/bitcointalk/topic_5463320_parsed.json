As e be like this, I just say make I bring this topic make we come together, discuss.So, a lot of us may already know, some may not, and others may just be figuring it out now, ( like myself ), that there are 3 broad ways of acquiring Bitcoin. These 3 ways are; buying, earning & mining.  Buying is the easiest way to get Bitcoin but of course requires finances. It involves;* Cryptocurrency brokerage which are websites that allow you to buy & sell away from the order book concept making it simple, but with a higher transaction fee. Eg., Coinbase.* Cryptocurrency exchanges which are cheaper and allow users to interact with an order book to buy and sell. Eg., Kraken.* P2P marketplaces allow users to buy and sell freely and choose their buyers and sellers. Eg., Binance. Then there's earning bitcoin which happens when you ask for a percentage or all of your pay to be in bitcoin, providing services online that pay in bitcoin, and through faucets.Lastly, we have mining. It involved solving difficult hashes and puzzles to earn block rewards. It used CPU,  GPUs, & FGPAs in the past, but now ASIC is used in mining Bitcoin. This method is not advised to beginners as it requires intensive capital.After all that has been said, I would love the experts and those with experience to please share their stories and tell us how they got their first Bitcoin, stating what method they used, prefer, and how they maintained it to this point.Thank you...",

      "body": "First let me welcome you once again, to our local board and e good the way you first throw the question here,  instead of the larger Bitcointalk community outside our local board reason being that,  you can easily be corrected here and given advice and suggestions that are compatible with your region/country. First, since Bitcoin is not fully adopted here in Nigeria getting a job that pays you in Bitcoin may not be available because no organizations will take that route of paying staffs salaries in Bitcoin in Nigeria for now unless on a personal arrangement,  e.g we have some members of this local board who run physical business and have started to accept bitcoin as payment so unless you need such services or you provide service to such private business then you can get paid in Bitcoin. Buying Bitcoin seems truly to be the best,  fast and easiest way to own your first Bitcoin since all you need is to own your wallet, and use an exchange to buy and store. But aside from all those ways to own Bitcoin,  let me also mention one of the unique and popular ways to own Bitcoin that is popular to many Bitcointalk users both in the local board and the global community, which is through signature campaigns and bounties pay in Bitcoin and among the two signature campaigns have become the most popular and proven way to earn a bit, through your weekly incentives at least no matter what the amount, you will earn some Satoshi if you meet the manager requirements for payment of the week.                                                  How I own my first Satoshi. I earned the first bitcoin in my life through a Twitter campaign,  and it wasn't from this forum,  that year in 2015 when Twitter was the mainstream media for many projects,  I followed a user then and after some time he contacted me to that he has a simple job that he will pay me in bitcoin,  then I already have the basic knowledge about bitcoin and I quickly created a blockchain wallet which was one of the popular bitcoin wallets then,  and after the retweet job the user paid me 5$ in Bitcoin,  and that was the first time I feel the air of freedom since it transaction was very fast",

      "body": "Getting bitcoin is very easy as you could imagine but even to that extent of it being that easy, one would need to be extremely careful so as not to get issues in the process of owning bitcoin as there are lots of scammers out there waiting for who to fall for them so they could take from them their time, resources, energy and skills put  together in doing works.The options you have mentioned are very much good and okay to acquiring or owning bitcoin. Buying of bitcoin involves your capital so you could own bitcoin. While in the process of doing this, one needs to conduct his or he due diligence so as to be on the safe side of not being scammed by scammers. Do well to crosscheck and confirm the authenticity of the vendors through which you want to purchase from because scammers are fond of cloning sites and making it look real like the original and they steal your details and funds while you try to purchase from their fake site.One can as well work to earn bitcoin as you have said but before you do that, you will need to be very sure of your payment because scammers use people to do work for them and after that they do run away after engaging one to work for them using their skill, time, energy, experience and resources hence you see people demanding for escrow for confirmation as to know if they are real or fake. Whatever the payment agreement be, the monetary value in bitcoin would be sent to the escrow before work commences. My first bitcoin earned was from this forum as a result of the campaign I joined back then as I was eligible to apply for it. Luck being on my side, I was accepted for the campaign and it was paid in bitcoin on weekly basis which I have benefited hugely from it till this very moment. As a newbie, if you need or want to earn bitcoin from this platform and you have skills, you can put up your services for all to see and approach you for job to earn in bitcoin. Making good and quality posts gives you an edge in the possibility of you growing in ranks here and as well retaining you in the course of being a participant of  a campaign and the opportunity of  campaign managers accepting you into signature campaigns.",

The first one is using your own money to buy bitcoin which is the easiest of all if you have a good monthly income. The second way is receiving your earnings in bitcoin, the fact remains that I haven't seen any job that pays with bitcoin in our country because of the restriction of banks dealing with bitcoin. Moreover,I know think say any Naija person go like pay you with bitcoin when he know the value of bitcoin and how precious bitcoin be. Na only foreign work go fit pay you with bitcoin. I got my first bitcoin from participating in signature campaign on this forum since I learnt everything that I know about bitcoin here in the forum.",

Yeah I think the OP knows that they are other ways to actually get BTC but he choose the ones listed because they are by far the easiest and well known if am not mistaking but all the same Bitcoin is something almost everyone craves for and it would be crazy not to actually have some now seeing that BTC is heading to a another record breaking season @ATH. As for mine was through buying, I bought mine first with binance exchange then later start earning it",

      "body": "On all the processes of accumulating Bitcoin, I can really say one is easier than the other because for those who have enough money to buy all the mining tools, they might see it as an easy way for them to earn Bitcoin, while for those who are also working online and earning Bitcoin, they might see it as an easy way to accumulate (like signature participants and other freelancing job), while for those that also have the money to buy Bitcoin, they might see it as a less stressful way to accumulate Bitcoin. Buying Bitcoin was easier for me when I bought my first Bitcoin around 2019. I did not even know that there was any forum like this that gave one the privilege to earn Bitcoin; although I did some airdrops back then, they were all paid in shitcoins or stable coins. Back then, I knew it really required enough money to mine Bitcoin, so buying it became an only option for me.",

Even if say e easy for some people unto say some old members hear just carry dem throw enter hear and direct them, the process too no too be one day job. People too don miss road and do wrong things, dem scam dem too. Like yahoo guys dey really scam people unto bitcoin investment. Those yahoo guys get app wey create and you no fit know say na scam app, once you register na to fund am and collect referral code take dey bring people. To withdraw your investment na, story go start and dem go begin tell you say make you deposit again before dat one go mature, na so cry and regret don start oo. Anyway for my own first time, Omo na faucet oo. I play tire and sometimes I go give because the road to withdrawal be like to go Jerusalem until one day I reach the level but I no fit remember the worth dat time, the tin too small whether e no even reach $5 self, Omo I just dump the faucet because na waste of time.",

Maybe through their friends and possibly research too got them here and In the process became members after a long time of observations and studies. They finally learnt what they are interested in knowing here and can attest it. You too are a witness here as you have said. Oboy be like say na me you dey tok about oo. If you know di kind times wey dem don scammed me before my oga come carry me come here you know go believe oo. I don really enter scammers hands but I thank God for everything.

Like the saying goes \"patience is a virtue\" it takes patience to build and to gather that is what people fail to understand. They think it will just start manifesting in a short time for them to start merriment.  Them forget say seed wey person plant go need water and constant attention to grow up. Na so e be every where.",
