  "content": "This thought occurred to me when reading a thread in the beginners forum.Everybody seems to assume that a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin, but that isn't strictly true. Every Bitcoin transaction has an acquisition value, and, assuming that you use a wallet that allows you to select transactions to move to another user. If you dollar cost average, then you may be losing some tax advantages. For example, if you show a loss on some coins, then you may want to save those to offset against gains in the future. Alternatively, you may want to dispose of some early, and highly profitable coins, to take advantage of your tax allowances. Does anyone know if the revenue departments will allow you to discriminate?There is another possibility as well.  Suppose you move coins into a different wallet, does that count as a disposal? If it doesn't, then how much will you have to vary the wallet ownership for it to become a disposal? Perhaps you could exchange it for (say) Eth in one tax year, and exchange it back in the next year.",

Perhaps you could exchange it for (say) Eth in one tax year, and exchange it back in the next year.It shouldn't count as tax, because US taxes only apply starting from when you buy bitcoins with dollars (and not any other currency) and are calculated at the moment you withdraw to dollars (again, not any in other fiat currency, USD only).In particular, if you're earning bitcoins from somewhere like a sig campaign or a job, you don't pay tax on that when you cash out because there is no applicable Capital Gains.",

NFT) are often classified as a capital asset, so moving your coins within your wallet is not subject to taxes because you have not exchanged them for other currencies like when paying using cash.Any exchange of Bitcoin with other currencies is a taxable transaction. If you make gains, you pay tax, otherwise you will not need that.You do not need many tax details for your wallet records, but you will need to download a record of your files on any CEXs/DEXs, as all buying and selling within them are subject to taxes.Some try to hide it by using platforms that do not require KYC and a one-time payment of taxes when converting bitcoins to cash.",

Perhaps you could exchange it for (say) Eth in one tax year, and exchange it back in the next year.If it's a wallet that you own, no that's not a disposal. I'm not sure what you're asking exactly, but if you still own that Bitcoin, you have to declare it to the tax man if it needs to be declared. I don't know where you are, and what exactly you're talking about here, but income tax is usually required to be declared. Whatever you do with that money from there on wards is considered yours until you send it to someone else. If you send it to a different wallet that you own, then that's just moving your funds around instead of a disposed of. Honestly, to prevent going wrong I'd just advise to talk to an accountant. I've had an accountant for years just for Bitcoin now. Usually, just give them the transactions of the wallet, and then any subsequent withdrawals. If you've purchased Bitcoin from an exchange, give them that. If you sell at a loss later, that'll be considered a loss, and won't be taxed.",

      "body": "As others have pointed out it is going to depend on country to country along with several other factors.Using the US as an example if I mine coins and sell them since they are considered property according to most accountants I have to declare them at $0 cost of acquisition. BUT I can then deduct the cost of mining them. Same thing different box on the form.But I know in some places you just put in the profit and call it a day.As always consult a tax professional and then consult another one to be sure.-Dave",

      "body": "OK, I obviously haven't explained things very well.Let say I bought one Bitcoin for £100, and a few years later, I bought another for £10,100. I then decide to sell one coin at a price of £20,100. The taxable gain on the first coin is £20,000, but on the second coin it is £10,000. With dollar price averaging, the gain is £5,000 (approx.). If my tax free allowance is £5,000 then by relating the sale to specific coins, the taxable liability is £0, £5,000 or £15,000. If I had purchased an additional coin for £30,100, then I could have an allowable loss of £10,000.So what is the purpose of all this? Well I am a long term HODLer. I'm starting to believe that this long term inactivity may not be the best approach. By selectively selling and repurchasing after a required interval, I could take advantage of unused tax allowances, or favourable tax conditions.It becomes even more interesting if I sell half a Bitcoin.Figures will vary dependent on market conditions, residency, and tax legislation.",

As we all wind up saying a lot here it depends on where you are living and what the local laws are.Some countries force you to use a LIFO method for doing things, others are FIFO and so on.Here in the US it's a 'thing' so I can pick. One of the South American countries that a coworker is from just changed from that method to FIFO. So if he sells any at home in 2023 he is going to get hit hard.-Dave",

Depending on the method they are using they will either use 1k or 10k, but most likely it will be 1k.Besides, the UK is completely different than most as they use Share Pooling so that won't help anyone in the US for example!Quote from: Jet Cash on January 27, 2023, 03:26:08 PMNobody seems to be addressing the fundamental point that I hoped to make.
