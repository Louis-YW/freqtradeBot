I guess the only time I read about them selling was two years ago, when they sold their bitcoins for the first time. Most people rated that act as a means of avoiding tax because they sold at a low price compared to their purchasing price and bought back immediately after a few days. Selling now will definitely look like they are losing some profit that could have been achieved when bitcoin broke ATH. They are a big organisation with a lot of funds, and they have a target to meet. That's what makes them different from individual investors. They are buying when they feel like the company has enough money to invest in bitcoin.  If it was a personal holding, once's Bitcoin breaks new ATH, even if I don't sell, all part of that holding will be sold, and profit for that will be realised first. Why do I wait for pullback? I didn't buy those bitcoins to sit in my wallet as decorations, but they have different purposes, and making profit is part of that purpose.",

How long would you HODL if you were in MicroStrategy's position? Actually, before anyone buys Bitcoin, they already have it in their minds for the speculated price they want to sell their Bitcoin, and if perhaps the speculated price has not been reached based on their expectations, then they will not sell until they have actually gained the desired profit they expected. If an investor happens to buy Bitcoin at a high price, let's say $70k per Bitcoin, and now the price has dipped to $63k+, the investor will have to hold until the Bitcoin price spikes again and goes above their bought price. These are the reasons why we always remind ourselves to invest the amount we can hold for a long time, so that even when the price drops below the purchased price, the person will have to keep holding until the price begins to surge again. Based on your question, if I am in such a position, I will have to hold my bitcoin until I can achieve the desired profit I was expecting. Speaking of an ATH soon, if you look at the price history of Bitcoin during halving season, the peak price of Bitcoin is usually met a year after the halving has occurred. The bull market is not yet over, so there is a very high chance that we are expecting a new ATH sooner or later next year. Bitcoin is predicted to surge above $100k, and if that happens, those who still bought around $67k will be in profit. There's nothing to worry about.",

On the 14th march 2023 they had actually announced that they have a note of offering of $500M with the pay back been set at for 2031. Immediately I was this I had a conviction that any market correction will be their buying opportunity. With a whopping 214k bitcoin that official makes The company a 1% holder of the current circulation of bitcoin (19.7M) and an unrealized profit of around $8B, it’s actually going on well for them.

Will we see another ATH soon? How long would you HODL if you were in MicroStrategy's position? Yes it’s the right strategy if you have long term plans. Also we already have an ATH $73k plus and I see this changing after the halving period though and we might set the ATH that will hold us to the next halving only in 2025. As for market correction I will advise anyone DCA to not wait for a heavy fall, once there is a -10% fall that’s one of the best time now to buy because we wouldn’t see the major correction we are waiting for not util a full bearish period",

This Bull market is different from the previous ones in certain aspects but since when haven't seen Bitcoin Halving yet, I think we might go towards $100K and beyond.",

If management comes to the realization that the price has reached an upper limit, then management must sell them, anything else would be irresponsible. Bitcoin also now has a large impact on the company's market capitalization, so I would expect them to minimize risk and sell bitcoins in the future.",

I admire Mr. Michael Saylor. I admire his views about Bitcoin which in one of his interviews describes as the ultimate form of property and investment asset, emphasizing its role in capital preservation. He once compared Bitcoin to real estate in New York City, suggesting that just as property in NYC is held long-term for its value, Bitcoin serves as the endgame property for wealth preservation. And I couldn't agree more. From their recent purchase of the dip, it is clear that their continuous acquiring Bitcoin is because of their strong belief in its potential for faster appreciation than traditional assets like stocks or real estate.QuoteThey did try to buy the dip but it has dipped further. Will we see another ATH soon? How long would you HODL if you were in MicroStrategy's position? Of course yes. It is certain that we will see another ATH but not in this month of March. As a person who shares the same strong views and belief in bitcoin as them, I would HODL. If I don't that would just be sad.",

What I have noticed at the moment is that MicroStrategy's level of confidence in BTC to date is in terms of investment opportunities, the growth of Bitcoin's value in the market in the future is still quite high and on the buying side it doesn't really matter if there are short-term price fluctuations. Indeed, the right time to HODL may vary from person to person, both individual and company, and if MicroStrategy wants to buy again, I think this is the right time while it is still discounted and that is also one of their Long Term Strategy patterns too.",

I don't see any point in us worrying ourselves about what MicroStrategy is doing because it is obvious they have pitched their tent with Bitcoin and are not doing badly overall. Despite the ongoing dip, they are in over 60% profits, not many big capitals can post such profits in less than five years of getting involved. What we should be doing is to follow them and buy as they are buying and see where this take us to. I have confidence that they know what they are doing and that anyone who follow them will not regret it. I have learnt to follow successful people in any business I am getting into and that is exactly what we should be doing as those who are privileged to know when they are buying.",

Btw this is a good indicator that another great bull market aways us and it's still a dip to buy Bitcoin today. I bought my Bitcoins when price was 20K, sold them two weeks ago at 67K. Now this step of MicroStrategy makes me think whether to wait for much better deep or if it was too early for me to sell my coins because if MicroStrategy buys at this price, then it means that they expect bullish market and guys who hold 1% of total Bitcoins, are definitely the ones that can influence the market.

The price of Bitcoin will keep increasing and companies like MicroStrategy are not taking any chances but always investing. I assume the they don't have any intention to sell their holding in this present bull season so buying at $63,700 is not a bad decision since Bitcoin will always beat it's ATH. Just like El Salvador which has not indicated when they intend to sell, MicroStrategy might keep holding until the price hits $1m. If I am in the company's position I will only sell when the company has a pressing need for finance. Besides that, I will ensure the firm keeps holding  Bitcoin just as nations keep gold as reserves.",

Well microstrategy only strategy is to buy Bitcoin at any price and hold but this is not applicable to everyone especially for the weak heart. Microstrategy has a lot of funds to invest on Bitcoin while they already experience the worst possible scenario on their holding on the last bear market so I really doubt that Saylor will still fear on buying Bitcoin even at peak while most of their holdings is already at profit.For me, It’s important to wait for the market to calm down before you enter so that you can guarantee that there’s no panic anymore to avoid future more dip. It’s better to purchase on a higher price if the market is already in bullish momentum rather than buy on uncertain market with the potential to correct further.",
