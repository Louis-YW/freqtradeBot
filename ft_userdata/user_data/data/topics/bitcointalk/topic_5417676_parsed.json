It works to save phones that has been damaged with water, and if it works for phones it should work fine with a Ledger.Yes, it is a helpful solution actually. I had a unique experience when I forgot to bring my raincoat when I went to the forest and didn't get shelter when it rained. All my electronic devices got wet including my cell phone and camera but rice has helped me save them from damage.This advice can also be helpful for other things that get wet for other reasons, including Ledger for example. But if it's a storage wallet, then I'd rather advise users to buy another one right away instead of using it even though rice can help them reuse (in most cases).",

      "body": "Putting it in rice can help, it's true, and it was my first instinct... The problem afterwards was that there was a lot of white dust all over the connector... which blocked the charging wire... So I disassembled the ledger to clean it... I realized that it was still full of moisture inside, the rice is not everything, it's not is not magic and in addition it puts dust all over the connector. That said, the best solution is to dry the components individually.There is also the battery issue.If there was a charge in the battery... The ledger was opened several times during the washing cycle... This may have damaged the battery and the ledger is already in the terminal phase... So dry it as quickly as possible and executing the right transactions as quickly as possible is essential....The nano S have no battery, so easier to save...when i got this i had 3 nano x in my pockets....Only one had a charge, the others were completely discharged... And I was able to completely save the 2 that had no charge... time to get out what needed to get out of the.In short, the world is a multitude of possibilities, you just have to put the good odds on our side",

A device that has come into contact with liquid should be immediately turned off and extensively dried before trying to use it again.See: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015216913-Frequently-asked-questions?docs=trueAnd that’s about it …I wouldn’t have really expected one of these devices to make its way to the washing machine with ease, probably because my usage habits in no way should lead to that situation. Giving it a proper thought though, once can envision a bunch of situations whereby the device ends up in a pocket and subsequently takes the dip (in the water). It’s probably even more likely with the Nano X model than the Nano S or Nano S Plus models, due to the Bluetooth feature of the former, that may make it more prone to portability type needs.I’ve seen a few other videos versing on what to do if your device ends-up in the washing machine (claiming they left it in rice for a while in their case), and even one more or less stating that it was non-officially water proof (which it is not). All in all, even if one manages to recover the device, it may degrade the device and shorten its longevity. Per se one has to consider the scenario of plugging it in one day, only to find it not working, what to say if it went for a wash.Side note:I wonder how they covered the water factor in this very unfortunate promotional stunt, involving a Ledger device allegedly buried in Mt. Gox Everest.",
