Quote from: balotelli on March 17, 2023, 10:52:39 AMBased on my technical analysis, looking at the weekly candlestick chart, this price increase is not sustainable and the bullish momentum is relatively weak. Therefore, it will be difficult for BTC to reach the $30k level. I predict that BTC will return to the $22k level in the next 1-2 weeks.",

He could buy small amounts of tens of dollars and do DCA, or he could get more involved in the forum and earn bitcoin from signature campaigns, so if he doesn't have bitcoin it's because he doesn't want to.Quote from: balotelli on March 28, 2023, 02:21:38 AMThe current issue with BTC is high transaction fees, so I rarely use BTC for payments, I usually use LTC or USDT with very low fees below 1$.I imagine that until recently you did have some bitcoin that you spent, didn't you, or are you just bullshitting us?",

But they're probably just in the phase of learning, of getting to know Bitcoin. They're just doing it slow. They're busy with what they do so they are not in hurry to do their first purchase. I don't think it is unusual for some people who don't have Bitcoin to discuss about Bitcoin. It is also possible that you used to have Bitcoin and sold them already but you're still interested about Bitcoin and even have plans to buy back one of these days.",

I just want to tell you that don't miss the opportunity to buy BTC at a good price, at some point I think the accumulation of assets is large enough and the selection of different investment portfolios, I am sure BTC in this market always offers the best opportunities.",

I agree.Sometimes i wonders what they tends to share with those who already had an experience of holding.Though i pay less attention to such people who talks about bitcoin without them having revelation of it, i don't think he understands what is called bear market and it hurts seeing your assets going down to -20% of your investment.

Lol.I have friends that discusses about bitcoin and they follow the news. I'm even surprised that they're doing that because they've told me that they won't buy bitcoin for some reasons. It's not only you that do check the prices daily and check everything bitcoin without having it. And I guess that even starting to think that you've missed buying the bottom when the price is surging. Don't you have plans of buying bitcoin? Because it could be another missed opportunity for someone like you if you're not going to give time of buying it now. With those researches that you've made, I guess that you're now encouraged and wanting to have it after all of those times that you're feeling the negativities that's coming out from you.",

Lol.At least you believe in Bitcoin which is the most important thing, because everybody on this forum was once like you who had no Bitcoin sometimes ago, but yet never gave up and kept learning about how it works, and the latest market news about Bitcoin. So if in case you may have forgotten, I will like to inform you that to own Bitcoin, you don't need a million dollars or very huge sum of money to own BTC, as with exchange such as \"Binance & Remitano\" has made it very possible for anybody to own a very small fraction of Bitcoin worth the least $2 to $5",

Lol.It all depends on your purpose, if you are here simply to spread Fuds, then it is normal for you not to own any Bitcoin. But if you really love it, enjoy discussing it but don't own any bitcoins. I would doubt it unless you're in financial difficulty and can't buy bitcoin at this stage because I've been in the same situation. At one point, I didn't own bitcoin but always enjoyed discussing anything related to bitcoin, I never missed any news about it, simply because one day I will buy it when I have money.",

Just like owning bitcoin, they might have a little doubt on youÂ  even you speaks a lot about bitcoin because you dont even have it. You dont know how it feels to lose some it or even earn some of it. On the other hand its good for you to know more bitcoin even you dont have it right now so when your time comes where you can afford buying bitcoin, you have that knowledge on how things work on it.",

Lol.Follow up daily trending news linking to Bitcoin and the crypto activities was my prime activities for the day, I found interest in it and never doubted that I was going to be a trader. I was in your shoes once, loved anticipating in active conversation concerning bitcoin but didn't got any in my wallet. I was eager to accumulate more Bitcoin but with my tense actions, I learnt to realize that one needs the basic knowledge of cryptocurrency before purchasing Bitcoin. It's funny to talk about bitcoin and not accumulate Bitcoin in your portfolio. But with time, you will be hungered to get pieces of bitcoin when you start witnessing profits made from it.",

You situation is worse than someone who has never heard about bitcoins because, it is not information that has stopped you, but yourself that has stopped you from making the choice to invest.
