I've updated the post.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 06, 2023, 07:57:49 PMProblem is that I don't see any option to pay with Bitcoin, only paypal, cards, google & apple pay are available in checkout page.I also don't see information from what country is everything shipped.Shipping is from China. I've added that to the welcome message now, thanks.I'm really surprised you don't see the option in the checkout page.Here's what I can see:I had a problem earlier where people viewing in their local currency couldn't see the option to pay with Bitcoin, but I thought I fixed that by disabling non-USD viewing on the site.I've disabled other forms of payment, now this is all I see:Can you please check the website again? I would really appreciate it if you can help me solve this issue!Quote from: dkbit98 on June 06, 2023, 07:57:49 PMPSI sure won't buy those binance branded stuff  LolI've removed the Binance items from the site.",

Maybe the reason is because I didn't fill up all my personal information and shipping address in checkout page, and this shows up later.Good that you are using BTCPay Server, but my suggestion is to add clearly visible bitcoin payment options in places I mentioned.Quote from: jackmurray on June 06, 2023, 07:40:48 AMWe can resell anything that is available on https://aliexpress.com/, if anybody has any requests please let us know!Should we contact you on website with email or some other way, and what are the prices compared to Aliexpress?I also know another website that cloned Aliexpress website with similar name, and they accept bitcoin and crypto payment.Quote from: jackmurray on June 07, 2023, 01:55:16 AMCan you please check the website again? I would really appreciate it if you can help me solve this issue!I did check again, entering random data and Pay with BTCPAY logo showed up, so it's working ok.Quote from: jackmurray on June 07, 2023, 01:55:16 AMI've removed the Binance items from the site.You didn't have to remove it but they are not very popular right now.Maybe making custom made tshirts would be cool",
