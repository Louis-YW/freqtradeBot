What would bring you the best success however would be to educate yourself and ask specific questions here in the forum like most people do. But still good look to find what you are looking for, maybe you can post it also in the market place sections but make shure to not get scammed..",

      "body": "I will advice you to disregard PMs, most people are only ready to scam you.The best mentor would be yourself, there are many articles and videos that you can watch.What you have know is the miners (ASIC) you want to use, you want a rig or mining farm. Know the amount of VA (watt) that the miners would be using per certain period of time. Calculate the electricity in watt that you will use per that certain period of time if you are operating the miners. Know the cost of each miners. Get a mining profitability calculator online and check the amount of hash rate that you can generate to get certain amount of bitcoin at certain period of time after paying the money required as fee by the mining pool because every mining pool has certain fee they do deduct from each reward that they want to give to their miners for the hash rate they are going contributing.Get youself the best miners.This may be little that I have said already, go online and study about mining yourself to know if mining bitcoin is for you or not.",
