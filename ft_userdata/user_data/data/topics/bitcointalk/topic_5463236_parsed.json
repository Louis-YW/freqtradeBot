Moreover, apart from the river Niger, Niger is also blessed with \"Uranium\" a natural resources that can be used to power it's own electricity if cut off by the Nigerian Power Electricity & Distribution Company. Or likely diverse to using Solar for generating electricity, since Niger is characterized by having a hot climate.",
