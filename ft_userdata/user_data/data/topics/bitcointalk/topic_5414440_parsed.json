But if you want bsc network then wait for binance launchpad projects cause they are launching normally on bsc network as its partner with binance. But depends sometime the project is available too on other chains. Can I ask why you preferably on bsc? Is it because of the gas fee?",

Thanks!To get information related to token sales, you will actually get it if you join various sales platforms, for example such as DAOMaker, Polkastarter, BSCPad, Seedify and many others.For DAOMaker, Polkastarter and Seedify themselves, they not only support tokens from only 1 chain but from various chains such as Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche and others.That way, you will be given more options to invest.But for the Pre-sale, I don't dare to suggest anything, because there are so many projects that end in the failure of independent sales. Instead of having to suffer losses later, it's better for you to buy these new tokens from a trusted platform.",

It helps to collect some funds and gives the ability to offer a lower price per token.In my opinion, it doesn't mean we buy tokens during presale will get 100%-200% profit.",

As a rule, coins purchased at the preliminary stage and as part of a public sale have a lock. Accordingly, by the time of TGE, you will be able to sell 10-15%, and the remaining coins will be unlocked in equal parts throughout the year. Accordingly, if you do not return the amount of your investment from the first distribution, then the price of the next unlock may be significantly lower than the one at which you bought.",

Some of the projects that I invested too in some private sales has been down for like its gone already, so better to check out and be very careful. Ico projects are way good than simple degen but we need to find which one is really an interesting project among the list.Usually like tvplus006 said, weve only benefited on the initial unlock but the rest, thats where thr struggle begins especially if the project isnt focusing on things to do and improve on their platform.",

When it comes on choosing up BSC and looking into those newly launched projects you could eventually see that its price soars up plus it is really tagged along with the most popular exchange platform which it would really be that understandable that people would really be aiming on dealing on something which is really connected or related into this platform or simply they had able to see those growths or gainson why they've decided for it to be on BSC chain and just like the rest that had been saying that investing on presale doesnt always end up on a good result.Due to lots of project then risk is much higher when you do really deal up on the wrong project which would cause losses.",

Thanks!As others in this thread have already said, there are a few different Telegram groups or websites where you can find lists, dates and information about upcoming crypto projects. That being said, don't really expect to find neutral information there. You always need to be aware that the crypto space is full of shillers that are just hyping up the token that they have invested in themself. Especially telegram groups are very bad in that regard. I doubt that there are telegram groups out there that are giving good and neutral evaluations of upcoming crypto projects without a bias. If those groups exist i am pretty sure that you have to pay to get into those.",
