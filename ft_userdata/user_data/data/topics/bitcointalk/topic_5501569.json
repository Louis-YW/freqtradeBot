  "content": "You might wanna say \"Satoshi nakamoto got his inspo on how to create Bitcoin from this man\" and trust me, I won't agree less.  this video throws more light on how vocal Milton Friedman was in his pursuit of a free market void of government interference.It's not like the economy back then was shaky that he(Milton) would make such a declaration but it's as if he foresaw that eventually, the government won't have to monopolize the economy and will rather have a strong competition. Milton Friedman was an economist who strongly advocated for free market capitalism. Known also as the founder of monetarism; a policy where the government controls the amount of money in circulation. He played a great role in the economy of the US in his days and is honored for many achievements. More information about his life's achievements can be gotten  here. Could there be a possibility that Satoshi was inspired to create Bitcoin from the sayings of this man or was the invention borne out of a need to create a decentralized digital currency free of the control of government and central banks?Ps; dunno if this is the right board to post this, of not I'd be glad to move it to the right board.",

We all know the caliber of this economist. He wouldn't have won a Nobel in economics if he were just one of the boys. But I don't think Satoshi was primarily inspired by Friedman in creating Bitcoin. If at all, he/she/they reacted against the rotten monetary system to which Friedman contributed a lot with this monetary theories. If we look for Satoshi's inspirations, it is already clear in Bitcoin's whitepaper. And then there are also those works which Satoshi mentioned in his/her/their early correspondence with certain persons. Also, Bitcoin is generally a modern monetary technology. It isn't just another design of fiat money, so I guess the inspiration is generally taken from the early attempts to create an electronic money rather than those fiat theories.Below is probably where Satoshi took a lot of inspiration from. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/sm5a3k/bitcoin_took_over_40_years_of_development_and/#lightbox",

He said, \"one thing that's missing but that will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash the method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B without a knowing B or B knowing A. The way in which I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you then there's no record of where it came from and you may get that without knowing who I am. And that kind of thing will develop on the internet and that will make it even easier for people to use the internet. Of course it has its negative side it means that the gangsters the people who are engaged in that illegal transactions will also have a easier way to carry on their business but I think that the tendency to make it harder to collect taxes will be a very important positive effect of the Internet.\"It is likely that Satoshi got his idea here or not. This idea may not have even been that of Milton Friedman. He may also have gotten it from reading wide, pondering over the nature of the economy, the government or whathaveyou. Anyways, whichever the case may be, we are seeing its manifestation today. And the government will not rest until they find a way to collect taxes from the \"e-cash method\" which is now a reality.",

      "body": "Maybe Satoshi got his inspiration from economists like Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, but I definitely don't believe that Friedman had predicted the creation of digital currencies and Bitcoin in particular. Hayek also had an idea about \"competing money\", that are free from government monopoly and the most stable currencies become the most widely used by the power of a free market competition, not by the will of the government. However, this idea always seemed a bit unrealistic and utopian. It sounds good on theory, but is it going to work in reality?Bitcoin and the altcoins seem to be a good example of this theory, but they aren't getting any big mainstream adoption as actual money for everyday use.",

Give credit to whom it is deserving. Milton Friedman was a legend in the world of economics and his theories helped to shed more insights on how a perfect economy should look like. You seeing his works as evil may be stemming from sentimental reasons and you are entitled to your opinions but I don't think is be out of place if I call him a hero. The theory of monetarism asserts that the supply of money is the primary key in determining inflation or deflation in an economy. We know Bitcoin acts or can be used as a hedge against inflation and all that and Milton, by introducing the theory of monetarism is trying to say that when you control the supply of money channeled into an economy, you tend to curb inflation, it seems like the same thing Bitcoin does, in my opinion. A typical example of monetarism can be seen in monetary policy. Take for instance a situation where the Central Bank raises it's interest rates to make it expensive and in turn dissuade people from taking loans, that way it has lowered the risk of inflation.",

      "body": "Yes, Milton Friedman was indeed a significant figure in the world of economics, advocating for free-market capitalism and minimal government interference. He predicted the rise of digital currencies back in the 1990s, saying, \"The one thing that's missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A\".Just my opinion, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, might have been inspired by Friedman's ideas. Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized digital currency to operate outside the control of governments and central banks, aligning with Friedman's vision of a free market. Friedman's thoughts on e-cash and his advocacy for a competitive, decentralized financial system likely influenced the creation of Bitcoin. Just my opinioin though.",

Who knows maybe Satoshi, knew the economist personally or he was a role mode of his because Friedman, literally defined what Bitcoin is today. Although great minds can reason alike and foresee what the future is supposed to be like, so both Friedman and Satoshi, might have both shared the same dreams of a decentralized digital cash for the future.",

All we can do is speculate on the source of the idea. From the diagram posted by Darker45, it's clear that Bitcoin has many forerunners that prepared the way for its creation. Satoshi might have had access to the works of Milton Friedman and others because I assume that the Bitcoin system is too organized to be created by a single mind. The government is already devising means to control the sector to enable them to collect taxes. To achieve this they are forcing exchanges to demand KYC and are also attacking decentralized platforms.",

Amongst the ten people you mentioned in your link, I will agree more with  Mahatma Gandhi's prediction as he said in summary that there will be an adoption of a currency based on the principles of non violence and it somehow relates to how Bitcoin operates. Without controversy or hassles. Just transact business seamlessly and securely via the internet through peer to peer.  Banks want control over their customers and try to intrude when they feel you're overspending your own finances. In a way, Bitcoin uses energy, although it's not in the real context we know it as. Bitcoin is a digital currency in which a record of transactions are maintained and new units are generated. Now one will argue that it's not energy that is consumed in this process but the miners will say different. Secondly, asides from the electrical energy been used by these miners , they also use motion energy too .",

Because the rules are already established and known beforehand for everyone to see before they decide to participate. Plus the rules are to be changed, it must go through a hard process which in its own, has its pros and cons. There are many people in the community that say it's too slow and that BIPs like OP_CTV or OP_CAT should be implemented as soon as possible.
