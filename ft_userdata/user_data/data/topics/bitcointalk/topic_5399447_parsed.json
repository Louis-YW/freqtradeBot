But those things mentioned were indeed ideas that preceded Bitcoin, as in result we can safely say that most bitcoin concepts are built from those ideas.There is a good article that explains most of the concepts of the image in a chronologically way, It's worth reading: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3136559, I suggest to take a look at it.",

I remember that when I came here first to the forum in 2012 you could get coins for free at any corner. This made people download wallets, sign up at exchanges und trade coins. Because of that the whole ecosystem started to grow. This is somehow missing in my opinion. And don't get me wrong the coins you would recive then would be maybe worth 1-5 USD but still it was better to download a wallet etc. than to not recive that small amount.",

It's requiring a good tech to be a predecessor of Bitcoin and of course it also requires scarcity of a coin to predecess Bitcoin. We know why Bitcoin is appreciated as a store of value and a competitor needs to be at least similar to Bitcoin's storing of value. Also, ETH is a good quality coin where a lot promising innovation is built. We will see which one will be predecessor of Bitcoin.",

It's not that people don't want to talk about Bitcoin here, but the admin has provided a special Bitcoin thread, and it's at the top of this forum. It's okay to talk about Bitcoin in the Alt thread, but the experts are in the Bitcoin specific thread.",

A community seems like a more suitable term for me instead of a team. But besides Silk Road, there is also Wikileaks which adopt bitcoin too. Anyway, within Bitcoin, there are still projects which give a minuscule amount of bitcoin. A project like Carrot Course is one example of a project that encourages adoption by incentivizing people to learn about bitcoin. Currently, there is also some exchange that gives coins for free in order to complete KYC, but that is the problem. Some people are discouraged by the requirement of the verification.",
