  "content": "So I find myself in a predicament that I'm unable to solve with my wits.I have inherited a Samsung Galaxy A30 running Android 10, from a deceased relative, but not only do I not know the password to it (there are no other unlock methods on it), I also do not have access to the Google account that's associated with the phone.As a result, after I factory-resetted the phone, I am unable to initialize the phone, because it is blocked by FRP.I have tried many methods on Youtube to break the FRP protection, including ADB - it does not even find the device - and MTP - which my computers do recognize, but attempts to use software that access the terminal by MTP have all failed.Since I know which files need to be erased inside the Android phone to remove the password lock, I just need to find a way for the computer to connect to the phone. [And remember, the phone is locked so I cannot just enable USB debugging from Settings app].Any advice, internet?",
