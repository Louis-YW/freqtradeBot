      "body": "I would like to add a couple of interesting facts about this accusation, the accounts themselves performed these merit transactions almost at the day and time, also they seemed to try to cover their tracks by giving merits to reputable and well known members of this community. The only merited user which appears in the three merit histories is ltcrstrbrt and GazetaBitcoin appearing in two of them. In my personal opinion, the fact these accounts woke up/changed credentials to merit this way some post this antique is fairly suspicious, for now I will only step aside and wait for further evidence and statements from people who are better getting such evidence.Good catch Shasan.https://ninjastic.space/user/id/214323?merits",

Proving ownership to this account still shady due to the recent behavior towards merit abuse and potential loan scam. There’s a chance that the account is sold with private key so dealing with this user is extremely dangerous.",

All illegitimate merit will decay, and will account for a tiny and very expensive fraction of the total merit economy. It's basically a rounding error; fight it where convenient, but waste no sleep over it.So I think unless with these a Merit source it is difficult for them to continue to get more free merits and therefore no one will hire them, which means that they are forced to create high-quality posts.Therefore, it is better to put a neutral trust to remind the possibility that these accounts are alts and to take this topic as a reference if any additional evidence is found, and then a negative trust can be given.",

I see that you are quite new on BitcoinTalk ( from 2018) wondering where have you been when this forum needed you? When this forum needed to grow up... It doesn't matter!Everyone has good and bad periods of time...I was lucky when in the 2015-2017 and unlucky starting  from 2019 until now...but thats about my personal life!! Searching for a loan  among community members starting to be a crime? BTW, you asked me how I got these merits ...contacts etc... bare in mind that in 2016 (ie.) in my town ( 40k res) where around 25 BitcoinTalk users and more than 40 miners ... Also 3 Icos started from my town... people are talking each others they meeting etc... I'm not living in the jungle...",

I asked how many can you lend and for what time!!!Lol, both the sentences have the same meaning, isnt it?. Indirectly, you did ask for a loan but let the amount be decided by the lender.Quote from: ltcrstrbrt on December 31, 2022, 11:48:01 AMSearching for a loan  among community members starting to be a crime?Here, your way of presenting yourself makes it look like a potential scam attempt. Let me tell you, even I have an active non-collateral loan from @shasan and its not a crime ;PQuote from: ltcrstrbrt on December 31, 2022, 11:48:01 AMBTW, you asked me how I got these merits ...contacts etc... bare in mind that in 2016 (ie.) in my town ( 40k res) where around 25 BitcoinTalk users and more than 40 miners ... Also 3 Icos started from my town... people are talking each others they meeting etc... I'm not living in the jungle...Now you sound like a (potential) scammer, merit abuser and troll all in one lmao..Quote from: hugeblack on December 31, 2022, 11:17:33 AMTherefore, it is better to put a neutral trust to remind the possibility that these accounts are alts and to take this topic as a reference if any additional evidence is found, and then a negative trust can be given.If the user tried joining in a camp. (with merit abuse) managed by @yahoo, he would've gotten a red mark straight away by now.",

Only because someone manage a bounty campaign can get tons of merit points? Is it that valuable for this forum? it can make that user more trustworthy? No! But that's a human behavior! and it doesn't affect me with nothing!! It's a free world and free forum ( Thanks Theymos and... for this)\"\"I make you a favor you return me the favor \"\" and vice versa.I'm not saying that here, especialy here, does not exist scammers! And I'm not talking about cryptoworld !!  I lost more then 100k usdt  in 2021 in one scam generated by mechbeth arena  via BSC chain...  and even to this day I have not recovered my money.. But making accusations based on \"\"who gave it to who \"\" it doesn't make any sense.When you make accusation you should have some proofs  and \" I thing that..\" is not a proof.",

What is your connection with the user accounts bluedeep, speeder and Averim?Are they your alt accounts? Did you ask them to merit your account? Did you pay them for it?",
