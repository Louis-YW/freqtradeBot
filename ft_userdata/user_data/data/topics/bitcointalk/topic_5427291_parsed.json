They know everyone is overly sensitive nowadays due to all recent events (as they should be), so it's a no-brainer to tell your users that you aren't running a ponzi, especially to those withdrawing funds. If you don't have funds there, you trade less, they receive less revenue.Of course, that doesn't mean you should keep your coins there (you shouldn't, in any exchange, ever).",

But even if this looks like humbly begging for their customers to \"come back and deposit, buy, or trade,\" at the very least, they provide a number of seemingly valid reasons why they're better than other exchange platforms. It's up to their clients to be convinced or not. Of course, not all of the claims could be independently verified, but this is probably much better than attracting clients by paying millions to rebrand Miami Heat's arena to FTX Arena, or to enter into an expensive partnership with the Mercedes F1 Team, or to hire Kevin O'Leary as spokesman.",

Pull all your moeny from a bank and get an offer to come back and get this kind of deal.Nothing surprising about this, if you have had funds in there for a while and did some trades it's a normal business practice. Now that a lot of people are pulling funds out of exchanges I can see them being a bit more aggressive / proactive about sending the emails since yes, fewer people with funds on the exchange means less trades which means less revenue.

Bitstamp is the longest surviving Bitcoin exchange in the cryptospace. Whatever they have been doing, they are certainly doing it right. However, I would not be very shocked if some of those smaller exchanges suddenly begin emailing people informing them of a welcome back bonus similar to what gambling sites are doing to lure people back hehehe. This is normal practice for gambling sites but it would be a sign of desperation for exchanges, I reckon.",

The exchange probably wants to assure its users how competent they are and how they will deal with the backlash of what happened. They are trying to retain customers.This is probably the only move that they can make for now. I can't think of anything else. (If I was part of a centralized exchange)",

It is just an SOP when customers stop using your service.For me, posts like proof-of-reserve, assuring 100% backed, and the like are more cringy than this \"please come back\" message. These crypto exchanges are run on a fractional reserve, what makes them different only about how high their leverage is.",

They were all only seeing Binance to be affected but pretty much all other exchanges experience the same as Bitstamp. Bitstamp will not convince a lot of people just as they are not coming back to Binance as well. People already realize they can trade anyway even if the coins they have are on wallets capable of accessing swap platforms.",

While they are indeed trying to make money and clients withdrawing funds means lesser income and they should do something about it, the context is obvious with what's happening to a number of centralized platforms. While they are a business, they are a business built on foundations laid by Bitcoin. While they are now doing things contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin, I suppose they are still believers of what Bitcoin means. I suppose they still believe in decentralization, 'not your key, not your coins', 'don't trust, verify', and other Bitcoin-related principles. And while it is understandable that Bitstamp did this for the sake of the business, there was actually Kraken's Powell who advised to get funds out of exchanges. And while Kraken was a centralized exchange, Powell actually encouraged people to trade through peer to peer only. And recently, there was also Paxful's Youssef who, despite having a custodial business, encouraged people to self-custody and keep funds out of exchanges including his own. https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1601934200893997057I'm simply saying, centralized platforms could be honest and call a spade a spade. Rather than making people believe that they are a safe platform, that their clients' money are guaranteed safu, that they have 1:1 reserve, that they are regularly audited, that they are keeping anybody's information private, and so forth, why don't they just set it straight that they are a risky platform and that everybody shouldn't be keeping funds in them except those they are willing to trade and lose?",
