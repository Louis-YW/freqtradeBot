      "body": "Bitcoin's ATH and increase has something to do with demand and supply but one thing that can't be removed is about the printing of Tether. Whether we like it or not, that really contributes big to the price of bitcoin.Quote from: Husires on November 29, 2022, 08:50:44 AMPeople's laziness in withdrawing their money from platforms makes real Bitcoin less valuable?I don't think there's direct impact on it. Whether people are lazy to withdraw, it's still the same as what the market is showing. I'm thinking about those news about whales moving funds in and out of exchanges. That don't give that much impact these days until the exchange happens.Quote from: Husires on November 29, 2022, 08:50:44 AMWhat would happen if everyone decided to withdraw their coins? And how will it affect real bitcoins.Probably the impact of it isn't on bitcoin but more with the exchanges where people are pulling out their funds. Demand will be less on them and they'll do something to take back those pulled out funds on them again.Quote from: Husires on November 29, 2022, 08:50:44 AMIf these actions continue, can these platforms influence the price of bitcoin and reduce it by arbitrage or shorting between them?Most likely, yes.Like with what these owner of exchanges done, we didn't even know that they're doing something behind with people's fund. It's like when they're using people's money and everyone gets to know about it.Then, the chain reaction is there, it's a domino impact.",

And how will it affect real bitcoins.If these actions continue, can these platforms influence the price of bitcoin and reduce it by arbitrage or shorting between them?They are actually part of a sophisticated attack on Bitcoin (but this has been taken care of). I call it an attack because it's an attempt to manipulate the price of Bitcoin with control/centralized platforms especially via price suppression/control... it's more like how they control the price of gold. But they are not clever enough as that will be in violation of Bitcoin deflationary/anti-inflation principle. Anyone who is principled enough can always use that to punish the violators. They are violating a just rule and you can always punish any violator of just rules if you are qualified. There is also the possibility of nations/people buying loads of bitcoins that can only be used or exchanged within specific platforms. And the bitcoins could be sold way below their real market price. They could do this mainly to prevent people from buying bitcoins at their real market price to increase demand/price. I wouldn't be surprised if they tag the real market price \"Black market\" price, whereas the actual black market price is the suppressed price.",

      "body": "For Bitcoin to reach ATH or even ATL, this is mainly related to the market movement, supply and demand. The use of altcoins has an impact on supply and demand and not on the price directly. There are many other factors that can affect the price in varying and unstable degrees.What you call Fake Bitcoin is not much different from the creation of alternative currencies, the main purpose of which is to create a trading instrument, and not for developmental purposes. As someone mentioned in his comment above, real bitcoin never leaves the bitcoin network.",

I am referring to all kinds of Bitcoin that is not in the Bitcoin network. That includes all the Bitcoin that is within centralized exchanges and all other centralized platforms. They're mere numbers, IOU. We have to remember that FTX has more than a billion of Bitcoin liabilities but don't have a single Bitcoin in its asset. This also includes Bitcoin-pegged tokens.

Here, sorry, but 50%, in fact, fake virtual assets, behind which there is nothing but burned electricity and not much needed video cards This is normal and will continue this way for a long time. But the topic with quasi-bitcoins, when, based on the balance of the past, “new” ones are credited to you and they are actively traded - pure speculation, and probably almost a criminal way of seizing real assets and funds from gullible buyers. There are no laws, no legal framework, no full-fledged control, so honesty is out of the question .. You just have to put up with it",

So if we remove them, then the population of investors will greatly reduced too.QuoteWhat would happen if everyone decided to withdraw their coins? And how will it affect real bitcoins.If everyone decided to withdraw their coins, the centralized exchange will obviously get out of commission since there is no one trading for the exchange to get a profit.  Exchanges have monthly maintenance, without profit from trading, the exchange will eventually get bankrupt in the long run.  The effect of this action on Bitcoin is severe and makes the price of Bitcoin idle because no one is trading it.",

There was a post here about that ftx hacker who allegedly trade the stolen coin into a token which name has a btc on it. Some says that it was some kind of a shit token or fake bitcoin as you name it.The effect of it is that this shit token are going to pump and maybe there are people who will get tempted to buy it and then the hacker will dump it making those investors lose. Btc ath didn't extinct but the price only drop because of the bear market. Once this bear ends, you will see that btc will make a new ath again. Fake coins on the other hand might have some effect in btc but that was only small.",

Sure, it's a valuable asset but it won't rise if the demands are low. A big competition is happening in the crypto world and investors looking for rare gems where they could invest their stablecoins instead of buying Bitcoin first while looking for that gem.

Even if you don't withdraw it from another platform the demands should still go up. There would always be the \"many\" trying to stock up more Bitcoin than sellers.Arbitrage is a risky method because once the market reacts after they take out those funds, it's more losses than gains.",
