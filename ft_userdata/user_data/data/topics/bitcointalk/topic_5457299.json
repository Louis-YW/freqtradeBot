In general, we would like to know the methods of dark web promotion, and for a better understanding, we would like to know the differences between dark web and bitcointalk promotion (or how these marketing methods can be combined). We are also interested in why Bitcoin mixers are advertised here and not on the dark web.I'll be back here in a few days and for the most detailed answer I'll send $30 in bitcoin.

Thank you for your attention.Bitcointalk is in clear web and for dark web you need an onion version. But I don't think that's what you are looking for here.Your one is an exchange, as far as I saw from the years of being in bitcointalk almost all cryptocurrency projects have a community in bitcointalk. Exchanges, gambling sites, mixers, even e-commerce sites advertised their project on this forum. Most of them are successful. Obviously, you do not have much understanding of so many things of the forum. Contact with an experienced campaign manager and seek their guidance.",

Is it illegal?The only reason that I think why you want to promote it on the dark web is because you don't want to involve in government policies.",

First things first, Bitcointalk is the most active forum for discussion on cryptocurrency. Most (almost all) of the people here are directly involved with Bitcoin. Don't you think it's the greatest place to promote Bitcoin mixers? The forum has a lot of active members. It's easy to understand why mixers want to promote their service here. Besides, this forum is the perfect place for building up a reputation and communicating with your customers.If you are planning to promote your exchange here, get a campaign manager to ensure the best output from the campaign. Feel free to reach out to me as I have managed a few marketing campaigns here, maybe I can assist you in fulfilling your goals here.",

I don't think darkweb is your best choice since the traffic on the forum is much better and the results will definitely be better.I invite you to connect with Campaigns manager Royse777 and I am sure that he will help you promote your platform and support it with many creative ideas.Good Luck",

Is this an assumption or have you interviewed some mixers here? I think the best place to ask this question would be their ANN thread. Most mixers are quite active and respond in a timely manner whenever there is a question about their service. Most of them are using the signature campaign to promote their services, sometimes review campaigns or some avatar/design contest. I think a review campaign and signature campaign might suit your purpose. Social media promotion is not really worth the time from the participant's perspective which is why you'll likely attract spammers if you do it.",

Unless a company used a tracker in the sig links and shared that info with whomever was running the campaign, the manager likely has no stats to share. Chipmixer is also closed in case you missed that. @OP, no matter where you decide to advertise, if the product is shit you will get no interest. If the project is good, you'll start seeing slow growth. I would advise you to advertise in as many places as your budget can afford and not to expect miracles in a week.",

Even that doesn't give the true exposure a project gets from the signature campaign because the clicks aren't the actual output/exposure but sadly team wants miracle overnight, clicks, and sign up through the tracking link. Most of the projects even don't care about the exposure they get if the clicks on the sig link aren't good. They don't consider the brand image they are creating, they don't consider why people would click in the sig link when they can reach by writing the url lol.",

It is therefore logical to advertise where your advertisement will have the highest visibility, and this forum is a good place to start such a campaign.However, it should be emphasized that it is not only the product/service that is important, but also the approach to advertising in the sense that 5 people in the signature campaign that will last 2 or 3 weeks will not very likely make great results. Quality participants, competitive pay rates and campaign longevity are, in my opinion, the only possible path to success.",

It is used for keeping internet activity anonymous and private, which can be helpful in both legal and illegal applications. For simple understand   I checked and saw the clear difference, of course if you don't want a shady promotion then bitcointalk is most open for everyone to view your promotions and clicking the links on the signature to get directly to your business site but dark web limits people that will have access to your business using specialized browsers or VPN to navigate through. So a clear mind and legal promotion would use bitcointalk.",

Bitcoin users (not Ethereum, not USDT, etc.).Bitcointalk is the most-viewed forum and first stop for anyone seriously considering using Bitcoin or looking for Bitcoin solutions. You get the most eyes from Bitcoin users here. Also, that means reaching out to a general audience of Bitcoin users who don't already use privacy solutions. This means regular Bitcoiners, not chiefly dark web users, who, presumably, if they're already on the dark web, already know about mixers or are using \"privacy coins\" that suit their purposes more.",
