      "body": "Can you tell us that how will you pay the users who work for you? Are you going to pay them half money in advance and half when job is completed or you're going to pay them when they complete the job? I'm quite sure that you will choose the 2nd option because that way you'll get your work done and you won't pay the ones who have completed your work.You already have 2 red tags from the reputed members of the forum and I believe you should stop making such posts because no one will trust you or want to work with you. I don't believe that someone like you will even pay $1 for the hard work of sending 500 e-mails a day and anyone who works with you may get scammed.",

Are you going to pay the users with Bitcoin or something else? Because here in this forum the services board is mostly for Bitcoin payments and if someone doesn't pay with Bitcoin then such threads should not be posted here. I also want to know that what type of e-mails the user has to send because if the e-mail contain something illegal then the user might face troubles. I would also want to know that are you going to have a trusted escrow from this forum or you're going to send the money yourself because if you deposit some funds with a trusted escrow then people may still want to work for you.",

Without specifying who owns these emails, @domain type, are they personal or commercial emails, how will you be sure of their quality, or whether you buy any email and the high price for it, all you will get is being defrauded.150 per day is considered higher than the average wage in many countries and higher than the minimum wage in most countries of the world.",

So you think that you will still be able to pay 50 USD ?Here that person is still waiting for this 50$ for many years now. Negative trust feedback and the flag against you are enough to prove that you are not a trustworthy person. No one should trust you for even 1 Dollar.  Quote from: mr_ROBOTT on August 07, 2021, 02:55:16 PMQuote from: marios22558 on August 07, 2021, 02:47:56 PMStill looking for hiresYou still owe me $ 50.
