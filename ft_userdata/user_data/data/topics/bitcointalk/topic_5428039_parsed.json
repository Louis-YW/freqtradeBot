According to the report, Binance’s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, was unable name Binance’s parent company, as Binance has been going through a corporate reorganization for almost two years.This is quite odd. Looks like a ghost company.QuoteDifferences between the total Bitcoin liabilities were also highlighted. The exchange's proof of reserves shows that Binance was 97% collateralized, excluding assets lended to users through loans or margin accounts, indicating that the 1:1 ratio of reserves to customer assets was not achieved. And in the end, the publish all that useless garbage they call \"proof of resertve\" and they don't have all of it!",

      "body": "the PoRis a data structure that shows binance customers balance is accounted for and combines to a totalalso binance shows they have coin control of an alotment of coins that meet and exceed that total accounted total..the objections are that some beleive that it does not include the companies own private assets and liabilities. but that is a separate account report with a separate report. also objections about binance not revealing all its corporate entities. again this is separate to the customer accounts/PoR stuffthe fear becomes that some hidden parent company could claim ownership of the coin control of all assets. whereby \"binance\" as a daughter/sister company could be sent into some legal system of administration where it locks customers from redemptions. and prevents payouts while then not honoring the use of the coin control assets to be used on those customer due to some hidden contract under the parent company that customers are not aware of..its a simply family 'chore board' where having 4 stars on a chore board = 1 chocolate bar reward at end of the weekwhere they can clearly say the kids have a total of 8 stars= 2 chocolate awardsand the big sister can show 2 chocolate bars in the fridge waiting for the end of the week. however mommy can be malnourished(in debt) and may want to take the chocolate out the fridge to eat for herself to make her heathy. leaving the kids then under nourished. and thats the fear.the fear that if kids complain they didnt get their chocolate and its found out the chocolate is not in the fridge. big sister(binance) as kid babysitter and the family fridge gets locked up with the kid in social services disputes(regulators)but the parent is not disclosed/ put into a social services investigation.  and is instead sunning it up on a beach with a full tummy",

Binance is big and popular with trust of investors not minding it is centralize exchange so people won't have any more trust with exchange and they like to keep the coins within them and that will create dull moment for cryptocurrency. Exchange transaction help the trader alot and if binance go down, it will affect every body.",

This is a good thing, we should be able to use this to feel better if we want to, if you don't feel that way, just take your money out, binance is open for withdrawals.",

These are the sort of small indicators that you might have heard about FTX a few weeks or even months before the total collapse of it. Not only that, even if the company is perfectly solvent, if such talk starts to work it's way around then it can create a domino effect that turns a healthy company into a company ready to collapse. I just hope that Binance have been wisely reinvesting all the obscene fees that they've managed to collect over the years from their many customers, dunno if they still do it but that put me off them for good.",

As far as I can tell, this is standard for most exchanges. This doesn't mean that your funds aren't safe on an exchange, but you should pause to consider how these exchanges hold their customers' coins.The problem with most of these exchanges is that their financial transactions most times are shredded in secrecy. This shouldn't be the standard for exchanges because customers deserve to know where and how their money is used. That was how FTX claimed that they had their customers at heart. Just like FTX is might be possible that Changpeng Zhao is running Binance like his personal business. The most important factor is financial business is trust. And trust is build when clients are sure that their funds are in safe hands. And a transparent audit report is very important to boast the confidence customers have in your business.

This is because Binance is a big player in the cryptocurrency industry that any financial disruption would really affect the market negatively. There have been reports that some exchanges are manipulating their financial dealing to outsmart competitors and gain customer's trust. But auditors should be able to vouch for a company's finance dealings if they are clean, standard and  accurate.",

It's just become quite present on social media and in crypto that it can look to have the best interests of its customers in mind.It may find ways to serve both but I doubt it'll hold back if it finds (more) ways to exploit its customers (like when they kept withdrawal fees far higher than they had to be - though they might've just realised they were funding their competitor).Quote from: coupable on December 12, 2022, 08:54:43 PMUnfortunately, users are affected by the reputation of the provider, and when the options are limited, the pressure is less.Which leaves at least me to question why they've done this now? Why?Less competition = more customers coming to you. Why would you want to get an audit done where you aren't certain you're going to pass the audit? Binance isn't great at dealing with regulators, perhaps it's just not great at communication except for some who want to believe what they say and not verify their claims.Either that or this is some plan to keep them in the news, maybe to make those who didn't want to do kyc come back or to make those who did want to use them more - there's presumably a lot of people who have used futures to gamble in the past and it's \"good\" free advertising for that.",

The result of the audit, in this case, is to confirm or deny the presence of reserves. Reserves - they either exist or not. An audit based on the results can say: I analyzed the transactions: for such and such a period, I recorded transactions that arrived in cold wallets. The amount of income, like this, in such and such cryptocurrencies ... The balance at the time of the audit is like this. The withdrawal of funds amounted to such a sum. Dibit / credit converges, does not converge, the discrepancy is like this - an explanation of the additional expense - like this (these are all conventions, purely for example).But if he cannot confirm or deny, this means that the person could not conduct a normal audit and obtain the necessary data.

This is a company that makes billions and billions in profit every year.There is even a theory that we should stop using them because with more trading fee that we pay, the more bitcoin they are getting meaning eventually they will be the monopoly on bitcoin because they have so much and can dictate whatever they want. No company that big would be stupid enough to make a move that would risk anything they have.",
