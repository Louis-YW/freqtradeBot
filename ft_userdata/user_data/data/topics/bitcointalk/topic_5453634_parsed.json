Feel free to check it, though don't expect it to progress daily! Also, this is an opportunity to take the development discussions into its own topic, instead of having it scattered across many unrelated topics. Therefor, feel free to ask your questions here, even old, recurrent ones.https://trello.com/b/wJOsu12D/dev",
