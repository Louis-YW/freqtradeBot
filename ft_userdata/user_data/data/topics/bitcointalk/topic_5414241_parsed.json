The adapter you bought uses screw terminals, any concerns using these long term? I was originally thinking of soldering wire to a connector.well the plug is rated for 10amps and 12 volts = 120 watts.now that the unit is running on the gold leadex psu it has never gone over 102 watts.it swings from 86 to 102  which should be okay.I am thinking of finding a titanium as I have a few and see if I drop to 79-95 watts.I used 16 gauge copper wire with the dc adapter about 2 feet longMaybe it is 14 but It is at least 16 gauge.should handle 13 amps or 13a x 12v = 156 watts.so I feel okay with the tip and the wire.I will try to photo this a bit more tomorrow.i would think if you have a big psu like an evga 1600 watt plat ot titan you could likely do 9 of these grins and save 110 to 140 watts for the 10 piecesI like playing with lower powered gear for mining.these units scale well compared to the top of the line model.price power efficiency are very close30 x 300 = 9000k which was the price for the big model30 x 1.2 = 36 which is the hash rate for the big model30 x 111 = 3330 which is just about the watt use for the big model.Here in the usa the small one can legally beat import tax.if you get 2 or 3 of them.I think I can do 3 more maybe 6 more. but surely 3 more.",
