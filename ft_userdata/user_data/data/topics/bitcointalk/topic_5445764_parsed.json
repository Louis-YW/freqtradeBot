Most of the gamblers had their opinion towards the sportsbet as compared to the casino games.Football had huge crush all over the world,even the country of most of the people was not involved into gambling.They will have huge interest on the football because of the legend player like Messi and Ronaldo.This two players had created huge response on the game of football.Most of the predictions was made using this two players involved games as compared to other games.",

I don't have a crystal globe but I do have a significant amount of experience. if you have any particular match in mind, feel free to post it here.",

So what's you're prove of experience that has always worked?",

      "body": "Thanks to those that welcomed me and rest assured I will keep my posts within the platform guidelines. The purpose of the post is a mix between education & entertainment.In regards to request on proofs, imo not much proof can be provided by anyone that claims to have experience with match predictions. The best proof is a test run on multiple matches over the course of several days, maybe even weeks. Those results speak more than any screenshot, as images today can easily be edited. Should I mention I've had pre-match bet on Real Madrid when they played on Anfield against Liverpool? Should I mentioned I've staked more, again on Real Madrid when Liverpool had 2-0 from the 14th minute? What value would those claims have? Or a screenshot with the bets for that matter. For this reason I was requesting potential challenges, basically matches for which users would be interested to see my opinion on.As for the math behind analysis, again I believe each bettor has their own strategies. There are literally tens of variables that mix up in the decision, from sentimental value to X or Y team or even a particular player or more for that matter, up to weather, up to team mental state, the referee that will keep the match in place, the stakes as is it a battle for a certain position in a league or is it a cup event in which one of the teams get to be eliminated, and so on. What I can say on this is that through my course in the sports betting world I've learned that there are cases where it's best to make a decision based on few elements, and there are cases when you need to consider more elements in order to make a decision. The key metrics that tell me which case I have in front of me when looking at a scheduled match is a mixture between stake of the match and odds offered by 2-3 bookmakers. Odds are basically a particular metric that dictates how the market is moving, but at the same time they are benchmarks on the match outcome in many cases.Ultimately there is another highly important aspect in regards to the odds of a match, depending on the bet that you take in consideration of course. Most of the bettors out there stake the odds, it doesn't matter we're talking about 1 match or multiple matches on an accumulator/combo ticket. I think like this when ever placing a bet, at least in the past 7-8 years: don't play the odds, play the win. If you want to place a 100 units (EUR, USD, etc) bet on a match for which say over 2.5 goals offers you a 1.6 odd, but notice another match where maybe over 1.5 goals offers you a 1.5 odd, and in your personal opinion, the 1.5 goals might be 10-20% easier to be attained, then bet on the 1.5 odd. Don't let greed overcome your judgement to place on the 1.6 odd just because you would win 10 more units.Since no one has placed any match requests, I would like to add 2 matches I've been considering for today (22.03.2023):France U19 - Northern Ireland U19 [ over 3.5 goals @2.05 ]England U19 - Hungary U19 [ over 3.5 goals @2.00 ]In both cases the favorites play at home and it's their first match in the qualification stage. At the same time, both France and England have opponents with which they can register high scored goals results. A safer run would be to clock both games for over 2.5 goals each, however lower odds of course. Will rest the analysis here.*Would also mention that this is not a financial advice and that you are entirely responsible in regards to any decision you might take about the posted matches above.",

      "body": "when you average the number on a daily basis it gets you somewhere indeed, however mostly at least in the past 8 years I've preferred live betting sessions. at the same time, most of the matches are scheduled during the weekend, therefore Friday-Sunday runs. probably my longest betting session during a weekend was close to around 30 hours. so getting back to the 12-15 average / day, that's totally offset as I've had loads of weekends with hundreds of bets placed, even some with thousands.could not provide a precise winning % even if I wanted to. about 300k predictions I have stored and tracked, and for those the win rate would be in the 60%+, without taking in consideration correct score predictions as those are close to impossible, more like luck bets.the odds I usually like playing are within the 1.80-2.20 range but it depends on multiple variables as I described in my previous reply on the post. I won't disconsider an event that has a say 1.40 odd, however will get quite mad losing on that.  overall the mindset is \"play to win\" not \"play the odd\" or \"play Messi\" or \"play Chelsea\" etc.between pre-match & live betting I will always go for live betting. there's no level of comparison from multiple points of view, but it also depends a lot on the bookmaker/platform.",

I've stated above why posting \"evidence\" is pointless as anything can be manipulated these days.the math behind the first match has nothing to do with the result. excluding the goal, France had 4 shots on target in the 1st half, and only 2 in the 2nd half. still 6 extra shots to score against Northern Ireland. another vertical to be considered, France had 6 corners while Northern Ireland had 5. a match with good numbers overall, except for the score table where almost nothing happened.for the 2nd match stats were even worse. England had 2 shots on target beside the goal they scored, 1 shot in each half. there were 11 corners in total and for some weird reason 7 minutes of extra time.France U19 - Northern Ireland U19 [ over 3.5 goals @2.05 ] (final score 1-0)England U19 - Hungary U19 [ over 3.5 goals @2.00 ] (final score 1-0)interesting how 2 matches with favorites having under 1.20 odd to win had each only 1 goal scored. moving further.",

I personally beg to differ. you also stated that \"gambling is actually a game of luck\" and that as a general statement might be true. however sports betting has been around humans for the past 2.000 years, and basically represents the backbone of trading. I wouldn't mix it with other gambling activities like for example slots, craps, roulette, etc. and of course, democracy so have no problem with you ignoring the post.

I do however agree that every sport bettor should be able to carry his own analysis for the bets he/she plays. again, I never claimed to have any crystal globe or anything like this. don't see the reason why you brought addiction into discussion, but will add that it's a huge problem and those that face it should require proper help and distance themselves from temptations.",
