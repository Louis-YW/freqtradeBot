As far as I know, there is no trading bot or trading strategy that I have a cross that generates guaranteed daily profits. Why do i feel this might turn out to just be some ponzi scheme?",

      "body": "What's with the specific number for profits? 1.2 and 1.8% are really odd numbers to choose from. If you want a catchy marketing slogan, I think \"more than 1% daily profit\" is a better term. Without the guaranteed promise of course, unless your product is just a ponzi.Everybody is definitely interested in a good tool to make daily trading easier. If your software is built properly, it will definitely have its use. But if it is just a scam tool, you'll probably get a ton of negative feedback/trust. Try to share the code for the basic version, then you can gradually build a premium one. Going open source is a good idea, especially when there are many open-source tools available that do more or less the same thing without any shady promise.",
