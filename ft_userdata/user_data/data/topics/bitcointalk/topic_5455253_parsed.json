Some of them may be real gamblers and some are just influencers. After all, we don't know whether they play gambling like us or just promote the casino. But if they often share referral links on their social media pages, they also hope to get income from what they do. This can be seen from their followers on each social media, so we can only imagine how much their income will be if half of their followers become their referrals. And that's one way to get passive income and they really know how to use that social media.",

This will actually increase the number of new users who have not jumped into the world of gambling, while gambling influencers, surely he found many gamblers who made many accounts on many gambling platforms, it was indeed good, but gambling influencers were very rarely followed/followers .",

However, I'm talking about accounts where gambling can be advertised. Influencers here can cover various content, from lifestyle to humor. Gambling can be advertised not only on accounts solely dedicated to gambling. This top focuses on accounts in different spheres where gambling is promoted, so the audience here is more receptive to such advertisements than with any other influencers. It doesn't include the largest accounts such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Selena Gomez, etc., because it's not about the most popular influencers in general, but rather about influencers where gambling can be advertised.",

Influencing just need you to have an online audience of loyal followers so you get a result when you advertise for products that you're promoting on your channel.Unless you're a review influencer in that case you have to make use of the casino so you can give your opinion based on what you feel while using the casino. If you don't use the casino then your review will be fake and you'll get exposed by those that have used the casino. Most influencers just use their fame to sell products and make money, if you look at the celebrities that advertise a product, you'll observe they don't use that product in most cases and that's exactly what influencers do. They're just a marketing tool.",

All influencers can not be gamblers. You being an influencer can be otherwise called a marketer. As an influencer with large number of followership, you can see monetize it and do a good marketing job with it to your larger followers who are into it in one way or the other. It does not necessarily means that before one can market or influence a product on their followers, one must be up and doing in  that product. The product company sees you as a good point of contact to the larger populace or consumers so the assume you could be of good importance to them hence they need your services to influence your followers.",
