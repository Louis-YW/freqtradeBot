You will see many of them fall back from where they started from. The worst part is that this could be their all-time high because people will leave them for new ones that will come in the bull run season after 2026 just like they left those coins that were created before 2020 in this last bull run. Be careful of altcoins.",

Research, test, and see for yourself. No one asked you to go for Bitcoin and if you do not understand it then leave it. We are not forcing it upon you and neither is Bitcoin forcing you to buy it. I agree on one point that it is now not as easy as it was 10 years back when the price of Bitcoin was under the reach of everyone. Being said that there is a concept DCA which anyone who understands the potential of Bitcoin in the future is doing. Before coming into any conclusion like you have done now try something that is being used to make yourself financially free. Altcoins except those that have established themselves are risky investments. I have been here for 6 years now and I have seen how altcoins come and go. Every year a new concept pops up and every time it uses the same narrative which is to get rich quickly. For me that is a myth and trust me you will face a dilemma as to what to do when you face a big fail in this industry.",

People that lure people to invest in shitcoins / memecoins and wasteful projects are making the real money without investing in bitcoin.If you are an user that doesn't want scam anyone launching fake project or you don't want gamble your money with altcoins you must learn what is bitcoin and why is different from crypto.

Go study more, you need it. Altcoins are more volatile, as is the risk, so when the market is green, you will make a significant profit, but when the market crashes, so will your money. The larger the profit, the greater the risk.  Also, alt coins are unreliable and have a tough time recovering from crashes.",

Maybe there are altcoins that can bring someone those profits, but there is an ocean of altcoins, so it is not easy to navigate it to find the right coin. And also, crucially, find the right time both to buy and to sell. If someone wants to experiment and take that risk, they are welcome to try.

You cannot borrow money to invest in bitcoin or use money for important issues to invest in bitcoin because it will disappoint you are you will run at big loss.Bitcoin is for both the rich and the poor as long as you have a discretionary income to invest. You can use DCA to buy bitcoin for as low as $10 every week consistently and persistently to build and grow your bitcoin portfolio overtime. You must not buy a whole bitcoin.Your information is misleading on bitcoin and advising people to buy shitcoins. Newbies should not listen to OP because bitcoin is tested and has great potential with solid background. If you invest in bitcoin and hodli for long, you will not regret your action because you will make profit and it will also keep the value of your money from inflation.Altcoins are like gambling and the chance of losing your money is 50-50 because a lot of them have crashed in the past since the dev only created them for pump and dump to scam people of their hard earned money. Altcoins will burn you and you will be crying to people around you.",

Quote from: ContentWriter on July 28, 2024, 01:41:42 PMFor me in practice, I hardly have made any serious gains from Bitcoin, Yeah, apart from using it as a payment medium for jobs I do for clients. Are there other ways people like us who are late adopters benefit from Bitcoin?I don't think Bitcoin is for you because you can't hodl it for a long time. You also have a bad perception about profiting from it because you believe that only early adopters can make profit.Quote from: ContentWriter on July 31, 2024, 05:12:08 PMFrom what I've seen so far, Telegram is the future of bounty and token hunting. I'm afraid platforms like Bitcointlk have seen their best days. What do you think?How much have you made from bounties so far? You are free to join telegram and make money. But from my experience, 99% of these projects are fake. This telegram hype will gradually fade out; Bitcointalk has stood the test of time.",

Actually, Bitcoin has shown its value again and time yet again. It's a groundbreaking technology, a store of value, and an inflation-hedge. I know you're drawn to altcoin because of its promise for fast wealth. Those are dangerous, loaded with pump-and-dump scheme and scam.The real issue here is not Bitcoin, it's your approach. It's about knowing the principles, doing your homework, and seeing long term. Those that make sensible Bitcoin investments are realizing actual gains. I thus advise you to stand back and educate yourself before discounting Bitcoin. Discover blockchain technology, grasp market patterns, and create a sensible investing plan. Recall in the realm of investing that knowledge is power. And knowing the correct information will help you to make Bitcoin a useful addition to your portfolio.",
