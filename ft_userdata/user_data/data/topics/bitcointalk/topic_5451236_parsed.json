Any hints appreciated.Thanks.KeyHunt-Cuda version doesn't support for p2sh and bech32 addresses at the current moment and there has been no updates that would add that support in the program. I think the developers aren't interested in adding support for those addresses or they might have given up on the project.your best bet is to add the support of those addresses yourself as the program is open-source and can be modified by anyone. But, that requires programming skills, however, if you aren't a programmer than you can hire someone who might do that for you.",
