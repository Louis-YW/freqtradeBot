This year and the next we won't see anything happening. By end of this year, G20 might release a paper on how to tackle and control the crypto space. Since we are in India we can expect some of those recommendations to be added to the existing law by 2025 or later.",

      "body": "Nothing will happen well that I am sure about. Most probably your earnings through Bounties, freelancing, and others that are not part of trading might incur a 30% tax. I also expect after 2023 there will be a separate department that will only monitor crypto. I also expect many strict laws for those who are not paying TDS. I am also expecting stringent actions who are caught evading tax. The list continues as it is not looking good now. My advice to you is to have patience and wait. Do not jump to any conclusion now. The more you think about the future the more you will be depressed.",

Will it be a new tax law to suck the blood out of us or will be it against the local exchanges & international exchanges. If you have anything on your mind then go on and reply. I don't think that the government is in hurry to ban or regulate cryptocurrencies anymore. By bringing the crypto trading under the harsh taxation rules last year, they have already curbed the Indian crypto market effectively. I haven't read the state of affairs of the Indian Exchanges for the financial year 2022-23 but I'm not very optimistic. I am estimating a drop of 80% in trading activity in comparison to FY 2021-22. If you hear the recent statements from the government ministers and officials, you will notice that the narrative has changed. Till 2021, the government was proactive in banning or controlling the crypto. But since last year, you will see that they are deviating the topic by citing the need of international collaboration due to the possibility of regulatory arbitrage. They know that the market is effectively dead by their absurd tax rates and TDS requirements that they don't have to do anything proactively anymore. Cryptocurrency Bill which was listed under the agenda for Parliament in 2021 is no more on the schedules this year.",

Â They are already doing their next move. They are talking about this issue in international forums like G20 and other international conferences and making sure to create a unanimous opinion about Cryptocurrencies among major developed and developing economies because only this will allow them to actually execute a complete ban on cryptos otherwise the ban would just be on paper and not in reality.",

Most probably we will hear such news after July of this year.If this happens, i think it will mostly be because of the scams that have been going on unabated in the name if crypto-investments. Who knows how many people lost money in the crypto MLMs and token scams where actual salesmen were selling tokens to uninformed residents of tier-2 and tier-3 indian cities. It will be nearly impossible to nail the actual culprits I guess and the P2P traders would probably be the first ones to go.It is a sad state of things really and this is a problem that governments all over the world would probably be grappling with. In a country like ours, the sheer size of population and aspirational behavior (greed?!) of its people makes the problem multiply manifold. If and when this purge happens, its going to be a major case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",
