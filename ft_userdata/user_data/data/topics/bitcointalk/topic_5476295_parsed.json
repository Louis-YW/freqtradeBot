  "content": "Found this on ebay and thought I would bring peoples attention to it. Being part of the forum and owning genuine gekkoscience products I haven’t heard of anything of the sort from sidehack and the team. Just a headsup that its using the gekkoscience brand to mislead people into thinking its their product. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/196106676967?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=3ndlbsq8tu-&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=m7NV-5oRR3q&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY",

It was a fair assumption to make and I appreciate you looking out for people and Sidehack's brand. So I've been a long time lurker, first time poster here on the forum. Been involved with BTC since 2011 and a good friend of Sidehack for a while. As mentioned, a formal announcement is coming on the SmartHub. The site plastered on the eBay listing you posted is mine.
