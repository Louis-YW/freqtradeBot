I wonder where those funds will move though, if they're just going to be held in cash and the manager wants an exit from the bond or if they'll be converted into stocks/property over time - doesn't look like enough to cause a bubble unless they mess up.",

Now the situation is reversed, because everyone needs money.The bank puts out the fire with money and buys long-term bonds to make them more popular.It is difficult in a crisis to force investors to buy long-term bonds when it is better to be with money and buy shares of fundamental enterprises that have fallen in price.",

Gilt bonds are mostly purchased by the institutional investors and they usually invest a lot of money into such bonds. It's good to see that UK government is solvent and is able to deliver on their commitments. However, I noted that this is actually not a buyback of expired bonds, but ongoing bonds which will be done through auctions. Not sure what's the strategy behind this but I am sure that the UK market will cheer about this news!",

Although I could be underestimating the value global investors place on the US economy.I think in 2020 or 2021 the federal reserve also bought up a large segment of the US bond market. It would seem that the UK is following in the feds footsteps as far as its bond purchasing go.Japan and china were two of the largest holders of US bonds. Federal reserve purchasing of US bonds could have bailed both nations out on any losses they might have sustained HODL'ing them. Not certain on who the largest HODLers of UK bonds are. The bank purchasing bonds from the largest HODLers could save them from taking losses during an economic downtrend. But there are other motives and reasons which could be behind it as well.",

What Truss wanted to do is cut taxes and increase spending, which is crazy. It's as if a family that is having trouble making ends meet because they have several loans and high fixed expenses, comes up with the solution to the problem of taking more loans and working less.UK cuts taxes, boosts spending, accelerating pound’s slideTax cuts tend to work if they are accompanied by reducing public expenditure, not the other way around. I can also be a UK PM like that: I cut taxes so that people have more money available and I spend more from the government so that people have better services and stimulate the economy with public spending. The problem is, it's a direct path to bankruptcy and that's how the markets have understood it.",
