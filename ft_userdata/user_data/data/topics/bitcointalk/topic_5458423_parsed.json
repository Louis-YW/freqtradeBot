Looking forward to hearing your insights and opinions!\"OP I'm not really seeing any pump on Bitcoin now, rather I would call it retracement, I believe it just normal demand and supply, the price was $36k sometime ago which later fall to $26k there about but am not sure on the exact amount and now it has started retracing back which is normal market movement, so for now I wouldn't call it a pump on less it breaks $36k. Secondly I don't think Bitcoin moves based on speculation and news because is not a Meme coin that moves based on speculation and news",

How do you think this pump will impact the overall cryptocurrency market? Looking forward to hearing your insights and opinions!\"What drives any pump in bitcoin can simply be summarized to be high demands. Now the question is what creates or brings about this high demand, I would say it news surrounding it. Take for example the recent announcement of many institutions looking into Bitcoin ETF this caused a little FOMO and people started buying and this caused the pump. Another reason again could be government policies, should a top country relaxes there policy against bitcoin it becomes news and insights demand. But the major reason for bitcoin pump is usually the halving period. Before each halving period many investors rush to buy bitcoin because they feel the reduction of its availability will actually cause it to become scarce and expensive. For example a block mined is rewarded at 6.25 bitcoin after the next halving it reduce to 3.125 which would make it expensive. So this demands actually cause the pump we see",

Yes. It can't be denied that whenever there's a good news like those Bitcoin ETF applications, that really drives the market positively.

Before the halving in 2024, likely in April, we will not enter a new bull market. I can not know when it starts but market is still bearish.Bearish before a bull run so I don't think sell now, believe in a prediction that market will dive again, and buy back is a good plan. We can not outsmart the market so if we have coins, hold them and don't sell them within few months before a halving next year.Big news will not come in bear market and believe that it will come in these days is not realistic.",

Just because halving is coming in 2021 doesn't mean we have seen the lowest price for Bitcoin this year.",

Well, i will like to say that it's a combination of the aforementioned factors but you need to have the understanding that these factors only have a little percentage of the rate in which they influence this, the major drive in this is the supply and demand market flow for the bitcoin network.Quote from: Researchoo on July 03, 2023, 11:37:35 AMHow do you think this pump will impact the overall cryptocurrency market?

This was actually pretty small going back to above $30k and if you zoom out a little you can see that we have been seeing a pattern of ups and downs that are inside a fixed range between $25k and $30k ever since March (about 3 or 4 months).In other words this recent small rise doesn't really need a major news. However if price broke out of $35k resistance, that would be a different story.",

Plus . I don't understand this so-called enthusiasm sometimes, especially in cases when it comes from the same that put memes with Bitcoins rising up 1000000000% times since 2009, for gods; sake if we go back all this \"pump\" has managed to do is give us 50% on the December 2017 pump, and once you count those 6 years in the equation it stops being such a formidable thing.Just as you said, many 1 million by Christmas newbies are going to have a disheartening surprise.

Do you believe it was primarily driven by positive news, investor speculation, increased mainstream awareness, or a combination of these factors?All of the factors you mentioned, some do influence the bitcoin market price. Because actually the most important thing in bitcoin price movements, namely about demand and supply availability in the market. So that is the main factor that makes the price of bitcoin increase or decrease. But what makes the demand for bitcoin assets, namely there are several factors, and some of which you have mentioned. As an example of positive news about bitcoin, it will definitely make someone's mind interested in buying and owning bitcoin, and if there are many people who are affected by positive news about bitcoin, it will definitely make the demand in the bitcoin market increase.And regarding the recent bitcoin price, I think it's all a surge in buying by bitcoin investors, aiming to hoard more of the asset, in preparation for the upcoming bitcoin halving.QuoteHow do you think this pump will impact the overall cryptocurrency market?

But knowing exactly what created the demand, is close to impossible 'coz there are many factors affecting the demand; news, communities such as this forum, big investor manipulation, month of the year(?), issues and more. Bottomline is demand. But if we would base in this industry  solely, this might be because of the upcoming halving. Indeed there's still a long way but that's just how powerful expectations are. Many people in this industry know what happened with the previous one therefore many investors are accummulating at this piint even if there's a chance for a lower market price along the way.",

And because the popularity of Bitcoin is increasing, it makes some parties who don't like Bitcoin make a lot of negative news so that Bitcoin can't rise and fall deeper.But that won't stop Bitcoin because Bitcoin has become stronger than ever. And negative or positive news will be fuel as a price increase. The pump that comes into the market may be a push for the price to increase, no matter what's going on out there. And when it does, there's no stopping it.The pump that comes is a process to return the price to its original highest price and to push the price up even higher. But the price is still inclined sideways for now because there is no significant price increase. Maybe soon it will happen but maybe we will see another correction before it happens.",
