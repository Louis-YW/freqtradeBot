  "content": "Hello everyone,I would like to hear your feedback on the following.This will be like a raffle or lottery, but with a twist. It will be based on smart contracts. The contract works like a traditional lottery. You buy a ticket to participate, and if you're lucky, you win a share of the pot. The ticket price could be set, for example $10 worth of coins. The lottery runs in rounds, each lasting 10 minutes. At the end of each round, the pot is distributed among a random number of winners. The contract is designed to be fair and transparent. The random number generation is based on blockchain data, so it's impossible to predict or manipulate. There are also some safety measures in place. The contract owner can add funds to the pot, but they can't withdraw them. This is to prevent any potential scams or misuse of funds. Let's say in 10 minutes, a 100 people buy tickets, $10, pot is $1000.Then we select random winners, like 36 person.Instead of distributing 1000/36, we will distribute randomly as well.Any thoughts? Is there any similar projects out there?",

The issue is; how will those that will take part in this so-called lottery be able to trust their funds with you? And how are you going to prove that the system won’t be rigged? That should be more concerning at the moment because AFAIK you’re just a newbie with no reputation whatsoever and I for one wouldn’t want to risk my money with a stranger.",

There are just too many unknown factors. It might be more interesting if it were some sort of player-versus-player (PvP) game, where competitors battle each other. Just my thought.The whole app would be decentralized. It means the smart contract is deployed, the source code can be read and it will be verified (green tick mark in network explorers), so basically it will live forever. Basically to deposit, you just call the deposit function, and there will be a distribute function when the round is over. So let's say even I would create an UI for this app, but for some reason the project is abandoned, it would still live forever on the blockchain. Verified mechanics, everything is handled by smart contract, which is open source and can be verified to rule out malicious code. Actually a contract like this is super simple, so ordinary people could also check if nothing malicious is going on.",
