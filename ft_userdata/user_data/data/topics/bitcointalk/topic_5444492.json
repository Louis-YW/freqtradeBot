  "content": "Let's start why I distrusted you last week.You are an ALT account, digging others post history to make a name for you, throwing mud on the wall hoping something to stickmore. All because you are one of those users who wants to have a space in DT so that whatever desire you have, you can fulfill. One of those typical DT and merit hunters. I don't trust these type of members. Hence you are in my distrust list. What is your reason to distrust me? Retaliation or you found I left wrong feedback to others. Did you find me to earn a bad name in a trade where I did not pay in a deal?Solosanz's judgement is Trusted by:1. Swordsoffreedom (Trust: neutral) (113 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)2. bitmover (Trust:  +2 / =0 / -0) (DT1! (2) 4216 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)3. lovesmayfamilis (Trust:  +26 / =0 / -0) (DT1!

But an alt account could have a bad motive. Just like we suspect a bought account can pull a scam. Does he have a long forum history that you trust him and he is not going to misuse his DT status? No.Most of you are fighting against scammers but consider some of your action that are easily earned by people who are looking for opportunity is not going to be misused.More: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404743.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5402179.0 (most successful one if not wrong)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5395403.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5402584.0",

Did you find me to earn a bad name in a trade where I did not pay in a deal?I don't think you should be worried about this. There are very few people who use the feedback system correctly. Everyone looks for their own benefits, and own interests. I have observed this retaliation a lot of times from some people who take these internet activities too personally and someone took it too personally that they tagged me for no reason. Just because I had them on my distrust list because of their stupid use of the feedback system.Better you move on. Let people do whatever they wish.Edit- I just noticed someone distrusted me and that might be because I didn't pick them in my campaign lol (I assume).",

      "body": "I see trust whoring is still a hot trend. When you wanna complain about trust, it should be about bullying, misuse of trust flag/ feedback. If someone is accusing others wrongfully and others are blindly following, report it, but someone trusting or distrusting someone else is not a good excuse.I should say this here, I very much like the monthly rotation of DT1, even though it resembles the monthly period time for women, it is an interesting sight to see people going up and down, this month you could be red, next thing you know it's all green.ðŸ˜‰",

All because you are one of those users who wants to have a space in DT so that whatever desire you have, you can fulfill. One of those typical DT and merit hunters. I don't trust these type of members. Hence you are in my distrust list. Are you any better than him? You created 25 topics in the last year, half of which are related to the Reputation topic, and the other half to the Meta or DT topic. It looks like you are not interested in cryptocurrencies on this forum, since you only like to discuss the work of the forum, DT or the behavior of other users. On this you decided to make a name for yourself?But your behavior is, of course, not digging in dirty laundry, like Solosanz, it is something else, not in the name of bearing a signature and does not merit, you are our people's fighter for justice, unselfish.  You dug into my posts, looking for material for your next topic in reputation, and you are trying to tell someone else there for digging into other people's posts.I immediately apologize for my crooked English, otherwise you will suddenly think that I wrote this English text with my own hand and decide to mark it with a tag in my trust.The point is I have a history of long eight years. Not a cheap dog who are going away by scamming others. If I have business or anything bad in mind with the account then I would not hang here for the long period. I would farm trust in a few months or years and you would never discover me because you would have been none existed. May be I could do the bad thing twice before you entered in the forum. And by now I would had third pull and working on the fourth LOLI don't see anything bad to create one after another reputation topic against everyone but I have problem if that is an account who joined few months or years ago and doing it to farm trust, doing it to earn quick reputation and ranking up, making it a day job. Only they know what will they do with it but you can not deny the possibility that they will use the opportunity and rob someone when they get opportunity. Don't we have many examples so far? Should I give some names?",

      "body": "I don't agree with the way he is questioning accounts without having solid proof. Basically is x user the real owner and could make that same argument for every account on the forum. Is he doing it to gain rep and merit fast? Possibly, but currently he isn't doing anything against the rules of the forum. If he has questions about a user he needs to go about it differently by maybe going into detective mode and questioning the user in pm vs making a rep thread. You have already added him to your distrust list, that's really all you can do. Just my opinion.",

It's a race if you have an agenda maybe. Some view DT as power. Power to bully, power to threaten, power being in the DT mafia, you have a scam you want to pull off, or power to bring out the real you. Sort of like they gotta be DT to share their personal opinions about a user without facing any drama. None of that is actually true. You bully or threaten users, you face the possibility of being removed from DT. There is no actual DT mafia, there's just a group of people who have the same feelings on some issues. Every DT member does not agree on everything. Bringing out the real you doesn't need DT status to happen either. If you're an asshole or don't like someone you have the right to let them know. It doesn't have to be a public announcement or anything. People are not stupid on here, most aren't anyways. There are some super intelligent users roaming around this place and if they smell a scam, they'll call you out. DT or not.",

Did you find me to earn a bad name in a trade where I did not pay in a deal?It's pretty common that someone will \"retaliate\" with distrusting you after you distrust them... ironically there's a logic to distrusting someone who distrusts you, even if not based on trust feedback or how trust lists are supposed to work. As others have said, I'd ignore. If anything, it's confirmed your theory that the \"feedback\" isn't trust worthy and you were right to add to your distrust list. Well done.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on March 11, 2023, 03:41:27 PMTo you guys, do you see a pattern of another scam buster who are making scam hunting as a day job?Not exactly. I had a look at feedback left from this user and to be honest there isn't a lot of it. At least not in league with the likes of Lauda, mosprognoz, JollyGood and others....Ideally though, let's stick to the reasons why you would distrust this member: trust feedback.Notably the flag against Royse777 was withdrawn which was the right thing to do imo: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=2984(But I don't know if this was simply after enough DT members had opposed it?)However this inactive flag I think should also be withdrawn (after debts repaid to [banned mixer]): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3079I see the argument for the flag at the time, but doesn't seem accurate anymore since money has been returned.Ironically the other two flags are badly done as well... One is referencing a scam claim without any evidence (at least not on page 1, only suspicions at best):https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3030The other is linking to a casino's ANN, no flag-based topic of scamming, how is this even reasonable?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3018I imagine the user has good intentions and just got \"carried away with flags\" after Royse777 flag was activated. But either way will add to my exclusion list until the accuracy of feedback improves. Ideally it will.Have otherwise opposed referenced flags as links are unreasonable. Good chance those casinos are scams, but evidence should be provided for such a flag. Â Solosanz's feedback isn't anymore insightful either.@Swordsoffreedom @bitmover @lovesmayfamilis: I think you should reconsider including Solosanz in your trust list, for reasons provided. Specifically, the inaccurate use of current trust flags.@BitcoinGirl.Club Maybe next time when referencing a member being \"untrustworthy\" you can reference their trust feedback, rather than their personality, opinions, age of account or topics created?No offence but I feel like I had to do a lot the work myself here! Thanks for creating topic though in order to review.",

Quote one or two comments, repeat what was told before, stat to agree or disagree and then leave the topic. Long ago I read an analogy which was like: There are 50% changes to rain today. I agree with you, it will rain but I also think we will have a sunny day today. The topic is done. Good job dragonvslinux, thanks for the time you invested reviewing his trust page. Let's lock it.",
