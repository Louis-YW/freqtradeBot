  "content": "Shiba inu improved in the popularity of meme coin and pepe has rekindled that fire after its initial success, this has spranged up the adoption and development of meme coin where various websites how stating things like \" the next big meme coin \" or \" a random coin is outpacing pepe and doge coin\". One of the biggest issue that influence peoples decisions is that they follow what they had without any further research.Lovehateinu is an example of a meme coin some website praised but has been underperforming after its listing. People should be aware that meme coin ride in hypes and the size of it's community since most lack a need they satisfy. The poor community of lovehateinu was like a flag that should have shown that the coin isn't going x40.Pepe success came as a result of its large community and the speculation that it would be listed in binance, now its listed and investor have jumped to another and those doing HODL like they holding Bitcoin are up for a bumping Ride.What am ranting about is meme coin can make you rich but can also swallow the gains back and the belief that buying during presale is not always right as lovehateinu is a proof. If you are a risk lover then make thorough research on a project before jumping on it and always consider it's community, use(if any), and don't do HODL is not Bitcoin. Read that some meme coin are created via inscription on the Bitcoin blocks and they are the hype now, well I am of the opinion that ordinals are just a phase like having a new toy would be fun for the first time until you get bored and get to another.Chose to post this because a friend bought lovehateinu because he saw it in various websites but the reality was a dip than the presale price. I might be biased on my thoughts on meme so would be happy to hear our views on them.",

Then talking about those who venture into altcoin within just a hype of the project or even the community making too much promises without them understanding the real language of crypto. To me is a game of the wisest, meaning being smart enough could give you lots of opportunities than being just there thinking to make all profits by holding altcoin. I know those who hold for long always engaged their selves with holding bitcoin instead of altcoin. Moreover whatever called memecoin is a pump and dump which I won't encourage anyone to venture into it for long time investment.",

That's why there are winners and losers on this one because the winners have to eat up the money of those losers and the late ones. We can't change the minds of those that have been brought up by the hype of these meme coins because they think that it's the only one that can make them rich. But if the time comes and they're the ones who are losing their money, soon, they might realize that everyone who's talking like this are correct.",

I might be biased on my thoughts on meme so would be happy to hear our views on them.Talking about that, well, in 2019 through 2021, I really made a mess with some of those meme coins and their like, but it seems they are always playing tricks on someone because you can never predict the right token that can pump, and if any investor is buying them, it's never based on certainty. That's why they said altcoins are a means of gambling. I totally made that decision in 2021 through 2022 that altcoins are just a means of gambling. If you are buying any altcoins, always have it at the back of your mind that you are in for two things: either you will make profit if they luckily pump the token or you will face losses of your asset if the token dumps -99%, and it's very unlikely for any token that has fallen by -99% to easily recover, not as if it doesn't, but if they really do exist, it's only a very few tokens. Bitcoin had some very bad downtime in 2011, 2013 A (2013 B), 2017, 2020, and 2021, respectively, but it is still standing and waxing strong.",

One thing I came to understand in memecoins is that you need to act fast especially when the project start to pump really hard.Memecoins are Short-term basis and require very little capital to dive in and possibly gain more than the  initial investment. It is very risky and can be worth it, as long as you don't put a good amount you are good.",

      "body": "when I entered this cryptocurrency market, everyone was more focused on bitcoin, and then ETH came and started to give a lot of importance to altcoins and people no longer wanted profits like 2x, they wanted profits above 10x, which in a way was already beyond the norm of an investor and you started to get into the pattern of a gambler and if you ask me: are people wrong when they seek profits of more than 10x? Today I can tell you that they are not, but I must add something very important: investing in meme currency or any altcoin that aims to make a 10x profit? the money that the person puts in must be money that the person can afford to lose, being more specific if the person puts 100$ in a meme coin?so that person must think that the 100$ is lost, it is very different from putting 100$ in bitcoin that despite the person knowing that he can lose up to 50% in extreme cases, the person knows that he will not lose all the money and will only lose 50 % if you decide to sell, then that's investing, now in the case of meme coins the person can lose everything, this is no different from putting money in games of chance, that's why in my opinion people should only put money that they know that they can afford to lose and they won't miss it, so it wouldn't be very smart to put a lot of money in a single meme coin, it would be ideal to put a little money in many meme coins and then wait to count on luck",

Sometimes you need to plan your target gains if you enter a meme coin or else all your unrealized gains can go to zero or worse, loss.Pepe, shiba, and (should I include it?) safemoon, have big community that is why they have more than a thousand percent gains. If you compare it to lovehateinu, the community is just full of jeets that will just left the community after selling.",

They don't do research but just follow the hype which can lead to a quick loss before it's too late. Although the coin meme is a cake for the greedy who come first, it is not always a good piece of cake. The stakes are very high for meme coin projects and it's really unlikely that they will succeed.

Investments require responsibility just like gambling does!Some people have very good imagination and expect things that are impossible to achieve. They go after a $0.001 coin with trillions of coins in supply hoping it reaches $1. How in the world are you even expecting that my man, Bitcoin bately gets to move now and it’s got a beast of a market cap.. why would a memecoin ever do something better than that?",

For someone who do make out that kind of investment then of course you could really make yourself goes into that sayings from rug to riches but it would really be entirely depending if you do hit up the right spot considering that we do have thousands of degens and memecoins in the market which its been created mainly on BSC or ETH or any blockchain platforms on which it is really somethingthat you could easily make out decisions on which one to choose.This is why if you could be able to bare up with the risks involved then it would be your choice whether you would risk and invest to it despite on having no real use case or something like that or you would really be just simply sticking into those coins who are already on top of the rankings and making yourself at least secure.",
