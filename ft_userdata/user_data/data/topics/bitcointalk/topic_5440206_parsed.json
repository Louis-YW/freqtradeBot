Has any of you had the same problem?You are not the only one having problems with ledger nano x model.This is one of the worst piece of crap hardware wallets available today, and they have many problems with cheap batteries they are installing in this devices.Try connecting your device with cable instead to see if it works, and try resetting your device, but it could also be a problem with firmware update that creates problem.I wrote about ledger nano X problems few years ago, but they are still happening very much, and I heard they have problems with latest ledger live app: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5358741.0",

However, if you really want to stick with them, you'll just have to contact support. I don't expect you to get very far with them though. It's very likely to be a battery issue, that's usually the most common component to start failing this early on in electrical devices. Plus, the chances of having a dud battery is far greater. Easy fix I suppose, although I've never physically looked at a ledger device in enough detail so couldn't tell you if it's going to be good easy for the consumer to change the battery. However, you could potentially have it repaired by the manufacturers. Again, not that I recommend that.",

I've had that model for several years and I don't have any problems, although there is obviously a difference in the quality of production a few years ago and 1-2 years ago.",

      "body": "@HedgeFx Ledger devices come with a 2-year warranty. There was no need to order a new one until you speak with the customer support and see what they say. If you listen to their instructions and it turns out it's a faulty battery, you would get a free replacement and shipping. The battery problem is sadly a common issue with the Nano X batches they have introduced in the last 2-3 years.Get in touch with their support. I think live chat is available only during business hours, but you can always leave an email where they will respond. Quote from: dkbit98 on February 17, 2023, 05:01:55 PMI heard they have problems with latest ledger live app The only problem Ledger had recently was in the synchronization of Ethereum accounts with their servers. It was much slower compared to other assets. It affected sending and receiving of ETH and Ethereum tokens. That was fixed in the most recent LL update. One issue before that was with Tron accounts, but that wasn't directly Ledger's fault. It was to the point that Ledger had a maximum fee limit of 19.9 TRX when you sent TRC20 tokens, but that was common in some other wallets as well. Then the Tron network voted in a new update where smart contract interactions required fees up to 30 TRX. Naturally, it became impossible to use LL and your Tron account until a fix came. After 2 days they fixed it.",

Are you sure about that?This is what their official Ledger Support posted recently, and it was affecting everyone who use Ledger Live app for Bitcoin, eth, sol and near (whatever that is).It's possible they fixed some problems, but there was a whole thread with instructions how to downgrade, wait to sync, and do bunch of gymnastics.https://nitter.net/Ledger_Support/status/1626142335636500480#mQuote from: Welsh on February 17, 2023, 06:18:22 PMHonestly, I'd just recommend changing from ledger.

It shows an error and \"Tweet not found\" notification. The issues with NEAR, SOL, and ETH is the synchronization thing I mentioned in my previous post. It affected ETH and those other two coins. Unless your client can sync, you can't send transactions or see balance updates in your LL if you haven't updated to the newest state. That was the problem. I don't know what issues there are with BTC. It syncs fine on my end. But I am also using Electrum when sending bitcoin, so I wouldn't know what's going on with LL on that front. One thing that I rarely see anyone mention is just restarting Ledger Live if the syncing takes too long. It works. I am not sure how many servers Ledger has, but it seems you sometimes get better and other times worse results depending on how you got connected. So exit the app, open it back up, and re-sync.",

A couple of days ago I checked again and the synchronization went through in less than 15 seconds, but I think that these are common problems that have existed since LL existed.",

It would be interesting to mention this to the Ledger support to see what they say about it. It might have something to do with how many connections are active at the same time to their servers. And as I said in my previous post, a restart of the app can fix it as it might connect you to a different server. Since you mentioned firmware upgrades and I know you are using the Nano X, there should be a notification about upgrading to the newest Nano X firmware version in your app. They still haven't released it for Nano S users, and according to their support, it's going to take some more time before it's ready.Additionally, it's a good idea to do two things before using the LL for transferring coins: Check the in-app notifications if there are any ongoing problems with some coins or networks and checking if there are any pop-ups on Ledger's support page. It's shown on the bottom left corner. If there is an issue that they are aware of, they usually mention it there.",
