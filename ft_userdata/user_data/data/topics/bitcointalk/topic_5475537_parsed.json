  "content": "The newly elected Argentina president Javier Milei have come to the air to announce his decision to shut down the Central Bank of Argentina as one of his new moves as the president of the country. He made mention of this yesterday on his official statement he released on the office’s X social media handle.This is the image here.I have tried to translate it to English using Google online translation tool“PRESS RELEASE City of Buenos Aires, November 24, 2023.-“The Office of the President Elect of the Argentine Republic communicates that the only official information about the future government, headed by Javier Milei, is that published by this medium.“In that sense, the economist Osvaldo Giordano will be the head of ANSES and the engineer Horacio Marín will be in charge of YPF as of December 10. “Regarding the President-elect's agenda, this afternoon he will have a telephone conversation with the president of South Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol. “On the other hand, given the false rumors spread, we wish to clarify that the closure of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) is not a negotiable matter.”From the reactions over the social to this humongous decision, a lot of bitcoin users have expressed gratitude and happiness over the decision including the first thread I highlighted here including this other forum thread whereas others have criticised his decision. However, my question is, if he's going to be shutting down the central bank, what will be the instrument he will put in place of the bank or is he willing to establish a ‘Bitcoin Bank’ or what exactly?",

This kept me wondering how he will go about it and if it is even possible. If yes, how will he regulate their monetary system and will the global financial system will allow it? I don't know if such a thing has happened before and how they managed their banking system. I feel the man may go the way of El Salvador by legalising Bitcoing. Another option will be to adopt the use of foreign currency like the dollar, the same thing Zimbabwe did during their turmoil.  Well, let's keep fingers crossed and watch as events unfolds. I wish him good luck.",

Any action adds a correlation with the previous country. Currency can build a country as well as good and wise governance, who knows when. But we can see the characteristics of an improving economy from suppressing the reduced inflation rate, because to recover 0% from such a difficult condition and it takes time.",

Many of their citizens stopped using their currency long ago as it was way too unstable.A bit off the mark, the inflation will not stay the same, it is going to get worse because that is how an uncontrolled inflation operates, the more your banks print paper money, the more you are going to devalue your currency. Definitely better off using USD or Euro but these solutions are temporary because they are not a US territory and they are not a part of the European Union so it is not the best fix. I do not know much about Milei but there is going to be a lot of things that he has to change and those change are going to be met with some resistance from those that have benefited from the old system. I hope that his friendly terms with bitcoin is accompanied by actions because if a lot of people thinks that bitcoin might be able to help Argentinians to combat the inflation, I guess that Milei using his position to create laws or policies that are bitcoin friendly is a must watch thing right now.",

A whole central bank of a nation being pulled down? Or you guys didn't get the president's gist very well? He might mean he's shutting it for a while to overhaul/restructure it. Because it's so difficult for me to comprehend such as the work of the central bank is limitless when it comes to functions and interventions both at home and abroad. And for those Bitcoin lovers praising him, will he now use Bitcoin to settle international payments? I don't possibly know. I don't just know why folly follows some people around, they can't just think with their brains but with their legs.Central bank is inevitable in every country, perhaps, the guy wants to call it a different name entirely but would still be saddled with the same functions and responsibilities. Time will tell on this as this idea is unimaginable to me, so gross, lame and ill-conceived.",

Could be the reason why we discussing this today with Milei and his decisions to Break down the central banking system.

So how does he run their financial system without a central body? Who will regulate the cash flow in the economy? I hope he has a full proof plan for this.People in the crypto space are happy that he's a bitcoin enthusiast , that hopefully he'll make it a legal tender in Argentina. No doubt this will complete bitcoin adoption in that county, and if it works out well for their economy, other countries in similar situations can learn from them and also adopt bitcoin digital decentralized currency.",

They FR can and will do things that are great for the US economy they can and will do things that may be not great for the US economy and everything in between.How it will effect Argentina's economy is not important to them and if they do something that is good for the US but sinks Argentina into a decade of financial ruin.
