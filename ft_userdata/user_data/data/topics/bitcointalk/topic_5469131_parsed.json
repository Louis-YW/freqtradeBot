  "content": "A newly evolved Clipper and a keylogger called “BunnyLoader”. And we all know that there are a lot of variants of keylogger and clipboard malware that replaces crypto currency wallet with that to a wallet address that this criminal controls. This malware has undergone some transformation already, and it's very clever to see that it will test if your system runs on sandbox and usernames. So the Clipper looks for cryptos:Also looks for this information to steal:So it's very important for us crypto enthusiast to learn how to protect from this kind of malware. We need to install the latest anti-virus, and not just to download any crack softwares as this is where this criminals exploited their victims. When we thought that we can get free softwares, but we don't know that the criminals have laded it with a lot of malwares and we will only know until it's too late. And for the Clipper capability of this malware, we should check the details of the addresses that we are going to send to, make sure everything is correct so that we will not be a victim here. And obviously, do not click any links like in our email, maybe it doesn't look suspicious at all, but if we don't know the source or even know the source, we should be very very careful.https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/bunnyloader-newest-malware-service",

My most serious concern is the fact that the author Poker BL confirm it, to be a fileless loading feature that \"makes it difficult for the antiviruses to remove the attackers malware. Which means it might have been in action in ours machines without our notice, so what then can we even do to stop it?. It's really depressing to find this kind of information that your investments or credentials are at risk using your browsers, and most times we can't even avoid using this browser because they are still very important at same time.

But it seems highly undetectable as per many cyber security experts and can stay unnoticed forever so the best possible solution is to stay away from downloading it in the first place.Here is an article that explains how can we manually remove the Bunny loader - MaaSHow to remove BunnyLoader from the operating system",

However, as far as I remember from some previous discussions, clipboard malwares usually cannot be detected using AV, although I don't know if anything has changed in that regard.Quote from: hugeblack on October 04, 2023, 10:20:51 AMUsing hardware wallets or open source wallets will not change anything here, but rather: - Do not install applications that you do not trust. - Check the title completely, or at least the first and last 8 characters. - Make sure everything is correct before broadcasting the transaction.Today it is hard to believe that an app is reliable (trusted) unless it is an app that has millions of downloads and it is possible to verify it before installing it. Even if it is in one of the legitimate app stores, it does not mean that we should consider it 100% safe - and what can we say about those cracked apps that are downloaded via torrents or various suspicious websites.In much simpler terms, if you know how to behave online, have a solid AV/firewall and don't use cracked software, the chances of picking up something like clipboard malware are very low or none.",

We don't need to wait until our devices are infected by it but avoid any forms of red flags that are likely to get you malware like bunny loader. A usual practice before doing a transaction is not to be lazy checking the address if it's correct or not, and don't get tired of reading each character, letter, and number before pressing the send button. It sounds simple but will help you verify and avoid making a mistake.",

Even with the latest or strong anti-virus they can still get caught and the bad thing is even you wouldn’t easily find out that you have got caught. The best thing is to try as much as possible to avoid downloading just any application and one should check their transactions details like the address properly before broadcasting them. And if you have much funds try to get them off online wallets, don’t get too comfortable with them because hackers can strike where you list expected them",

It's how we can avoid exposing ourselves to these malwares and other possible attack vectors. As long as you're careful about what links you click and what files you download to your devices, you're good to go.  Another note about Antivirus programs is that they can only provide you so much security which is why Antivirus is not a hot topic in security discussions these days. It's nice to have though. For keyboard apps, it might be true. As a matter of fact, Apple doesn't let users to use 3rd party keyboards when it comes to entering sensitive details like passwords, keys, etc.",
