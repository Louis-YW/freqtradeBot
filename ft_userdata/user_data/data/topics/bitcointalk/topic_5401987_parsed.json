Recently I was looking at the Cross Chain Expo 2022, that took place on June 8th, it was exciting to see that some of the projects I have been following for years were there : Thorchain, Thorstarter, Brokkr and it was awesome to know that no matter the market cycle we are in, they are putting hard work to innovate and maintain their relevance over time.https://twitter.com/CrossChainExpoWhich projects are you currently following that are doing these kind of activities and why do you believe in them?",
