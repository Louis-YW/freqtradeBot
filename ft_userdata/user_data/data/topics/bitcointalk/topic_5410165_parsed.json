  "content": "Today, apart from enjoying Indonesia's 77th independence day, I read some news about the condition of cryptocurrencies in Indonesia, where currently, the Indonesian Bitcoin market is less than one percent of the global cryptocurrency market. There are two Indonesian Bitcoin exchange platforms. However, they sell Bitcoin for only a fixed price. Nevertheless, Indonesian authorities have recently claimed a neutral position on cryptocurrencies in Indonesia. #cointelegraphAnd what's more interesting is that currently the number of workers in the Indonesian Blockchain Industry has increased by 43% and makes Indonesia ranked 8th for this category. #tokocryptoI am increasingly happy to be an Indonesian citizen with the growth of the Blockchain Industry in Indonesia because this can be a very positive value for Indonesian citizens who are increasingly liking Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at this time.",

The indonesian crypto space is growing because the government is giving the sector the opportunity to strive in one of the best economies in Asia. I am wishing the entire Bitcoin community more wins until they become one of the key players in the industry.",

      "body": "I am happy for their independence day, and I believe that a neutral stance toward cryptos of the authorities is a pretty good thing. I'm trying to understand, though, if there are truly only two Indonesian exchanges, and both are at a fixed price (not dynamic, like on many international crypto exchanges). So they don't have local exchanges to buy and sell Bitcoin for local fiat, for example? Or is it just something that isn't accounted because it's not really a crypto exchange?",
