Trailing stops are executed below the support level when it is broken, you know that it reach its conviction that the price will not rise again, and therefore it is better to sell. Therefore, it is not placed as a percentage, but rather under the support chart at a rate of 10% to 20%, and not for a specific price, as the support level varies from one price range to another.It is easier in Bitcoin and more difficult in altcoin especially pump-and-dump coins, in which technical analysis indicators do not play a main role, and then it is difficult to identify support and resistance points. Therefore, in those currencies you do not do many calculations and consider any gain as a gain because it may not come again.",

Because sometimes if you do this, your risk: reward ratio for that trade will be affected.Take note that the higher percentage is, the higher profits will be ensure, but be careful, it's still risky.",

      "body": "The percentage depends on the pump and volatility of the coin or speculation of it at the moment because trailing stop can actually get you to stop your trade when you are suppose to maximize your profit. It can stop you half way when you have set the percentage very high, so I could go for 1% or 2% while watching the market and adjusting my stop loss as well.",

When you're longing a position and then move your stop loss above the buying price, that's what we call a trail stop. And because your stop loss is higher than your buying price, if the price falls and hits it, you still get profit, especially if your profit exceeds your trading charge. We all have various perspectives on trailing stops; some see them as advantages, while others see them as disadvantages. That is why we cannot make others believe in you.",

But still you will be calm because you have gained something not just lost it, It took to much time for a person to understand this method correctly so that, he could get benefit from the full pump but keep in mind, it is always your luck and your understanding about that coin, For example, i had a token BS and i want to sell then, at that time price was around i think more than 0.45 and it remained there like 2 days ago and after touching 0.48 it came down to 0.38 and then the next morning it was around 0.45 so i thought it is a good chance for me to sell so i only sold 50% of my token so that i could benefit more when it reaches to new high well, unfortunately, it did not set any new ATH in a weekly timeframe so i had to sell my remaining 50% when it was near to 0.43 well, i am happy with that too because from them to till now, it has not touched 0.43$.The point is, never regret on fewer profits and keep your mind some space to grow and enjoy the profits which you have made, if you were not able to get full benefits from that QNT token then no regret because at least you have booked some profits and you may know the nature of that token very well, so i hope you will get my point, and always perform DCA while selling too.",

If we trade using stop loss then we have less chance of loss. But when I first started trading I didn't understand stop loss and I lost money almost every time.But now since I go to stop loss almost most of the time I can trade and make profit.I think there are many advantages of using stop loss. Those who are big traders trade using stop loss. Trading using stop loss is very safe.",

If I trade gold, for example, I can't imagine myself leaving my stop loss at the same level after capturing about 150 pips in the trade.I have support and resistance strategies that show me the accurate places to place my stop loss, and at that time, they must have shifted ground for me to safely lock my position in profit.",
