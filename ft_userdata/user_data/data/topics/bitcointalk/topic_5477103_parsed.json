You have to do it now. But the arrangements of boards in that forum is not really good compare to Bitcointalk. Everything just in one line and awkward. And according to people the admin is very fast to respond to people there. Bitcointalk will still be the best option for all of us. And the only thing that will make that place boom is the present of mixers.

It is a place of less opportunity.Your point is misleading! 80% of active accounts on altcointalk are teleported high ranking accounts from Bitcointalk.This is not a comparison post because Altcointalk has always been in the shadow of Bitcointalk for a long time, but things are changing due to the forthcoming censorship on Bitcointalk. People value free speech, and removing it would leave this place as desolate as the desert.Take bounties away from Bitcointalk and the traffic will fall drastically. We already have the Nigeria Local board With child boards and that's something we have not been able to achieve here.",

Altcoinstalks daily, weekly, monthly and yearly traffic are significantly low if comparing it with Bitcointalk. It is a place of less opportunity.You are right, if we begin compare the two in terms of traffic and all that, the plain truth be say, altcoinstalk no near bitcointalk for rank, even for activities.I personally don dey altcoinstalk since 2020, but na due to lack of activity on that forum make me later become inactive there, there was actually a time when some bounties where held on that forum, I participated in them, but they were all altcoin paying bounties and most of those project never saw the light of the day, so made me to stop being active there and focus more on this forum.When you say that, those who are active there are people who don't know how to rank up here, that is from the signature ad campaign perspective, you are definitely right to a great extent.But now that mixers are moving over there, let's see what happens with the traffic on that forum, hopefully, this will be their starting point to achieving the kind of record, or close record of what bitcointalk have already.",
