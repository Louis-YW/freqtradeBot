You can decide to stay if you just want to be among people that are discussing about bitcoin, crypto generally and other related discussions. You have your choice to make, the forum takes nothing from you and do not force anyone to stay, do your wish, but this is a nice forum and I do not experience anything like restriction since I have been posting on this forum.",

[1]I strongly suspect that among the four written rules, one or two of them you violated or you don't know it.I think this forum is not suitable for you, some of your posts have been deleted, you have blamed others, you should read some of the rules first before starting to write and fix where you made mistakes don't be pessimistic.But that's okay, if you want to leave this forum, hopefully you can get a better insight into Bitcoin/crypto out there, if you want take care of your emotions and stay positive out there.",

Quote from: BccKing on August 21, 2022, 10:43:00 AMThe manager of bitcointalk deleted my discussion in the altcoin sectionDo you know why it was deleted? I assume that someone reported that topic because you just copied your post from the topic you mention in the OP - in other words, it makes no sense to have the same discussion in two different boards. It has nothing to do with that anyone wants to prevent you in any way \"to speak freely\".https://ninjastic.space/post/60767449  -->  https://ninjastic.space/post/60767464",

As someone who is on various forums for ~20 years, I can say that bitcointalk is by far the least restrictive forum I was ever part of. I advise you to grow a thicker skin otherwise you will have a hard time anywhere else.",

You just need to evaluate what you have done so that the moderators delete your post, this is a different matter than what you call free speech.Having thick skin is the best advice for the current situation but if your interest in being in the forum has dropped then take a break and come back when you have better interests and feelings. But believe me, deleting posts that violate the rules based on the moderator's interpretation is not a valid reason to say you are prohibited from speaking. You must obey the rules, so you should know more about the rules so that in the future not many of your posts are deleted.",

I can only think that you're still relatively new here even though your account ranking isn't really what it is, it's not your account you previously acknowledged in a thread.I don't know if you deserve to announce this departure by creating special thread, but your departure will not be remembered because you are not a valuable contributor like Lauda, ​​TMAN, or anyone before. You come with someone else's look and I don't think you need an announcement when you want to leave. Stop your posting and leave this account forever and live your better life.",

You cannot go to the altcoin section and make statements like the one below and expect your post not to be deleted. QuoteI hate altcoins, they made my dad lose money and they are just imitating bitcoin, a lot of altcoins are just to scam money and then disappear, and the real king is bitcoin. So I call on everyone to join me and only believe in Bitcoin, abandon those altcoins that cheat money, and just follow it!The altcoin board is for altcoin believers, you took the took the battle to their territory and you were knocked out.So, it will be nice to believe bitcoin alone and if you have problems with altcoins, just be specific about the particular coin and not trying to defame the whole altcoins.",
