Of course it make sense, but the question is that this have been thought before and we didn't know if it become successful or not. There is no problem with football, it's worldwide and will continue.So we don't know what will be the next big craze in the next bull run. But just the same though, it's a cycle, ICO-IEO and now we have the NFT and then P2E. But we will have to wait what the new wave will be in 2024-2025. But just like what we have learn from the past, we should be the first in line to be able to make profits on it in the bull run.",

They already have Chilliz project that become hype on this category before when it was introduced and they just introduced the individual fans token using Binance launchpad to gather more funds. I admit that this Fan tokens is really good if you are a real supporter of the said team but having the physical collectible is much better to collect while using fiat to purchase merchandise is much convenient so that the token value will not gonna be volatile.I don’t see something like tokens that will boom in crypto because this is not the type of token that can be used for profit generating purposes for investors because it’s main purpose is for financial support to the sports team where it belong.",

You should just take it easy first, so you don't get hurt too much if something unexpected happens. Although, Football is a good game.Let's look at the next chapters and things that can happen in the future as long as for now let's just enjoy that thing.",

Anything will be pumped during the bullish market no matter what happened with the token even some scam tokens were also being pumped by the whales. In my opinion if any legit tokens that have been backed by a legit parties must be used as a way to make money. The fan token was also a very good thing to be used as short term investment too. I think that fan token was also a good thing to be used during the bullish trend. It will be also going up like whole of coins.",

You're right, it's not good to expect more fan tokens, they don't have a clear use-case or utility. But, if it's just to ride the hype, I don't think there's anything wrong with it, for example the world cup event that will take place this year. I think this event will have a very positive impact on fan tokens, and we can take this opportunity to benefit from riding the hype.But if it's for long-term investment purposes, don't expect more from fan tokens. They won't give you anything.",

Even though on defi space havent heard such hype on this field cause its not a general perspective to a lot of community. Well maybe those fans around the globe but lets consider not all are fans of football ( I am more on basketball such as NBA).",

However, that's a risky thing to be involved in that kind of token that doesn't really make sense to exist n the crypto world. Besides, why hope and expect fan tokens to be created when there are lots of coins out there that are more worth putting money with?Better forget this idea and shift to other plans.",
