The blockchian could help in conducting a free and fair election because data that is recorded in it can hardly be tampered and is also immutable.Many nations are embracing central bank digital currency (CBDC) because it seems to be a better currency compared to the physical or online fiat. Some nations are even engaging in international trade using CBDCs because it need no intermediary to facilitate these international transactions. Using CBDC is cheaper, and faster than fiat currency, this is why many nations are embracing this blockchain technology.",

Blockchain outside of the context of cryptocurrencies and NFTs is a solution in search of a problem, and they still haven't found one.",

This is perfect for digital money.It seems to me that most ideas of expanding blockchain to other uses, which got popular among the general public and businesses back in like 2018 in the naive \"blockchain, not bitcoin\" phase were mostly a misunderstanding of what blockchain is good at and were businesses' attempts to try to channel the hype around Bitcoin and Ethereum toward their own business.I'm sure there are other useful things trustless networks of p2p interactions can do. I'd be interested in seeing a detailed analysis of the actual specific ways a blockchain could be used as a solution to greatly improve specific existing systems. Mostly I've just seen vague ideas of blockchain being a solution to business/govt issues due to blockchain hype rather than a realistic assessment of how it would work in practice and how it would improve existing systems, and how the fact that these networks would probably be centralized in design would deteriorate the potential usefulness of a blockchain for the solution, considering decentralization is the underpinning of what makes Bitcoin special and is the super power of the correct usage of blockchain tech.",

If not it already is our new normal. Everything these days is already digital. It is also about time that the government start to accept development instead of trying to restrain the use of bitcoin. Although some countries are now more open to cryptocurrency than they were before so maybe they are starting to realize the benefits of crypto to their economy. Cryptocurrency is here to stay. Not only bitcoin itself but its system, mechanism, and how it operates. Those things can be learned from and be used to innovate even better blockchains.",

Read these news below,https://www.ccn.com/indian-state-government-will-issue-birth-certificates-on-a-blockchain/Also, there is a proposal going around the land records to be maintained in a blockchain database. Read the proposal below, https://blockchain.gov.in/Home/CaseStudy?CaseStudy=LandRegistration#So the usage is there and waiting to be implemented.

Distributed ledger demands decentralization while governments are all about centralization.In any case I disagree with the subject here, [decentralized] blockchain technology has no use for governments and can not change them at all. And as I skimmed through the article my opinion didn't change. The article simply doesn't have any justification for any of the random examples it uses (eg. using it for land registry, healthcare, etc.).You see it is not about explaining possibility of doing something with a tool, it is all about explaining WHY.Read the Bitcoin whitepaper (again if you have already). In there Satoshi doesn't only explain how this new payment system works. He also explains why Bitcoin should even exist, and most importantly what problems it solves.Take land registration using blockchain technology (which so far has only meant injecting an arbitrary data into bitcoin blockchain through OP_RETURN and still use the same centralized database to verify these), what problem does that solve? Why isn't the current centralized system not working? What is its flaws and how does using the most inefficient form of database aka a blockchain solving those issues?These are the questions they never answer. They just use some pretty words and some buzzwords about a new technology trying to solve everything with it without knowing why or how.The article being old is proof that this is all empty words by people who neither understand the technology nor understand the problem they claim to be solving.",

Blockchain technology is essentially a separate part of cryptocurrencies, but cryptocurrencies have benefited from this technology to record all their transactions since their creation and keep them in blockchain records.About two years or more ago, there was an idea for a joint European project to benefit from blockchain technology in government fields such as the banking, health, education, and even chemical sectors, where this data would be recorded on the blockchain and made available to everyone.I do not know what happened to the project, but I expect that governments do not want to use Blockchain technology because it is decentralized. There is a lot of important data that the government wants to keep secret and not make it available to everyone, and this contradicts the concept of Blockchain in terms of decentralization and transparency.",

Perhaps the blockchain technology really has the potential to transform the governments, but are the governments willing to transform themselves?One blockchain hater said that blockchain technology is a \"glorified database\".

It'll, of course, register and lead to Economic growth by supporting new business ventures like decentralized finance, smart contracts, and so on. It'll also reduce bureaucracy, corruption, fraud, etc by enabling digital identity management in land registries, voting, taxation, and healthcare records. Although there are lots of positive impacts, there would also be negative impacts. They are; conflicts with existing laws, rules, and regulations which would require new ones in order to address the 8ssues of data privacy, taxation, and so on. The second would be technical and operational complexity which may lead to slow operations and delayed results. Also, it'll lead to the redundancy of government in their responsibilities. Honestly, everything that has an advantage also comes with its disadvantages, and these disadvantages have their respective controllable measure and solutions.

The country I live in is currently in the process of collecting data on election results which were just finished a few days ago and are currently still collecting data on vote results in each region. The problem lies in the results that use a data collection system that is very far from the actual data collection system or the administration's data collection system which can easily be changed by other parties.If blockchain is applied to collect data on election results, I am 1000% sure the results will be in accordance with reality.
