If they find links with other account no matter how it happen they are going to act according to their terms. Since the mistake is from your side, and you claim that you gave them enough evidence, let's see what they say. If they say they are not satisfied then they have the full right to say it. But if they decides to give you a chance then it's even better.You may contact their official representative on the forum. Send them a PM pointing this topic and let's see what they response.",
