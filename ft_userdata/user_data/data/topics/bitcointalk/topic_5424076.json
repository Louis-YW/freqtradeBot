Ppl should already be smart enough to not fall in so called \"low-level scams\" otherwise there would be too much never ending accusations against the investor-based games board itself (a board full of ponzi scams). Even scams/hacks are not moderated by the mods here since they know \"the weakest end in any chain of security is not the security itself but the person operating it\". We are responsible for our own acts. Stay smart, stay safu!",
