How is everyone else feeling? Still fine, got used to this, and won't let me panic. I'm long, no matter what the market will show for these drops, I am firm to myself that I'll hold no matter what happens. If you're feeling that you need a break, you really need that so that mentally you'll be prepared for what's gonna happen soon. You may not take it for now if you're still new to the market.So taking a break will help you and will make you decide and think better afterwards while looking at the plummet of the market.",

Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on June 15, 2023, 08:25:02 AMYeah I have been in crypto 18 months now and it has just been a long 18 months and for the first time feel it testing my patience.I will hold though will not be selling anything and just keep reminding myself 2024/2025 will hopefully be better times for us all. Overall since the past 18 months that you have been in this space cryptocurrency has been low in price Infact January 2022 had a closing price of around $38,500 and towards the ending of the last year it fell to around $15k. This could be associated to the fact that throughout last year they were just different economic crises that tested the bitcoin market, the inflation which resulted in increase in interest rate and also bankruptcy of some banks like Silvergate could be one. Another reason that strongly affects the market again is the fact that exchanges mostly centralized ones have been in the mix of either crashing, been hacked or sued like FTX and the current Binance fiasco. This actually has made some investors to take off their holdings into other assets.Another thing could be the much anticipated bitcoin halving period happening next year and according to past trends the market suffers lows like this before the period. So judging by the past trends I would say hold on to your holdings and if possible accumulate more if you have the funds. Do not wait till it get lower than this, you can utilize the DCA method to minimize the loss risk",

If you have decided not to sell anything until 2025, you don't need to worry about how much more bitcoin will drop, and moreover, no one will give you the exact answer to what you are wondering. Instead, you should be happier if the market continues to fall into 2023 because we will have more opportunities to buy bitcoin at a better discount than many others. I myself am expecting bitcoin to continue to fall below $20k this year, and I would really celebrate if that happens instead of being scared like many others.",

Then we will attack with our fiat stash and buy enough to overfill our bags and continue buying as the price keeps dropping. There are few opportunities which one cannot miss, falling bitcoin prices is one such. Don't be of the opinion that the price drops mean a poor asset. The drop will stop at one point and rise will happen, this can be seen from past charts.In trading being optimistic about the asset is a major important thing and for Bitcoin this carries an immense role. Buy when you can otherwise you will lament the loss.",

If you know how to recognize market structure, you can simply establish what the current trend is and whether it is bearish or bullish. According to my analysis, the market is still bullish as long as the price did not falls below $19,000, because I will consider it bearish if the candle in the weekly timeframe closes below that level. What we are seeing in the price is, in my opinion, merely a retracement before the price continues to rise and create new highs.",

I think it will be on a sideways again since the issue on SEC and inflation are still ongoing.There's still no sign of positive market so don't expect that it will recover overnight after you invest.

Personally, I'm greatly satisfied with the current price, and if the lawsuit against Binance doesn't take a turn for the worse, it's very unlikely to see a new bottom.
