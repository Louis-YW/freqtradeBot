  "content": "Crazy Time is a unique live online game show built on our extremely successful Dream Catcher money wheel concept. Now the interactive fun and excitement reaches crazy new levels with the chance to add multipliers from the Top Slot in each game round and in four exciting bonus games. Interactive elements and advanced technology make it possible for players to win different multipliers in two out of the four bonus games. Offering live entertainment with added advanced RNG gameplay, Crazy Time offers a one-of-a-kind player experience, and with multipliers up to 25,000x the fun hits a new high![1]I know that many user here is playing this game so I decided to start this thread since no one is talking about this game anymore. I recently become hook up on this game after watching multiple streamers that playing this game to hunt win. This game is exciting due to its bonus games and additional multiplier round. So far this is still the best game show made by evolution gaming despite there’s a lot of new game coming.Crazy time also now have 2 live games which named Crazy Time A. This additional new game only means the demand of this game is so massive.Personal Betting Strategy: Bet on both 5 & 2 consecutively and wait for the multiplier hits to have a huge win. I hate hunting bonus game now since it’s rarely give huge multiplier especially coin flip that always sucks these days. You can use 1 & 10 bet combo too if you want a hard core betting experience.If I saw that there’s no bonus hit on last 25 games and above, this is the only time when I hunt bonus games because it usually pay massive after a very long non bonus game streak.Personal High Win: x2000 with 1$ bet on Crazy Time. We got x10 multiplier Crazy Time then hits double one time and x2000 to finish the game. This is massive if I place 5$ bet on it instead of the coin flip.Favorite Host: Pavel for the win!I want to discuss with you guys betting strategy, max win you got and your experience playing this game. Feel free to comment below.You can play this game on Livecasino.io if you want a better benefits for playing live games!  [1] https://www.evolution.com/our-games/crazy-time/",

I’m just relying on the credibility of the provider for me to still continue playing on this game. Actually I’m still not 100% convinced that every game is not a rigged because there’s a possibility that they are using magnets on wheel same with other bonus games like coin flip, pachinko and crazy time.But despite this uncertainty, I’m still playing because I can see some streamers that winning huge amount that makes me motivated to play more. I hit my highest win on this game recently after being motivated by watching the video of xposed playing crazy time and win the max win of 500,000$ on his bet. I experience the huge win by myself so I’m now optimistic that the game is probably fair for me. Here’s the video of Xposed winning 500,000$ max win on Crazy Time: https://youtu.be/D4ZaPDdVV2ISometimes I’m spending a lot of time by just watching youtube videos of this game. It’s satisfying seeing someone huge win on the bonus rounds.",

This is the topic I created so I’m free to post what I want.Tbh, I don’t understand this criticism, it’s not even related to the topic of discussion here.

I want to see if it's true that someone in this forum got a big win at this Crazy Time.It’s very hard to measure the difficulty of getting high multiplier on slots vs this game since both games is purely random result. Probably it looks like easier for you to get multiplier on slot because you are not choosing what to bet. But in my experience, I get high multiplier on crazy time than slot since I cover most of the betting option that increase my chance of winning while slot has a fixed winning chance percentage because it’s based on RNG.You can start by betting the minimum bet of 0.2$ and try hitting bonus game with extra multipliers. This pay huge if you get lucky.Quote from: Eternad on March 18, 2023, 04:09:53 PMCrazy Time is the most exhilarating and hype game for evolution gaming.

You might end up winning low multiplier on bonus game but hey they offer up to x50 extra multiplier. You can have a one time big time if you manage to onboard with this extras.Quote from: Eternad on March 18, 2023, 04:09:53 PMI rarely bet on this game because you will be addicted on chasing bonus games that is very rare to come without any guarantee that it will pay a very wholesome amount.

Sometimes the wheel spin sucks when the host can’t spin strong enough to have twice rotation that makes crazy time very hard to win.Most of the gambling game is design to hook the players to play more by chasing lose or having some more fun like hunting the bonus. As the host of this game always said. This is game show and gambling at the same time. You can’t guarantee any huge return on every bets. It’s important to focus on having fun rather than chasing those huge win because you can guarantee fun by playing the game if you will just focu on entertainment.",

He is one of my favorite casters that I'm watching since he usually plays Crazy Time as his main game, unlike other streamers that are more on bonus hunt on a slot.

Many gambling streamers throw 100k or more bets as if it's nothing because their balance is from a casino partnership like Drake.Anyway, he hit 10 with x50 which gives him a total of x500 multiplier on his bet. He bags a whooping 53K in that bet. BTW he is playing during his birthday and you will notice that the host is greeting him with a happy birthday song since many players are also watching his live stream.

I believe yes if the host notice your comment but it’s very hard to do that on Crazy Time since the chat is usually flooded by spam. Ttdante was noticed by the host because the chat is flooded by his supporters post. This is same when popular streamer is streaming Crazy time. I remember @xposed being banned on the chat box while his supporter keeps spamming the chat to free him.",

IMO, 300$ win are better rather than 50,000$ win while the streamer are just act usual losing a thousand dollar.That's the points.Quote from: serjent05 on March 23, 2023, 06:59:49 PM-snipIf you hoping like that, you just like hoping from \"License\" game like Curacao who are not protected the customer by only giving a casino license just because money and don't verified the casino is self scam or not. They doesn't care, a lot video in internet is showing that.It's same like player \"Blackjack\" who can counting card, but they still can get back off by casino because they don't want advantage player while we all know based the law counting card is not illegal. But still, casino push back also is getting worst by not payed his chips (NEVADA Gaming is also not taken any action on that).",

We know $275*2 is $550, so, this is nonsense.Source: https://youtu.be/otse42ToeJY?t=560All this happens on the same stream. So, it was weird as hell.",

      "body": "I'm not a big fan of casino games, I've talked about it several times, but I'm really shocked when I see how with so little money someone can win a lot of money in these casino games, man these casino games even surpass lottery prizes sometimes when we compare the price of lottery tickets and the maximum lottery prize vs the amount you can bet on these casino games versus what you can win, with these multipliers up to 25,000x when the person puts $50 and If you are lucky enough to win, then that person has already secured the retirement as soon as the casino pays himthis means that with these multipliers up to 25,000x the casino will restrict the maximum amount a person can bet on right? well in the OP it says that someone put 1$ in a 2000X multiplier and won, man I know that a victory is something to celebrate a lot, but the guy put 1$, if he had put at least 2$ to 5$ he would have won a good amount of money, and that's why I think that in casino games the person needs at least to have 150$ at least per month to be able to play and if he wins to have a good amount of money, I know that 2000$ is a good amount, but not a very big amount, casino games depend on luck, they are the types of games where when the person wins a lot of money he has to stop playing for a long time",

Sports betting is a bet that we can use to make profits a little easier than a game.So far, sports betting is very popular. Besides that, gamblers can bet, they can also watch the matches of the teams they like.But on the other hand, the games that are played live are no less fun, we as gamblers can also preview the course of the game to make an analysis before betting.In my opinion, crazy team is quite an interesting game to bet on, games like crazy team can give you profit opportunities if the analysis you make is right in this game, you can also place bets based on existing percentage statistics, making it easier you to consider which numbers are right to bet on.",
