  "content": "First things first, I have pretty average memory, I don't forget important things too often, but I also can't instantly memorize things to the tiniest details like some gifted people can.Around 5 years ago I decided to memorize my wallet seeds to have one extra backup method. My main backups are pieces of paper + a flash drive with wallet files.I memorized all 4 wallet seeds (12 words each) that I have very quickly by rehearsing them from memory and checking with the written down seeds every day. For a long time, maybe 1-2 years I kept discipline and repeated the seeds every day, but eventually I started slipping and forgetting to do it, especially if I was busy with something. This affected my memory, and sometimes I forgot or wasn't sure about parts of a seed (2-4 words) so I had to look at it again and repeat it more often.Interesting thing about memory, it's easier for me to repeat them in the sequence that I was always repeating (seed 1 -> seed 2 -> seed 3 -> seed 4) than to repeat only one seed that isn't the first. Also I can't repeat the words starting from non-first word or in an order that isn't original. So to me it's more like keeping in memory one big 48-word seed than having 4 seeds of 12 words each.So in summary, I think memorizing a seed is easier than most people think, and there's no need to come up with songs or rhymes or other stuff, they can probably even make things worse. But in general memory is not reliable, even in long term, so this shouldn't be viewed as a reliable backup. It's just a nice extra layer of backup that doesn't require any complicated setup, and its strongest upside is that it's always with you (until your memory fails).",

For example, using acronyms, where words or phrases are created using the first letters of several words.Rhymes also could be helpful but as you said, you don't need it anymore. But this could be also helpful for other people who can easily memorize or recall words by just using rhymes.",

Memorizing them can be a rather useful way to have an emergency backup in case the paper or steel seed gets lost or destroyed in a natural disaster. The trick to memorize them is repetition and other techniques to make it easier. If you repeat in your mind the seed at least once a week, it gets more engraved in your memory.The biggest threat about memorizing seed phrases is that if an attacker is aware of it, they could perform a physical attack on you in anytime or any location they feel to be convenient to extract the information out of you. So keeping the existence of the seed or even the fact one has memorize it is vital, otherwise, some criminal could take their chances and see how much Bitcoin you have got in your brain.",

The memorizing of seed Pharisees or keys aren’t bad but relying solely on it has the only backup for there storage is what is frowned at The human brain, retains information a lot more than we can imagine. Storing information in the long term memory, require repeated rehearsals and will also depend on the length of the information you want to store. For long, it has been advisable to store the seed phrase or any other private keys that have access to your wallets or funds in a safe place or location Like a hardwallet.The brain can be a safe place, but how long do you think it would last? How long can you continue rehearsing?  As time goes on, we tend to be busy with other important things and forget to rehearse.Memories can be fallible and mistaken if this happens for instance,  and you type in a wrong word in your seed phrase, you may end up loosing your fund permanently. The idea of composing songs with our seed phrase is not advisable too, it puts out funds at more risk. Let's just believe that everyone can store their seed phrase or keys in a way that best suits them and take full responsibility of any risk that they encounter.",

I've seen someone wrote song which the seed phrase as lyrics where I think it's possible to remember as long you always sing it.

The audio learning has been working very well for me and trust me I remember the most of the things that I learned with the help of repeated audio listening. For example, suppose if someone is trying to remember the 12 words seed phrase he/she has to record those words in a safe audio device and use earphones to listen to those words everyday. That way the thing will stick in the memory for long term.I'm not sure about others, but this thing has saved me a lot of time, as with its help I can remember almost everything. But, be careful if you are recording the audio in a device that is connected to the internet than you will still be at risk because that device can be penetrated by hackers. That's why for this purpose I use a smartphone that is unable to connect to internet because of sim/data hardware problem. However, it fulfills my purpose so that's why it's a safe thing for me.",

There is a lot of science based data on how to ideally memorize things, it's a multi-layered topic which for the best effect includes a combination of several methods. I wrote some of this down a while ago, let me check and maybe I can post some info on it here.One of these concepts is ORDER, so it makes total sense it was easier to remember all 4 phrases instead of one from the middle of the pack.Regarding memorized seeds: Totally agree, don't solely rely on it - instead, if you can, use it as an additional way of \"storing\" your seed phrase. The only viable method to solely rely on it would be short to medium term - for example to get funds out of an oppressive country without any hardware/solid (paper etc) evidence.",
