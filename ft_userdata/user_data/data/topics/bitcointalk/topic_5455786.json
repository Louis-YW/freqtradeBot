      "body": "most CBDC work like thisthey generate their reserves(mint) value via transaction between a central bank and a dozen commercial bankscentral $1.2trillion  -> commbankA $100b                         -> commbankB $100b                         -> commbankC $100band so on (for commercial banks efghijkl)this is signed by all. and becomes the reserve. completely agreed by all parties involvedmuch like how blockstreams liquid uses \"federations\" to create its assetswith each commercial bank knowing the value (funding lock) they can then use their output as a UTXO for their own payments between each otherthese commercial banks acting as part of the \"federation\" are also acting as the \"factories\"(hubs) in a system similar to blockstreams Lightningwhere by the commercial banks have channels(accounts) with customers where the commercial bank gives users inbound balance which users can request can be handed back to the commercial bank and the bank then pass to another bank that then pass to the other banks customer (like how Lightning routing works)its no surprise that blockstream done a few changes to bitcoin to emulate what the central banks sponsored them to do as part of the CBDC foundation known as hyperledger. yep bitcoin has become the sandbox test of possible plans for a CBDC with the systems like liquid and lightning being the prototypes..as for user access.. these inbound channels come in 3 varieties(levels)most CBDC agree that there are 3 levelslevel 0 is a max inbound balance that can be of a months salary.. with little to no KYC to act as 'digital cash'level 1 is a middle class/small business upto 100k with standard KYClevel 2 is the pro/elite account/channel for higher amounts. with full KYCif people want to send or receive more then a months salary they would have to upgrade(provide Id) to get access to the next level. there are many CBDC's yep even the chinese one it set up in this manner and so are many other countries set up in this manner. they only work on the system of LN payment routing style by ensuring they set the limits of users amount they can spend. thus controlling the liquidity of payments. EGcommbankA $100b  -> commbankB $4b                                  commbankC $4b                                  commbankD $4b                             and so on (for efghijkl at $4b each = $48b for all 12 combined)                                 commbankA Level two service $25b                                 commbankA Level one service $15b                                 commbankA Level zero service $10band then the factory(hub) of inbound value to customerscommbankA Level zero service $10b -> commbankA Level zero hubA $100m                                                          commbankA Level zero hubB $100m                                                          and so oncommbankA Level zero hubA $100m -> customer00001 $1kwhere this is the value that the customer negotiates(co-signs) with the commercial bank of value customer has vs set aside for bank after a payment is madewhere by the 'balance' of signed transactions change to offset who has balance or not which is like how lightning route payments now you know how its all laid out. you can look into many CBDC examples and also see the blockstream owned liquid and lightning networks as case scenarios they ran for the hyperledger sponsorsbut here is the reason why governments are doing CBDCpreviously it was difficult for governments to self manage their own currency. so they delegated that to banks. however with Visa and Mastercard the governments were not getting as much income from deposits/withdrawals (burning banknotes on deposit. the requiring banks to buy new bank notes at face value for withdrawals) like they did back in the 1900-1970's. because plastic debit cards reduced the ned of bank notesand with commercial banks failing, needing bailing out. governments want to take back some control aswell as the mentioned income from payments of deposits and withdrawals again, ..and of course loans. yep they dont want to give commercial banks bonds just to create money. they prefer to be able to create money themselves to then get interest returns on those loans direct back to the treasury",

One asset offers something completely different than the other one. Also, I am kind of curious how companies like Paypal and other American payment processors will react to the deployment of CBDCs.

We don't need something that they can't still access; we don't need something that's stable; we don't need something that's not fully decentralized.

Central Bank Digital Currencies are well, digital currencies, think of your bank money before you withdraw it, or after you deposit some of it. That in itself is digital money and in some places in the world that very number could denominate value and be used for purchases, be taxable, and such and such. So with that being said it must be obvious to anyone with half a brain that CBDC and Cryptocurrency are not two sides of the same coin. They are not binary, not entangled, not related in any way whatsoever.",
