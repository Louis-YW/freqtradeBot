Just be open to any possibility that's for sure can happen since bitcoin is volatile in nature. It can nosedive to $10k but it could also go back higher than the last ATH but, the matter on this one is that it will sure take a lot of time before it proceeds.",

At least that's what I have been doing for quite some time and so far it worked like a charm.",

Rikafip, thanks for your posting. What do you mean with dollar cost average?UPDATE: Found it on internet, so invest in small amounts over time instead of all at once!",

      "body": "Quote from: Paslir on November 15, 2022, 10:01:43 AMRikafip, thanks for your posting. What do you man with dollar cost average?It is an investing method in which you divide the amount you plan to invest in several equal parts and you buy the asset in regular intervals, no matter the price. So for example, you mentioned that you want to invest $5k now; with DCA method you divide that amount to let's say 10 equal parts and every 2 weeks/month /etc you buy $500 worth of bitcoin. Thing is, many people try to time the market to buy at the bottom, which they usually fail (unless very lucky) or sometimes not buy at all as they missed it so instead worrying over that, you simply buy bitcoin at regular intervals. Way less hassle and worrying, and it works very well if you plan to hold for longer period of time and not buying for a quick flip. Â Keep in mind that there is a chance that you may profit more if you go all in now, but another reason why I prefer DCA is because it helped me to be more disciplined when investing. Here is also an article about it https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp",

The sad thing is that it's not bitcoin's fault, but since we are all connected then we can't do anything about it.",

Selling during a period of panic/bear market/crypto winter is always a wrong move, but many traders simply need cash and they don't have any alternative other than selling their crypto.

This is why I'm adding a lot more bitcoin from the last bitcoin I purchased for 23K, doubling my position almost.Â  I think things are just so bad right now, you have the economy tanking, the stock market tanking, there is so much fear with bitcoin. Everyone is very bearish. These are the best times to buy, I mean how much worse can things get?Yes, I'm scared as heck right now buying, but I've been through this enough to know that the best times to buy are when there is max fear and we have well more than max fear right now. Yes, the whales will pump bitcoin again very easily when things calm down globally.",

Not that easy and wouldn't be really that amazing to do, but definitely going to help them in the short term for sure.We are definitely going to 20k levels and that means we are going to end up with a good profit when the time comes. Thatâs not going to be an easy task, itâs going to end up with a bit of a problem in the long run if you wait too long and miss that chance. I would suggest everyone to get bitcoin right here at this price so that they could make a good profit. Anyone who thinks it will go down even more and wait could end up with a big chance missed.",

It helps you to buy bitcoin at a much lower price, which gives you the opportunity to get more bitcoin when you can buy at a lower price. But you need to adjust your funds to be spread on many low prices and that means you need to analyze every bitcoin movement to find the time to buy bitcoin. For example, you can buy a few orders at $17k, $16k, $15k, $14k, and the last $10k (if this will happen). And once the target is reached, you can wait for the other target. And if the price increase, you need to wait until the price is down again. Maybe we will see many dips before the price starts a new rally and break the higher price.",

One example is when the bull run is starting. It's rise is also consistent even if the value is already high. $16k is a low value already and as you can see the price became stable on this level. I think there is no drops that will be recorded anymore but the price is only preparing to take off.Or maybe you mean is that there are no positive news right now that will trigger an upward movement? That can be true but there are always people who will start buying now because $16k was one of the bargain price many are waiting for. There's also a lot of encouraging posts and that helps people to buy instead of be scared of what have happened recently.",
