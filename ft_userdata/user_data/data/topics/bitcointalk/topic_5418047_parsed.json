  "content": "Alik BakhshiAnd you prove    In organizing a series of poisonings of Litvinov, Skripals, Navalny, and the murder of Nemtsov, Putin refuses to accuse Russian intelligence services of involvement. In the appearance in the Crimea of ​​soldiers without identification stripes and military equipment with removed numbers, Putin flatly refuses. In the shooting down of a Malaysian Boeing in the sky of Ukraine and the death of 298 people, the tragedy in Bucha, the bombing of the Mariupol theater, in which civilians were killed, the shelling of houses throughout Ukraine and the death of thousands of Ukrainian citizens, Putin has one answer - and you prove it. Putin even managed to accuse President Zelensky of the war he started with Ukraine, calling him the organizer of the fascist regime, from which Russia is forced to defend itself. What happened in Bucha, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, is actually setting up a fascist regime in Kyiv, and the destruction of houses and the death of their inhabitants is on the conscience of the Ukrainian army, which specifically shoots at its own people in order to blame Moscow for this. Prove it's not. Blatant lies are Putin's calling card.    As you know, Putin positions himself as a connoisseur of history, but he hides the fact that Germany was actually forced to attack Russia first in order to get ahead of the Russians, who are planning a large-scale invasion of Europe and, first of all, Poland as the former territory of the Russian Empire. For this purpose, Russia concentrated a huge army on the western border in order to regain the territories lost as a result of the First World War. The conquered Poland could serve as a springboard for a further attack on Germany. I must say, Hitler was well aware of Moscow's secret negotiations with Britain and France to create an anti-German bloc. To ensure the security of Germany and at the same time both to save Poland from the communist invasion, ahead of the Russians, Hitler sent troops into Poland, but all of Poland could not be saved. The Russians invaded, but it was too late, most of Poland was already safe. Of course, Hitler understood that Moscow would not stop. And in fact, the Russians, in accordance with the implementation of the intended goal, attacked the German troops stationed in Poland, having previously bombed Minsk in order to blame the Germans for this and present the outbreak of the war as defensive. Stalin, however, like Putin, who attacked Ukraine, did not expect the fierce resistance of the Germans, who, having defeated the Russian army, put it to flight right up to the Volga itself. And only the help of the allies saved Russia from defeat. Let Putin prove that it is not so.   23.10.2022",
