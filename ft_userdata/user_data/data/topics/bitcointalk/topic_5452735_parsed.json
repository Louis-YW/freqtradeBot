  "content": "Rare coins from way back in the day. I originally bought them from Casascius himself when they came out, and have held them since. Personally redeemed each one for BTC and BCH, some still probably have \"Bitcoin Gold\" on them.Kept in plastic coin protectors since day 1, not moved much, kept in climate controlled storage. Labels still in very good shape. These are being sold because I am cleaning out anything I'm not using much, including collectibles such as these.Purchased November 2013 direct from Casascius - can provide copies of the order email to winners on demand.Bidding will be separate per coin. Each coin has a lot number associated - see belowCoins are effectively identical aside from the sticker and how damaged or not it is from the redemption process. Occasional fingerprints or smudges but largely untouched.Closeups are of representative coins of the lot, if you want a detailed picture of anything I will do my best, just send me a PM.STARTING BID: 500 USD per lotMINIMUM BID INCREMENT: $50 USDPlease format your bid like \"Lot #: $550\" - you may bid and win multiple lots of courseEND TIME: JUNE 4, 2023, 12:00:00 New York Time**Payment due within 48 hours after the auction!!**Lot GuideHi res photos (the water mark refers to my initial thread, sorry about that)https://ibb.co/dmXhnzphttps://ibb.co/FKtBBNchttps://ibb.co/nkmV2x2https://ibb.co/sqxcrHMhttps://ibb.co/V9bGT7qhttps://ibb.co/QNq0LxXSNIPE: Any bid made in last 5 minutes will extend the auction for that lot 5 minutes beyond the ending time of that lot EDIT: lots remain open until the bidding closes on all lotsIf within those 5 extended minutes, a new bid is made, 5 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bidPAYMENT: Either BTC or BCH address + invoice will be sent from this account, you may also contact me via my gmail account if you like (garrett dot burgwardt at gmail dot com).
