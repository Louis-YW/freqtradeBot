The most normal scenario is that between now and halving we will have an upside, without beating the $69K ATH of this cycle, and post-halving we will have a proper bull run, beating that ATH and I believe passing $100K clearly after several attempts. From there I dare say no more. This is based on what previous Bitcoin cycles have been like, which need not repeat exactly, and this cycle is a sample of that, but they are a guide for us",

So do you think we are in the markup circle trap or markdown circle trap clearly besides the market value BTC is not much overvalued. Also, I was reading the Plan S2F model speculation still the journey is in the flow of $98k in NOV and around 120 to 150k in December well for the first target I'm more hopeful but for the secondary valuation, it can take a longer period of time. The accumulation Peroid of BTC is still open in my view until we hit the 35K.After 35k there will be weak game for BTC to be overvalued, in the accumulation. Rather than that I think there can be inconsistency in the cyclical behavior on a shorter period of time.",

But bitcoin price may drop, do not sell. I can remember that the last halving was in May 2020, but bitcoin dropped from $10500 to $3800 in March 2020. After some months after halving, bitcoin all to all-time-high at the time. I mean it increased to over $19600 which was 2017 all-time-high.

While some sources are indicating that we might be transitioning from the bear market (Markdown Circle) to a potential bull run (Markup Circle), this does not mean that past performances will be repeated in each new cycle. Each cycle is unique, and can lead to different outcomes. Personally, I'm currently in an accumulation cycle, and I'm continuing to buy as much as my finances allow. I still see no reason not to believe that we will experience the next bull run and reach ATH again, just as we've done many times before.",

So any fool could become rich. There are too many factors that can affect the length of the cycles, the bitcoin phases. Any negative (or positive) news will appear in the media and this will already affect the general mood of bitcoin investors, who may start buying or selling BTC in bulk, which will cause some changes in the current phase. It will create a pause, shorten or lengthen the phase for an indefinite period. Therefore, it would be naive to rely on past charts, but this should not be neglected either, because it allows you to have an idea of ​​a certain pattern in the bitcoin progress.In general, there is a theory that btc-cycles are slightly lengthened each time. In principle, this is possible, because the price of bitcoin is growing, capitalization and the user base are also growing, which makes its own adjustments to seemingly familiar patterns.",

Because Accumulation is when the price is good and this phase was already occurred in December 2022 when the price of BTC was around $16k and after that the price of BTC started to grow and now currently we are in markup circle, and this circle or cycle will run for the time until BTC will not reach to its ATH. The thing is BTC might go go beyond the ATH (expected one not the last year ATH) until people will start to sell there BTC or i should say to start Distribution circle. Means when people will start to book there profits.And that time could start even now before the halving but people are smart enough to not start it now, because they know if they will hold the price will go up as the supply will decrease over demand and this will keep happening until a new ATH will be made and people will then start the Distribution circle and after that Markdown circle will start. And we are currently in Markup circle. So we all have to do is hold and if we could not able to accumulate BTC in the Accumulation Circle then we might get the opportunity in this phase too. So be prepared for the next halving event because after that the markup Circle will be on hype and people will make millions of dollars depending on the money they invested.",

So for me, we could still be in the period of accumulation.The price is not that big, although it almost went x2 from the bottom price last year. But we are still very far from our last all time high. Meaning we are still in the middle grounds. And with that, we can interpret it as still in the accumulation phase.

We also have the terrible situation with the global economy being in recession+inflation phase that makes bull runs harder.",

Waiting for the halving is a very interesting feeling, but an advice to people is not to buy with all of their money, they can use dca to buy, and if you buy with funds you won't be needing, it will give you the opportunity to wait for the bull run, even if it takes sometime to come.",
