After partying together for several days, they apparently decided to turn on him.I guess his spendings must have alerted the criminals that he's well to do or he must have spilled some secret about his wealth when under the influence of alcohol. But come to think of it, why would his friend hook him up with 3 criminals? I guess he would claim he didn't know that they were criminals... It's up to the police to connect the dots.Advice: Be careful of the kind of people you keep as friends and don't draw attention to yourself by unnecessary or lavish spendings.",

That's why in this industry people preferred to remain anonymous as there are prone to threat since money are involved in this scenario. If you've become successful in this industry which is in the crypto, it would be better to remain silent about where'd you get the money to spend. We're aware of the capability of people to do such things just in order to get some funds, that's how crazy people even your family, friends and lovers could betray you for your fortune.",

I done’t one anyone dipping noses on my money because that's my secret. Making it an open book to everyone will just put your life at risk or danger because jealousy and greed of human.For all those sharing their investment publicly using their real identity. You should stop doing that since your only purpose for doing that is for bragging with a little bit of encouragement. Investment is better to keep private because its not meant to be shown in public because of human greediness.",

We can hide all our assets without anyone knowing, especially from people we don't know because we don't know their true intentions.It's better to keep it for ourselves so we can keep using crypto in peace and pass it on to our children later. In addition, owning crypto means we are responsible for everything from people who want to cheat or steal our assets.",

You don't need to tell everything to people who you call friend and sometimes family, that is one rule in life to help you.  At the point of telling someone, you may feel the person is harmless but you can never tell what is going on in the mind of the person and can not also tell what the person will do tomorrow.",

If you are active on forums like bitcointalk and involved in trades, you should not give information which can help others relate to your identity. One should not tell strangers about their wealth in crypto assets, even if it is someone they know but they are still obliged to maintain the privacy of their wealth. Many people are careless about this, they trust their friends too much about their wealth, even though it can be a threat to themselves in terms of asset security. Everyone needs money, even money can turn a good person into a bad one and it's all because of money.Stab in the back, this expression is one of the many cases where someone who is considered a friend turns out to have harmed himself. Avoid saying directly about the amount of wealth to anyone, regardless of whether they are people we know let alone strangers. On forum, you are not encouraged to post anything sensitive including the amount of wealth you have. There are many risks lurking, so always be wise in posting.",

Obviously a capital NO, and same logic applies to bitcoin but for its case it goes way more  secretive because even the bankers don't actually get to know the amount of money in your account or in this case wallet and no one will, so far as your keys are safely kept with you. So giving out little information keeps you at the risk of loosing everything on that wallet and its very important to stay sealed shut about your financial dealing because the more exposed it gets the more likely you would get wrecked.",
