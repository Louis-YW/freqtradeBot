Of course, there could be individuals who become self made millionaire here, but I doubt that he/she just randomly ask questions here and suddenly found success.",

It looks more likely that you will lose all your money. So don't be lazy and start self-education so that you can decide on the future of your money on your own.",

Anyway, in the next 5 years the market might be on a bear trend again but for sure it will be on a different price level, better if you will just aim for the next bull market next year, buy some now.",

If you want a lesser risk go with Bitcoin but you have to at least good amount of BTC before becoming a millionaire. This is actually the goal of many here, I suggest not just to hold but be more active here in the market, you might be able to achieve that.",

However it's not guaranteed you must reap such amount after put close to a million dollars because the volatility of cryptocurrency doesn't being controlled by you alone so you might be a millionaire or fall. But if you can exercise patient with bitcoin then and invest with a reasonable amount then you can actually see something good from bitcoin investment. For short term investment I suggest you into altcoin and after you make the required profit you may decide to dump and take off your capital.NB: this is not a financial advise, please don't borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency only invest what you can afford to lose.",
