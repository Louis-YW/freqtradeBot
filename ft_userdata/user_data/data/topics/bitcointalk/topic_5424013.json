      "body": "I'm afraid it will be too hard for us to guess what company/service you are looking for. Are you sure you don't have anymore information about them? About suing the company, I know you can still file a case against a closed/suspended business in a certain period of time, but it's almost 4 years after they closed, so your chance of suing them and winning the case is very slim. I wonder why it take you so long to realize of filing a case or talking about them where it's years already passed.EDIT: I just read your reply about the company.",

Try searching for it in web archives and collect all the information you find, such as phone numbers, addresses, company tax IDs, contact persons, etc...",
