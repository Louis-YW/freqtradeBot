It's just a machine which is there to fulfill humans' orders.Not everything is as clear cut as you think. Man is also a kind of DNA-programmed machine. A lot of restrictions are also invested in a person, including in terms of life time and various possibilities. Apparently, from the point of view of higher powers, this is expedient and necessary.If a person can give artificial intelligence the opportunity to achieve consciousness and self-awareness, it definitely needs to be very severely limited in the ability to improve itself, and it is especially necessary to provide for a number of blockings, if possible, to harm them. It is not for nothing that in the early science fiction books on robotics three laws for robots were voiced, the first of which stated that a robot under no circumstances could kill a person. Almost all the inventions set forth in books from the science fiction cycle come true after some time. Perhaps plots from the future as fantastic stories and novels are reaching us as a warning to time travelers. Especially as some visionaries warn us of the danger posed by artificial intelligence. Even now, the expressions of the currently created primitive robots that man is imperfect in comparison with them are described, and therefore they allow his destruction. Therefore, this should not be ignored. The risk is too great.",

It may just grab a random string of words to describe whatever art it is it'd make and honestly, has no connection whatsoever imo to the development of AI. Plus, I don't really think the AI's developed right now have said \"consciousness\" in them, it's the reason why they still require inputs from us, humans, to actually produce something (at least, from the AI's I'm familiar with).
