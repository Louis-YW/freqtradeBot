Ive seen some dapps built on their network already supported them like mintsquare, orbiter finance and syncswap but there are more. What we should do is interact on these dapps as possible to be eligible on potential airdrops like zksync. Also you can share some you have tried. Maybe I didnt chrck that out yet.",

I've seen this excitement these days, but basically I don't think it's necessary for people to be expecting too much with the airdrop, because the greater the competition, the less chance people will receive. , there will be many different criteria to select the satisfied users. After many large airdrops from the market, I realized that sometimes we just need to use it normally on the ecosystem without any complications, and don't expect too much that we will receive the airdrop.",

Thats the thing about airdrop, its unknown when or what the criteria would be.

I like syncswap btw, very intuitive dex platform",

I think to take part in the airdrop by using all the features in the project the criteria for swap, bridge, add Lp requires cold money which later beyond this expectation can become a treasure",

What we should do is interact on these dapps as possible to be eligible on potential airdrops like zksync. Also you can share some you have tried. Maybe I didnt chrck that out yet.After getting the allocation from the Arbitrum Airdrop, I think everyone is starting to understand the concept in order to qualify for several airdrops that do require capital. In zksync, I have rotated for a long time, because they migrated from Zksync to Zksync Era, which is a concept that is not much different. Do more bridging Eth assets L1 to L2. Do Pool/add liquidity in several. But keep in mind that taking Snapshots is always a question and their eligibility is kept secret.On Twitter we can find several threads for those who want to try playing on the Zksync network both the mainnet and the testnet. One of them here https://twitter.com/MingoAirdrop/status/1638178685999271940Apart from that, this year Arbitrum started a surprising airdrop, thus encouraging more networks to hold airdrops with a concept that is not much different. If we look at Nansen, he has shown his plans to add $ZKS tokens to his portfolio.",

Surely in my opinion they consider those transactions from zklite and some testnet. But I think trying out the mainnet is their biggest criteria since they are gonna use the official network hence seeing a lot of increase on transactions and bridging. Well I do hope zksync do much better than arbitrum if they announced it.",

I will advise people to use at least twice monthly until they announce their airdrop or even provide liquidity if you have funds when uniswap or any of these big dapps moved to the chain",

The hype for the airdrop goes wild again after the $ARB airdrop so for sure the hype will continues. There are also other project who rumored to have their airdrop as well, that can be a good one to look for as well.",
