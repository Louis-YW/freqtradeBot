      "body": "Like how they might think about a certain memecoin reaching $1 and coming with a lot of zeroes, maybe they like to see a lot of numbers so choosing altcoins is the way they think it's safe. But we all clearly know that Bitcoin is the main reason for this market to follow an up/down cycle. Similarly, I can think that one day bitcoin will reach $1M, and certainly at the present time, many people will consider that crazy  , it doesn't matter, everyone has their own investment position, and in general, exposure to the crypto market requires profit as long as we have a clear plan for it. Newcomers will need more time to go through what their predecessors have gone through. And then if they still stick around, I believe that with larger investment assets, people will prioritize Bitcoin and top altcoins.",

I have even notices some new coins and their prediction post listing which will give you higher figure than the overall valuation of current crypto market but they use terms like burning x percentage of tokens to achieve their target which is unrealistic, atleast this time we need to keep the forum educated and whenever we see such thread we need to educate them and make posts like you did in the past so that new investors don't fall for these misinformation. The worst part is people don't even know what they are investing into as they just get into some coins which are dying assuming that the coin had dropped it's value over 90% so it may recover and they can gain bit end up losing even that. FTX was an example where some users starts investing even during the dump assuming it will recover.",

There can be instances where you're able to get from rags to rich type of instance, but those are rare, like really rare. In most cases, scenarios like that only happen in rich people, and well, they only get richer. As for your average joe? They mostly end up losing everything they invested. Not every coin out there is the 2nd Bitcoin or Ethereum. It's kinda funny as well (self-insult here really since I did the same) how most newbies count not-realized profits into, well, profits already. There's also the idea of newbies investing in a coin when it's on a high. That's a mistake. Most highs often don't last long in the first place so investing at the peak only invites losses. Invest when it's down instead. If you're that afraid of investing in a coin that would only go down, Then naturally do prior research.",

In addition to what you mentioned, the average beginner did the mistakes always greedy, for example he bought Altcoin and then had a profit of more than 60% of the price he had bought before, which in the end he lost the profit and the altcoin he returned to the original price He bought or even made him a loss that forced him to have to hold the altcoin more and more, the most severe in the mistakes of the beginner was Fomo, this was the vulnerable for beginners in doing his mistakes at the Crypto Market.The difficult part to be considered in my opinion is not a comparison between Bitcoin and Altcoin, of course everyone will agree that Bitcoin is excellent forever despite the very high price. Nevertheless must be made the main asset that is most owned.But the possibility that cannot be denied that the average person wants to get a higher profit with small capital, and the place must be Altcoin as an alternative solution, although this thought is wrong but many people take more risk to benefit. For myself the most confused is altcoin which can give a high roi to bullrun later.",

I can’t speak for all newbies, but I can tell you about some of my mistakes when I was that newbie.Buying overpriced shitcoins, which after the completion of the bullrun rapidly became cheaper and instead of profit, losses were obtained, multiples of 3-5 times. And sometimes more. The price of some even dropped to zero. 100% loss. If this money were invested in a bitcoin, then even taking into account subsequent drops and increases in price, in the end it would still lead to income.I believe that when the market is moving up, you should not buy anything at all, unless you are looking for a very long-term investment.To me, almost all altcoins look like fly-by-night coins created for the sole purpose of collecting newbie money and disappearing into the sunset.",

Just for clarification, total supply and circulating supply details are not enough to tell how valuable a coin will turn out to be, we have seen countless projects with low supply like 10 million and turn out to be a shitty show while a billion supply might do well if the team control how tokens are been release with a proper schedule mechanism. You need to check the team background and what they represent individually and their past record. You also need to check what they aim, not some unrealistic products that they will promise and fail. That's what all the projects does today, just hype and lies.I'm waiting to see what is going to be the opium of the new trend that will drive people crazy to invest into altcoins this bull run. Last season was full of crazy memes and it comes to a point where people were acting like zombies, hard to control because to tell them to run away from these tokens is like telling them to stop eating their favorite food but look at all the meme projects today, I pity some people that pour their live savings into this HYIP investment because they are nothing but ponzi investments.",

In my view, it does not have the quality of shiba, floki, pepe, but it gets good enthusiasm from buyers, which can even provide much higher profits than coins that have real quality and utility in the project.

But I can't also deny that I have seen people that have focused with altcoins and made more profits through their crypto investing journey and that can't be removed to them and that's mainly the reason why they're investing in altcoins only and looking for some gem as they say to invest again at the start. But if they've been long on this game, they will notice that many altcoins are dying every cycle that we are with. And for that reason, they need to at least consolidate their profits into Bitcoin so that if they are ever decided to stay on this market for a very long time, that's what they're going to have looking at the market with assurance that it won't be outdated and will still have the liquidity that it always has been.And soon, it may be bigger when the institutions are finally in and with the ETFs being done.
