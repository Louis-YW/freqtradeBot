So, it should have almost the same or close benefits as of stake.I'm not a VIP in a lot of platform, in fact, I'm in a very few platform. So, have no much idea too.",

But the weekly or monthly bonus is based on the wager at most other casino.Yes, they dramatically reduce the weekly/monthly bonuses if you stop wagering. I was on holiday for a month and I did not gamble for that month, so my weekly and monthly was VERY small, compared to previous months when I wagered. In any way, wagering $1000 will cost you between $10 to $14 these days, so even if you wager... your gains from that would be minimal when they payout the bonus.  I started at PrimeDice with a similar VIP system, before they launched Stake.com ....so you can give that a try.",

I mean to say but not the least and if I may ask op this question?  You seems to sound like a gamer onboard the stake platform but do not get me wrong are you a member of the team because this post is more than what you posted here. Are you trying to make comparison between stake and other casinos here indirectly? Ofcourse it is the normal thing and the competition is on and very strong but do not forget that there are other aspects where others do better than stake. As the saying goes, \"no man is an island\" same applicable to the casinos.",

Other casinos like Roobet or Betnomi offer the VIP program and they give you a prize each time when you reach the next VIP level, they even have some cash back where you get a % from your weekly loss, but paying a weekly amount just because you hit a certain level of VIP is only on Stake for now.

Yeah, this is normal its also to void any suspicious activity of the account or inactivity. Because the selling of such account are existing in the web. Like those account sellers considers those accounts as an investment where you will get bonus per month, well this is different topic but i hope OP gets it and don't depends on that monthly bonus without wagering. It is also subject for termination of the bonus if it will detect the account's inactivity for X months.",

If you keep gambling at Stake as you usually do then you will keep advancing and getting a higher VIP level and your bonuses will increase even more, it makes no sense to me why would you want to change something when you seem to be very comfortable with it.",
