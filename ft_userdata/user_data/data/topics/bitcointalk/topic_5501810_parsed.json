  "content": "Apologies if this is not the right section to post this in.But I am thinking of ways to DCA into BTC without using evil centralized exchange's DCA bots.I am an intermediate level programmer (Python is my preferred language) and have thought of a couple of ideas so far, and would appreciate any insights or pointers.Acquire USDT thru P2P centralized exchanges (synthetic or fake KYC, or no KYC ideally). And their own API to auto withdraw USDT(Optional) Turn this USDT into Monero or USDCIf turned into Monero, send it to a swap service to convert for BTC. ff.io looks good with an extensive API although they seem to have been hacked a couple of times. Any thoughts on them or others?If turned into USDC, use Uniswap to turn it into WBTC - or are there ways to programmatically turn it into BTC itself at low cost?What is a turn-key script or method to programmatically self clean or mix the BTC with coinjoin or similar?",

There are some no KYC exchanges that can provide you different entering payment methods for your purchase.https://kycnot.me/Do it manually is easy but do you want to seriously do it with bot?You maybe can find what you need with Awesome Bitcoin.Quote from: cambodian_airlines on July 02, 2024, 11:10:31 PMIf turned into USDC, use Uniswap to turn it into WBTC - or are there ways to programmatically turn it into BTC itself at low cost?It's bad practice because WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is a token, with a peg to bitcoin, but it is not actual bitcoin. 1 bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin but 1 WBTC is not always 1 bitcoin. If the peg losses, 1 WBTC can become 0.1 BTC or 0.",
