In order to actually launch the nuclear fusion reactor project in an experimental phase in 1998, it is assumed that work will start with the clean energy that it will produce after 35 years from the date of its launch. On this basis, this energy will not be utilized during the next decade.I expect that after another 30 years, the current energy companies will turn to investments in clean energy, since the resources will not be sufficient to continue investing.",

      "body": "I get that everyone is all giddy and excited about the latest news of a breakthrough (getting more energy output than input in nuclear fusion) but we are still far from anything feasibly self sustaining. Lets not forget the two main issues:1. Perpetual, uninterrupted fusion without melting the inner workings of the reactor and/or creating byproducts which hinder the fusion process. (Because it gets hot. Really hot.) We used to count the seconds, now we count the minutes. In the near future, reactors will be able to run for hours.2. The fuel required for fusion is not that readily available to us in abundant quantities, (unlike fossil fuels or radioactive ore) and we can't get more energy out of fusion than we put in. Thats just basic physics. (If we make the fuel then we are putting the same amount of energy into the process of making the fuel (at minimum) as the energy we are getting out of the fusion itself. So that won't work. The current hope is that we can mine the Helium-3 on the moon and use that for fuel.",

It's not as if the technology for nuclear related energy isn't there, it's been there for decades but the climate change environmentalist had a successful propaganda campaign against nuclear energy which dissuaded countries from using it.I don't have the technical knowledge to determine how nuclear fusion differentiates itself from the current methods of nuclear energy production -- I can say with certainty that it will be met with the same level of resistance regardless of how clean it is.",

Last time I heard, China was able to replicate it albeit in a very short time. No such damaging effects whatsoever, just a momentary glimpse of what it can really be inside a very controlled environment. I think the next decade will bring about a lot of technological improvements in terms of creating raw energy which can be harnessed by Man. I have my hopes up, and believe that we can do it just like we did fission back in the 40s with relatively primitive technology compared to what we have today.",

Our sun uses a huge number of Hydrogen atoms, it uses immense gravity and heat, plus it has a good number of millions of km of space as distance. OK.But we, humans, have creativity. We may find out ways to do that in a way not 100% identical our sun does it.Even the current (test, small scale) ways are already a gain. The energy used is all re-created and can be used for another ignition. And the extra (since more than the initial energy is re-created) can be harvested/used for humanity's use.See the airplanes. They are no longer that much close to the \"initial project\" ie bird's flight. Still, they do the job.Back to fusion: I do think that it can be done in 20-30 years. I do think the presented timeframe is okay.",

But it can be assumed that today, after obtaining a practical result, for which scientists around the world have been fighting for more than 50 years, oceans of money will flow into this technology, more precisely into the development of industrial designs. Moreover, high-tech companies such as Google, IBM, INTEL and others will join this project, which can offer technologies that will help to greatly accelerate the modeling, calculations and development of physical solutions for thermonuclear energy. In any case - I hope that most of us will be able to check it out in 2030+",

Source: https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/12/12/politics/nuclear-fusion-energy-us-scientists-climate/index.htmlIt's definitely fascinating to read about the leap that they've made and it could really be one of the biggest leap forwards humanity has ever seen. However it still seems like there is a long way to go, because while they made more energy than they put in, they would need to scale it up massively to cover the cost of the energy from the laser, but it's the first step on the way completed. What I found as perhaps a curious side effect - maybe I read it wrong - was that helium was created from the process, which is currently is a finite resource on the planet that is irreplaceable. If we figured out how to produce it as a byproduct of this reaction, that would also be of massive benefit for it's many uses.",

I fear that overall we'll have a setback/slow down in this development on short term, until after the war.",

It is not even so important whether this type of energy will be used in the next ten years, or a little later. The main thing is that humanity has finally realized that oil and gas as a source of energy must be abandoned and used for other purposes.In the near future, the energy market expects a significant redistribution of influence. The good thing is that Russia will lose its influence on it, because with new technologies, as a result of the war, not everything will be so good there.",
