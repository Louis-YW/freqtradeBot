  "content": "A Senior Pastor (The Most Reverend in the Province) in my Church called me last week Sunday to see him after the Sunday service which I did. When I met him, he told me that he wanted to see me for a very long time. People have told him that I am good with bitcoin investment andalso teaching people in it. Thathe has three children and all have graduated from University but because of the way things are in the country, they have not secured jobs. And any moment from now he will retired. So he wants to invest online business if I know any. And I told him that I know of only one which is investing in bitcoin. And I told him the two types of investment. Short term and long term and I suggested long investment for him but he said he likes the short term investment because he can feed from it and I told him that, he can't invest in bitcoin and still feed from it. He can't feed from it because if he does then he will be at the losing side so the best option is the long term investment. And he said I should managed the investment for him and I told him that he should used one of his trusted children but I can only be a mentor, guidance and adviser to him and not to manage the investment for him. And I will introduce the DCA method of investment for him since he depends on the monthly stipend of the church. My problem here is, the time he is planning for his retirement investment is too close. It is just few months to his retirement and that is when he is serious about it. What was his plan for all these years in active service? As it is, we have scheduled another meeting this Sunday again after the Sunday service. And if he is serious I will invest for him but I prefer the long term but as a age man, really he needs an investment that can brings feed to his table daily and that is why he was insisting on the short term investment buy that cannot do him anything base on the volatile nature of Bitcoin. Your input can help this man through me.",

I think he suddenly realized his lapses of not to had diversified his source of income earlier before now.We really need to understand that something usually prompts an average or poor individual to invest on bitcoin that is usually when he has approached the scene of his threats to easy living based on the present economy challenges.Now due to the short range of time about his motive on investing on bitcoin, I'd suggest you advice him to invest with how little he can afford to overlook for a long period of time which he must not expect profit in a short period.Let him understand that his children can also benefit from if any cause of action but though doesn't mean he's Investing for a life time.If he has enough savings he can diversify to some physical trading which potential to quick profits while he exercises patient on his bitcoin asset. He must not DCA but it he has enough to risk then he can DCA as time goes .Be careful not trying to convince him so that blames doesn't splash at you at last when things ain't goin as he expected.",

Nigeria is a poor country and every single penny matters especially as it is his retirement funds. This is my opinion. Trading? Ah! That is not possible and that should not be mention because it is too risky. Investment is still the best option. And he has no retirement benefits from the church as a Pastor but only from the stipend and once he has retired, the stipend will also stopped because he is not in active service again. And that's why he is eager to invest. But I don't know how much he has at the moment to kick start any investment. And I believed many pastors in Africa is facing this problem because they were completely relying on the church stipend and when they are not in active service, they will not have anything to feed themselves. So we have to change their thinking from now. Tell your church leaders to invest now before it too late.",

      "body": "There is no two ways about it, since his retirement is very close, he should take the money available and invest in physical business that he can be managing and get his daily feeding from there. From the profits he will be getting from the business he can investing in bitcoin through DCA on monthly basis, since the business is still new, he might not be getting enough profits to cater for his daily needs and weekly DCA. So monthly DCA will be best for him. You know that bitcoin investment need to be done in a manner where there is no pressure on you and the capital invested should be one that is not for immediate use. Also anyone going into bitcoin investment should have other sources of income. But in the case of this your client, he hasn't put any thing on ground that will serve as a source of income which will sustain the investment he intends doing. So when you meet him this Sunday, advise him to use that money and start up another business and invest in bitcoin with time. That's the best advice you can give to him, so you don't end up putting yourself and him in a tight corner.",

Secondly it will be tough to learn the trading skill for old men.OP ,you should tell him risks and benefits if investing in btc so that he decide whether invest or not and how to manage money for investment. I think their sons should continue their learning skills and at the same time invest in btc 1/3 of their money for good return. Long term investment is solid idea",

I completely agreed with your points, considering the fact that Bitcoin is not a quick and get rich scheme, patient is a virtue and worth prioritizing in Bitcoin investment, the power of dcaing is consistency and holding for as long as 4 to 10 years and above of having a compounded value of investment over the period of time, Bitcoin investment is best performed when viewed from a long term perspective and not short term, the man is old and might not enough psychology to withstand the pressures that comes with the news and the emotional devastation that is attached to trading Bitcoin for term profits, I will also suggest that he should consider another investment plan and not Bitcoin.",

If he invests and wants to use the proceeds to still take care of his family and kids at his age then it will elude him, there is also no guarantee that his investment can cover the expenditure as they keep growing daily. An investment in his children will solve their immediate needs and also span to him, depending on what country he is from and the policy they have for the aged people. He should tell you to train his children rather than invest in a short term investment that might see him incurring loses now and again.",

He's already said that he prefer investing into something he can be taking out some profit time after time to take care of his needs. That alone takes out Bitcoin as a potential investment choice. Thier are a lot of things to take out of what you've said here. Since the children are done with school and still yet to get a meaningful job, if they are responsible enough to utilize the money the right way, it's best he invest the money in the lives of those children by starting up a good business for them, that way, it's possible for him to take out some fraction of the profit that's coming from the business to take care of his needs. Bitcoin investment is mostly good for individual that are at least comfortable with the primary source of finance  and can afford to take out a portion from it and still have some reserve that's enough to Carter for thier needs. The stipend most pastors get from churches aren't always much to serve these purpose and I understand that the reason why he's considering investing in a digital asset is because his schedule wouldn't allow him get involved in any investments choice that is demanding and time consuming. What you can alternatively do for him is to educate his children if they will be willing to learn on how to start investing in Bitcoin since they are much younger and can get some extra benefits that comes with it.",

Just do some basic research and see that all of the white paper points have been debunked. Bitcoiners make up new stories and they eventually are debunked as well. Bitcoin websites are constantly all over the place with their predictions (1 million by 2025, LMAO at that one), often contradicting earth other. Only the whales make money. Only people that profit from you buying will tell you to invest. Any small fries are just feeding the whales.  Bitcoin had been crashing for a while now, with the whales propping it up. Most people get this, which is why most of us ignore bitcoin. We know better.",

Don't make the mistake of introducing someone who, all through their life, never had a future investment in any volatile assets all because they were busy catering for themselves and their families. Having them introduced to Bitcoin investment is not something they can't easily do because of their family responsibilities placed on them.Someone who has a few months to their retirement can start up something different from Bitcoin investment if they want to start up something that will be bringing forth a daily feed on their table. They can go into agriculture farming, poultry,   provision shop, cement business, etc. All these mentioned businesses are good businesses to start up for someone who is in his or her old age for retirement.

A little dilemma and you certainly would not advise him to invest if his goal is to seek profit every day in his retirement. So it is better to give him clearer pressure about long-term investment and if he is still firm for the short term option, of course don't follow his wishes.
