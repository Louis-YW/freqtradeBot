  "content": "I had this account since 2019 and I had some money sitting there I wanted to transfer. I tried transferring half the funds today and found out my account is blocked under suspicion. Like what? They want me to send identification and everything but luckily I only have about $60 in there and judging by how many people they have scammed, I am going to call it a very minor loss.Fuck them.Proof: https://imgur.com/a/AhydaBVBy the way, i did contact support and they told me they suspended my account because hackers were trying to get into my account over $50. Oh, right.Now they are requesting ridiculous information. I am so glad I kept almost no money with them. Fuck these scammers.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

      "body": "I happened to open an account with them somedays ago as a recommendation from a friend but seeing this now have givenÂ  me some goose bump. I do not think I would continue with them any more. For my own safety and to avoid unforseen circumstances in the nearest future, I will have to do away with them for good. Thank you op for this update here. It is nice you made this post in time as I was about getting set to making use of the account but with this attitude they have put towards you, I will keep far from them and also advise any one who is trying to open An account with them to halt for the time being so as not to get scammed by them. It is better to avoid doing anything with them than to get entangled with them in the nearest future.",

They found that you violate one of their terms of use and they have a condition to close your account if you are unable to provide your data and therefore they knew that you would not be able to claim that money.They have closed the Elon Mask wallet, so it seems that their system will allow you to use the wallet even if you violate one of the terms of use, and then the problems begin as soon as you make a deposit. If you think your personal data is worth less than $50, send it to them, they will try to set some strict conditions, and if you can bypass them, they may return the money to you.",

I assume that there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of them, considering that these scammers have a very good domain, which in combination with the keywords \"free, crypto, wallet\" almost always has a position at the top of the search results. A perfect trap for naive crypto investors who don't know the difference between custody and non-custody wallet, and what's even worse, nobody can do anything to them because they only work according to the law.",
