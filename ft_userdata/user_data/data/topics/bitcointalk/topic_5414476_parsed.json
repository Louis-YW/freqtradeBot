I also wasted my time, there was only 5 dollars left to complete 80, when the site started giving problems. It is unfortunate that this company uses bad faith with people.\"\"Do not use this once, because this is foolishness, when I reach the minimum withdrawal amount a little more, I am directed to the ad page, let alone make money, to enter the account I can never enter,\"\"its big scam ,when i just reached 75 dls it made my account expired.when i log in, they redirect me to advertising pages that do not open and do not let me enter in any way.\"",
