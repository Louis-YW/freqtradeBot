  "content": "This is the title of an article[1] that I wanted to share and to discuss with you.  I find it full of FUD and misleading that is why I wanted  to show you the article and get your sentiment on the topic discussed.  As written, it was stated that:Bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactionsExplanation:QuoteBitcoin was created to overcome the existing monetary and financial system. In 2008, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto published the concept. Since then, Bitcoin has been marketed as a global decentralised digital currency. However, Bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment: real Bitcoin transactions are cumbersome, slow and expensive. Bitcoin has never been used to any significant extent for legal real-world transactions.My Reaction:The author simple generalization of Bitcoin usage is mediocre.  He jump in a conclusion without doing any research of his own topic.  If he could have known how to type and search legal company that accept Bitcoin, he would be ashamed of what he just stated.  One major proof to refute the claim of the author about Bitcoin never been used for legal-transaction is the number of company that accept Bitcoin.  Some of them are already listed on this article: https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/who-accepts/  and many more unmentioned company and retail stores that accept BTC.Regulation can be misunderstood as approvalQuoteLarge investors also fund lobbyists who push their case with lawmakers and regulators. In the US alone, the number of crypto lobbyists has almost tripled from 115 in 2018 to 320 in 2021. Their names sometimes read like a who's who of US regulators.But lobbying activities need a sounding board to have an impact. Indeed, lawmakers have sometimes facilitated the influx of funds by supporting the supposed merits of Bitcoin and offering regulation that gave the impression that crypto assets are just another asset class. Yet the risks of crypto assets are undisputed among regulators. In July, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) called for crypto assets and markets to be subject to effective regulation and supervision commensurate with the risks they pose - along the doctrine of \"same risk, same regulation\".My Reaction:Who cares about Government regulation, what matters is the adoption of masses since Bitcoin is already fair as it is and does not need the approval of the government to operate.  As a matter of fact, the mediatory action of government often messed up a system that is fine in itself.  And Bitcoin is fine as it is but government wanted to have a piece on the pie reason why they intended to regulate Bitcoin in order to milk it either of tax or rob it via confiscation.  Furthermore, regulation has two function, either regulation to ban it or regulation to limit and coexist with the Bitcoin system. The latter is the acknowledgement of Bitcoin and approval of its existence with some tweak via implementing regulation to the Bitcoin influence.  So my take, regulation is a double standard word where one is to totally limit it while the other is to compromise and approved Bitcoin existence by limiting the objects influence.Promoting Bitcoin bears a reputational risk for banksQuoteSince Bitcoin appears to be neither suitable as a payment system nor as a form of investment, it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimised. Similarly, the financial industry should be wary of the long-term damage of promoting Bitcoin investments - despite short-term profits they could make (even without their skin in the game). The negative impact on customer relations and the reputational damage to the entire industry could be enormous once Bitcoin investors will have made further losses.My Reaction:This one I agree, despite of his reasoning, Promotion of Bitcoin expose banks of its shortcomings and how they cheat their client so YES! Promoting Bitcoin bears a reputational risk for banks because they will be exposed of their fraud.All in all the writer is obviously anti-Bitcoin but his explanation on the selected topic to convince people are all moot.  So what is your take on the subject of discussion?  Do You agree with what the author stated?[1] THE ECB BLOG | Bitcoin’s last stand",

True, whether Bitcoin transaction is illegal or legal depends on the existing law in a country.  Pretty much those that make Bitcoin illegal can say any transaction made in Bitcoin is illegal.Quote from: sstephan on November 30, 2022, 06:51:17 PMQuoteThe author simple generalization of Bitcoin usage is mediocre.  He jump in a conclusion without doing any research of his own topic.  If he could have known how to type and search legal company that accept Bitcoin, he would be ashamed of what he just stated.  One major proof to refute the claim of the author about Bitcoin never been used for legal-transaction is the number of company that accept Bitcoin.  Some of them are already listed on this article: https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/who-accepts/  and many more unmentioned company and retail stores that accept BTC.most companies that accept bitcoin do that just to be \"cool\". they convert the payment to real  money straight away .you can argue as much as you want , but paying with bitcoin is truly inconvenient .cash is also inconvenient .i prefer paying with my smartphone or a watch , this is the \"new\" way.How many watch or smartphone can you bring?  If you think you can pay with your smartphone or a watch in every purchase you do, I think it is cumbersome, and the problem would be how would the seller give you change after you pay with your gadget?  Kidding aside, You can transact with Bitcoin via smartphone, it is pretty convenient with the use of LN since there are already an apps that  integrate LN for fast payment.  Ever heard of the Pouch wallet project on Boracay Island making it a Bitcoin Island where retail store can accept Bitcoin via LN transaction through their apps.  Here is the thread[1] if you haven't known it yet.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419576.0",

Meaning that FSB will have to go beyond sectorial boundaries in the coming regulation on crypto and the tightening of Stable coins. I'd say that the problem with cryptocurrency and the regulatory sector is the constant failure of cryptocurrency projects. Because Maijoor, in his speech pointed at the recent incident of FTX and referred it the fall of Bank of Amsterdam 300 years ago, insisting that FSB must learn from the past. QuoteLarge investors also fund lobbyists who push their case with lawmakers and regulators. In the US alone, the number of crypto lobbyists has almost tripled from 115 in 2018 to 320 in 2021. Their names sometimes read like a who's who of US regulators.I think the author is correct here as this action dulls the consistent effort of the SEC, FSB and the authorities behind the regulation of cryptocurrency. Considering that these sectors can easily regulate cryptocurrency like the traditional finance, it's quite clear that these lobbyists are stretching the process by making it difficult for them to execute their plans. They are hundreds of legitimate news on the internet about the cryptocurrency regulation, yet it seems like nothing is done about it. So if cryptocurrency must stay unregulated, they must be lesser ill activities attached to the market. Because it draws the attention of the authorities. https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/17/crypto-will-soon-threaten-global-financial-stability-fsb-official-says/",

I'm seeing Bitcoin falling from $100,000 to $75,000 soon and these hard-headed die-hard fiat fanatics would still publish an article describing the correction as Bitcoin's \"last stand.\" Wrong at $0.002, still wrong at $1,000,000.

Prohibitiosn is simply failing to get what they want from this industry which is to tax every transaction because of the impression of \"big profit\" earned by many investors. Well, governments are not aware of how long profit will take to be earned. Given how volatile the market is, there are only periods of uprise movement; thought being disregarded because profit is more emphasized. Regulation on the other hand would be made possible through third party wallets but as given in this industry, there are centralized and decentralized exchangers which keeps investors safw from taxes. And in these instances, governments decides to prohibit its usage.",

You can hold it in anonymity and it is likely to keep having value.But to acquire mass adoption, BTC would have to be used as a currency. And for it to be a currency, it needs government approval. Goods and services paid in BTC, which generates demand, which generates value. In my ideal world, working citizens would get paid in BTC. Not in a failing currency. I see countries legalizing BTC for payment but I haven't seen any of them paying citizens their wages in BTC. They continue to pay them in failing currencies, until their savings are reduced to 0 and they no longer have power to buy any BTC.I'm European, I have savings and a masters degree. But I get paid in a currency that gets devalued by crooked bankers. The cost of living rises rapidly until the entire society is bankrupt. Which is when I expect governments to step in and install some kind of fascism.The 20 year mortgage plan for a property is in a debased currency and nobody getting paid in a failing currency has a guarantee that they can make it. In fact it is unlikely that they will. Inflation just has to rise a few more years.You'd have to have a whole lot of BTC to compensate for a failing currency. But how can BTC adoption grow while citizens get paid in crashing currencies, default on all their payments and have 0 savings to collect BTC?",
