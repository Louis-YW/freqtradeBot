  "content": "I bought Bitcoin on  p2p and today I bought Bitcoin unit of 0.00098 which is equivalent to $19.18 and in local Fiat currency is about #17k after when I have paid the seller the cash and he left. I checked the BTC unit in Fiat currency (Naira), imo I regret it o. I bought at the present dollar rate to the Fiat currency which is 875 Naira per 1$ x 19.18 = 17,035 and 0.00098 BTC in Naira is 16k. I didn't check it before I bought it because I was very much Happy to buy Bitcoin with the local currency. This is the second time he has sold to me. I was excited but I lost at the moment because of the bear market of Bitcoin the high rate of Dollar with the drastically devaluation of the Nigerian Naira. But time will come I will not regret. That is the risk in the investment of Bitcoin one has to know before entering. As it is I don't think Nigerians can buy Bitcoin because of the present situation of Dollar rate and the bear market but any how some are still buying.",

That is what I understand, at least.I have experience with devaluation of my local currency, so I can tell it is not uncommon for merchants to charge over the market price for goods, I assume they do it to have a threshold while managing local currency (which is losing value), so they can have enough time to re-convert into other assets without losing their capital/earnings from spread.But it is a little odd, if you ask me, usually these measures are reserved for moments of quite high inflation. I had assumed Nigerian Naira was relatively stable in short terms and not suffering from sharp dumps against the USD.",

Last week, some of us sold at N860–N870 and I think that was the highest it got.
