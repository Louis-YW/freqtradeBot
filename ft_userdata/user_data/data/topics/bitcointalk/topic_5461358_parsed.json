      "body": "Your reason and lesson might be succinct but I can understand the anticipation behind those trades and the pain behind getting rugpulled. Most importantly you have something to learn, however it's not enough if you keep making the same mistake–you don't do the same thing over again and expect a different result. I would advise you DYOR thoroughly to decrease your chances of getting rugpulled. Personally I trade on CEXs so i can't relate to getting repeatedly rugpulled, and I think their ability to filter these rugpull projects give them an edge over DEXs.",

CEX knows how to do more research and KYC than any of us. And seems there are a lot of lowcap coins with good usecase trading on CEX these days.",

      "body": "Thankfully I've never personally been \"rugpulled\" or scammed out of money in a crypto or financial scheme. However, I know many people who have lost significant amounts of money due to cunning online frauds or cryptocurrency projects that suddenly disappeared with investors' funds.My friend John got rugpulled when he invested $5,000 into SafeWombatCoin after some convincing promotional posts on Reddit. For months the token value kept rising and the Discord community seemed very active. Then one day...the developers vanished, along with over $3 million from investors. John lost his entire investment. Another colleague Sarah invested into a blockchain startup called CloutPlatform that claimed to be building a decentralized social media platform. The founder was everywhere promoting it online and at conferences. Nine months on with no product in sight, the company dissolved overnight and Sarah lost her $15,000 investment.While these \"rugpulls\" leave victims feeling cheated and financially stressed, some lessons can be learned:- If investment returns sound too good to be true, they usually are. Do thorough due diligence. - Anonymous developers and hype-only promotions are major red flags. Vet a project meticulously first.- Never invest more than you can afford to completely lose. Crypto and startups are highly risky.- Stick to well-established, transparent projects with substance over hype.Losing money is extremely painful. But by researching thoroughly, avoiding \"get rich quick\" schemes and emotionally-driven decisions, ideally your investments will lead you to financial freedom one day instead of the poorhouse! Risk management is everything.",

Learning from my own experiences, this made me to take extra care in investing.One lesson, investing in Bitcoin will never go wrong. It's fine to explore but take the risk.",

But later on I learned to accept it, let it go, and focus on the lessons it brings. Dwelling on losses doesn't change the outcome, but learning from the experience does.",
