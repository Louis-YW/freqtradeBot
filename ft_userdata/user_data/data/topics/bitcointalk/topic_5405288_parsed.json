      "body": "I'm curious if these necklaces (chains) are a custom made product for these coins or if it was an off the shelf item that happens to fit Casascius coins.  My interest being in perhaps having a silver or gold version made (or finding one that is already for sale) that could house a 39mm airtite capsule.  I'd love to rock one of my own creations in a chain like this and I'm sure others would have a similar interest as there are plenty of coin-makers here.  Sorry if this is a bit off topic, but the idea of wearing a minted seat around my neck as a conversation starter is pretty cool.  I do worry about corrosion though without the coin being in an airtite.",

      "body": "Hi Og, I searched far and wide and never could find exact size (I did not search for airtite size pendants) pendants for the size of 1 BTC and .5 BTC Cas’s. Because I could not find anything for size or appeal, I had to have a jeweler custom make and plate in quantity after sending them samples for the custom sizes. Luckily, the minimum was almost exact to the number of peeled Cas’s  I had, so each Cas has a matching pendant. I have been asked if I can separate the pendant and sell individually, but as each is matched to a Cas I cannot separate. As for pure Silver and Gold I may consider this in the future, but the material, tooling, and quantity would make my cost so high it may price the end product out of what most of us can afford. Because of the uniqueness of these, and the high cost on my end, the manufacturer agreed to only produce this exact size for me. Sales have been good, so if there is a demand for more premium materials (Gold for example), I will definitely explore that in the future. I hope that addresses your questions.
