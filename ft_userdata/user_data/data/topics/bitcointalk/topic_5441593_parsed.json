  "content": "Trezor warned its community about an ongoing phishing scam a few hours ago. According to the company's information, scammers contact users via SMS, email, and even phone. Potential victims are told that their Trezor Suite has been breached and is vulnerable. The scammers probably instruct users to download fake apps to steal their seeds and cryptocurrencies. - Don't fall for it because it's fake!- If you are a Trezor user, don't click on unknown links and answer calls from unknown numbers. It's the oldest trick in the book.Trezor states they have no information about a data breach on their end. We should know more in the next few days if something bad has happened.If you are a Trezor user, did you receive any emails, SMS, or calls from scammers?  Source:https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1630526933199998977",

Though I believe they mentioned only emails were leaked, it only takes a bit of effort for someone to cross a couple of rough databases by email and start to associate some registers with a phone number in addition to the email.",

If someone asks for the seeds, then obviously it's a fraud, because what we know is that we ourselves have to know the seeds.I'm pretty sure we see this fraudulent trick often, but when you tell it to other people, especially those who don't follow the official trezor notification, it's quite helpful for those who have this hardware.It's no wonder that scammers have many ways to carry out their actions, one of which is that we must remain vigilant and never give seeds to anyone.",

I don't expect that a random scam attempt would be given such attention as this was and for such a scam to be actually effective, it would have to target actual users of Trezor. I could of course be wrong.As you pointed out, it could be a previous breach or a more recent one.",

This leak doesn't have to be from Trezor, as you might have left your phone number somewhere else and they could have leaked it. It can be an exchange or maybe even from that Ledger leak from few years ago. For that reason its a good idea to get virtual phone number (that costs like few dollars) if you want to register on dodgy websites that ask for your phone number.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on March 01, 2023, 01:04:32 AMSo how can I block phone number from outside country?Same as any other phone number, as you have option for that inside your phone call settings.",

It's the oldest trick in the book.E-mail is the least dangerous here because most of such messages end up in the spam folder anyway, while SMS and calls are something that is far more unsettling to users and can trick them into taking some reckless action. It is easiest to block calls from unknown numbers or even SMS messages in the same way, but not all such calls or messages are malicious.",

That's why the first thing i do once i have a friend who uses crypto is to introduce them to this forum, i think it is going to be extremely difficult for a long time user in this forum to fall for something like this.This kind of scam is quite popular in my country, but their modus operandi is quite different because they use the traditional banking system as bait: you receive a strange call and the person claims to be a worker in your bank telling you that there's some problem with your account that needs to be solved, the scammer goes ahead to request for the sensitive numbers on your ATM card coupled with other details...whenever i get a call like this i usually toy with the scammer by allowing them waste all their time talking, and when he believes he has gotten to me...i end the call with a resounding \"fuck you\".",
