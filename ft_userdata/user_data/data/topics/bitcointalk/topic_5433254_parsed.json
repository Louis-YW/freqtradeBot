I don't think theymos is from the same country as Satoshi, Cyrus, or other ex-admins and moderators. Anyone can be from any country and work on a remote project if they have skills. You should know why some projects hire team members from 3rd world countries. You can pay them way less compared to those who live in US or Canada. I am not here to say whether this account was bought/hacked or not. But, your point makes a little sense to no sense. I don't want to say anything about changed hands or not. I have seen many accounts hanging around, and it looks like those accounts were bought or hacked. But until you have some solid proof, You shouldn't accuse someone of doing wrong. Let's say someone is innocent, and I accused him of doing something just because I suspected him. If someone tags him, but he is innocent, I am the one to blame for the damage. This is just a bit of friendly advice and opinion.",

It was not a resubmission were we paid a listing fee, only to point out that the version of ForkNote daemon and simplewallet v2.0.11 which was delisted due to instability issues on their systems was noted my many experts as being the safest version for any cryptonote to run and to add the fact that our configuration file consisted of no checkpoints which is now also being advised to check for proof of no-double spending exist. We were also made aware that Poloniex was interested into the possibilites of adding a ForkNote based currency to their exchange but not told specifically that it would be NNC.There are many concerns moving forward in the area of cryptonote currency and we continue to give our best efforts the securing the best platform that we can. We thank all of our supports for their support.We suggest anyone interested in seeing NNC return to cryptopia submit a written request https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Home/Contactalong with their thoughts and opinions.And now here's one of the first posts after NicNacCoin's return in 2021:Quote from: NicNacCoin on June 15, 2021, 11:30:10 PMA successful project has many importants things.. firstly it should have good communication community, trusty team management. If a good communication spreading it's popularity and reputation among the investors then it would have highly possible to success.OK, how about this one?QuoteNon frangible Token (NFTs) are like as assets like land and home, you can easily get money from NFTs by selling and buying NFTs. NFTs becoming more and more popular day by day . Most of the people are interesting themselves collecting different NFTs.Now I ask you, the community: which do you think is more likely, that the account was handed over to someone who writes worse English or that NicNacCoin suffered a brain injury in 2017 so severe that when he recovered in 2021 he began writing posts like a typical shitposting bounty hunter?  I'd like to hear NicNacCoin's take on that.",
