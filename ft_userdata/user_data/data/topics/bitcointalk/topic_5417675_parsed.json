Maybe other members could give it?I remember posting a Gunbot ad there but it didn't receive any exposure. So maybe someone can point to it or something.",

Having said that, I checked their \"subreddit page\" and it looks like new developers have taken over some of the duties to \"come up with a new version\": mobazha.org [note: I prefer to not vouch, so DYOR]",
