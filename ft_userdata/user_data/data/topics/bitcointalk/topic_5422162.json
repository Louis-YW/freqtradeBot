Also even for the rest of the Cryptos the trail can be established but it's still psuedononymous you cannot predict or find the owner of the address just by looking at the address. so if there is not fiat conversion it's hard to catch them, these people may also use mixers to break the established trail of the Cryptos. So obviously it's not that easy to catch them.",

Also with stringent KYC, SFT norms, etc. banks are almost obliged to share each and every things that happened in a customer's account if requested by any of the government's departments. Cryptos on the other hand don't give them this luxury, this is why they have even brought their own version of it.",

Sometimes we found such morons in our life and we just need to ignore them. Our honorable FM doesn't have the brain power to understand cryptocurrency and it's underlying technology at all. She also doesn't have the capacity to understand the economic situations. She is just a puppet of PM Modi. So it's not her fault as well. She is being ordered to create confusion. It can't be denied that cryptos can be easily used for such illicit activities. But throwing the responsibility purely on crypto is a stupidity.",
