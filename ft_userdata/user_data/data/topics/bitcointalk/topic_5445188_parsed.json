I’m curious about how this thing is going and imagine being sued even if you are not connect to that project at all, let’s see if those influences will also pay by doing such promotions especially if they are also a victim of scam FTX.",

It is important to emphasize the exemption from the compensation in the news, which most sources tend not to mention, which I considered biased and misleading. I think influencers might be having a bad day because a lot of names are mentioned",

On the other hand, this influencers don't know if the project like FTX will be successful or not.So even if they are going to be sued, it might be difficult for the court to proved that they are involved with SBF or anyone from the FTX itself.Everyone here can shill for the project itself, in my opinion.

We've seen how SEC filed a case and made fined those influencers and celebrities that have advertised the Central ICO scam. And this should make more of these people in this industry they shouldn't be too confident with the projects that offer them money just for them to be vocal about it and give them some exposure to their community to gather more investors. That's what's happening and it's easy to access to these fraud projects when they can easily place money in the mouth of these influencers but then, these suing will make them more careful.",

What I am hoping is when the authority successfully sue these influencers and let them pay, is that all the proceeds will be divided into equal amount and disseminated to all the users who lost their funds. FTX has their own share of responsibility and these influencers do too, as they are considered as accessories of the crime. This will serve as a lesson for all those influencers in the social media who wants to engage into promoting a company.",

If anyone should be sued, it is the institutions that issued them those permits and were supposed to supervise their work.I'm not defending influencers here. They certainly have their flaws, but it's not reasonable to expect them to predict the future. How could they have known that it would turn out to be a scam? They were likely presented with a convincing pitch and believed that FTX was a legitimate investment opportunity, just like many others in the market.",

I believe that these influencers are only there to promote a project and be compensated for it; those who want to invest in those projects should do so at their own risk after conducting research on it. Part of the agreement between the two parties will be for the influencer to send a message to their followers encouraging them to invest in the project; however, they will have no choice but to follow the terms of the client/employer. Most people who are familiar with the cryptocurrency market are aware that influencers are just doing what they’re ask to do, they should always invest at their own risk.",
