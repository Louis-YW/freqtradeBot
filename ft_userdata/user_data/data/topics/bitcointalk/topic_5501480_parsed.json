Because they enable the creation of digital signatures in Bitcoin transactions, public keys — which are derived from private keys — are essential. These signatures allow transactions on the blockchain and verify who owns the funds.A vital component of Bitcoin’s operation, hash functions are used to construct fixed-length, shorter representations of data, including public keys. These hash algorithms ensure that Bitcoin addresses are compact and standardized, which makes data storage and transfer on the blockchain network more effective.You can see the part I highlighted with a bold text, maybe that answers your question.And you can read the whole article HERE, If you are interested in knowing more about bitcoin addresses and their types, there is alot you can learn from the article.",

The both are referred to as version 0 Segwit address format. The P2TR is the version 1 Segwit address format, simple called the taproot address, this was Like a little privacy upgrade on the version 0 formats when using multi signature addresses.",

They’re made up of a string of letters and numbers, usually between 26 to 35 characters. This length helps ensure there are enough possible addresses to go around and makes it really tough for anyone to guess or hack them. It's like having a super long, complicated password for your digital wallet.This forum is not an online place that you will visit daily and read the OP and post anything that you like.

But if you use an Electrum wallet, you can guarantee the security of your wallet.I don’t know how you come about with the percentage but yes having your coins stored on exchanges is at the risk of you losing the funds, this is because exchanges are custodial wallets that holds your private keys which are the gateways to spending your funds, so should they get compromised, rig pull or even hacked your funds will be gone with them. But does that make non-custodial wallets like electrum ultimately safe? No because even with your private keys or seed phrase right in your possession, the way you treat that wallet or protect the private key will actually determine how safe your coins on the wallet are. So using electrum or other wallets doesn’t guarantee safety of the funds Quote from: btc78 on July 01, 2024, 02:57:30 AMQuote from: julia335 on June 29, 2024, 06:56:44 PMbc1peyr986nrj2f0w5a69jl496j4svdc03f64z0agke8kqyq6lhne6psgxk7hfSince this has ‘bc1’ at the start, it’s most likely a segwit address.It’s not a likely solution, this is certainly a SegWit version 1 address which we popularly know as Taproot address format (P2TR), the prefix (bc1p) and also the long characters length is there to confirm it",
