  "content": "Greetings Bitcointalk Community, BTC\"I hope this message finds you well in the world of Bitcoin.I am here today to share a remarkable experience from the London Domain Summit 2023, where I had the privilege of showcasing MX12.Artand engaging with visionaries, creators, and pioneers in the crypto and web3 domain space.I just wanted to try out something different and see how it goes: making a private exhibition of Bitcoin art at the London Domain Summit.Domain names were the first digital investments on the internet, and I met people from the Bitcoin space there.After the conference, a couple of them flew to the next event,Honeybadger 2023 in Riga.\"\"In the heart of London, under the vibrant August sun of 2023, the London Domain Summit was abuzz with energy and innovation.Among the sea of tech visionaries and domain experts,there stood a booth adorned with captivating artwork — my booth, showcasing the world of MX12.Art.\"\"As a bittcoinartist, cryptoartist and creator of cryptoart, I embarked on a journey to bring a unique atmosphere to this prestigious conference.My art added a touch of creativity to the conference,blending seamlessly with the Bitcoin theme.\"At London Domain Summit 2023, I had the opportunity to meet numerous individuals and businesses,all united by their passion for exploring the boundless business opportunities, including the world of web3 domains. Amid the bustling conference, one meeting was particularly memorable — my encounter with the visionary founder of freename,a pioneer in the web3 domain ecosystem. This encounter opened new doors for collaboration, revealing exciting possibilities.I learned that freename was not just about domains;it was about empowerment. Freename’s revolutionary concept of owning a domain or top-level domain (TLD) forever, without renewal fees, resonated deeply with me. Meeting them in person added a tangible dimension to our collaboration.\"Helmuts, the visionary behind London Domain Summit 2023,played a crucial role in connecting individuals from all corners of the world.If anyone ever felt alone or unsure about who to speak to at the conference,Helmuts was there, extending a warm welcome and fostering connections.\"My art, like every piece of my life,holds a story. Each artwork is a reflection of what I feel, what I see, and what I never want to forget.When someone owns one of my creations, they possess a piece of my journey,a fragment of my lifetime.The emotions and experiences I gathered at the conference will find their way into my future artworks.Every feeling, every interaction — they are all part of my creative odyssey.There were many more incredible people I crossed paths with, and I extend my gratitude to each of them for their interest in my art and our conversations.I look forward to reuniting at London Domain Summit 2024. This conference is invaluable, and I encourage you to consider sponsorship to ensure these gatherings continue shaping our future.\"\"To learn more about my bitcoinart and the exciting developments at the London Domain Summit, please visit my Medium post here: [https://medium.com/@mx12art/a-cryptoart-odyssey-my-mx12-art-exhibition-at-london-domain-summit-2023-82aa89dfb96d].For a visual journey into the world of MX12.Art, explore my website: [https://mx12.art/].Let's continue building and creating together,for the only thing that can stop us is death, and our creative spirits are unbreakable.\"\"P.S Very soon, I'm going to finish the Earth series with the Weather element.There will soon be a chance to connect all four elements, opening doors to discover the fifth element.You can check out my artwork thread here: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5362071.0].My artwork thread is growing larger, like a labyrinth, because we have a maximum number of letters per thread.From my thread, you can navigate to each artwork sale thread or presale, and if needed, to another one.Have fun exploring MX12.Art.
