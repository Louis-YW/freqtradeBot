You will change to trade and no longer keep it as investment. You will have risk to lose it to exchange because it is their bussiness, not yours and you have no control on your bitcoin.QuoteSo I have my weekly I decided to invest in bitcoin from a profit share.I am not sure where you get profit share from your shop because you revealed that you are struggling to maintain it because of less total income from sales and other costs as well as inflation (?) in your country.",

It is only affordable for big enough purchase.The shop operator, OP, must aware that there will be many inputs in his Bitcoin wallet and he must consolidate them when transaction fee is cheap.OP must have reserve in cash to keep his cloth store running without have to sell bitcoin every week or every month. With reserve, if bitcoin price falls, he can hold it and wait and it is more like his investment. If he don't have reserve for his business, he will have to sell his bitcoin even when price is lower a lot than price he receives it as payment from customer.",

If your shop is big and you know that renewing the rent on the shop will be difficult for you and cut into your investment, you can find another small business owner looking for a small corner in a store to pay rent for, to run their small business. There are beauty shops around me that started up first as just a salon for females, later on, they allowed a Male salon owner to combine with them to have a male salon too, soon after, they allowed a pedicurist and manicurist to join them too, all different businesses operating under one roof and each paying a percentage in the rentage depending on how much space they consume. That is a way for you to get more if your shop is big, you can permit other small businesses that maybe have a linkage to what you do to come under you.",

But Bitcoin gives you privacy. Just that, while investing in Bitcoin, you should not invest an amount that causes you some phycological issues when the price becomes so volatile. Whoever is investing in Bitcoin should be prepared to hold onto it for a long time until they make a profit. Just as you are investing your business profit share into Bitcoin, you should only invest what you know that even if you have an emergency at hand, it will not force you to sell off your Bitcoin for a lower price than the amount you bought it for, because that's what most newbies do: they invest so hard and exceed the limit of what they were supposed to invest, and when they are not making profit in the time frame in which they have speculated, it becomes an issue for them. So, while investing, just invest the amount that you can afford to leave for the long term.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

If you were to “lose” all that money instead of investing it, does it still sound like a good idea for your business? How about the future of your financial situation?It’s a good idea to never keep all eggs in the same basket, but think it very very wisely and thoroughly. You don’t want to spread your eggs in high risk investments I suppose. After all, there has to be at least one safer, more protected egg.My advice is to take this very seriously and seriously consider your actions. Are you willing to take the risks involved? Because the BTC market isn’t in very strong at the moment and the uncertainty is about at an ATH. And if all you own is a now-uncertain business and BTC during a crypto winter, it’s probably time to think about more opportunities as well.",

Hope you guys can help me with good advice.I think you should still consider Bitcoin as secondary investment and not the primary one. It's good to know you are investing only some portion from the actual income into the Bitcoin. First get to know Bitcoin, its one crazy horse to ride and control. Its volatility rules are mind wobbling so its better to focus more on your Business and how you could grow it with the time in the bad times like these. You should always keep up your Bitcoin purchases and see how it goes over the period of time. Why I am saying not jump all in is due to its volatile nature. Since your business is already running low, it means you need to keep up with daily needs with little bit of struggle. Hope so you will calculate the finances properly and make your choices.

Hope you guys can help me with good advice.Yes, if you can invest in Bitcoin then you'll earn good returns after holding the investment for 10-20 years. As you mentioned in your post that you are working in a small cloth shop in a country that's affected by inflation, so in that scenario I recommend you to invest only the money that you can afford to live without. Do not starve yourself or your family to stake your money into Bitcoin, but only invest the money that won't affect your life and your family life in any adverse way. First of all, you should calculate your expanses and when you are done calculating those expanses then you should invest the remaining portion of the money into Bitcoin as that won't affect your life at all. You should also keep in mind that Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme and it's like a commodity in which you invest and leave it to go higher in value. The current rate of Bitcoin is not so high and if you're already investing in it then you should continue that and accumulate as much Bitcoin over next few years as you possibly can. Once your investments are enough then Hold your Bitcoin for 1-2 decades before selling them to secure profit. It's expected that Bitcoin's price will be in millions after a decade or more and you may earn quite enough profits by holding your Bitcoin.I also recommend you to keep your Bitcoin in a secure cold wallet. You should install a software wallet in your computer and when you generate a wallet with that software you should remember to copy your private key and save it on many storage devices that aren't connected to internet. You should also save your seed phrase in those storage devices and at the same time you should also backup your wallet.dat on those storage devices. I recommend you to use USB flash drive, and SSD's as storage devices because they are better than hard drives and they last for longer periods. Once you have done copying your private key, seed phrase, and your wallet.dat on the storage devices then you should disconnect that computer from internet and only copy the wallet address with you so that when you accumulate more bitcoin you can transfer those to your cold wallet. You should also write your private key and seed phrase on a paper and keep that in a secure place. Investing in Bitcoin won't make a person rich over night, but after some years the return on investment could be very high. The price of Bitcoin keeps increasing because the supply of it is limited to 21 million BTC only and with each halving the amount of Bitcoin are reduced per block. The current halving event is expected in 2024 and after that the block reward will decrease from 6.25 to only 3.125 Bitcoin per block, and after that the next halving that's expected to occur in 2028-2029 and with that the reward will further reduce from 3.125 to 1.5625 Bitcoin per block and so on. With each halving period the amount of Bitcoin reduce per block and that creates scarcity in the supply which triggers more demand for it and thus prices increase with the demand.",

It is called \"dollar cost averaging\". Investing lump sum has the possibility of generating better returns but it is just a \"possibility\" if you don't know how to make educated guesses. DCA'ing on the other hand, will give you the market average and since BTC goes only upwards in the long term, you will likely to make profits. Just hodl tight and don't panic. In the upcoming months the markets might go ape shit because of the FED.",
