I do not know what happens that Europe is full of murders due to mental problems of that kind, because of course, Islamist radicals do not murder unless they have such problems.",

I do not know what happens that Europe is full of murders due to mental problems of that kind, because of course, Islamist radicals do not murder unless they have such problems.There seems to be some confusion about the motivations or the context of this attack in particular, in my opinion. If I had to bet, it may have something to do with the on going conflict between the Arab world and Israel. People try to put others in the worst light possible for the rest of the observing public to show less empathy for them.Anyways, it would not be the first time some white European person gets converted and radicalized to carry out atrocities in the name of Islam. Whatever is going on, one can only hope for French and European authorities to get fully in alert during these challenging times. People are losing their minds easily and the news from the middle east are more than enough to push those mentally unstable/radicallized ones over the edge.",

You didn't get the irony, did you? If the murderer had been a white Frenchman who voted for Le Pen we would have his face all over the media explaining how the ultra-right has committed a murder, but in cases like this the media always find an excuse to downplay the drama of what happened, in this case saying that the murder has nothing to do with his radical Islamist views but that it was a poor fool who killed because of his madness.",

Yes. Actually, I admit that the message of irony or the pint you were trying to make completely went over my head in this occasion. Casually, I have been listening to international news this morning, specifically those from MSNBC and they covered the news. They mentioned the number of hurt people and the fact the author of the violence also screamed Allah akbar, during the attack. Though, they indeed mentioned that man alledgely had already been detained for 4 years previously and had an history of mental illness. Anyways. Sometimes I miss how the news were handed back in the Early 2000's, when reporters cared to be neutral and refrain from giving their personal opinion .",

It only takes a look at the TV or the YouTube channel of some media outlets to start counting on the attacks carried against both Muslims and Jewish people. Also, on the point of France banning certain customs of the Islamic people, I would say it is an isolated case within the western world, after all, in the most of the countries of this part of the planet, any muslin is allowed to wear what they consider to be fit for their religion, on the other hand though, it is the opposite in countries where the Sharia law is the normal set of judicial rules.",

It's sad that these terrorists and mentally ill individuals use religion as an excuse toÂ  commit these murders, I believe that there are also monstrous individuals that stay in the background that brainwashes these mentally ill individuals to kill innocent people for no justifiable reasons. If I didn't have Muslim friends who are very responsible, I'd have ignorantly associated Islam with terrorism. The activities of terrorists in the world are increasing, so nations should increase their security alertness to protect lives from thethi hands of these murderers.",

This is only a news and the actual incidence can be manipulated and presented in a way that would like something is wrong somewhere. This happens virsually everywhere and we should not act like there is something going on that the news do not want us to know. Actually I have seen so many incidence like this where tourists where killed and was hidden from the news to avoid the anger of other tourists and hatred. The whole story was tagged to be the work of a psychopath that infiltrated the killing.",

If I had to guess, I would say it was more to do with a mixture of radical ideals and also mental instability, one if them is enough to push anyone to commit disgusting acts, when both are present then worse things can happen. Though, I indeed agree with you we all should be careful during these strange times and do not take unnecessary risks ir deal with people we do not fully trust, those tourist did not take any unnecessary risks though, they were just simply trying to have lovely vacations in a lovely location. In the end that is what terrorists want, to make us afraid of living a meaningful and good life.",
