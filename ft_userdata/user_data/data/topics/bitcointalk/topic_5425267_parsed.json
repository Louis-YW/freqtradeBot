The marketplace is pretty new in the game and just started building their reputation so if we're talking about playing it safe, I'd say not yet, at least not with significant items/amounts.",

      "body": "Why they require a 10% of product value to be deposited in bitcoin when I want to lise an item? Is it for avoiding fake listing or it's their escrow fee? I don't know how such escrow based marketplace works, I have never used any. However, requiring such a deposit doesn't interest me to list anything there. I was checking and trying to list an item for my country but step down when I saw ot requires an initial deposit.",

      "body": "Making a deposit before you make an advertisement is suspicious behavior, and I do not expect that you will grow in the number of users with this strategy, given that many other options are available.The most important aspect of such services is the activity of the people who advertise and the advertisers who will buy, the use of the guarantee is not essential as long as the evaluation system, trust, user comments work efficiently.",

Is it for avoiding fake listing or it's their escrow fee? IProbably for service charge or transaction fee, but asking deposits first is suspicious even though it is refundable. No reputed marketplace as of today did this kind of fees/charge, especially not for a marketplace who currently trying to build a name or building their reputation.Edit: I tried to read their FAQ, and i guess the 10% deposit is misinterpreted for deposit. It is a service fee, 10% fee minus to your entered price in their, you don't need to deposit first but, once a buyer bought an item with a complete transaction, you will receive 10% minus of your product price.Quote from: Little Mouse on December 06, 2022, 01:24:03 PMI think you have misunderstood that. They require a deposit at the beginning of the listing. I have checked them.Oooff, yeah, that's right.",
