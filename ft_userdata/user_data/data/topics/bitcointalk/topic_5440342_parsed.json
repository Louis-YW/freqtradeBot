After some few days, I started receiving PMs from brand-new accounts asking me to investigate on some more accounts.I think some people don't have balls that are big enough to expose alts using their real accounts, thinking things might backfire on them. Some are trying to do it inform of revenge or trying to snitch. Others are definitely targeting to farm some merit and trust.",
