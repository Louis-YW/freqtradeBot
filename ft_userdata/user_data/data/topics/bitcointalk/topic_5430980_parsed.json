  "content": "MYRIAD MAZE- Official Announcement -MyriadMaze.comMultiplayer Dungeon CrawlerCustomize and Upgrade AvatarFind Ancient Memory CardsCreate Powerful OrbsMap Devious MazesDiscover Great TreasuresEarn MyriadcoinQ: What is special about Myriad Maze?A: Myriad Maze will use Glitter as an unit of barter within the game. Every Glitter will be fully backed (and redeemable) by one Myriadcoin (XMY).Q: Why use a proof of work crypto coin as the backbone for an in game economy?A: I wanted a direct economic link with real value. Not a token with artificial (and unsustainable) values set by the founder. I believe this was the original intention of cryptocurrency. Glitter will be fully backed by Myriadcoin.Q: Why use Myriadcoin and not some other proof of work coin?A: Myriadcoin was fairly mined using five different algorithms, and has been in existence for over 8 years. It's low market cap and strong fundamentals allows a huge upside for growth.Q: What is the difference between Myriadcoin and Glitter?A: While every Glitter is back by one Myriadcoin, making them equal in value, there is one major difference. Glitter is primarily a game cosmetic that can be used to buy cosmetic enhancements for your avatar or bartered with other players. This makes Glitter technically a commodity, while Myriadcoin is technically a cryptocurrency.Q: Is Myriad Maze a Play-to-Earn game?A: Myriad Maze is primarily meant to be played for fun and challenge. I believe this should always be the first goal of any game designer. However, I also believe that integrating real economic value can greatly enhance play. There needs to be synergism between people playing for just fun, people trying to earn money, and people that just like the thrill of trading or flipping valuable items. Q: How do I convert Glitter to Myriadcoin?A: There will be an in game system that allows you to directly sell Glitter for Myriadcoin. Simply paste your Myriadcoin address, enter the amount of Glitter you wish to sell. Confirm and you will receive the Myriadcoin. For small values, this will be instant. Larger values might require some oversight to prevent problems though.Q: Will one Glitter always be worth one Myriadcoin?A: Yes. While I expect Myriad Maze to have some income, I also have a huge reserve of Myriadcoin as backup.Q: When will Myriad Maze be released?A: Myriad Maze will be released as Alpha in early 2023. This will just be the maze part of the game with some Glitter to find (that can be immediately redeemed for Myriadcoin) and is mainly to test my server code. Later in 2023, after server testing, I plan to release a Beta version that will implement the full game system where you will be able to sell Glitter, but not buy it. Full version should be ready by 2024 where you can exchange Glitter with Myriadcoin in a one to one ratio. Q: Will this affect the price of Myriadcoin?A: I hope so. As of today (Dec 22, 2022), the price of Myriadcoin is below $0.0001 on Bittrex. In other words, you can buy over 10,000 XMY for a single dollar. Market cap is less than $200,000. There are crypto coins with zero utility and zero use with market caps of several million dollars. At one point Myriadcoin had a market cap of nearly $100,000,000 or 500 times today. I wish to demonstrate that real utility can lead to real value even exceeding it's previous market cap. Note that this is not meant to be an investment (or investment advice), but to be a social experiment in the economic value of real utility.",
