  "content": "Is there any multi chain crypto wallet that supports moonbeam? I use trust wallet most times and Monnbeam isn't supported yet in the wallet, since Moonbeam use a separate blockchain its hard to find a wallet for this project. Also Moonbeam missed out in this past bull market, I am guessing its a good project for the future, if thing goes as plan this project might worth 100$ per coin someday.",
