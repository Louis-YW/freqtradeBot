You, their victims, will never know they are getting scammed because of the trick they used on them. Just imagine where you are being called by not just a common scammer but someone who has your complete private details as if they work directly with the exchange you use. How can you not believe them? Then again, the point where they advise you to move your fund into your own cold wallet, not the one they give to you, never will it occur to the victim that this is the point where they are going to get scammed. The only place their victims make mistakes is where they try to reconfirm their seed phrase, and the scammer will get hold of it.",

I'm quite cautious with what I'm clicking and sites I access that's why I use different devices Why for surfing the web and doing shit The Other for My holdings and engaging in things that doesn't require me accessing the Net.

Also, never let fear run over you and thereby ignoring all this proofs of scams.Thanks for this God bless you, we all need to be careful.",

The easiest way is to avoid leaving your information everywhere, and take everything that you see with a grain of salt. If in doubt, probe them further and directly contact the company.",

I was wondering if they were pure psychopaths who don't care about stealing a few satoshis from poor people but the scammer says he targets people who have at least $50K, which is what he has from an Unchained Capital database. I guess this way he feels better thinking that he is “only” stealing from rich people, but what doesn't make sense to me is that people with so much money (according to him bankers, businessmen, etc) fall into the trap. I guess that as in all scams they play with big numbers and only with 1 successful scam in a month (by mistake or whatever) it pays the prize.",

That's why we need to protect our identities and be more private because there are many unscrupulous people out there who will steal something valuable that we have. Their principle is simple, stealing using the skills they have, I also read some news that there were a group of young people stealing bitcoins from someone's wallet and they started planning something evil by contacting the perpetrators who said they were the service party of the wallet used.If we are smart enough and aware, there is actually no service that will contact us unless we send them a message via the service number or email. Theft occurs due to negligence, therefore protect the assets we have and never give anything that is asked by others. Being anonymous is much better and let people not know that we have a number of bitcoins in the wallet we have.",

Whatever the type and form of crime, all of them are truly heinous and dishonorable, especially if their targets are people who are really not rich. i think they don't care who their targets are, and this is truly immorals. So, from this video we need to learn a lot to avoid scams, data theft, or other types of crime, namely by carefully maintaining the confidentiality of our personal data, especially keeping our bitcoin, and if possible, storing it offline, and use another secondary wallet for main or daily activity. So, if something wrong happened, our main vault of bitcoin is really safe.",

I have watched hundreds of episodes so far. I see some people learned these tricks from YouTube, and now they are doing it on their own. But most of them work for scam call center companies. Their payment is based on commission. So, they focus on scamming people.",

While the scammers are working hard to steal from notable investors, it is paramount that we as investors and potential investors work way harder to keep upgrading our knowledge on the best practices to stay safer, because in the end, it doesn't matter the kind of hardware or hot wallet that one uses,  what will matter is the attention one pays to details of transaction and every other issue that surrounds the security of these wallets and processes.This is why it is also important to read up on more subjects in this forum that borders around this topic of scams and hacks so as to stay trendy and be more aware of the ways to protect oneself from these hiccups.",
