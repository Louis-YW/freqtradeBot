      "body": "Howdy! Yup, it looks to me like that hash256 function would've done a double SHA-256. You can define your own function to replace that import, like this:Code:from hashlib import sha256def hash256(data):    return sha256(sha256(data).digest()).digest()That should work identically to the missing function (i.e. print(hex(int.from_bytes(hash256(b'my message'), 'big'))) should emit 0x231c6f3d980a6b0fb7152f85cee7eb52bf92433d9919b9c5218cb08e79cce78).",

Only use hexdigest() method after you have calculated a final hash.Instead of Code:print(h(h(\"my secret\".encode()).hexdigest().encode()).hexdigest())DoCode:print(h(h(\"my secret\".encode()).digest()).hexdigest())You can also use f-strings to add 0x to final representation:Code:print(f'0x{h(h(\"my secret\".encode()).digest()).hexdigest()}')",

Quote from: unknowncustomer on May 26, 2023, 08:28:06 AMI am quite new to Python and Programming Bitcoin, any idea where I should start ? which books ?I'd say you're already on the right path; just keep trying to do stuff and ask questions when you get really stuck. The best programmers I know basically taught themselves by trial-and-error. Books, and courses, etc. can help, but (in my experience) nothing will teach you better or faster than mindful practice.In the beginning, you'll feel like this guy:But after a while, you'll start to feel like this guy:Just keep practicing. (Feel free to send me a PM if you get really stuck on something.)",

Although if you prefer something shorter, check learn me a bitcoin website[2] instead. Aside from @PowerGlove said, i find reading documentation and example of certain library/function is helpful to prevent problem like this.[1] https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook[2] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/",
