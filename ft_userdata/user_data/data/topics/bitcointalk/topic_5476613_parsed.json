Text me would be ignore automatically4. they only reply to something interest them, so far all my topic is too broad thus they do not know how to reply, they just ignore them. I had to be specific when texting5. their device is broken, or the internet is broken, or the text didn't reach them for unknown reason, censorship?",

Is something happens to them that they are so busy that they can't even reply once? I mean ALL of them, not just one or two or them, IS ALL OF THEM, it is like complete silence!Just take some consideration since not everyone is active on social media so maybe they are busy on their own hustle and didn't bother to go back those messages they read online.Also try to approach them nicely and say that your intention to approach them is not to ask some loan or credit and just want to say hello for them. Since usually people will not reply if they know the intention of people. Extend more your patience since maybe they have other things that needed to take care for and answering you is not in their priority but later on maybe you might get an answer from them.",

Your account might be once hacked and they ignored the scammer3.  They might have heard something wrong about you they are displease with and acted upon4. Try reachout to other people and check for the same reason if it continues that people keep ignoring you5. If you're less important to some people, they try to ignore you, things might have changed very much from how you left them.",

Are they your close friends? Consider thinking deeper. Well if they really are your friends and there is something going on thats why people arent messageing then they shouldve told ypu. But usually, people might be caught up in stuff. Give it a bit, and they might pop back up. If you're really curious, maybe drop a casual message to see what's going on.",

If your answer is yes, it means that there seems to be a problem or something wrong with you.When you know they have read your message and only seen zone or no comments, it means either they don't want to talk to you or they may already know the reason why you chatted with them. It's like all your friends are weird and don't want to replay you; wouldn't you be surprised? Won't you think about what you did that they saw in you that they didn't like something like that?",

When people find out about your financial struggles, some may not be able to help you and ignore you, while others may not want to help you even if they have the means to do so. Some people may be too busy with their own lives to lend a hand. I consider myself lucky because I know that if I'm ever struggling, there's someone I can turn to who will listen to me, even if they can't solve my problems. Having someone who will lend an ear when you need it is important. If you want to be that person for someone else, make sure you're willing to listen and support them, not just help them because you need something from them.",

Part of it is due to I'm getting quite drained of energy, if I was to go through one by one reply with deeply thought reply, it is insane, I'm not superman, I would have to be died to overthinking myself to dead just to please the readers, but it is disturbing, despite I'm hinting I would not entertain some unworthy reply but it is still spammed with countless reply which I couldn't do nothing about, it is here to wearing down me or it is just want to harm me idk, don't blame me for low grade reply, I am very drained to answer one by one honestly, I am also a lot less healthier now, you must know I need to be healthy to think deep, cheers!",

You OP, should be able to introspectively scrutinize yourself as to why such is happening. Maybe you haven't leveled up to their stand and don't intend to in the nearest future. Let me tell you a secret, once you get to invest in cryptocurrency mostly BTC as you earn, with a steady DCA strategy, am sure in a couple of years, these same friende would be the ones to call just to hear from you. Crypto is decentralized and personal to a very long extent, and the way you earn or make profit from it either by trading or HoDling, would guarantee your independence from these friends.",
