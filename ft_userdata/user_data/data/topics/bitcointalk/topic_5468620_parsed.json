I wonder by introducing this ID verification what special Australia is looking to achieve from it?  They are making online gambling there properly regulated which is good for me. I know that most fiat online gambling sites already ask for KYC directly through the registration page which is why I don't know what will be the setup for this since according to the article, and from what I understand, it would be a different KYC from the gambling site and for the government.It might totally eliminate underage gambling but at least, it should minimize one of the problems of gambling there.Although everyone doesn't like the idea of KYC, there is no choice but to comply. Generally, only in Australia.",

If so, what’s the purpose of this new law?  I believe they make lots of money from gambling in Australia. If they make it harder for the players, then the Australian government will lose lots of money. That means less health care, less infrastructure, less security etc…I think they are trying to ban gambling without directly banning it because they don’t have the balls to do it. The sheeple are not sheep enough.",

I wonder by introducing this ID verification what special Australia is looking to achieve from it?  I think we have talked something similar to this last year. If not last year, it would be early this year or so. The ban of credit card will discourage gambling, there is nothing it has to do with underage. It is even easy for underage to go to betting shops, especially those that are 16 or 17 years old that will look like they are 18 years already. The second link which is about gambler digital ID can be more linked to an effective way not to allow underage gambling, but this is another step to make privacy to becoming the thing of the past.",

In my country, we still have no strict regulation but I hope they are working into this so they can eliminate fake sites and fake agents.",

It does look like they are very alarmed by these issues that they have put an extra effort to impose another step to eliminate irresponsible gambling.  However, minor gamblers may be a little harder to eradicate especially online, because there are several ways to bypass it plus the other casinos might be a little loose with their KYC compliance and lastly, the underground online casinos.",

I wonder by introducing this ID verification what special Australia is looking to achieve from it?  They cannot stop that what you said is really happening there. Maybe they should pass a law penalize those adult individual help those minors to gamble. Maybe with this they can really reduce the cases of minors doing such activities. If they didn't put some penalty maybe the case became different since for sure with having this no adults will help young people for that situation since they are the one will get chased by authorities if they found out such activities exist on their homes. Casino KYC implementation is doing good to combat any illegal activities and for sure for knowing that exist on a casino this abusers or minors will think twice if they continue their illegal act there or just avoid and seek for another casino.",

If a gambling site could require that and we would comply, there should be no problem with that. Of course, it will reduce the number of gamblers if what was happening before the new rule was introduced is that minors were allowed to gamble. It will just definitely correct what is wrong.Now, everyone submits an ID before gambling, making it easier for the government to track their gambling activities, as gambling sites are also regulated by the same government that requires the ID. Nothing is anonymous now; with government intervention, it becomes known to them already. But don't worry, they promise to keep that information secret, as there's a privacy law. Only you, the government, and the gambling site would know, no one else, unless someone leaks that info.",

Raising awareness of the player protection tools available to consumers has been considered an important step to achieving a safer gambling market where betting is enjoyed responsibly.The government of Australia is very serious about its enforcement, they do not want to see the very high figures that they saw their people losing on online casinos the government of Australia will monitor the development of their measures to ensure success, the players cannot so anything but to comply, or they cannot longer play in their favorite online casinos.",

The sizable gambling population in Australia has led to numerous individuals experiencing losses, with a 2022 report revealing that a staggering $22 billion of gamblers' funds vanished into the abyss of defeat. This underscores the necessity for Australia to begin enhancing its gambling mechanisms in order to reduce them to a more typical level.Imposing restrictions on young children is a highly plausible means of safeguarding their future from gambling addiction. Alternatively, a more positive outcome would be for these children to remain entirely oblivious to gambling, allowing them to grow into adulthood without the influence of gambling in Australia.https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-welfare/gamblinghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_in_Australia",

For example, playing at a large casino like Stake at level 1 only fills in information data without having to provide identity for level 2 verification, of course minors will not go for level 2 verification, because as we know money what they hold is not as big as big gamblers, at most only small gamblers with small bets because minors will not have a lot of money.So they only carry out level 1 verification, which is more than enough to be able to withdraw money and make deposits, unless they are big gamblers, but even so, I sometimes see minors doing things like that, giving their identity in the name of their uncle, usually their uncle is also a gambler, so there is cooperation between them, it is rare for minors to gamble using their father's identity because it will create new problems for them with their parents.",
