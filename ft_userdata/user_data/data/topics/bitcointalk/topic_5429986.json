  "content": "So 2 months ago I started to accept Cryptocurrency as a payment system in my rice business. Here's the previous post if you are interested:I started business many days ago. Now it's time to accept Crypto as a payment. After this post, I got so a good deal of help from you guys. The information you shared with me and those advices has helped me a lot.For the past 2 months, I have got some payment through Binance pay. Not too many people were aware of crypto and those who knew, they were very excited. I am a wholesaler, so I sell in bulk, and they were very happy to pay me with Crypto. I have 4 customers, who pay me through Binance. They were worried about BTC payment as it takes time for the transactions to complete. [I don't know much about how to do it faster. If anyone knows, please leave your comments below. It will be very helpful.] So here's the transaction that were made by them. I am very happy that this is going well, and I will also try to teach people who don't know about crypto payment or crypto at all.In the future, I hope we can build a community of crypto users and do our business that way.

As for your problem with delay in confirmation, using lightning network for your transaction would be faster. It was already suggested that you adopt lightning network in your previous thread. It seems you haven’t done so yet, I guess you didn’t see it or aren’t familiar with the process. You can read it up here  “Basics of the Lightning Network”.I also noticed your customers pay in BNB and USDT, I didn’t see any bitcoin transaction. Are you only accepting these coins as payment?",

I think it will make your life much easier and safer if you go through a private key wallet. I understand that it's easier to convert your cryptos into some other cryptos using this method but with a little bit of effort you can do that in a wallet too. But yes I feel the one advantage of Binance Pay is that it's free for the sender as well if he is on the Binance platform only so Technically that's an advantage but this advantage is surely coming with a lot of disadvantages as well. I am desperately waiting for someone to make such a solution over a decentaralized blockchain.",

The thing with Bitcoin is currently we've got a lot of it's users thinking that its too valuable to be purchasing anything with in its current climate. Therefore, they hold it instead. That's true for most recessions, but particularly so for Bitcoin since it definitely has the potential to increase ten fold in a short period of time. I wouldn't worry about expanding your advertising or anything like that for Bitcoin payments, since it probably wouldn't be worth it, at least in the money return. If you want to do it because you just want to promote Bitcoin, by all means. However, the need for rice, and the amount of people willing to spend their Bitcoin for rice in the current market situation isn't going too be many.",

Cheers._tjtonmoyCongratulations, the biggest thing you have achieved in your business life is that you have patiently traded and intelligently used cryptocurrency as your business payment system.  It is true that initially you will not get great feedback because maybe few people in your country know about cryptocurrency especially they are not that much interested in cryptocurrency payments.  If you patiently implement cryptocurrency payment in business system then you can get big things in future.  Moreover, seeing your business system, others will show interest in crypto currency.",

It's like converting your dollars to something much more risky to hold, without any reward. Usually when you take the risk there's a possibility of a reward that works as an incentive. In this case there's none of that. You don't even do any good for bitcoin by using a stable coin. You don't popularize bitcoin payments this way, don't encourage people to invest, don't earn any money... Don't get me wrong, you should accept it if people are willing to pay with it. As the old Latin saying goes pecunia non olet. I'm just curious why someone would go through all these hoops to buy an altcoin that's made to simulate a fiat currency instead of paying you with a real crypto.",

Later on, it's already up to the OP how he can restock his/her products, so overall, if OP goal is to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method without goal of investment then everytime there's a payment, OP can convert those cryptocurrency to some fiat currency or stablecoins which I know Binance is very capable of doint it.",
