Bisq is a good Dex, but the problem with Dex is that they don't have many local currency, but few, unlike CEX. I can say from the knowledge that I have back days in my country when there was no exchanges, people trade bitcoin through Watsap group, where everyone there is into bitcoin either to buy or sell. But it was somehow risky because you can get scam by members in that group.",

Also people traded with each other on bitcoin related forums like this base on mutual trust and nothing more. Mt.Gotx came in 2010 but before then buying bitcoin wasn’t common like we have now because people either got it easily through faucets or they simply mine bitcoin then which was easy done on CPU not like today were we need ASICS which are expensive. As for the wallet it was bitcoin core at the early stages and not the new wallets we have now. Currently there are many exchanges or platforms to exchange your coins and also to keep privacy, you can use decentralized exchanges for that",

People prefer accessibility and easiness over autonomy and independency. They always go for exchanges or middlemen services, because they are instant, even though customers have to pay an extra price for that. For me it doesn't make sense at all, but what can I do? If I have to sell my coins, I don't have any options besides sticking to exchanges for that purpose.That is how people have been dealing with Bitcoin along the years and I really don't think it's going to change anytime futurelly. It seems centralization always overcome decentralization, after all.",

These days if you want to buy without using the likes of anti-bitcoin scamcoin peddling exchanges like shitcoinbase that require you to upload a mugshot of yourself while holding your passport then you can use a decentralized exchange. Bisq is a decent option. Be caution however that most decentralized exchanges \"dex\" these days are scams. Everything built on eth is a scam. Despite all the hype and noise about eth being the king of \"dex\" there is not a single \"dex\" on eth that allows you to trade government currency like usd for bitcoin.",

I remember well first time I bought bitcoin trough Payza site and convert my dollar fund to bitcoin but the process in manually around one until three hours later but rate of bitcoin depend on first time transaction and Payza have giving the warning if bitcoin price for three hours later get little down. I think have many site supported for converting our dollar fund to get bitcoin, using many kinds of third party site seems the possibilities how to buy and sell bitcoin before having many top CEX exchange. Right now many of third party side supported convert buy and sell bitcoin have shut down with their website due many user not using their service yet for converting bitcoin.",

There are a good number of p2p exchanges where you can trade directly without third parties, just as how it was done in the past. These p2p exchanges can also set up f2f trades for customers who want to trade that way, but you must follow safety protocols if you are going to meet your trading partner in person.
