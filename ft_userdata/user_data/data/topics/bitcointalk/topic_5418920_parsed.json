      "body": "Starting a business is not easy these days. Central banks are constantly raising interest rates. That's why money circulation is so difficult. Even big companies are laying off their workers. In fact, prominent economists talk about the risk of recession every day. If I make a lot of money, I will not start a business. It is very difficult to be a business owner under these risks. Instead of starting a business, I put my money in the bank and get interest income. When my money stays in the bank, there is a possibility that my money will lose value in the face of inflation. But when I start a business, I am likely to experience greater losses. I think banks or cryptocurrencies are safer than starting a business.",

Which is I make sure to have maybe 1% of the money to gamble again maybe aim to have fun and not for another attempt to win a huge amount again.

Is it to buy are car or start a business?        Let's discuss about it together. Well, seeing as you are asking this kind of question in a forum dedicated to users who invest in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, because they know them to be the future, I would say most of people here would invest a large portion of their winnings into crypto. At least, that is exactly what I would do. And since I gamble with crypto in the first place, I would not even have to do anything other than hodl in order to achieve that.A part would go to my family. I would buy them everything they need, obviously. I mean whats the point in having money if you don't spend some of it to improve the lives of the people you love?Not sure about the 3 other things I would do.",

I'll definitely buy things that will make me secure all my life, like a house and lot on my own farm so I can be sustainable and of course invest in Cryptocurrency, stocks, and established businesses in our country, we all want to be secure our whole life I will avoid luxury items that I do not need, winning a huge amount is a once in a lifetime experience so you have to make the most of it.",

You have to give a specific number of money for the contribution to be around that estimate. You make it open and it will not give a good level to judge what people saying if they can use the money very well. You can make this thread more intelligent if you put such price money. Me I will invest with money I win if I get up to money to buy land(s).... You see why you need to add the amount  Quote from: Oshosondy on October 31, 2022, 10:06:52 AMFive things to buy if someone win huge amount if money is off-topic to gambling and gambling discussion. It is off topic. No it can stay here also. It is a gambling discussion and what come under gambling like winning can be a discussion here.",

I wouldn't call 10k huge. It's a decent money if you want to buy groceries but not enough to buy a decent used car, not to mention a new one. I wouldn't say no to 10k but It wouldn't take my breath away either.If I had 10k, I'd just waste it on things that I need on daily basis. If I had a huge amount like 100k or more, I'd do some investing and buy more bitcoin.",

Is it to buy are car or start a business?        Let's discuss about it together. That's so unrealistic to happen to me and still so many people think and dream about it. Of course I have thought about it extensively myself and made a plan. It's not really about 5 things I would buy, rather a few steps to take. Step 1 would be of course to cash out, no need to risk a huge win to go for an even bigger win. Step 2 would be to pay off all my debts, and give some money to my parents as they struggling right now with the rising living costs. Step 3 would be investing, rather than buy something big like a new car I would invest it and wait a few years to treat myself. My main investment would be crypto currencies and buying a house to rent out. Only then with the monthly rental income I would buy things for myself.",
