Even it has attained all-time-high several times and $69000 is not the last. If you have a mind for long term investment in bitcoin and you invest when the price is low, you will see your money increasing when the bull time comes. The possibility that you will lose is far lesser to the possibility that you will gain if you invest in bitcoin.",

When investing in something there is always risk involved. I think risk is the possibility of gaining or losing something valuable.During the early years when bitcoin was invented and many were introduced into this new digital currency and technology, some doubted that how possible could this be and so on, those that accepted and invested never regret making their decision for once, the advice I will give you is to build more courage on what you already have been taught about bitcoin and make more research on the past events on bitcoin from how it started to where it was today, this will be the best motivation that can keep you moving ahead towards the better futures that are yet to get unfolded about bitcoin because we will soon be arriving at another all time high soon.Those that were afraid all these years will always remain on the same spot while you taking decision and risk on bitcoin will always have better opportunities over them that sit down and fold their hands watching, now is the time you're paying for it worth by taking the risk, when it's time for maturition, you will enjoy the benefits of holding a bitcoin investment.",

OP is just curious about how his investing will turn out. He is aware of the possibility of either losing or gaining money. Second is his earning or his living is not solely reliant on crypto. He has another source of income. Which means he doesn't pressure himself. He just let the market do its thing. This is one of the best-shared experiences on this forum I've experienced so far. It's just he has the trust to BTC that it has real value and by that it will raise its price years from now. It seems that he haven't had solid plan for investing yet but I am sure that his mindset will save him from losing lots of money.",

Because in fact, many bitcoin investors have predicted that in the future they will experience enormous growth. Whether it is seen in terms of price increases or it can also be seen in terms of popularity among the world community. So your decision to invest in bitcoin is indeed a very good and very right decision. Moreover, the bitcoin halving is coming soon, it is certain that if the bitcoin market experiences a bull run, the money you invest will increase.QuoteWhen investing in something there is always risk involved. I think risk is the possibility of gaining or losing something valuable.Regarding risk when investing, it will definitely always be there, including when investing in bitcoin as well. Because basically, anything that smells profitable or productive, it is certain that it will always be followed by risks that may have to be faced. So when you start deciding to jump into bitcoin investment, you also really have to be prepared with all the consequences that exist. But that risk can still be minimized. That is by continuing to add knowledge or insight about bitcoin, then train your mind well, and don't be an investor who is too greedy.",

Well for sure almost all people in this industry will have positive attitude towards this technology simply because we benefit from it. But people who are negative towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, are most likely ones who are outside this industry. However not all of them are just lacking the knowledge about blockchains 'coz some of them are just not having the initiative to engage in this technology because of their own reasons and one I guess is the risk involved. As more institutions accept cryptos, there's still a chance for non believers of this industry, we jist have to be patient as ones who understand it more.",

Some other people prefer to keep their money in banks. They don't have this saving and investing mentality which is why they keep their money in fiat and watch it gradually lose value in banks due to inflation.

Only a very number of kids think to save and gather up these money until it is enough for something good. You have always been blessed with the rich mindset of saving up and trying to make more from the little you have, that is why it was not hard for you to fall in love with bitcoins and decide to buy to keep it until it gives you more than what you put in.

Bitcoin is a high risk investment but if you trust and hold it for long term, the risk of losing will be reduced and with right mindset and attitude, not selling when price turns crashing, then you will have bigger opportunities to reap huge profits in time. My advice is just tighten your faith, bitcoin may move so slowly, but when bull market happens, every hardwork and patience you did will paid off and selling at its peak price will bring exceptional profits more than you imagine.",
