  "content": "as a crypto trader sometimes, there's this question that usually comes to my mind and that is if there are people out there who are into Bitcoin investment fulltime and then if crypto currency paid me more than my current job, would I quit my job to go into Bitcoin fully?So yesterday, as I went out at night to grab some snacks for myself. I bumped into a group of friends who were also into cryptocurrency trading. Then it turned on me that I should drop my question of whether Bitcoin or crypto trading could be a full-time hustle that would continuously put food on our tables in the near future and if they could quit their current jobs going into Bitcoin investment fulltime?Their responses were quit alike saying that  \"to them, Bitcoin would continue to be a side hustle and since the price of cryptocurrency is volatile they could loss the value of their investment at anytime. they also said that they couldn't quit their jobs as that would continue to bring more capital for their investment\"after this encounter, I decided to bring this question too to the Bitcoin community itself so I would hear from other traders like myself. What is your opinion about this would you quit your job and go into Bitcoin investment, considering it as a full-time hustle?",

They do not have that much time and resources to do crypto fulltime.2) Concept of crypto is new. So less people will bet on it completely.",

In cryptocurrency, you can gain income from investment, trading, coding, community management, graphic design, animation design and more.Unfortunately, no guarantee that you will always have profit from investment and trading. No guarantee that you will always have jobs in cryptocurrency. The very tough challenge from cryptocurrency is it has bull and bear years and bearish time in cryptocurrency market is very terrible. You will hardly to get jobs in bearish market.QuoteWhat is your opinion about this would you quit your job and go into Bitcoin investment, considering it as a full-time hustle?If you can have them both, keep them both.

What is your opinion about this would you quit your job and go into Bitcoin investment, considering it as a full-time hustle?Many people in this world nowadays have found great value in bitcoin as a means of generating income to address their financial issues. As a result, some view bitcoin as a potential source of employment, even though they are aware that there is no guarantee they will continue to be making money from their Bitcoin investments always.It's not a smart idea to quit your job for a cause you can't be sure of. The primary issue with bitcoin is that there is no assurance over it because of the volatility. Bitcoin is seen as a huge opportunity where we may make some money, either through long-term investment or by trading but relying on it fully is a bad idea.As for me, I can't quit my full-time term job where my payment is guaranteed for Bitcoin investment that I can't assure myself that will be making money from it always.I see Bitcoin investment as side hustle and that it what I will always take it to be.",

Many of us actually into bitcoin due to its freedom, ever growing value and demand makes it more of an investment based asset. We all know how it’s growing since its invention, the growth is literally exponential. Every four year cycle is proof of that. It has to be full time endeavour for us then only one can make good progress in the portfolio. Yes peeps are making something on short terms as well but not as side hustle. It does take lot of efforts in that as well, so surely not just side hustle.",

There’s no such thing as consistent on Bitcoin or crypto investment in general. You can be quick rich or quick poor based on the outcome of your investment.Unless you already secured your future funds that will gonna last until you die then this is the best time to do this kind of crazy idea but with moderation.Why would you sacrifice your stable source of income just to focus on Bitcoin investment while you can do both by doing your work and invest your salary on Bitcoin then just hold.",

How are you going to get the money to use in investing? That will be a really poor decision to take. Investing in bitcoin is not a job, it is not a side hustle. Just like every other investment, it just involves buying bitcoins and keeping them safe until they grow and give you profit, how is this a job?

What is your opinion about this would you quit your job and go into Bitcoin investment, considering it as a full-time hustle?The first mistake you made not being able to properly distinguish between bitcoin investment and bitcoin trading. Let me hep you out. Bitcoin investment entails buying bitcoin for the sole reason of keeping it whether in a cold wallet or hot wallet for an extended period of time with the intention that it would appreciate in value. In bitcoin trading, as the name implies, you buy and sell bitcoin frequently in order to make profit from price and market movement in a short period of time. While the duration if the former may be in weeks, months and years, the duration in the later is in minutes, hours and days. Having made this clarification, it is obvious that you bitcoin investment cannot be a full time job but a side hustle if you choose to call it so. However, bitcoin trading can indeed be a full time job or a side hustle but it depends on the trader, their level of experience, goals, and many other factors. Only the individual can say whether they can it to be a side hustle or their main job. A lot of persons are doing it, therefore it is possible but you must weigh the pros and the cons and seek counsel before making that move.",

What is your opinion about this would you quit your job and go into Bitcoin investment, considering it as a full-time hustle?By itself, investing in bitcoin does not require as much time as a job, so even if my financial condition allowed me, I would certainly quit my main job. But I can't imagine that investing takes as much time as the main job, it would take a lot of time if I was a trader, but since I am a long-term investor, I do not need to analyze the chart daily in search of good trades.If everything goes as I expect, maybe in the upcoming bull market I can make enough profit on my investment to leave my job, but for now I keep working as it is my main source of income which also helps me replenish my investment portfolio.",

I feel someone who doesn't have up to millions of dollars in BTC should not consider leaving their job for trading. Take note that trading is different from investing, the latter does not take time away from you, and you can do it while even working more than two jobs.",

Honestly, I have not seen anyone able to make regular profits from this market, especially during bear season, most of the time, it is tough to make a profit, let alone make a steady profit. Moreover, in addition to instability, the future of this industry is still uncertain, so giving up your main job to focus on the market full-time is quite risky. We will have no way back if the market crashes. I would never quit my job to devote all my time to bitcoin, and it would be better to have 2 sources of income than 1.",

Then, I'll say you'd need absolute dedication to stay ahead of other traders in the market and make more profits. If the current work isn't providing you enough time to trade and the pay is nothing compared to what you make in bitcoin, then it's a decision that nobody can take for you. Although, going full time into side hustles sometimes gets boring especially when we just start the journey. Handling the both is also a better way of maintaining your financial security. Always have a second plan to fall back if bitcoin trading surprises you with a decline or losses. You can't predict the outcome of your investment unlike your office work, where you're sure of weekly, monthly or yearly payment.",

You probably have enough by now to live a comfortable life with the money you cash out and still continue to do investing.But for the most part of humans, this is just a “side hustle” as you call it.. some people are just waiting for the opportunity to cash out and buy themselves a car or a better home.. just like in businesses, how many people actually get to the level where they don’t do anything and earn money?
