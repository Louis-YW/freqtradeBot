So I wanted to ask everyone - Do you trust the RNGs and why? Well I was doubtful at the beginning when I was not hitting huge wins and saw other people hitting them I thought that maybe RNG-s are rigged (which of course was nonsense thinking).The fact is that soon after I hit some x2000-x3000 multipliers and if the RNG-s were rigged they would never give those multipliers out.Very lately though not longer than 2 weeks ago I hit my biggest life multiplier which was x9833 in Fish Eye slot from Pragmatic,funny as Pragmatic was a provider I hated before because of their super high volatility and yet I hit it there this win,so I believe the RNG casinos as long as huge multipliers are coming out frequently when the casino has a huge user base,as I see in Stake chat almost every day over x4000 multipliers and they also are from Pragmatic slots so Pragmatic slots provider is my number one RNG provider that I fully believe.",

Why not, do you think people will be using these gambling platforms if they are not trusted, this is not being manipulated because they also loose at the cause of these, if a gambler win over the house then such can be said with fair justice, we should be less concerned about the RNG because it's all about taking risk when we gamble and we all know that games like slots and dice are luck base games, i don't think the gamblers should concentrate more on this than focusing on their game to enjoy the fun in it, giving much thoughts on this will only leads to discouragement and we will begin to think we are being manipulated.",

This is because we have no way to verify our bet, all we can do is trust the providers.If someone can't trust RNGs, then the choice is avoid slots and only gamble in own casino's games, you can verify your bet.If you still not trust both of them, you can gamble in sport bookie.However if you still think sport is rigged, never talk about gambling anymore and go away from this place.",

This is the thing that is hard to actually know that is why you need to use the best gambling site available in your place so at least you can have your peace of mind and you know that it is trusted by many. If you are going to doubt the site then better not to gamble on that site, beside this is more about your luck so don’t expect that much and just continue to gamble with excitement.",

It's all about feelings; if you feel cheated, then in your perception, it's cheating, and if you feel uncheated, it implies that the RNG (Random Number Generator) is fair. This is all highly subjective, as someone who consistently loses on slot machines may view slots as deceitful. Conversely, those who have won from slots may regard them as fair games of chance.Given my infrequent victories in slot games, I tend to perceive the RNG as something manipulated. I prefer card games and sports over having to speculate on the systems used in slot machines. And most importantly, never forget about luck .",

There is no hesitation on my part not to believe it. And even if the casino were cheating, I wouldn't know either but that's okay too. Each gambler may have a different opinion depending on their goals in gambling. And if they want to win, they will check everything and make sure there is no cheating. And when a trusted casino and its providers say it is fair, we can only believe it even though we can check it.",

It’s either you will trust or just don’t play. This gambling software is being audited by their license provider before they can offer it to their customers.This is the only reason why I keep trusting them or maybe just a self justification to satisfy my trust issue because we really have no choice here.

I mean it's the heart of the game like slots, so I don't see reputable casino's rigging it. And possible that in one given time, there are a lot of gamblers playing simultaneous slots from good slots operator so I doubt that they will even attempt a slightest tip on the RNG in their favor. Otherwise, if someone checks or at least there is some suspicions that they are rigging it, then the news will come out and it might hit their reputation. And yes, if you don't trust them, then play other games, simple as that.",

As slot games began to enter the world of gambling more and more players adopted these games as their favorite game. And trusting RNG Since RNG software controls the slots these games must be fair and easy for players. What stops casinos from creating games where they can guarantee players to lose at will and where the software can monitor and confirm your spins. Also in RNG slot games similarly pay out fixed amounts often and offer small wins while others return any money after hundreds of spins or guarantee a win but offer much higher chances with a single spin.",

If Random Number Generation not really work, I think every gambler will lose money faster and there are even many hackers or anyone who tries to manipulate the system to break into games like slots and dice, if they dont have an RNG, it will be easier to manipulate.maybe this is just my own opinion but maybe there are several different opinions here and how long will RNG work for real except for RTP which I never trust.",

So I wanted to ask everyone - Do you trust the RNGs and why? Not really, but they are as reliable as you're going to get. This completely ignores the fact that a casino is naturally a \"blackbox\" operation and could have vast manipulative algorithms running that no player would ever have the ability to detect, so it's a bit of a moot point really. Casinos are generally winners with the odds built into every game in their favor, so they don't really need to go down a route like rigging a random number generator. You'll never get a true random number generator, as you're probably aware, so you just have to accept the best that is on offer which has been doing quite a good job already for decades. If you're heavily into gambling you're probably not that interested in deep number analysis like this anyway.",

But I can say, if you are playing on known sites here, players tend to forget to verify the provable fairness of the game. I believe, people are trusting the site already if they already established their credibility in the community.Hence, very rare that you will encounter a gambler going thru the verification process, let's say in duelbits or stake or sportsbet.But sure, there are several threads here educating users how to determine if the provable fairness is indeed fair.
