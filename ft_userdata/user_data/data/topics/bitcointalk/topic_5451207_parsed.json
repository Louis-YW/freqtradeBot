I have never liked this wind power of a thing right from the day one when I was trying to build my first set of mining rigs, years ago some of my friend advised me to use wind power and from my own research I've got to know that the negative impacts on wind power is the climate change, you have to make sure that you're getting a lot of wind in your area before setting up a wind power. The disadvantage is too high and I don't like it and from my own area I think that using the energy from the sun is far more better than using wind power I have some friends outside country in United State of America from Texas and I hear that it's a good place to set up a wind power generator, because it's always windy.",

Special wind conditions are needed in order for wind turbines to pay off and bring profit. And judging by this news, they didn't bring her either. And it worked only for the future, rather as an experiment. It seems to me that it is necessary to develop this direction, it is eco-friendly, but to strengthen supervision over the appropriation and sale of funds allocated by the state. Because in any case, in the future it will be a profitable project.",

The backlash in political events will delay all sustainable development plans for several years in the future, which will harm the industry. The brilliance is that there are guaranteed funds that will agree to the industry, and therefore the money allocated to research will increase, including cheaper costs and better energy.",

Especially for wind energy, building one wind turbine requires millions of dollars but the results obtained are not worth the costs incurred. Moreover, since it was first introduced, equipment in this industry is not getting cheaper, in contrast to solar panels which are now getting cheaper. So what the wind business is doing is siphoning money from the government to fulfill their so-called \"renewable energy\" dream.",

Evil = \"anything that creates problems and lowers the quality of existence\"Certainty increases when evil is little to zero, while uncertainty increases when evil is much. Evil darkens the mind, and Prediction/Calculation of a darkened mind is limited or full of errors like the error of missing the behaviors/nature of things in future supply chain , resources extraction, global pandemic etc",

It is appealing to use since it offers minimal running costs and a renewable energy source. It is difficult for it to be widely embraced because it is limited to specific regions of the world where there isn't always enough wind to operate the turbine. I think it's a great idea to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels, but we shouldn't rely on it too much because it might fail at any point should the source that powers it cease.",

I have a friend who works in a wind farm company and they have 27 wind farms, not the biggest I know but they are making a hefty profit all the time. They do get some tax cuts as well, so that helps, but USA companies get that too, what makes them lose money? I mean we need to look at what the costs are, that's the trouble because if one nation has wind farms that are profitable and another has it losing money, even when putting up money for it, I feel like there must be something wrong going on, it shouldn't be losing money, it should be making money in buckets. But if the problem is with wind, then if we want clean energy, we do not really need to use wind alone, there are other stuff as well we can use, so it could be no issue at all. Just switch to solar if that's better, depends on the geography I suppose? Not entirely sure, whatever works for you basically, whatever makes profit for that nation, do that. Green energy is a seriously important subject and not a fake deal, we really do need it, but we don't have to insist on a single style, we can give up what doesn't work and switch to something that works and makes profit.",

A decade ago, back in 2013 I had a chance to interact with a few people who were involved in wind turbine installation. Back then, they were quite bullish about the prospects of wind energy. The cost of production was comparable with that of solar energy, and it was considered as an option that is suitable for a wide range of regions (not just regions with high solar radiation). One decade has passed, and the situation has changed completely. Solar production cost has come down considerable, while wind power has become more expensive.

It is glaring that there is a need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases but the economic condition of the US is fragile and more attention needs to be paid to the banking and the entire financial sector. Giving these wind power equipment producers subventions or grants might be the best option but considering the financial standing of the US, the drive for green energy should be reduced for now until the economy recovers. Even the UK government had to open up some of its abandoned coal mines because of the problems caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
