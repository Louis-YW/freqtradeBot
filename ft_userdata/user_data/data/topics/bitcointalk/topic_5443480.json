      "body": "I wonder what is the connection of your post to Ripple and SEC being friends.  Anyway, I do think that the monthly release of xRP greatly affected the XRP price.  It is like a blockade to hinder the growth of XRP price since developers are dumping millions of XRP every month.  Developers had found a milking haven where they don't need to work on anything but still get huge amount of money by dumping their XRP holdings to the unsuspecting investors.  I honestly feel sorry for the people who are holding huge amount of XRP and expecting for it to moon.  I would say, XRP will have a chance moon after the dev finish dumping all their coins.  But the problem is, will the developer still be around after they sold all their holdings/",

Some past top altcoin projects even become dead projects.https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/Ripple got trouble with SEC in the past few years and investors have reasons to worry that Ripple will fail over SEC. They hesitated to invest more and that reduce new capital flow into Ripple that does not help its price on the market.",

I agree with you: if they were friends, they wouldn't have spent a ton of money suing each other, and still no end. I want to ask OP, do you think you will sue your friends? Not only does the SEC consider XRP a security, but they recently made the point that all altcoins are securities, so in OP's mind, the SEC has a lot of friends in this market.",

I am constantly getting various articles and videos about XRP. There is quite a mismatch with their attitude and reality. Where they giving large unreliable price predictions. With which there is no foundation of faith. I am quite fed up with this type of news using this AI. According to their opinion, Ripple may be freed from the SEC case by the end of 2023 and will be bullish on the XRP price. Some say it could go as high as $10 to $27. But when I realized they were created by AI, I couldn't think of it anything more.",

But one thing is certain, they will definitely continue to take advantage of this to continue to make a profit. The protracted the judge/trial is also enough to make us bored to continue to pay attention to it. But I think Ripple remains on the crypto side and Sec is on the other side. so the outcome of the Ripple vs Sec trial will be a decisive outcome also for the growth and legality of crypto. so I still support Ripple in this regard. not because I like Ripple but because the outcome of the dispute between the two parties will indeed have a big impact on the crypto world.",

The fact that the Ripple team keeps dumping their tokens on the market helps the case SEC has against them in court but the problem with this is just the basic law of demand and supply. Do you mean that US Dollar also is a security because the majority of USD in circulation was printed in the last 3  to 4 years ago? Significant increase in the supply of goods causes inflation, this is why people welcome BTC halving almost every four years because it causes supply shock. I don't think the high inflation of XRP tokens alone helps the case of SEC against Ripple there are other things on the table, this is why the RIplle team is fighting their case in court and using part of their XRP tokens stash to lobby politicians to help their cause",
