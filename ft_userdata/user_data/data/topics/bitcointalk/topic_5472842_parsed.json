Can I ask about setting up node on this project? Experiences and feedback on your end. How long youve been doing this btw?Setting up node has payment and with the earning does it suit well?",

And the way you described it, I like it and I will like to test the project but how to get it is the issue. Does it have mobile app for easy access and desktop wallet? But why does it have the features of bitcoin? Is it that the founder made it that way to fasting the growth of the coin.  Bitcoin has 21 millions coins noso also have 21 millions coins. Though like the way it growing rapidly.If someone invest in it now and by next year it hit $4 to $5. I will test it and diversification of investment is good but we should be careful of this stuff.",

In this cryptocurrency investment business, security is the number one thing to do. So if there is no password of mine and no seed phrase to identify my assets then when I download the app in another device what will I use to retrieve my assets? Well I will not argue with you since I am not a developer. But I am afraid though I am interested to invest in but since there is no security measures for assets then the wallet is prone to hack and the wallet is too open to the public as there no security. Well there is no big deal on the white paper. When everything is set let me know. For next w I can't invest in it. Please can you also explain this as well?",

That is because if the project becomes developed and there goes what's inside the whitepaper and written on their roadmap then for sure it's going to be profitable for people like you. The effort that you have exerted on running a node for them is surely going to give you a lot of coins or tokens if the time comes that they're already in the market and they've been listed to any exchange. And people are misunderstanding what's the meaning of pos/node(mn) and mining. But that's not a matter, as long as you're effort is there and you believe that it's the most profitable altcoin for running a node, of course you are bias because that's the coin that you're running a node right now. But for sure that there are others that will argue to you that they also know what's the most profitable and that's the one that they are in just as you.",
