  "content": "Is PvP gaming a thing? Is it fun to compete against strangers for money? Does it provide the same level of comfort and convenience as casino games?I mean, I've seen couple of threads here about some decent PvP games, but I'm not sure if people really do prefer this sort of gaming, specially in terms of the fun and the ROI.If you are familiar with the PvP gambling topic, which of the following would you pick if you had $10–$100 and felt like gambling?1. Casino A:Normal casino where players play Slot games, BlackJack, Rollet, baccarat, Crazy, and the rest of casino games with the chance of winning large chunk of money.2. Casino B:PvP casino where players compete against each others in games such as Poker, Rummy, Ludo, 8Pool, Monopoly, Race Cars, Flipcoin, etc..., with the prize being your opponents buy-in amounts.If you don't want to express your thoughts, simply answer with A or B.",

Yeah, the thing about PvP gamling, is that most of the games that i've seen, they suck in terms of graphics and strategies. Also, I believe having a hardcore game such as MMORPG, would be quite frustrating, as these games usually are to much skill-based, with a large gap in skills between the average player and the very good one, which makes the average player afraid to play, fearing if they match-up against a smurf.",

Well the only thing good about PvP, is that it's a bit engaging, as you won't be playing in silent. But usually when I'm gambling it's like \"Ok I have xx$, don't waste my time, it's either i'm mega rich or feel cheated\", most of the times i feel cheated  :/.",

I feel like it's going to be the future one day. Imagine a game like diablo that uses a cryptocurrency instead of gold. You drop crypto in game, use it as a currency in their store, can spend it on exchanges outside of the game, hold it in a wallet and wager it in casinos. Then you can also bet it against other players in a pvp within the game and win more. As far as I know PvP gambling is not a thing yet, not even in the simplest way like 2 players playing chess or something. The only way to do PvP in a casino is to play poker.",

But looking purely from the profitability perspective, any online PvP games that are played online and where there are big money involved, will have a high risk of being abused by bots. And as we already know, there are pretty much no skill/strategy games left where computers can't outperform people. You can win short term (i.e. few hands in poker) but, in the long-run, you're doomed to fail, as computers don't make mistakes.But there's another form of P2P gambling that I find quite interesting: P2P sports/events betting, where odds are determined by the amounts wagered on each side of the bet. In this kind of betting, there's a big chance of getting a really good odds if you go against the grain.",

This is the direction we may be headed, after all what are loot boxes if not another form of gambling already? However this will probably push the rating of those video games immediately to the A rating which is only for those aged 18 and above, besides this will bring all kind of trouble especially when it comes to the matching algorithm, since now players could use their smurf accounts to beat players with lesser skills, collusion will become a problem, players could lose intentionally to drop their ranking and then get some easy wins, and a myriad of other problems which we see whenever money is at stake.",

What I find annoying in all the PvP games is that people either cheat using software, or they find bugs and glitches that allow them to win against other players and make their experience as bad as possible. This used to be a thing in all shooters, especially battlefield and call of duty series. For this reason while choosing a gambling PvP game you'd have to be prepared to lose money, even if you're a skilled player. There's also a thing with practice. Would you allow players to play without wagering, just to get to know the game and get better at it before they make their bets? If you do, you'll end up with people experimenting with various tactics and you give them more time to find glitches and bugs they can later use against other players. If you don't do it, the only way to get better would be to put money into the game, so people ready to put a lot of time and money into the game ultimately win more, which makes it a pay to win game. That said, I'd still choose B, if the game was well made.",
