  "content": "The journey for bitcoin hasnt been an easy one but we can all boldly say that its adoption by the world is slowly coming to a realisation. For so long many people have been financially control by the central banks until a man came up with the idea of the decentralized system (Satoshi nakamoto) which his primary goal was to free the people of the financial entrapment placed by the central banks. Just imagine you are owner of your money but still you will be given and placed conditions on how to use your currency, they monitored and stipulated rules on how your money should be use and when to access to it and even as far as tempering with your money you saved in the banks.      It was not until this crisis my country faced @nigeria,  that i actually understood the disadvantages of what its meant for your money to be actually controlled by a central system. Million of people couldn't have access to their money due to the laws stated out because of the naira problems. Imagine a situation where you are having millions but can be only offered 20k naira a day, i mean its really frustrating. But hopefully for everyone Bitcoin is growing so fast to counter such financially errors in the system. The meme actually tells the truth, the little write up explains it all. If you fix the money you fixed the world.   Am just waiting for the time the last stage on the picture will be achieved, when biction actually conquers the fiat system and decentralization became the next thing. Feel free to Share with us some recent update to achieving this decentralized ecosystem.",

Bitcoin is Bitcoin and its most important mission is giving people freedom of what they own (be their own banks) and better if they invest smartly they will get financial freedom too.I disagree with statements to over emphasize missions of Bitcoin. It is not here to fix everything on Earth. It is unable to fix local or global economics or social, politics problems and other issues in other areas.To make Bitcoin more friendly with the crowd, I don't think we should spread that statement that can makes side effects.Bitcoin does not fix everything and yeah that time will never come., such too aggressive motto can make people who have yet been Bitcoiners or Bitcoin Maximalists will hate Bitcoin more.I do like a softer motto. Bitcoin is your freedom and is a gate to your financial free.",

If government will say thay this is illegal on their country for sure this is big loss for the adoption and maybe other country will follow especially if US or other first world country against its existence.Bitcoin can still change the world maybe on how it can make the transactions became more simpler, also the opportunity is so wide and the salary is huge compare to traditional work which pay a chunk so I guess by this we can somehow see some changes and discrimination on some jobs will be eliminated since skills will matter here.",

It is mostly dependent on BTC. Since there are different says in different countries how they will use cryptocurrencies they will just keep using the governments money or banks in their country operation. Once their will be a proof in other countries that it change their systems in a better that will only be the only time other countries will follow.",

They are making so many mistakes, it’s great for us.I think in our lifetime most people will have some exposure to bitcoin through pension or investment schemes at least.

Thinking that Bitcoin could possibly change this is simply naive.Heyy, I get your doubt about mass Bitcoin acceptance, but hear me outt, dude. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a way outt of the old-fashiond financial system. Though the government and banks may have some power, they cant have the adoption of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain tech and decentralized nature of these currencies giv the users transparency, securitiy, and privacy, which is dope, rightt? Furthermore, the youth are more tech-savvy and dont trust the traditioonal institutioons, so they vibe with cryptocurrincies. Sure, there are challengs like rules, expancion, and user experience, but the industry is tackling these. Besides, some major players, such as Telsa, Microsof, and PayPaal, alredy acceppted Bitcoin, which shows its gainin steam. So, it may not totally upend the world order, but I believe cryptos will groww and become more widely adopted. As they say, \"Adoption is inevitable\".",

It doesn't matter how many altcoins that come into existence 99% of them will fail at some point and at a time people will get tired of of losing their money.The picture in the OP will come to reality at some point of human existence, already we're seeing steady steps towards achieving Bitcoin global adoptions. First it was the banks banning it but now they're embracing it. Then countries making it a legal tender. It takes only one world power nation to accept Bitcoin for the whole world to follow. Imagine if a country like China adopts Bitcoin, others will follow as they won't want to miss out. Or imagine if a country like American accepts Bitcoin as well.

Yes, the number of people who depend on the banks will reduce and that has the potential of reducing bank profit and government profit, but bitcoin adoption will happen in a manner that they will be used alongside bank notes, but people will trust and rely more on bitcoins because they know that it is an improvement that can offer benefits that bank notes cannot offer.
