  "content": "a lot of the decentralized financial or the decentralized stablecoins that will be coming out are completely outside of the existing Financial structure there's no existing regulation that can handle that especially like there's a difference between enforcing this you know and just creating these regulations enforcing this great bring it on you're going to have a dark dark black market that's going to thrive in this condition because nobody's going to put up with this garbage especially when they come out with their CBD which is completegarbage junk from the bank of international settlements and the Federal Reserve is just crap right and you know what why would you trust people like this anyways especially when you just hit 31 trillion dollars of your national debt shows how fiscally responsible the United States is and you know what they are not interested in being fiscally responsible especially when you know they're buying upmortgage-backed Securities when even in 2007 2008 when they were buying up their rating agencies and making subprime loans which are just garbage loans thatthey packaged up and everybody knew about it but nobody did anything about it.if you want the same people to rule your life your financial life go ahead you know because there's going to be two different roads that you can take the daddy government one that you're going to die early and you're going to be poor or you can make a difference in your life and you can become very wealthy and be successful in life which is doing the opposite of what government wants you to do and thisÂ I don't care one bit I love how scared they are and how they're shaking in their boots it's great it's beautiful and thisis what needs to happen more and more Slaughter Goliath means disruption is working this is a disruptive technology and the government hates disruption.",

So it's up to this money services to adjust, not bitcoin. But what the government did here? taxing everything that is related to crypto.",

Probably better than bitcoin in the sense that it sounds like it might be faster, cheaper, and more convenient. No more needing to transfer funds out of your bank account to some shady exchange who might limit you. Or sieze your money.",

Like, how do you write such a wall of text with no punctuation marks and it doesn't feel like your not from an English speaking country. Anyway, I can't know that for sure can I.I don't buy the idea of viewing bitcoin to be disruptive, it sort of doesn't feel right and as it portrays the network to be wrong and the traditional systems to be right.The CBDs is never going to be any better because, its always going to be centralized anyway.",

      "body": "Governments are concerned because they know their fiat system isn't sustainable and doesn't lead modern society to prosperity. They don't know what to do anymore and I think their last move was to raise interest rates in order to attract investors to their countries.They see bitcoin as a threat, as money invested in btc is out of their surveillance and control, but on the other hand, they must be somehow confortable for now with so many huge scams happening in cryptocurrency, so they can say people the only entity to trust are governments and not entrepreneurs from a decentralized environment where there are no rules and guarantees for its participants.",

No more needing to transfer funds out of your bank account to some shady exchange who might limit you. Or sieze your money.I'm not from the US, but based on this article:QuoteIt is worth noting that the FedNow system is an instant payment system that will allow individuals and businesses to carry out instant payments within the US. While FedNow uses the ISO 20022 standard like RippleNet, it is not based on the blockchain. Instead, FedNow will work with 3rd party companies and banks.https://thecryptobasic.com/2022/08/31/new-us-federal-reserve-instant-payment-system-fednow-will-not-use-xrp/So still, not much difference if you like Moneygram or any other 3rd party services, and with the US Federal Reserves heading this one, hmm, not sure if we can used it or not or if they won't seize the money if they suspect that it's dirty and you are trying to launder.",
