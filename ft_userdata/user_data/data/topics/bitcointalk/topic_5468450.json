Gambling disorders can have long-term effects on a person's ability to complete their education and choose their future, and young individuals may be particularly susceptible to acquiring these illnesses These are all physiological effect of gambling addictions and you were right to mentioned that the availability of the gambling alternatives have cause an increase in youth involvement in active gambling although the covid-19 pandemic have contributed to significant increase in online gambling and there is no gain saying the obvious impact on gamblers most especially in the area of accessibility and transaction frequency among gamblers and the level of revenue gains recorded within this period from 2019-2024 some casino already announced their revenue turnovers. So that is a great pointer to the increase in gambling demands and accessibilities,  this is what we have to truly point out,  but most importantly also there is a need for gamblers to settle within a limit so as not to put both feet into any sinking water because it results may be negative and the gambler may not be able to beer it most especially young inexperience youths who may not be able to control the emotions.",

More likely youth gambling is encouraged more by schoolyard bets over games or even bets with their friends about other things. Could this be a path to gambling addiction? Maybe. I also think it is quite normal behavior.",

For example, neglected children are more likely to engage in activities like gambling, alcohol consumption and drug abuse. So, instead blaming all this onto the easy and legitimate access to gambling, we are also supposed to take a look on problems regarding the strength of couples and child protection, in general.",

      "body": "It is true that the pervasive networks of sports betting and online gambling have hooked many young people nowadays. I don't think anyone can dispute the attraction of gambling, especially for young souls. Gambling disorders leave a lifelong mark on people, making it hard for them to imagine and plan for the future and keeping them from finishing school. The young, who are still figuring out their futures, are taken from their routes and placed in an impossible-to-exit maze.There is a clear distinction between responsible and enjoyable gambling that can be made. Instead than letting the wind throw you around, you must tightly hold onto the ropes. It's a fine line, but one must walk it, draw it, and maintain stability. It's a difficult but logical decision. A one misstep and it's a wild fall.",

One positive thing that many gambling companies have is that they apply a limit of +18 to be allowed to play, considering that gambling is not an activity that can guarantee players will be rich and is not an arena that promises players will not become addicted.Before entering the age of +18, there is still time for young people to learn about the negative effects of being involved in various types of gambling. There is still time for parents to provide education about their future.Those gambling companies don't need to be blamed because they are in business and they operate with a license.",

Gambling disorders can have long-term effects on a person's ability to complete their education and choose their future, and young individuals may be particularly susceptible to acquiring these illnesses The gambling age in my county is 18+ and at this age, many young people would be in college. Just as the problem of the increase of pornography and drug addiction which is triggered by the internet, gambling is also having some impact on our youths. This is a problem that society will keep facing as technology keeps improving. So we have to seek means to reduce the rate of gambling disorder and give addicts the needed assistance. The government and gambling firms should step up awareness programs about gambling disorders and ways to avoid them. At a young age, youths should given the right education about gaming so that they cannot be misinformed by harmful information from social media. Youths that are already suffering from gambling disorders should be given the required attention. Counseling and medical assistance should be given to them. These youths need to focus on their education, that is why any distraction should be removed.",

I also think it is quite normal behavior. I feel like OP is trying to find someone to blame. Online gambling does not make young people become gamblers. It's like saying that the easy access to Internet porn makes young people into porn addicts.I know so many people who used the Internet when they were kids and they're all normal, not addicted to anything, not abusing any online service. Usually people are either strong or weak when it comes to facing addiction. Those who are weak will fall victim even if you try to keep them away from it by not allowing them to use computer. They will go to a friend and gamble at his house or will go to a local bookie and bet on football.",

Next school year, there will be other things they get busy with and they will forget about gambling. They get over it after weeks.It's best they experience it now while they are young rather than getting addicted while they already are in their 30s and with mouths to feed.",

Tons of similar discussion or topic on which i do agree that this one isnt necessary because it would really be that much wise if OP does have this kind of questions or concerns into his mind then making up some research with those old or previous topics in correlated to this and will really be reading up on tons of peoples response and views towards it.Going back into the topic on which when it comes to gambling addiction then there would really be no exemptions whether you are young or old age there's always a tendency or chance that for you to become that addicted and if you arent really that careful or having that good control towards self then you are really that highly susceptible on such possible addiction and this is something that dangerous with gambling because this could really be bringing out that total devastation towards your finances or with your entire life.This is why you should really be that responsible on whatever actions that you would be making specially with gambling. Its not really that bad to gamble if you do seek for leisurebut always having that good control in towards your spending so that you wont really be having some problems afterwards.",

What I see about young people going into gambling is based on the company that they keep and the environment where they grow up from. Id a young boy has a friend that his elderly ones gambles and he sees them doing it, he can likely copy from them and take this to his friends which they might want to try it out. I could remember when I say gambling for the first time was when I just got admission into college, there are some groups of boys that are friends only when they want to gamble. When school is over, they wait behind to gamble and I noticed that majority of them has elder ones in the university that do gamble and that was how got into gambling. This is the main reason why we need to know the friends that our children keep and who they mingle with when they are not around you, because the youth exorbitance must come to play.",

Let's say football, we all know that there are huge money involved as far as this sports. And that is why we hear games being rigged in below or low tournament. So if they started young at this sports they will already know how gambling works here and who knows, they could get themselves involved early and approach by some entities to deliberate lose a game or just do point shaving. Unless the youth is really not into it or doesn't want to ruin and have dreams to really play on the big league.

Obviously anything that interferes with the brains development will end up having life-long consequences.So, to the kids I say: first complete your education and when you are finished, you will have more than enough time to pick and choose whichever fun activities you like.Not many kids have good parent figures, so obviously there are a lot of kids running around, gambling and doing much worse stuff.
