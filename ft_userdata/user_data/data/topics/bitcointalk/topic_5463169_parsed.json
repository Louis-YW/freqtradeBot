  "content": "The ukraina war situation similar with Afcanistan the East or maybe similar with vietnamise war.Look like USA Will just lose alot money like in history before but not much success against soviets.Usa and russia cant fight so likely this war will be stop and russia ukraine need to make peace seal.As trump soon in power and USA stock Market shine again and trump Will be proud of USA and trump want good relations with russia so trump Will stop probably the war and Will be peace talker in this case fire between Ukraine and russia probably Will reach to mutual agreement Under the Donald trump lead.The USA goverment look like a mess Under the Biden rule... that's what many trump supporters think so the trump will come and fix and make it right again. If trump away then everything in chaos as trump said If he was in power ukraine never would invaded that's shows trump diplomatic skills becouse trump can talk Putin the way Putin Understood.So let's wait when trump is BACK and then USA stock market shine again and If trump want to make USA great and stock market to shine bright again.Probably trump is only leader who Putin really listening i guess when trump call to Putin stop then Putin Will stop probably trump will go to ukraine to be the peace keeping person between russia and ukraine becouse trump don't like war",

      "body": "It is not about Putin only listening Trump or something like it, but rather that Trump is preferred by the Kremlin, because he is implicitly pro Russia. Trump would likely push Ukraine to give up their disputed land with Russia, which is what Putin wants, to take over territory. Also, the stock market is not completely dependent on whoever is president, there are other external factors which go beyond our control. For example, during Trump's presidency we saw a crash in Wall Street due to the COVID-19 pandemic reaching the United States. Investors do not only see the color of the party but other reasons to be bullish or bearish on the American Economy.",

Loyal Republican and Democratic voters will vote for their party respectively but the election is decided in a few swing states by the undecided, and I don't think at all that the undecided will vote overwhelmingly for Trump. Besides, the 2022 midterm elections did not go as well for the Republicans as they had hoped, after all the wear and tear that Biden had supposedly suffered, so I would take it with a grain of salt that Trump 'will' win.",

Trump is NOT a truly patriotic American. But he is more-so than most others. Here is why.America is strong as far as the people go. It was the patriotism of the people that developed America. It showed itself in WW1 and WW2.Right now, most of the big business operations are operating out of, or farmed out to, Asian and other overseas countries. But Americans have the ability to out-manufacture just about any country of the world. Consider, again, the way Americans moved in WW1 and WW2... patriotic wars.The most important part of what Trump was doing, was causing big business to move back to the States. He was doing it through manipulating export/import taxes with other countries. If he had had the time to succeed, he would have made America great by bringing the REAL jobs, the manufacturing jobs, back to America. The other nations would be eating out of our hands.",
