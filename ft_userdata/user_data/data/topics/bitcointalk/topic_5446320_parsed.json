If you buy cryptocurrency from an ATM, send it to a wallet, and then use that cryptocurrency to purchase something a few days later, it can still be traced.You can use CoinJoin to improve the privacy. When you use CoinJoin, your transaction is combined with other transactions from other users, making it difficult to identify which input belongs to which user. An alternative choice is to use a different mixing service, such as one listed in the 2023 List of Bitcoin Mixers and Bitcoin Tumblers Websites. However, none of these options offer the same features as ChipMixer.",

And I think you're missing something here, non-custodial doesn't only apply to hardware wallet only, for example Electrum is not a hardware wallet yet it's a non-custodial wallet, as long you are able to control your cryptocurrency through your private key then that wallet is non-custodial.And just as they have recommended above for you, if you can't find any mixer that provide you with chips then all you have to do is to create a new wallet address and let the mixer send your mixed coin to the new wallet, that way you'll get the best result from the mixer.",

Thanks!    If I were you, be careful with the decision you make, maybe later you won't know that the person you are talking to is a scammer. Apart from that there is nothing like the chipmixer.    That's why you say that it's a group of mixers, that's a bit worrying because you don't know that it's a group of scammers just trying to bite you with nice words, so be careful, friend.",

Thanks!No, there is no other mixer right now with the same concept as ChipMixer, and probably this is one of the biggest reasons why they remain on top until they were seized by the authorities. I know it's hard to really know if this mixers are getting clean bitcoin as they claim and it come directly to their mining pool or any other pool for that miner. So if you really wanted to remain anonymous and private, then you have to 'trust' those current mixers that we have today, and t hat their coins are not tainted in anyway. Or if you have questions about the whole 'trust' then yeah just continue or your mixing strategy.",

If you're referring to Chipmixer mixing method, I believe you can just check the history of each chip to see whether your past transactions/addresses are linked or not. This should apply to any mixer that follows a similar mixing method, CMIIW. As for others, some of them develop a code that you need to save to make sure your coins don't get mixed with your past transactions. Time will tell how effective it is, but these prevention exist for now. You can probably use both mixer and coinjoin to add another layer of obfuscation, although I can't tell how effective it would be.",

Why were they keeping all this data for such a long period of time?
