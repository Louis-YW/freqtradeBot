      "body": "What do you mean by without creating a bitcoin wallet? If you mean an exchange, then no there's no way especially since you're dealing with fiat.First, you need to create an account in an exchange (there are a few but it depends on where you're from) and then, you can use your card to buy bitcoin. If you're sending it to somebody else, then you don't need a wallet yourself, you can just use the other's person address directly.But if you're buying the bitcoin for yourself, then it's not recommended to keep your funds at an exchange, you should get a wallet (Electrum for desktop, or Bluewallet for mobile) and withdraw your funds to that non-custodial wallet.",

What is the easiest and quickest way to do this? First, you are welcome.But your question is a bit confusing to us here because you did not make a constructive sentence that can make up a question that will aid you in getting the response that can solve your problems.But since what you mentioned is close to using a debit card to purchase Bitcoin directly into a Bitcoin address, it may only be possible if your debit card company support Bitcoin direct purchase and creates a domicile wallet for to store the Bitcoin, which is extremely rare to see any debit card with such service, so it still left you with no choice than to either.1: create a Bitcoin wallet 2: get an exchange account 3: use p2p to buy Bitcoin, make payment through your bank get the Bitcoin into your exchange wallet.4: get the bitcoin transferred into your personal wallet which you own the wallet keys to them.",

What is the easiest and quickest way to do this? Get registered in a centralized exchange i.e  Binance.com, Kucoin.com, etc..  Get your KYC processed so that you can start P2P trades or you can directly buy BTC from the exchange.Here is the process on how it is done on Binance: https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/bitcoinThat is the one you are asking for I believe...  But just like the earlier replies I also wanted to remind you that keeping your BTC on exchanges is not a good thing since you do not have access to the private key of the address.If you wanted to have full ownership of the Bitcoin you bought, you must install a non-custodial wallet, and transfer your BTC to that wallet.You may also need to read this thread:[General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?The right way to store Bitcoin for long term",

I think this is a centralized exchange that you mean, search for a centralized exchange that supports debit cards.  It will automatically create a Bitcoin wallet in your account when you're buying Bitcoin.  Research and choose a reliable cryptocurrency exchange that supports debit card purchases and I found this article that might help you.While you can keep your Bitcoin on the exchange, it's generally recommended to transfer your Bitcoin to a secure cryptocurrency wallet where you control your own key.",

What is the easiest and quickest way to do this? Hey, you might be new here, but imagine the question yourself for a moment; I'm sure you understand what BTC is and how it differs from fiat currency. Is it really possible to send money from a debit card to a bitcoin address? Let's forget about creating a bitcoin wallet; BTC and fiat money are incompatible. If you want to convert from one currency to another, you'll need an exchange, and the exchange isn't the person who needs the currency you desire, but the merchants you sell to there. The exchanges exist solely to bring buyers and sellers together. If you want to buy and hold bitcoin with fiat currency, the easiest place to store it is in a non-custodian wallet. Most commonly used are Electrum for PC/laptop and Bluewallet for mobile devices. If you have them stored there, the BTC become yours and you’ll have full ownership of it because it is now your keys and your coins.",

      "body": "Thinking about sending Bitcoin straight from your debit card without a Bitcoin wallet? Well, it's not really the best route. You see, while some exchanges might let you buy Bitcoin using your card without setting up a wallet first, it's usually a good idea to have one. Why? 'Cause wallets give you better control over your crypto stash.Getting yourself a Bitcoin wallet is no biggie. There are different types - software wallets, hardware wallets, and even wallet apps for your phone. Once you've got your wallet, you can link up your debit card to an exchange or service that sells Bitcoin. And after the purchase, move your btc to a private wallet.",

Make an exchange account that has service that accept debit card deposit to buy bitcoin, then send bitcoin to bitcoin wallet.

And besides there is no way to transfer bitcoin directly to your wallet without undergoing processes like either using p2p or buying with your card from centralized exchange then you can make a withdrawal to your wallet directly and alternatively, if using p2p you send fiat (cash) while they send you BTC directly to your bitcoin wallet that's, you share your address with them then they send you btc and you receive it through your address to your wallet.Please mind the kind of exchange you are about to purchase bitcoin from and not all p2p providers are trusted and reliable.

What is the easiest and quickest way to do this? A debit card uses your national currency, so you can't just send money from a debit card to a bitcoin address because bitcoin addresses hold bitcoin, not whatever your national currency is. Debit card and bitcoin address use different currencies.You can send money from your card or bank to a crypto exchange, then exchange the money for bitcoin, and then send that bitcoin from your account on the exchange to a bitcoin address you've created for yourself. A bitcoin wallet is a piece of software that lets you send transactions. You'd be using the exchange's wallet to send bitcoin to you own address, but you wouldn't need to use a bitcoin wallet yourself until sometime in the future when you want to transfer that bitcoin out of your own address.",

Actually, you can do this by looking for tutorials or accurate information on the internet, because the first thing you have to do is create your own Bitcoin or crypto wallet and verify it.And there are tons of exchange platforms out there or you can do it with a trusted centralized exchange in your country of residence, and still do your research and study well before you do. And in my opinionto exchange money from a bank account, credit or debit card to bitcoin the process is easy and fast as long as there are no other obstacles from the two, nothing is difficult and doesn't take long either.",

Now, if that is the case, then it is not yet possible...as of now. I am hoping though that since Visa and Mastercard are also interested - and actually starting to enter the crypto industry - then this feature can be enjoyed by us in the near future. PayPal should also be looking into this option since it is already now adding crypto into its business. That would make things seamless and really convenient. In addition, it would be so good if instead of that long crypto address which can be confusing sometimes and can be a cause of error, we can send crypto via an email address - and on this matter there are now testing this possibility. We need and we must improve on many things in the transfer of money so more and more people will be delighted to be using Bitcoin and altcoins as well.",
