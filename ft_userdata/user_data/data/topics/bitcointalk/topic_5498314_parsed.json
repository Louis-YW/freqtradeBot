If you didnâ€™t own the private key of the wallet which your Bitcoin save(on this case, your friend) then itâ€™s still risky no matter how trusted your friend is because he/she still a human that is subject to greed. Exchange and wallets is very easy to create an account. Why you will still choose to have a risk by choosing 3rd party to handle your assets while you can do it by yourself. Anyone can do buy and hold for long term until you get profit.",

The knowledge is available for all, you can learn how to trade by watching YouTube videos and reading materials online. There is no reason why you should trust a second party with your funds, many have lost their money to so called professional traders who promise to give them ROI monthly or give paid signals. Donâ€™t fall for the trap, go for the knowledge instead. Here are some articles and links you should read to get started:Blockchain Books, Bitcoin Movies And Documentaries https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbookhttps://bitcoinbook.info/translations-of-mastering-bitcoinÂ https://www.coindesk.com/learn",

As long as you know how to buy your coin ( by coin I ðŸ’¯ mean Bitcoin), and you've also sorted out the right and safe wallet to use, you don't really need a third party to work you through the whole process. If you're talking about going into trading on the other hand, that's when you will have to talk about directing learning from someone that's already in the system so you will get the needed hands on knowledge.But in general, having the ability to doing most of your stuff by yourself is the best thing and so you should do the needed research and ensure that you're knowledgeable enough to carry out but trading and investing responsibility all on your own.",

Is proper for me to trust a friend of that high magnitude ?It is not about the trust you have for your friend but understanding things better for yours. The reason why you don't need to rely on the trust you have on your friend is that your friend can't control the market or make things happen the way you want it. You don't have to do things because you trust your friend, Â your friend is human which it is possible for him to take wrong decisions that won't go well with you. Â I'll advise you whenever it comes to investment never let anybody to convince you to invest without you knowing about what you are putting your money in.Make research and understand bitcoin because investment in bitcoin is personal, Â you need to make decisions yourself. Investment like cryptocurrency you need to be in charge as to take full responsibility of everything.",

I can trust people in other things but not money, because I have been betrayed by some close friends in the past even with small amounts.Also, it will be foolish to give out login information to anyone except yourself. They can easily say that the account has been hacked, or that they didn't use the account when funds are lost or the password has changed.

No No, you dont trust someone to trade your bitcoin with, at least I would not recommend doing it, even if that person is a very close friend or family. Unless they are your parents or your next of kin, even then it is tough to trust someone in this sphere.You should learn trading on your own and there are immense number of articles and videos to demonstrate the same. This forum is also very helpful if you need to clarify specifics.Anyone who has access to your wallet private key can spend your coins, please be wary of that. Secure your wallets and never store the coins on exchange wallets.",

Is proper for me to trust a friend of that high magnitude ?The question is if he really can be trusted? Or if you really trust this person because if you feel doubt, I suggest not to continue and better choose exchanges instead. It was not just the TRUST of our main concern but also the confidence we have that this person ( our friend) can really take the responsibility. Many people get fooled by promises and many people lose their money from trusting a person who never knows how to value the trust we give. . There is no problem with doing this as long as we know ourselves that this person can give us what we expect from him. But despite this, we should not give full control of our funds still, the major decision is coming from us.",

Escrow must be a very trusted entity because money or bitcoin will be kept / escrowed by the Escrow service provider.If you buy bitcoin, you send fiat to the friend. Your friend confirms with the trade partner that he receives fiat from you. Then your trader partner will send bitcoin to you, and your friend will send fiat to your trade partner. Escrow is a middle man with a role like this.There are some members with Escrow services in Bitcointalk.[Overview] Bitcointalk Services from Bitcointalk Members.
