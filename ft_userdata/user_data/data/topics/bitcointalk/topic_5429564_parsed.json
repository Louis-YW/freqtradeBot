Very confused.Because this is how it works.It will generate a new Bitcoin address per transaction successfully made.  So possible, you've copied a newly generated address that doesn't have transactions.  This features the same on the Electrum software wallet which is really safe if you'll change your Bitcoin address per transaction.  It will mislead possible scammers who will track your transaction. You need to learn more about how Bitcoin works especially Bitcoin wallets.",

Very confused.Most likely, your wallet generates a new receiving address every time you want to receive some coins. At least that's how most of today's crypto wallets work. Your total balance is likely spread across multiple addresses, so to see the total amount of coins in your wallet via blockchain explorer, you'll need to check each individual address one by one. Alternatively, if you want to explore all balances and transitions at once, you can try the xPub key method, as described here: How to analyze a Bitcoin (BTC) extended public key (xPub) using a block explorer.Quote from: Doubleflip7 on December 16, 2022, 11:33:30 PMRookie question... When Glassnode says there's x number of wallets with at least 1 bitcoin, is that analytic only accounting for wallets that made a whole BTC transfer into them? Or is it grouping all wallets together that are underneath one seed phrase?I don't think anyone can know which addresses are derived from the same seed phrase except the wallet owner. However, there are various methods by which individual addresses can be linked to the same wallet. For example, if you spend coins from multiple addresses in a single transaction, it leads to the conclusion that all addresses that share input in the transaction are from the same wallet.",

Very confused.I do not know how it works on Ledger Live, but it supposed to be in a way that your transactions on blockchain can be easily accessed, like through the history tab (how it is on Electrum). You can be able to know the coins you received on certain addresses and the ones that you have sent from there.Quote from: Doubleflip7 on December 16, 2022, 11:33:30 PMRookie question...

You can not know all the addresses that belong to the same seed phrase or wallet.",

A better way would be to run your own node, download the full blockchain, and then scan the blockchain yourself for transactions involving your addresses. Both more secure and more private.Quote from: PrivacyG on December 17, 2022, 11:54:44 AMI advise against using xPub on Block Explorers.Which block explorers support xpubs or other extended public keys? The only site I am aware of which will scan xpubs is https://blockpath.com/wallets/new?action=appxpub, but that's more for locating coins when you've forgotten the derivation path, as opposed to being a blockchain explorer.But I agree, ideally you shouldn't be entering any of your addresses, let alone extended public keys, in to online services, since you lose all privacy as soon as you do.",

Best to just import the master public key on a wallet like Electrum and be used as a watch-only wallet.

Unless your watch only wallet is in Bitcoin Core, or in a light wallet pointed exclusively at your own node or server (such as Sparrow pointed at your own node or Electrum pointed at your own Electrum server), then either way you are handing over your xpub to a third party who can then link all your addresses, balances, and transactions, and potentially link that against your IP, device fingerprint, and other unique data. Given that most people don't run their own node and instead rely on someone else's node via light wallets, their watch only wallets give them zero privacy.",
