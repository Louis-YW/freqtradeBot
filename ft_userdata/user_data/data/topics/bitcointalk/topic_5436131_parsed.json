Nice, keep holding. But don't hold it all in one place I mean in one crypto. Also always try to 50% USD so that you can buy more once it will cheaper.Btw it does not matter if you are buying or holding if you don't select the correct coin. So always try to invest in what has usage, which is more potential, and high-ranked coin/token only. If someone wants to know what should be brought I will say Bitcoin, bitcoin, and bitcoin. And another thing that needs to mention is that keep secure your private key, don't keep it online. Always it's better to keep it written on paper.",

Hi tooThere is no more advice unless you are willing to buy more Bitcoins and hold onto them until the next bullrun occurs, because that way you can experience better and more tolerable profits. Because buying before the bullrun comes is a very good option and it is also done by many people who still believe in the next bullrun in Bitcoin. So you yourself can also apply this if you have more capital and it doesn't make you feel destitute when you buy Bitcoin which you consider a future investment.",

The 9-12 months prediction is not decisive it could take longer or shorter than that, but the biggest advice is to keep holding and most importantly it shouldn't be with a borrowed money or money that will be used to solve a problem within a short time duration because the next bull run might be more massive and holding is the only way not to be left out.",

Or better yet, just continue accumulating through dollar-cost averaging (DCA).A lot of people expected that to happen, but when the market was getting green and green, they didn't own Bitcoin because they sold at the bottom when they panicked or it was too early to sell.The reserves they have are also used up to conduct DCA at a price that they think is already a dip price, but in reality, the price is still far from a dip. Do not have spare money when the price is really down.this all depends on how strong the psychology is to continue to hold and buy gradually with the capital that has been prepared.I hope I will also engage in the next bull run and sell at the green, green and green.",

You don't really need to know about anyone's experiences, because all the price history is written down on exchanges or services like coinmarketcap. The chart is all you need to know. As you can see, in the past bull markets have started shortly after the halvenings. The next halvening is in 2024. So this whole year is not likely to be bullish, which is not a bad thing, it means that it could be an opportunity to accumulate more.",

The last bull run is a massive ride because the price down almost 2K due to the pandemic scared then a price rally come out of thin air that never stop until it reach the ATH 67K. All the altcoins follow this rally that print exponential percentage growth. The last bull is the most profitable for me because I manage to reinvest all my crypto assets that I’m holding since 2017 bullrun that stuck on my wallet to finally recover and get massive profit.Also we have a lot of relief rally like we are experiencing right now before the real bull run occurred. It’s very hard to spot the right one but the experience is great if you manage to ride the hype because everything in the market is green.",

However it won't mean you will survive in 2023 bear market. 2022 and 2023 bear market is different than past ones because with DeFi 2.0, Staking, Farming, Stable coins, the market is more dangerous than years ago. With these sensitive projects, when a hack, exploitation happens, price will be dumped from peak to the hell. Like Terra LUNA, FTX token FTT and some algorithmic stable coins that lost their pegs so terrible. Some Bitcoin Wrapped tokens lost their pegs too.If you own those tokens, you should die in 2022 and 2023 too.I don't know what you're holding but bear market is so risky to hold altcoins. I advise you to hold only Bitcoin in bear market and only buy altcoins when bear market already ended and a new bull run starts with Bitcoin.",

It's more than that, so plenty of time for you.I guess you are doing great, as I have said, the best strategy is to go and buy as many as you can in the next 15 months. Even in bull run you will have to do that as well, because you might see a price surge in 2024, but the best time to sell is during the all time high and it will be in 2025.",
