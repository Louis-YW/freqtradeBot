This is probably the biggest payday in his career so good job to his manager or promoter for making it happen.I can see it's the similar 10-point system but there's no mention of the number of rounds. I think Tyson will fight smart and play the long game since Francis doesn't have enough tank.",

Too early to say but he may really get it and Dana his best friend may just as well congratulate him. It's very possible that Ngannou can KO Tyson. If he can't then he will really have to prepare to last for at least 5 rounds. If he can survive at least 5 rounds it's not very shameful.",

Tyson Fury has the advantage simply because boxers are used of running 12 rounds while fighting their opponents, there is a huge difference with stamina especially if the 'outsider' has nothing much of an experience to be in 12 rounds straight not to mention that fury himself is a hard hitter which would make it harder for Ngannou to stay in shape during the match. Ngannou is a great player in MMA but whoever exits his cave would be at the disadvantage.",

Francis took the risk of not signing another contract from UFC and got the PFL contract and this dream boxing fight but this is somewhat of a mismatch that Francis could terribly lose. Fury had been boxing since he was a kid, you can't just jump in and kickass someone like that. He needs a really good team to train him well while there is a long time to train. I can say that Fury also chooses to fight Francis over Jones.  Cherry-picking or not, he gave Francis one chance of a lifetime and Francis will be forever grateful to Fury.",

He has the advantage when it comes to boxing.We will see if Francis is up to boxing, he may discover that he will like this sports and may continue later on.At least, get some money out of this before he is out of any sports. But Tyson should be cautious about the power punch from Ngannou.He can be knock out if he is not careful inside the ring. Remember, upsets can happen all the time.",

Otherwise no heavyweight has just really grabbed my eye.  Will we ever see one of those again?",

But there are a lot of criticism about this fight though, specially that we all know that this is just a mismatch fight and Fury will have a lot of fun playing with Francis in this fight. And it can be considered as just another exhibition match, as it is a known boxer against a former MMA fighter. And we haven't seen a MMA fighter beat a decent and very highly skilled boxer. Only way for Francis is to win but one hail mary shot.",

If its an MMA type of match Ngannou can easily pin Fury and choked him but since this is a boxing match where all the rules of boxing are applied I don't think Francis will have a chance to beat Fury, Ngannou agreed to the fight because he wants to make a lot of money and this is a trend right now MMA fighters shifting to boxing for more money, this is going to be entertaining and a real fight as both fighters are badest in their respective field, I hope Ngannou will get a good trainer who specializes in boxing.",

Much respect to the sports of MMA, but since this is going to be a boxing match, Ngannou will be schooled. He should have chosen some weaker heavyweights instead. I think he couldn't even defeat Joshua. But, well, this is where the larger money is. Anyway, the odds this early show Fury as the huge favorite at 1.25. Ngannou, on the other hand, is the underdog at 4.00. I couldn't agree with those odds more.",

Ngannou is primarily a UFC fighter, and they will be competing under the rules of boxing, where Fury is currently considered the best in his division though maybe not officially since Usyk owned 3 belts in the same division.",

Fury is much bigger in size and also a lot more skillful inside a boxing ring. It is highly likely that Tyson Fury wins a one-sided fight since he has all the advantages. Nobody should be under any illusion that this will be competitive but these sort of matches are what draw the most viewers. Fury is at the stage of his career, like Mayweather was against McGregor, where he has accomplished enough that he can just decide to choose the most lucrative opportunities instead of taking a greater risk against real contenders. Despite the objection by fighters like Usyk, I am certain he would immediately accept if he were given the same opportunity to fight an MMA fighter for tens of millions of dollars.",
