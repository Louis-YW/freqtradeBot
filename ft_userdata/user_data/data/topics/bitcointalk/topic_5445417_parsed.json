      "body": "I actually didn't like Spondoolies that much. The SP10 was a 1U rack machine cooled by 1U fans which spun incredibly fast to move any air at all and therefore made pretty terrible noise. Their 2U equipment were still about three feet long, which meant by the time intake air got to the heatsinks at the back it was already oven-temperature and didn't cool effectively. Heatsinks were inadequate.I started losing respect for Bitmain when they produced a new S7 model with a regulated string but firmware-locked the voltage. It had a lower parts cost than the first version (therefore higher profit margin) and significantly worse efficiency but they did their darndest to convince people it was better. The S7 is also when they went all-in on epoxied chipsinks, cheap and quick but unreliable and hard to maintain or repair. They also kept making their air paths longer and longer even as they doubled the amount of heat in the box, causing the same problems as Spondoolies. It took them too many years to figure out that was dumb.Who I really like is those GekkoScience guys. Their schedule is pretty sloppy but the gear itself is decent üòÅ",

      "body": "I miss the S3 / R4 quiet Bitmain miners.And, although it pains me to say this, I made a lot of BTC getting 2nd (and 3rd) hand Butterfly Labs stuff.For a while there so many people overpaid for it, got it delivered late and were so disgusted with it all that you could pick them up lightly used for 1/10 the price that they paid.At that point even with them being 1 or 2 gens out and not efficient, you could mine on razor thin margins at the time and still come out ahead since the $1500 miner cost you $175 delivered to your door.And when you were really done with them you could still sell them for a few bucks.The old innosilicon were also workhorses, not the best efficiency but they just kept on mining and mining with no issues. At least for me.-Dave",

      "body": "For a while I was pulling in 0.5BTC/week with Antminer S1. I had started pretty much with nothing and reinvested or made side money doing repairs and built up a 2TH mine, then switched from \"turn ridiculous profits\" to collecting interesting gear and traded most of them out for an S2, an A1 Dragon and other cool stuff. The Dragon outlasted everything else, and I bought a second one later not just for the collection but as a heater for the office. It actually had a failed board, which was really weird. I think I pulled the PSU from it for a computer that was still in use about a year ago; pretty solid.The S4 was a pretty decent machine, tidy and not a lot of noise. S4+ however, went backward in efficiency and reliability. I was consulting for a guy and steered him away from those machines, but his MO was to always do the opposite of what I recommended so he went all in and had a 20% failure rate within the first few weeks. Our working relationship did not last long. But when I think about cased miners, I pretty much always think about the S4 first because its dimensions and design was just really good.",

The PSU clearly makes more noise than the ASIC itself, and if you put a small fan on the front panel at the 6Pins connectors to extract the air, they are still very stable for their age. I also have quite a few old S9s and a few S9ks often with some hashboards removed, I pay almost nothing for electricity so I keep using whatever I have or find cheap in terms of $ per Th/s. My favorites are the gekkoscience Newpac / R606 / R909, I find them perfect to mine solo, never any real problems with them, always fun to follow the shares submitted from time to time. I only had one problem with an overheating R606 once, but easy to fix. I like to check old equipment on this website : https://bitcoinminingmuseum.com/gallery.htmlI would love to play a little bit with some S1 or S2",
