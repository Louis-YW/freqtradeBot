I know this is likely not to happen in real life. But let's say it did. What would you do?It is gambling, it can happen real life, but the chance that it would happen is very slim. But we should always advice that betting big comes with big risks.I would feel like killing the friend, but I do not have option than to forget about it. I will also think he has good mind for me as he did not want me to risk big in a way it can affect me.This also depends on how rich someone is. If that 10k is just a chicken change to the bettor and having millions of dollars in account and wealthy, he will not think much about it, but in cases that the person is just looking for luck and in a way the money will change his life completely for good, he will feel like killing his friend.",

An I wrong?Let's not confuse movies with reality.While you are right and it is not about losing money but rather \"not winning\", that would not stop people to get mad or depressed at the fact of the missed opportunity.It is similar to the situation of those who sold their Bitcoins when they were worth 1000$ and regretted doing it later, because they could have been gotten set for life instead. By the way, I just searched about roulette etiquette on internet and you are right, no one should touch other's chips, also people is supposed to avoid putting drinks over the felt, etc.",

But we should always advice that betting big comes with big risks.Highly unlikely that this can happen in real life, no one are allowed to move their bets when it has already been placed whether it's the bettor or his friend. The bet can happen if that how rich you are and you just casually bet $10,000 on a single number however in this case, he is not. Also, no one can bet anymore once the wheel is already spinning not when it's about to stop. If this scenario happens on real life, his friend will be kicked out from the casino or probably the whole bet he made will be forfeited. Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 07, 2022, 04:06:24 PM2.

He later on announced the no more bet line to avoid further changing of bets and to proceed on the game. The chips place on the table is the legitimate bet even though the original didn't move it and also the one who moves it is his companion and not a stranger.",

What would you do?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT4GcK6DpkkI was trying to look for Kevin Hart movies on Netflix so I found one. Turns out one scene is an unsatisfying win.Well as frustrating as it sounds, thats not losing $350 000 USD. Thats missing out on the opportunity on winning 350k. Which is nowhere as bad as losing 350k, if you were to ask me. Also as much as I enjoy Kevin Harts comedy, I would not quote him on his realism. Obviously this is a very unrealistic scenario because as some posters have already mentioned, nobody can take your chips. They do not allow that. And the bet was already locked in as soon as the wheel started spinning (although it may have been locked in earlier but I am not familiar with the technicalities).Obviously they make movie gambling unrealistic to make it seem more attractive and/or exciting to the viewer.",

I mean the reality is that you wouldn't be allowed to touch it when it's still going on, it's too late to retract the bet, also it would be not allowed to let someone else other than the person who wagered to touch it either. It just doesn't feel like something that would be real, it's just a movie scene. If you wager, you wager, and end of the story.However, if any of my friends try to persuade me away from gambling then I will always thank them, gambling is a risky business and anyone who tries to stop someone else from gambling their money away is doing something good in their heart, with the good result or bad result doesn't matter the intention was good and that's what matters.",

Let's say you placed a bet on a casino and your friend attempted to remove or change it. The croupier wouldn't allow him to do this, because he would be interfering in someone's else bets, what isn't allowed. Moreover, we would notice if someone touched our tokens in a casino table. Anyway, the scene was nicely built and was really funny. It's interesting to imagine absurd situations like that happening in reality.",
