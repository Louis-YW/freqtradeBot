  "content": "Hi Bitcointalki was looking for a good criptocasino, i found Sportsbet. io and and I thought it was a good option, I registered, I made a deposit of 560$ and reached 1200$ in roulette, after that, I sent the necessary KYC, and tried to make my withdrawal, after a while they cancel my withdrawal, and tell me to make a second KYC, after doing so, they proceed to block my account, and my funds.They do not allow me to play or withdraw, not only this, but they accuse me of multi-accounts, and without any basis, I tell them that I do not have any multi-account and that I will be willing to provide the necessary evidence, but please respond because of all the attempts to contact them by mail, they have only answered me one.The last thing I did was to tell them that if they continued to ignore me, I would expose the case here, and try to solve it legally by opening a case in their department. Since as a consumer I feel ripped off, not only they do not respond, they do not enable my withdrawals, and they do not let me take out MY LEGAL WINNINGS, and not even MY INITIAL DEPOSIT.I have screenshots of all the conversations and proof of everything.Hope bitcointalk can help me to solve my situation .Thank you very much in advance.Information:Mail: anon*******@protonmail.comUsername on Sportsbet : anonymousxmPayment Method: BTC ( BTC )Mails:https://hizliresim.com/sqikzx3https://hizliresim.com/jr8t6euhttps://hizliresim.com/3uvjb8c",

Do you have any family member/relative who also access sportsbet, and you use the same devices and internet?Sometimes abusers use VPN services and once you innocently use the same VPN service, they will see similar IP addresses, especially for free versions and your account will be flagged, and they may think it's the same person or people.",

I suggest you keep engaging with Sportbet support and other necessary parties for a possible resolution.Sportsbet spend way too much on promotions, I don't think they would bend that low to scam off a customer his $1,200Try contacting this guy and see if he can get you a quicker response  sportsbet.ioThere have been similar cases of multi-accounting in the past, but they would then get resolved well like this one -SPORTSBET.io accuse me with multi accounting and DONT PAY MY WINNINGS (Though your posting style looks the same in both scam accusations, are you the same person?)",

For the time being, I noticed no one asked you yet if you're the only one accessing SB in your home. Are you?",

Sports Bet is among the top trusted casinos out there and they won't do anything wrong to degrade their reputation for just $1200. You should try to continue your conversation with the support team and I'm sure that if everything is right from your side then you'll surely get your money.",

Does anyone know any way to report these scammers to the consumer? https://hizliresim.com/ojnc7eghttps://hizliresim.com/ilhqxy2https://hizliresim.com/gvdqtfrThe first excuse was multi accounts, obviously I do not have multi accounts, and they have not had proof, so they have invented the movie you see there, I just registered, deposited, played, and to withdraw I did my KYC correctly and everything legal, I find it embarrassing that they act in these ways, committing a crime because they are stealing my initial deposit, and that is my own money, not only refuse to pay legal earnings, in addition to this they steal. I warn you so that no one plays on this site, and if someone helps me with some way to denounce, I would be grateful. Thanks.",

But that is not withstanding, if you know the representative in the forum, you can contact the user to explain everything to him with all the evidences and see if he can help.And since you said, you do not have multiple accounts, and if you are sincere about it then the matter will be resolved just clam down and present your documents and explain yourself.",
