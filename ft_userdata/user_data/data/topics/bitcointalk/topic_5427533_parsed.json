  "content": "The other day I was faced with the need to quickly check balances on BTC/ETH addresses from Telegram and Twitter posts/messagesAfter an hour of searching, I found the next extension: Web3 Balances Viewer from BEE company.But no other analogs were found that would allow for effective checking of balances. This extension satisfied my need, so I'm leaving the thread about it here. Maybe it will be useful to someone :Â  https://l.b-ee.io/8VEPKS I also wondered what extensions can be used to make life easier in such matters? (interactions with cryptoassets and addresses)What do you use for this?",
