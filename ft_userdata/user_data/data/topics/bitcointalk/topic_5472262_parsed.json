It wasn't bitcoin but it was alts which ETH, LTC, DOGE which were very low but then they exploded in price and I basically had no way to recover that data. It was overwritten probably hundreds of times and no point in getting it recovered.This is why you should always back up your wallets even if you don't think you will use them. The tokens might be worthless now but you never know if one day they will make a comeback. I remember when bitcoin was $50K, I had tons of dust in old accounts that I recovered, was only 0.005 BTC or so but it was valuable then compared to 2015 when it was useless.",

This is a ridiculous thing where I have Bitcoin but am tempted by altcoins, I know that at that time ICOs and altcoins experienced a bubble, the price of altcoins soared, and I was interested in investing there, but unfortunately it turned out that the bullrun and altseason period was starting to end and there was a big price drop. on Bitcoin and altcoins.",

In 2021 I saw friends on social media sharing screenshots of profits using the future trading feature from Binance with x20 leverage. A 20% price increase seemed very easy to get, so I tried to open a futures trading account on Binance as well.Because I'm working remotely and the Covid pandemic is still busy, I can focus on trading futures. Unfortunately, I didn't know the big risks I was taking and only thought about profits. That was my stupidest act, voluntarily giving my money to Binance because my assets were liquidated. I can still bear the amount, but it still hurts because I really regret not studying it first and just following the FOMO of my friends on social media.This is a mistake I really want to forget so it doesn't happen again. I have learned from this mistake and consider this my stupidest disgrace.",

      "body": "There are at least two events related to Bitcoin that made me cringe always and of course I want to forget and if possible I could revisit the time and make a different decision. One, I sold my Bitcoin at the time when it was just valued at $3K and it was because my brother need more capital for his fledging business - seems to me then I have no choice but to let it go. Two, I got so bored with the movement of Bitcoin that I decided to sold them all and replace with Bitcoin Vault or BTCV which of course was just another pump and dump coin. All in all, these two resulted into me losing money especially with the rate of Bitcoin we have now. Can we please invest a time machine so I can go back and rectify these big mistakes?",

When I started, it was difficult buying Bitcoin due to FX restrictions in my country, so we relied entirely on third parties which are individuals that had found their way around it. Scammers seized the opportunity to deal with us ruthlessly. I fell into the hands of scammers on many occasions, loosing various amounts of my hard-earned money. I'm just happy I did not quit then. Fortunately,  I'm not struggling to forget the terrible experiences I had joining Bitcoin... I have already forgotten them and moved on. There is a saying that \"whatever does not kill you, only make you stronger\". Perhaps those experiences form the basis for my trust and confidence in Bitcoin.",

It can be anything like some sort of scam happening to you or some other type of loss. Sincerely there are things left untold. Each an every one has there tereble experience in one way the other. Mine was that some crypto I stocked on my non custodiall wallet was lost because of pasphrase misplacement. And that has thought me a lesson of my life never to joke with pasphrase. When a wallet is newly opened,  before sending any coin to it one needs to keep your key in safe place before stacking coin in it. The wost mistake one can make is stack coin in a safe which is no longer safe after losing access to youy furtune. that reminds me of a thread created in this Bitcoin discussion that someone lost access to his 8k Bitcoin that was a kind of huge amount of BTC. Although mine was not much like $30 but no matter how small it is, one still needs to be careful.",

And when the market was bearish, the altcoins I owned experienced huge losses, plus several new altcoins ended with nothing.However, as time goes by I understand that when the market is bearish, altcoins experience sharper and higher declines and losses compared to Bitcoin which only experiences small losses. And all of these are very valuable lessons and they all start from beginners because we learn from babies who can just crawl until we can stand and run.",

One thing in my memory way back 2017 that I want to forget is not having a back up copy of my wallet address and keys. That's one of the worst thing that happened to me when I was a beginner in blockchain, bitcoin and crypto world. My desktop was accidentally reformat and All the coins that I acquired in bounty campaign, white paper translation and some side hustle in crypto was loss in just a snap. I don't have any back up which resulted of losing huge amount of money. Charge to experience and one of the biggest lesson for me.",

Not buying a lot is one of my regrets because I was still trying to learn what Bitcoin was when I was still a newbie. Because of the proliferation of scams and unknown schemes, that had made me not purchase a lot even though I am not rich but has a little savings several years ago. But still, I was able to stay on Bitcoin and learned along the way on what Bitcoin really was and those skeptics like me for a short period of time or not really a skeptic because I was still unsure probably have the same thoughts during the early days.",

It can be anything like some sort of scam happening to you or some other type of loss. I only regret the several mistakes I have made for myself through several exchanges, because in the past I more often entrusted certain exchanges to store assets. Even though that was the wrong way, I started to change the pattern to be more different by taking all the assets on the exchange and moving them into my personal wallet. Apart from that, I was also deceived by an unknown person via email who offered me many benefits, but he shared how it worked via a phishing link which made me have to reset the device that I was using at the time. Because he managed to take all my assets even though at that time I didn't have many crypto assets and the rest I had also made a mistake with a withdrawal which resulted in losing assets due to adding the wrong wallet. However, I consider this a normal mistake which can make me learn to be more disciplined and also be more careful so as not to experience the same thing again in the future.",
