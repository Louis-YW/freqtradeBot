There is no schedule. You can get merits only if other users merit your postsQuote from: kasunrandil on August 13, 2022, 04:47:42 PM3. by whome merit points are released to the forum??There are ~100 users who are appointed merit sources and get \"sendable merits\" that they can send to other users.All other users can send merits too, albeit \"recycled\" ones - once a users gets merits for posts, they also get half as many sendable merits. For example, once you earn at least two merits, you will have one merit that you can send and so on. Sendable merits are separate and do not reduce your earned merits that count for ranks etc.Quote from: kasunrandil on August 13, 2022, 04:47:42 PMcould anyone explain me these things?? Thank you.Make sure to read the threads other users posted above.",

Merit source ATMs will usually be refillable monthly regardless of whether they deplete their sourced supply in a month or not.Quote from: kasunrandil on August 13, 2022, 04:47:42 PM3. by whome merit points are released to the forum??AFAIK, if previously 111 merit sources were appointed to distribute merit, now only 110. I don't know who is missing, but they are contributors that are selectively appointed by the admin.In addition, there are about 153,881 users (including merit sources) have distributed smerit to other users (219,960 users) with a total merit score of 1,266,669 so far based on merit dashboard. Without exception, if you have sMerit then you can also distribute it to other users.",

Prior to the merit system, users just created posts and boosted their activity inorder to rank up, leading to lots of spam in the forum. Now users have to contribute constructively before ranking up.",

The OP has a neutral tag that says he's violating the rule of ban evasion, but he's so naive that he just doesn't care why this happened to him. Why was his first or twenty-first account banned?

      "body": "It's very simple and no need to complicate things. If you want to receive merits, you have to contribute something to the forum. The easiest way is to write quality posts. Posts that are informative or help solve certain problems for example. Your other concerns about how merits come to existence and who has them are of secondary importance. Those who have them will find and reward those worthy of receiving them. But don't expect any by participating in bounties and posting bounty reports. That's spam, and if it were up to me, I would delete those.",

I don't know who is missing, but they are contributors that are selectively appointed by the admin.Merit sources come and go, I would imagine.  Some of the ones that Theymos tapped back in 2019 might have become inactive, as they never applied to be merit sources--and then there's always the chance that some of them simply aren't as active on the forum anymore or aren't as active in spreading merits around.  I don't even know when the last time Theymos made someone a merit source, but I really wish he'd create some more--especially on the local boards.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on August 14, 2022, 04:10:52 PMHere, another fact is much more interesting.
