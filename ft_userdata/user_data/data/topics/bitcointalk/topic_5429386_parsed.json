      "body": "Having a clear direction is better than having no or ambiguous direction. Bitlicense was hugely complected and was a blocker for small companies to engage with banks regarding crypto related businessman. If the new guidelines are removing ambiguous directions, then it's good for the the overall crypto ecosystem.But I really don't like the idea of banks to get into crypto related services because of the centralisation risk. But new capital will flow into the market for good reasons.",

      "body": "Coming from a NY resident, the NYDFS is both hated and loved here. To a certain extent they do as stated above have a bit of over the top regulation that does slow things down and make things difficult at times here. OTOH, they are the 800lb gorilla with a bat. You will obey and if not suffer the beatings (lawsuits and fines) if you want to deal in NY.There are banks here that have more money flowing though them for New Yorkers then some states have GDP.So, if you want to play in this league to so speak you have to follow the rules.-Dave",
