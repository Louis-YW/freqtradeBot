  "content": "Hello World!!!Wondering if you guys could give some feedback/ opinions on Voxnet’s utility/fundamentals.VoxNET is a fully functional Game-Fi platform, the main utility behind the VXON token is in game wagering/ betting. Functional side-utilities include staking, capped p2e and an in game store.PvP Wagering: Player creates a match with a wagering fee of a choice, for example: lets say host creates 5-10 minutes match with 10 tokens as a wagering fee(easier to count). 5 other players join the match(if you joined it means that you agreed to pay 10 tokens as an entry fee), 5 x 10 equals to 50 tokens per prize pool for that particular match. At the end of a match we have 2 scenarios: 1) Cash Game - token prize pool is split proportional to frags players have. 2) Tournament: Same formula as Cash Game but only first 3 places have their frags calculated and honored by payout system.We also have PvE mode: Basically its same as  Wagered PvP/Deathmatch which is described above(follows same payout formula), but its people against bots without friendly-fire, whoever kills most bots gets the biggest slice of a pay.\"Consumables\" and Wagering Fee as a token deflationary mechanism:For example: You created a match with  50$ worth of token as wagering fee and you want to have a little edge. In game store that works with a native token has HealthPoint potions (consumable item) its cost like 5 tokens and gives +30 HP instantly, which can help in PvP. What if you want to play an archer ? Archer needs arrows (consumable item) which can be bought at in-game store for tokens (Store also has unique weapon skins, stats points ,mystery boxes (set of 3 items)Right now house keeps 0% cut from wagering fee. In the future when platform/game becomes popular, house plans to keep 5% from every pot which will further DEFLATE supply. Basically instead of INFLATING supply all the time just like traditional P2E does, we are DEFLATING it. Instead of dull gameplay where people just grind their tokens we offer competitive gameplay which  brings adrenaline and fun.Use Case In Action (unedited gameplay footage): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKqW9ubAoYoOfficial Trailer with VO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAGLyGIsErIWhitepaper: https://voxnet.xyz/whitepaper.pdf",
