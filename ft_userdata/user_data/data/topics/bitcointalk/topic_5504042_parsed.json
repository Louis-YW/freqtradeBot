But we didn't come to a really convincing conclusion yet.Regarding crypto users, the US seems to be only third in the world - of course there are only rough estimates, but it seems India and even China (despite the heavy restrictions) have more crypto users than the US, of course due to their larger population (see Triple-A estimates).Main factors may be:1) the US as the leading economy in general, and the presence of US news in the world's media headlines,2) the US as the place where most modern \"tech companies\" reside -- in reality, most modern software companies, because industrial tech is mostly located in Asia 3) several founders of big cryptocurrency businesses (Binance, for example) and also altcoins are from the US or located in the US,4) the Wall Street as the world's \"money hotspot\" and synonym of Capitalism in general, which is important above all for financial products like ETFs, but also crypto stocks,5) of course, in recent years also the large mining sector (35-45% of the world's hashpower, according to estimates)I think while these points of course are important, the importance for the crypto market in my opinion is disproportional. Much more bullish than a crypto-friendly legislation in the US, where already 15% of all people have owned crypto-assets, would be a crypto-friendly legislation in India for example, or a lifting of the restrictions in China. I'm thus quite bullish regarding the developments in Hong Kong (the authorization of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs there), because they can hint to a change in the Communist Party's views about Bitcoin and cryptos, and possible further removal of crypto restrictions in China.",

I am guessing it would be because of USA’s general role in the economy of the world. The dollar is the reserve currency of the world and the fall or rise of the dollar can have massive impact on bitcoin. It’s also because of sheer market size.It’s difficult to say accurately just how many americans are investors of bitcoin but we can assume that there’s enough that any political or economic situation happening in USA can affect the investors and therefore affect the market. QuoteEven when Biden decided to step down from the presidential race, many speculates that bitcoin could go up as a result of that.Well that’s because Biden’s opposition is Trump who has been constantly mentioning bitcoin. Biden stepping down just increases the chances of Trump winning and by extension his ideas about bitcoin.",

And mining was very concentrated in China until 2021. Regarding the Ukraine war, it mostly seems to have impacted due to its influence on inflation in almost all major markets, and that impacting on interest rates globally -- including in the US. Interest rate changes in major countries are not so much \"news\" stories, but fundamental reasons why people invest more or less in Bitcoin, because of the increased competition of traditional financial products (like bonds) when the rates are high.To be fair, the US is one of the few countries where presidential candidates even used Bitcoin in their campaign. The only other country I know where this was a major topic is El Salvador. Even in Argentina for example, when last year a \"Libertarian\" (Javier Milei) won the presidential election, Bitcoin wasn't a significant campaign topic, although some minor politicians from Milei's party have publicly supported cryptocurrencies.",

Even back in my small town, my father's old radio which broadcasts local stations relays to us what's happening in the US.I guess all eyes are in the US, perhaps because everything's there. As regards Bitcoin, the mining is there. The ATMs are there. All kinds of platforms offering services all over the world are there. The most influential ETFs in the world are based there. The richest Bitcoin owners are from there. The list goes on.But I guess this is also partly because we're fixated on the US all the time. We don't have to. But it has already gone to a ridiculous extent that even the most inconsequential event happening in the US like Snoop Dogg shitting on his pants could be associated with the next direction the Bitcoin price would take.",

Fiat has a direct correlation with Bitcoin because of how fiat moves and how the economic outlook is supposed to be. Think of how S&P or NASDAQ moves when Jerome Powell speaks. A poor market outlook results in a general downward trend for the majority of the market save for inflation hedge like precious metals.It'll be naive to think that there is any currency out there which is free from the influence of news and politics anywhere in the world, much less from one of the biggest and most prosperous countries. Cryptos like Bitcoin will always be affected by politics, same as literally anything that has any value in the world. Think of this: If one of the biggest countries in the world shows signs that they'll be easing policies on Bitcoin, then obviously the optimism on Bitcoin would be high -> higher prices.You also highlighted an important phrase: Speculation. Crypto in general can still be treated like a speculative currency, where traders are eager to predict the general trend of Bitcoin, if it'll rise or fall. This would obviously lead to the market being more volatile than usual.",

Why? Most likely as one powerful nation, and then their USD as the world's reserved, the world's strongest economy.Perhaps if Bitcoin will really mature, perhaps we can see it decoupling from US economy, and we might be independent with it.

US politics. Just like the US dollar is.  So much for Bitcoin being an \"independent\" currency and all that and is outside of the reach of any government.But holders of US Dollars don't hang on every nuance of the US elections to see if their investment is going to go up or down. But to hear Bitcoin holders tell it, US politics is the only thing keeping their investment afloat. The supposedly \"government-proof\" Bitcoin needs the right political faction in Washington to be in place to survive. I guess this is where rhetoric meets reality? Bitcoin starts life under libertarian ideals of a government-free world, and ends up holding its hand out for government alms like Ayn Rand's looters from Atlas Shrugged. Crazy stuff .",
