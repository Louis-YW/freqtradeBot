The message counter in square brackets is pretty easy to miss (unless you remember to cast your eyes up there once in a while), so I sometimes leave messages sitting around for longer than I'd like.I played around with a few ways to make it more obvious that your inbox needs attending. It's quite easy to mess up that area of the HTML, so what ended up working best was a carefully-rasterized image of a little white dot:I think it catches the eye nicely without being too opinionated (stylistically), so it fits in with the rest of the SMF aesthetic.Here's the patch for @theymos, if he approves of this change:Code:--- /var/www/baseline/Themes/default/index.template.php 2008-04-30 18:30:34.000000000 +0000+++ /var/www/modified/Themes/default/index.template.php 2023-04-10 14:59:46.000000000 +0000@@ -545,25 +545,26 @@   // Edit Profile...

For me, it stands out and flashes the eyes better. It isn't for nothing that it's used to indicate \"danger\"About new messages, I do believe that it's better to have the forum alert users by default through notification whenever they log in telling them they have new messages and if they would like to open it then or later. With that no one misses any message.However, I want to admit that those who don't have the habit of reading messages will still not read. So, it's not even about choosing to boldface or sparkle the notification with bright colour that should matter.",

I'd prefer the patch to just add a simple class=\"new_message\" (or something) to be added to the section when a new message comes in, then the styling or adding of icons could be handled through custom CSS options by users themselves. Even if the styling ends up acceptable as a change to the forum overall, I'd still add a class tag to the code so it can be adjusted through CSS.",

So far messages weren't really an issue, the [1] wasn't that bad.This red one for sure will be a lot more noticeable compared to the new one, but maybe red is a bit too much on the forum's theme, the blinking will be perfect if added.

There's also an email so I really can't miss it. Nevertheless: great effort!If there are going to be improvements for PMs, I'd like it to be much faster. With 200 pages, it takes about 7 seconds to show when I click MY MESSAGES. And I think it always links to the last page, which means if you have many new PMs, it's easy to overlook the ones on the second last page.What really grinds my gears, is that the [1] doesn't update (it neither appears not disappears) when I have a tab in Preview. I often keep those open for days, and the [1] stays the way it was when I opened it. But I'm nitpicking here",

Also, from your profile, active is already showing and the total post count is just showing, which is not really so necessary. You can just go to your profile and see your post count.I think this is a good development, but the color being white is not too eye-catching; I think yellow or green would be a better fit (just a suggestion), and also @Powerglove, the dot should blink, just as Husires have suggested.",
