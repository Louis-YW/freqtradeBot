The matter looks childish  at first because the whole table of friends there were all gamblers including myself but we all never reached the height of complaining or blaming someone for our gambling ethics.So I was wondering if some folks here too feel the same way or it was just a matter of grudge and hatred for the particular fellow to stir up such arguement.",

Whether I’m up or down money wise is an unknown to me but I don’t ever gamble large amounts so I’d imagine I’m probably +/- $1,000. Given the amount of fun I’ve had with poker nights and sports bets, it was easily worth the price of admission. Just be responsible and gambling can be fun.",

For me I would say I don't regret although there are some times when the going gets really tough but still light at the tunnel and I obviously don't gamble with funds that can damage my thinking because it can easily make you addicted to the act as you would probably be wanting to recover your money back because it will be looking too big to be lost.",

      "body": "The decision to enter the world of gambling is purely your own decision, we cannot blame other people for this. If we have a strong stance, I'm sure we can resist gambling. When I stay in Philippines, my two friends and I got into a casino and played slots and other gambling games, even though we lost money there, we also made a profit from playing slot machines. The point is that gambling is just for fun, don't make it your main choice to make money, if you want to make a lot of money, work at a job that can make a lot of money. If you continue like that then your friendship will be damaged.Always use money that is actually ready to be spent or loss.",

It is up to you whether you want yourself to get involved in gambling or any other vices for that matter during those days.And that's what we call peer pressure, if you succumb to the gambling just because all your friends around are gambling then the issue is on you. Maybe one of your friend you become addicted is looking for someone to blame as to what happen in his life. He should have taken control of everything as I have said, in my opinion. And be man enough to admit your mistakes and not point to others.",

There are ages that are not considered matured, they are mostly called minors. They have no will power to an extent and they tend to copy loads of people since they can't function themselves. At that age of life, whatever traits you pick up can not be dropped easily and when you don't let your guardian know about it, you'll drown in it.To an extent, I'll join him in blaming the guy but from a matured standpoint, I'll blame myself for not having muscled the courage to stop",

Some time I feel regret when I remember the time I lost some money in gambling, but I always try to forget about it and move on. I believe that regret something too much will not help us to be better but it will bring us into worse situation. If we need to blame, we should blame ourselves if there is negative effect of what we did but still we should not do it too much. We should be mature enough to evaluate and find the best solution if we are already in serious issue that comes from our gambling habit.",

      "body": "At some point, yes, when I experienced being addicted, and because of that, it disrupted my life, but when I realised it was my own fault, I'm the one who cost it, so will I blame gambling itself? There will be no addiction to gambling if they don't let themselves become addicted, I think of that. Right now, after that realisation, I still play gambling, but not always, let's say often, but with discipline in mind and always setting up the kimit for myself. I'm only spending the money that I can afford to lose, and I enjoy more gambling after that. There is no hope that I will win. So for those blaming gambling, think again: are the casinos or online casinos at fault because you are addicted, or are you yourself who let yourself become addicted and did not limit yourself, resulting in bad results?",

Now that you have all grown up you should know how to be responsible with your own acts and not because someone invited you to be conscious about gambling and now the blame game is happening. That's not right. Don't point fingers at your own choices, it's not their fault. We have our own decisions on why we do those bad habits and I bet he also enjoyed gambling at first until he was losing some money. Then, you are all friends, I mean sharing experiences about gambling will do you great and the discussions should not lead to blaming each other. Those were your fun moments as friends and no one should be pointing fingers because all of you made that decision individually. It should not matter how you all end up but what matters is how you can help each other starting now. I don't regret being introduced to gambling, it made my love for sports more colorful and exciting.",

Well, lemme not digress from the Original topic but I don't think there is need for someone to regret something they choose to do because I believe that before you join anything in life you must have checked the advantage and the disadvantage of what you choose to do so In case things begins to go wrong there is absolutely no need of pointing a finger at someone that introduced you to such thing.Gambling is meant to be played at leisure and for pleasure so whether you're incurring losses or making gain shouldn't make you feel emotionally down to the extent of regretting or pointing fingers at someone who persuaded you to join.",

Maybe he is having difficulty managing himself now and his gambling activities are disrupting his financial condition which is causing problems in his life.

Okay discussion copied for discussion.This also reminded me when I and my friend discussed about how some person's are engaged with some sorts of addiction and would never realize the errors at their engagements as long they are not willing to change from it but only those who are willing to change if they want would acknowledge what they are doing is an addition probably some sorts of unhealthy additions such as smoking and alcohol that is liable to damage the lungs At first that of my guy was in the same lines of discussion with me but along the lines, the most himself because he is an addicted smoker then turned against me where he began to say..... There are people that lives 70s-80s-90s and still smokes and drinks meaning nothing ever happened to their lungs.At this point of time, he is giving himself some sorts of hopes and reasons about his addictions. That is definitely he would never change from it because he is not ready to figure any sort of errors or some unhealthy repercussions that is liable to accompany his addictions of smoking.Equivalently, that is the same scenario between you all discussion. You maybe all addicted to gambling and never realizes the consequences nor understands the mayhems you are causing to yourself simply because you are never ready at all to any form of changes of riding away with your addictions in the gambling while your friend is craving to struggle out of the gambling whereas, he is flexible to make changes about his gambling addictions that is just the possibilities of his abilities to error findings about his engagement in gambling because he either wants to quit or limits his gambling velocity. Hopefully setting a gamble portfolios budgets.Quote from: Jaycoinz on December 09, 2023, 12:42:36 AMSo I was wondering if some folks here too feel the same way or it was just a matter of grudge and hatred for the particular fellow to stir up such arguement.Sometimes we are so loosed to nonsensical indulgences that are probably and influenced by friends or the environment.So if such life was never part of us, we could be able to realize what we are up to is not sensible nor productive to some profits. Also as the ability to recall yourself about some addiction which turns your life around either h bad reputation or some series of thoughts and realizations that he had been loosing up to the gambling and never had been at the winning side to make profits.So it is believed that that if your friend had the personal ability to take control of his emotion's in gambling which left him regretted and disappointed of himself.Otherwise no grudges not hatreds as thought OP.",

Anyone having gambling issues call it addiction or whatever, this things are caused based on how people took gambling so serious by expecting so much from it. When engaging into gamble people needs to be conscious on how they play if not it will be something that may cause alot which can lead to regrets. Their are ways people must go about gambling,  it should not be what we need to expect so much  money from as a source of income or a way to make huge sum of money.",
