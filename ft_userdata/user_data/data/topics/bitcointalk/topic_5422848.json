  "content": "Graduate from department of economics Matthew Ferranti recently published this paper that describes how bitcoin can serve as a sanction hedge, alternatively to gold, and especially if acquiring gold shares isn't sufficient for the respective central banks, which does present some interest: https://blackhatcoiner.com/Cryptocurrency_in_Central_Bank_Reserves.pdf (source)Here are some parts worth to highlight:QuoteCountries that import valuable military equipment from geopolitical rivals of the United States, particularly China and Russia, plausibly face a heightened risk of U.S. sanctions. In 2017, then-President Trump signed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, providing for sanctions on entities that transact with the Russian defense sector. In 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13959, establishing financial sanctions against certain Chinese military companies. As previously discussed, entities that transact with sanctioned entities face the risk of secondary sanctions, so importing military goods from China or Russia raises the importer’s sanctions risk.QuoteAs a risky asset, Bitcoin has historically not exhibited a flight to safety effect; Bitcoin’s price tends to fall during periods of economic turmoil. Indeed, Figure 25 shows that Bitcoin declined concurrent with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, the figure also shows that Bitcoin sharply appreciated immediately following the US Treasury’s sanctions against the Central Bank of Russia. Therefore, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin may provide some insurance value against deglobalization shocks, such as the disruption caused by sanctions. This hypothesis is consistent with Aysan et al. (2019), who find that Bitcoin hedges geopolitical risks.QuoteThird, Bitcoin’s volatility does not preclude its functioning as a store of value. Gold, a reserve asset widely regarded as a store of value, has experienced significant real losses over prolonged periods of time. Harmson (1998) illustrates that gold tends to maintain its purchasing power over centuries, but the price of gold can experience significant fluctuation over 10- or 20-year periods. Indeed, Figure 26 illustrates that the real price of gold experienced an 86% decline over approximately a 21-year period beginning in 1980. Similarly, since Bitcoin’s third ”halving” event in July 2016 (which reduced the rate at which Bitcoin is mined), Bitcoin experienced a maximum real drawdown of 83% from December 2017 to December 2018.31 Superimposing the Bitcoin and gold price graphs reveals several similarities, including the concavity, the pattern of volatility clustering towards the beginning of the series, and the magnitude of the price decline.",

America's healthcare is vastly more expensive in comparison to other nations and the market and regulatory reasons for these trends carry over to defense technology and other industries. Which is one reason why america's manufacturing sector has suffered.Long story short, conditions inside the USA will not allow it to produce military hardware at a competitive cost in comparison to other nations. This puts american defense contractors in a desperate position where they must resort to this type of heavy handed and authoritarian approach in order to maintain some semblance of competition. Of course, this is only temporary and the outcome is obviously in favor of defense contractors outside the USA if things do not change to make american arms manufacturers more competitive in global markets.QuoteAs a risky asset, Bitcoin has historically not exhibited a flight to safety effect; Bitcoin’s price tends to fall during periods of economic turmoil.

Apple co founder Steve Wozniak is famous for defining how better and more efficient methods of extracting gold from the earth will be developed. But no matter how fast crypto miners become, the mining rate for bitcoin will remain relatively the same. Which guarantees bitcoin's stability as a deflationary asset over its precious metal competitors.",

I'm curious how it was received by the respected economists of Harvard considering that majority of them are probably traditional. I believe this was presented as a PhD dissertation? It's interesting to know how Mr. Ferranti was graded with this paper and who his adviser was. Anyway, it seems this is more focused on circumventing sanctions. I think this possibility was already widely discussed during the time when a number of packages of sanctions was imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine, although probably not as a central bank option. Of course, it's probably better than gold in that it is digital, so it could easily be moved from one nation or continent to another. However, challenges as to its actual use are probably difficult. Would it be accepted as a payment method? Like, for example, in purchasing arms?",

      "body": "The idea of Bitcoin \"hedging geopolitical risks\" doesn't seem right to me. Bitcoin mining in concentrated in several countries around the world-USA, Canada, Kazakhstan, etc. Banning mining in those countries could create short term panic across the Bitcoin community(until the hashrate is adjusted). This possesses certain risks of market panic and price crash and/or the blockchain getting stuck for a while.This definitely doesn't make Bitcoin bulletproof against geopolitical risks.I don't think that China and Russia are going to use BTC in order to bypass any western sanctions. They would simply use their own national currencies(ruble and yuan) since their goal is to \"de-dollarize\" the global economy and to increase the value of their own fiat currencies.Bitcoin/crypto isn't a part of the equation here.",

Countries like Iran and Russia could use cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions and keep their international trade running. It's more convenient than using gold as a medium of exchange for international trade. Many countries are unhappy about the hyperinflation of the USD and are eager to find an alternative.",

The loss is not just in terms of pricing but it could be associated with many other factors such as loss in the metal itself, good reserve which are untouched Forever (ex. Temples, Shrines, Cultural). It may not be useful when wars are broken because no one will be using metal to trade.

They even brag about this on their website: https://www.rothschildarchive.org/collections/rothschild_faqs/rothschild_and_gold.I actually believe eventually there will be a massive revaluation of the gold price, which would be a devaluing of the USD against gold. If the Fed (or really the Treasury) merely marked gold to market (its actually priced to this day at $42.50 by the Fed / Treasury) theoretically this is a way out of the incredibly massive hole they've sunk everyone in. This is easier said than done because there are a lot of societal complexities along the way which have to get resolved, also because you don't want the worst people in America, who are insider enough to know of the timing of such a plan so that they rug pull the economy, to be in possession of the gold when you do devalue. Also I think Bitcoin emerging when it did may have delayed those plans. Greenspan all but admitted this back in 2014 so I dont think I'm off in terms of speculation.",

So there can be big mistakes here that won't be spotted by people without very good higher education in economics.  In any case, the arguments seem to be that gold is less risky (because it's less volatile) but has less liquidity and is more inconvenient (because it's physical, has to be transported and stored, etc.), whereas Bitcoin is easier to obtain and store, but is risker because it's more volatile. That seems right to me, but I would expect banks to go for gold way more than for cryptos because volatility is too big of a gamble when you need to stabilize your economy.",
