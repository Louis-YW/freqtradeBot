      "body": "Quote from: theHelpbitcoin on August 16, 2023, 08:32:46 AMI modified the DBcache… around 3000 instead of 550 MB!Modifying the database cache size from 550 to 3000 MB shouldn't cause any issue with your wallet file or blockchain, it mainly affects the node's performance.If balance is the issue, the first thing you should try is: rescanblockchain command to check if the last scan missed some transaction(s).But based from the size of 550MB, I think you're talking about \"prune block storage\" size instead of dbcache.If it's the case, you cannot use the command above with the default parameters, for pruned blockchain, the \"start_height\" and \"stop_height\" must be indicated based from your available blocks.So here are your current options:If it's not the dbcache, use the mentioned command by opening the 'Console' in \"Window->Console\", select the correct wallet,and enter rescanblockchain command.If it's pruned, you should get your 'pruneheight' from getblockchaininfo command,then rescan starting from that height using rescanblockchain \"start_height\" command (replace \"start_height\" with your pruneheight value).Take note that if the missing transactions aren't included to the scanned blocks, it wont be scanned still.",

If his wallet is fully synced and he still can't see any balance or any transaction then importing the wallet (seed/private keys..) into another wallet software will not help.However, you raized a very good point! OP, you said you created a new wallet then you generated a new address, right? If the address you have generated is a legacy address (starts with bc1) then (most likely) this is not the wallet you are trying to recover.You said one of your friends previously helped you recover your wallet. Do you teust him? Why don't you call him and ask for his help or at least ask him what you should do!",
