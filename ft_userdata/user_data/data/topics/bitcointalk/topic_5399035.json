For a given pubkey, you will have four possible combos to make a different but equivalent signature for it: X and P-X (unless X >= N - an extremely rare occurence), and Y and -Y.R is directly derived from X so the only way you'd end up with two R's for the same nonce is if you used the other identical value for X. In a similar vein, you can end up with four different S values if you mix&match X and Y values.And yes, that would allow the private key to be solved for and its funds to be spent, because solving such an equation is trivial.",

Also your example is relevant ..but its (s1*z2 - s2*z1) / (R1*(S1-S2)) is the same as the formula above IF R1 and R2 are equal then it applies.   R does not have to be equal to K to be able to be mapped, just shared by 2 txn generated  or not. since one is 254 and the other 256 and arrive at the same point on K its relevant.  Look this also inst my strong suit, those were created on valid pub-key and address compressed... nothing is re-used.. So the rule of thumb that i have seen over all the years here is that K can be traced back to the private key.. If you want to do it or show me it would be awesome, as i would like to recover the wallet. If i doesn't work then okay...  but i have tried to do it again which is impossible to duplicate. just to balance it, another person states that its a different K its correlating too... \"\"If K would be the same, \"R\" should also be the same. ...Because r = k*G\"\"  - but this is not possible as there is only ONE K ... its not as if there is another  one which phases in and out on the same bit level..  . Also they did not have the full 2 examples, as i omitted K ..  There are points on both sides im not discounting that but as Albert also said its a mix and match which approach and  makes the shared K value i outlined relevant and solvable..  \"\"The signature is then (r,s) and H(M) is the SHA-256 hash of the message (M), and converted into an integer value. The power of -1 is the inverse mod function.But here is the problem … if the k value (the random value for each signature) is revealed for any of the signatures, an intruder can easily determine the private key using: priv=R-1 x ((k.s)-H(M))i am no where as involved in this side of the internals,.. and i could be wrong, but to determine that would be to finish it , which is why i asked for some help here, its the end of the road for me as i dont know what the next steps are and would like someone to review it. I cant post it out in the open on the chance its legitimate. so how about anyone giving me something that inst going to make me cuss like sailor here changing it or better yet something already made for 2 RSZ 1K recovery",
