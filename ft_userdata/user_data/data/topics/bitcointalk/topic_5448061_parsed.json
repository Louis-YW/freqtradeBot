Did you change the stock fan? And what worked better, Hashboard in the middle or off to the side when it came to keeping the hashboard cool with wood added?",

Yes, merely blocking the extra empty space does the trick. Don't do it and it overheats. Works like magic (at least a year tested).A definite improvement on my idea. As it is easier and cheaper.Also do no use the apw3 psu get something like this one.https://www.bestbuy.com/site/corsair-rme-series-rm750e-80-plus-gold-fully-modular-low-noise-atx-3-0-and-pcie-5-0-power-supply-black/6537989.p?this is a good 1 board psu very quiet.it can do 2 boards if you use brains  and set to low powers (under 500 watts)",

Use an HP Common Slot PSU with breakout board and custom cables. Runs cool and quiet, although I only ever use it now when its cold as a space heater.",

Or would that be insufficient cooling?As far as OP's question goes, I would wager liquid cooling to be the quietest method for cooling your mining rig. But then again if you have an entire room of miners, I am not sure how exactly that would differ from fan cooling. You would still need a source of cool air/liquid in both cases, I imagine. Perhaps combined with an more efficient way to channel the electricity through a minimal energy loss system. I don't suppose anyone mines with superconductors ?",
