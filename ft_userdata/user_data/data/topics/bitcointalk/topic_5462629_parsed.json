I'm sure some people are more lucky than many others. Not a fan of slots but I have been playing Dice and Crash many times and have gone through the same phase as you. I have not been able to convert $1 to $200 like you did but I have made quite a few big profits with small investments. The number of wins is less than the number of losses for me and I believe most of here have gone through the same phase while playing games that are solely based on luck. I am also sure there are people here who have been more lucky than me and you.",

Do you have any Slots spinning stories to share? I'm sure some people are more lucky than many others. I am also not a fan of slot but I understand your points. Playing a game for the first time and winning can be a motivating factor to like the particular game. You will assume that the game is easy to win or it is your lucky game. But that is not the true nature of gambling. Gambling is highly determined by luck. Winning daily for a week is not even a sign of skills, I think it is just your lucky week. It is nice to know that you have a gambling limit that helps to control your bets. So don't be deceived by lucky wins, always follow your gambling plan. Immediately you get to the limit, it is time to stop because the next bets might be losses. And if you are careful, you might start chasing losses. I think every gambler has the same two stories. The lucky days are filled with wins and the unlucky days are occupied by losses but the mature gambler knows how to handle these two situations.",

I'm sure some people are more lucky than many others. I played my first slot game on one of the online casinos being promoted on the forum. It was my first, I was excited. I didn't know what to expect. I deposited $50 and used it. After the spin, I won $40. This wasn't bad. My second time was after some weeks and I used $30. I won only $10. I was furious. A week after, I tried it again with $30 and won about $60. Why this happened was because I got some free spins and bonus during the game. The key take away for me with slots is that, slot doesn't care about your gambling beliefs. It is a game of pure luck and zero skills. And if you want to really enjoy the game play at a reputable casino because some online casinos rigged their RTP system.",

Never expect too much especially with large capital hoping for even bigger wins but the reality is that it makes us lose all of it but you are still lucky to leave $20 but some other people with ambition even spend their balance on slot games.I have to be willing to lose; capital $20 if you lose it will not be a problem, if you win, let's say above $50, I withdraw the profit and capital and return the next day.",

Not slot, but dice I am one of those who fall from the belief that doubling is a good strategy to win, I have experienced beginner's luck on dice, and dice is one of the games that you can easily get hooked on there are a lot of variations that you can think of when playing dice.Until now I have had my ups and downs in dice game but the downs are more than the hits, I guess the house edge always play a major factor in a luck-based games even if you employ a lot of variations from old to new variations and methods",

I can relate to your experience cause I had a similar situation when I won my first big money from gambling and mine wasn't from slot games but the joy I had was so much and I couldn't imagine i could win that big from gambling, and that gave me a big motivation in my gambling journey and i understood that in as much a gambling involves risk, if you understand the game and try to lower your risk of losing you could make a fortune from it. The world of gambling is not a bad of rose there's loss and theirs gain, if youv avoid gambling recklessly you'll make more profit than lose, I've had several losses but I've never lost a huge money that would make me feel remorseful for days and I'm not looking forwards to that yet because I try every possible means to avoid too risky games and stake wisely with funs i could let go without feeling bad, there's more joy in winning so I try to make sure I get more wins that losses, I heard slot games have a good chances of winning I've never tried it because I'm more of a sports bettor, but I'll love to give it a trial when I make a research and understand the game better.",

I never know for sure when slot gambling started circulating, but I have been playing since 2019, when slot gambling was booming at my place. and I think playing slots is getting more and more difficult every day and the winnings are unpredictable.in the past and it's been a very long time when I played slot gambling and got skaters, I definitely won big or at least returned my capital, which was very different from now getting skaters. Not sure I can get a big win.and the last day I played the highest slot gambling I won 20% of my initial capital, which made me reluctant to withdraw so I spent the balance to try my luck. and someone once advised me to create a new account because slot gambling tends to give wins to people who have just joined. however, even though I followed the advice, it turned out that it was indeed difficult to get a win at slot gambling lately.",

I'm only keeping it always low to gamble even on slot that seems enjoyable. On my first try with online slots I think I've been on a win streak but when it starts to have more spins, I think it's when the losses came as well.",
