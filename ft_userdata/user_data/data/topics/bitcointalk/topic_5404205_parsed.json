LOOTaDOG isn't just a Move2Earn project for dogs. Dog owners who use our app while dog walking will get surprise rewards along the way and guess what, they'll be better ready to Play2Earn using our game mode later!Mint now if you want in!https://lootadog.com/mint",

      "body": "How New Web3 Projects Are Impacting the Real World: The Case for PetsCat-and-dog-themed NFT projects are still on the rise, but are they making a real-world pawsitive social impact? While pets are being hyped about having their own Metaverse avatars, we still believe their real-world versions need the utmost care and attention. Hence, the LOOTaDOG PetCare Foundation.Many Web3 projects already exist for pets. One of these is Web3 Doge. It sets its eyes on becoming the gateway for 3D pet avatars. Another is Petaverse. It also invites you to bring your pets to the Metaverse, as we do, but it takes on a similar approach to Web3 Doge. Yes, they‚Äôre both into creating 3D avatars for cats, dogs, or likely any other kind of pet. It‚Äôs cute and all, but we were wondering if virtual walks in a virtual park are all they got to offer. We don‚Äôt know all details yet, for sure, but instead of speculating, we wanted to focus on something they haven‚Äôt (yet, likely).Instead of promoting just a virtual universe, we‚Äôre shooting for a project that will impact the real world. In the case of humans, we mentioned previously how STEPN is already doing the thing. They‚Äôre encouraging more and more people to actually go out, move around, and eventually earn from being active outdoors. It clearly is a Web3 NFT project with a mission.So how about something for pets? Interestingly, the NFT and crypto space owes a lot of its fame to cats and dogs. CryptoKitties is one of the earliest blockchain projects that got cat lovers into virtual cat breeding and NFT collecting. It has had huge success. Today, many copycats may have outshined it in terms of hype and popularity. But, CryptoKitties is still a thing, and one good reason for that is it‚Äôs making a real-world social impact.Not so long ago, CryptoKitties formed a partnership with ACTAI Global and Ocean Elders. Together, they created ‚ÄúHonu.‚Äù It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first ‚Äúsea-loving CryptoKitty.‚Äù They bred Honu for one specific noble purpose: it is to serve as an environmental ambassador to help protect real-world oceans and wildlife. Honu was then auctioned, and all proceeds were donated to charity. That‚Äôs a noble cause, indeed.As dog lovers, we salute this cool cat move Okay, we weren‚Äôt awed only by that CryptoKitties move. Cool Cats ‚Äî another NFT project ‚Äî also made a donation to charity together with artist Ghxsts. And we thought it was super ccool Cool Cats and Ghxsts gave 18.16 ETH each to Hope for Paws, Animal Equality, and Rainforest Foundation. All these organizations bring new hope to our animal friends and the planet. The donation they each received was USD 41,285 at the time.Do you see the point here?NFT projects aren‚Äôt just for making big money. When good people make good money, they also do good deeds by handing the fortune to others. They have filled their pockets with more than enough for their need, so they‚Äôre generously filling those of others.How LOOTaDOG sets itself apartWe can‚Äôt help but applaud our fellows in the Web3 development and NFT space for their creativity and brilliance. To our comrades here, we salute you and say to you, WAGMI (We‚Äôre All Gonna Make It)!But, after some thorough search among real-world pet communities ‚Äî especially those for dogs ‚Äî we found a disconnect. Many dog lovers are actually advocating for dog rescue missions. While some of them may want to take in the concept of ‚Äúearning‚Äù by expressing their fondness for pets, many more are pushing for charitable causes. Many dogs need a new home and sufficient care, According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), roughly 6.5 million animals enter shelters each year. Sadly, only 3.2 million get adopted. About 2 million of these are dogs. Imagine stray dogs roaming about, left in the streets and alleys to fend for themselves, and having no clue what life would look like the next day. That‚Äôs just heartbreaking.These sentiments led us to find ways to give animal lovers what they really want. And that‚Äôs freedom and love for pets! In order to make a significant contribution to the pet community, we created the LOOTaDOG PetCare Foundation.How the LOOTaDOG PetCare Foundation will make an impactThrough this foundation, we‚Äôll build our charity fund dedicated to pet welfare. We aim to prioritize the following pet care needs:Necessary pet suppliesVeterinary costsCampaigns to help them find a new homePet care center developmentBasically, we‚Äôre geared to help with pet rescue missions, pet care, and pet rehoming. Our Web3 NFT project will donate 10% of our NFT minting fees to this petcare charity fund. This will be an ongoing mission. We will then use the fund to help the animal rescue and animal welfare organizations we‚Äôve connected with.Do you know any other animal welfare organizations that would love to partner with us? A huge part of our mission is to make this big contribution to already existing pet rescue centers. If you‚Äôre running such an organization, or if you know someone who is, then we‚Äôd be delighted to chat.UPDATE: we‚Äôve already launched our LOOTaDOG Genesis Dog NFTs (since June 13), which means we‚Äôll soon be ready to make a pawsitive impact in the real world of pets ‚Äî dogs and cats and any furbabies alike.So fam, head over to https://lootadog.com/mint to start minting.And, stay excited and stay tuned! If you have any questions about the LOOTaDOG project, feel free to email us at web3@lootadog.com",
