Perhaps the owner did not bother to hire developers or a customer support team, although you suffered a loss, but fortunately, it is not a large amount. I hope that they will solve your issue as soon as possible after their representative in the forum sees your case, which some respected members have highlighted in the topic of their announcement. For me, I do not prefer to wager even a dollar on new casino platforms that have not received ratings or feedback from users who have already tried them.",

It's normal, if you and many other customers start winning they will run out of money and they will become unable to pay you your winnings. Their only option is to look for excuses why they shouldn't pay you.Sorry, but it's your fault for trusting a new casino that has no reputation. Thank you for the warning and I've hoped there was something we can help you with to get your money back. Unfortunately, there isn't.",

There's a high chance that they many user encounter this issue so its good to put that to warn other user who's not aware about the issue happening on their casino. If they will not return this might be consider as another fast scam scheme since maybe there are some gamblers deposit some huge amount of money and the owner decide to run and secure his pocket. So hopefully they came back and our assumptions about them as scam is wrong.",
