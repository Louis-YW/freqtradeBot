Some may want to try and pay lower amount and see if it would work.That amount is huge and it the best is for it to lead to lawsuit. If the casino can not pay, they will give the woman a better offer in a way the money will still be huge but not up to the amount won, but if the woman do not agree, it will lead to a court case. The woman would win as long as he has been abiding the gambling site rules and something good will come out of it.",

If casinos don't have the money to py for wins, why should we trust them? If they're reasons are too ridiculous and unbelievable, why would we entrust that they'll honor the next big win that might occur on their platform? For all we know they are already going under and we might be in for a treat, so as early as now it's great to spot these casinos to avoid them. That $43m win from the lady is a gut-wrenching example that these casinos can just shrug off the win and even get the authorities involved to back them up. Really hard to fight these entities and all that we can do on our end is just avoid them to let them take a hit on their profits.",

Or you mean trend? Maybe the reason why they came up with that situation is they cannot pay that huge amount of money won by their player. And if that case maybe this indicates that we need to pull out our money there since if they can't pay other peoples winning then provably it will happen to us or more worse they don't have  a plan since in the first place their target is to scam their users once they accumulate huge deposits in their casino.",

We should admit that some gambling sites really doesn't have huge bankroll and really can't afford to pay players if they win a jackpot and that's what we should avoid. There are some previous incident here in the forum where a gambling site couldn't afford to pay its customer and promised to pay him a portion on a monthly basis, sounds ridiculous right as you will be receiving your winnings partially and on a monthly basis.I'm not sure if that casino were new but that's what I'm skeptical to new casinos if they offer big rewards and bonuses, well of course not all new gambling sites are like that but most of them are starting business so it's not bad to question that.",

So many problems happened with the various sites started from that. That's why we must be careful with any of gambling sites. that's a lot of money. The sites must try to pay what they can affort to pay it. I think that this gonna be a long term problem since the winner will not let the site will not pay him.
