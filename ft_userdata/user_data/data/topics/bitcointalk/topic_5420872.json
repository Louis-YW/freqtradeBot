  "content": "introduction of Bitcoin has improved my lifestyle, despite it hasn't significantly improved my financial situation.Despite hearing about bitcoin and even learning about it from friends, my experience with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general has only been a few months back. When I purchased my first $30 worth of Bitcoin  from my friend who introduced me to Bitcoin in year period of March but since then, the value of Bitcoin has fallen. But that doesn't move at all, do that I have  I performed more research on my own during this current semi-bearish period instead of declaring, saying this \"Fuck this, I'm out.\" As a result, I became more knowledgeable about the world of finance and have never stopped buying since. both in the upward and downward directions.Even though my bitcoin investments is not moving well, getting into crypto has taught me how to be frugal. I have gained a lot of knowledge about the stock market, charts, and economics in general all stemming from my interest in crypto. I didn't have any future investment plans before  getten into crypto. my plane was save everything in bank in savings account. Before I paid no attention to inflation, the state of the economy, or my financial future ( besides being a graduate ).Even if I never achieve financial independence through Bitcoin, I will always be appreciative of the positive impact it as  added on my life.And once more, I want to express my gratitude to the forum users for their advice.",

Secondly it showed me, today's world is so brute. If you don't have any investment plan you will fail at some point of your life. Because nowadays inflation is a crucial problem.  We are seeing its effect day by day. Thanks to cryptocurrency my last two years was more effective than before about financial freedom. Of course, everything wasnt positive. I had many days without sleeping. Most of the time i was thinking about my portfolio and i couldn't concentrate what i was doing. My internet quoata starts to finish earlier than normal. I had same problem for my phone battery  And also I became addicted to this forum. My total logged time is 127 day",

No OP; there is no need to even utter such thoughts. Your positive thinking will definitely make you successful. With bitcoin, many grow up and begin to be more careful and restrained in their means. I won’t say that I limit my life to constant savings, but the understanding that instead of momentary weakness and buying unnecessary things, I can buy bitcoin once again always has a positive effect on my well-being.For a long time, I didn’t take bitcoin seriously and didn’t take it into account, but now that I’ve gained experience, I won’t repeat my mistakes. In addition, when there is a permanent job, investing in bitcoin for me arouses, in a sense, a sense of excitement.",

This got my interest, Bitcoin made you to be frugal, I'd wish to learn such from Bitcoin as frugality seems difficult to me, but I'll get over it. However, I've never thought of Bitcoin as a vehicle to ride over the problem. Moving forward, Bitcoin thought me to be skillful, when I got into bitcoin I saw lots of opportunities in it other than saving money or investing money. I saw Bitcoin as a means of learning different things. Those days we were advised to learn a skill or two then fit it in on Bitcoin then build from there. Though it wasn't easy but I'm enjoying the ride now.",

Keep the faith, mate, and you'll have enough stories to fill a letter.This is a nearly identical experience, but mine was not during the bear market, so I didn't get to experience the dip as quickly as you did, but experience is the best teacher, and I am glad you are able to learn, and I hope you will continue to learn in this forum.Even though this one has taken a very long time and is getting worse by the day, all our hope is based on our trust in Bitcoin, and this period is like a test, which will also pass one day, and we can both enjoy the profit we will have at the end.",

This has been the practice until Bitcoin gave us financial freedom and offered us an alternative to banks and how we are free to control our financial dealings without any third-party involvement.",
