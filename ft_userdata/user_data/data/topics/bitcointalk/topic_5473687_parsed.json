Some people knowhow to manage their financial life and they do not spend much on things that are not necessary like gambling, but some people just want to make some money from gambling which is the reason they waste money on it. When they realized they can not make money from gambling as gambling is taken more, they will stop the stupid thinking.",

But those who just get carried away with their feelings make unnecessary and risky decisions. You play gambling at the same time you know the risk you can lessen those with proper management of your gambling habit.",

There may be more ways to control yourself well.I usually use restrictions on the amount of money I deposit. If it reaches almost half of the amount of money I deposited, I will stop gambling. I don't think about the outcome of losing or winning. Getting that win was a gift for me that I rarely get.Apart from that, I always use small bets so that if I lose, the loss won't be big immediately. But each person who is able to control themselves has their own method, which will definitely be different from the one we use. Everything aims to ensure that we can control ourselves when gambling.If they still can't control themselves, they have to keep training. Only with practice can they have good self-control. They can prevent bigger losses and will not continue gambling if they have had enough.",

They say it's difficult to fight against oneself, especially when you can't control your emotions. They might ignore this tip or simply brush it off, thinking that there's always the next payday. Perhaps even if you've already replaced the money with the ticket, you still know the value.

And until gamblers understand this then there is no technique that can stop them from gambling or magically convert them to responsible gamblers. Some people take and consider gambling as a full time job lol.  Maybe the above tip could also be helpful to some people but I bet it would be useless to many. The solution I believe would be if the gambler realizes that gamble will always be in favor of the casino and not the gamblers, so then he can change his approach and  emply a better approach.",

What the vulnerable person could do if he runs out of capital in the online casino is take the paper money and go to a real casino. Hahaha.His environment and the people around him will be a very important part of his life to avoid falling into addiction. It's definitely better not to start gambling for those kinds of people.",

But I agree more with the method described by @Solosanz, usually people will stick photos of their parents or children to keep reminding them that there are people they should pay attention to rather than just gambling.Whatever the method, if someone cannot control their habits, all methods will be in vain. I have tried many ways to stop myself from being too ambitious in gambling, but so far I have not been able to stop it after using many methods.",

I agree with your assumption, although there may be a lot of advice that is good enough to make them become responsible gamblers but I don't think it will fully work, in my opinion there are two types of gamblers, and the advice will only apply to those who are still not too far involved in gambling then such advice can be useful for them, but the problem is that on the other hand for gamblers who have entered the addiction phase the advice is very difficult to apply or do. As you said, those who are already addicted are not ignorant about what the best thing to do is, but on the other hand they have a very high curiosity about some of the opportunities that exist in gambling, which ultimately makes them overdo it, whether it's in terms of putting a budget or putting a lot of time into gambling, the point is that they come with the wrong mindset and think that gambling is a place to make money.Satisfaction in terms of achieving results is always their priority, when on the other hand casinos will not be able to provide all of that because of course gambling is basically nothing more than a place of pleasure, but they have misunderstood all that. People who are addicted always want to win more, so of course they often carry a larger budget.",

If you are into gambling for quick money you will always lose control of your gambling behavior. You will always be tempted to stake higher and chase losses if you see it as a source of income. Such reminders will not control gambling disorder because it is caused by an inner drive. If you gambling within your means and have a gambling budget, you don't really need such reminders. Pasting reminders all over your room or on the screen of the computer will do little without a genuine desire to gamble responsibly.But beginners could adopt the pattern maybe it might be effective because you never know until you try.",

It is because of this thought that they cannot accept losing that they continue playing even when they lose little, they put in more money to be able to recover the little money they lost when they started playing, but they lose more money again and with that defeat the money lost becomes a lot. and this makes the person who lost become angrier and put more money in relation to the amount he put in both times, and the purpose is simple: play a lot to win a lot of money and recover the money they lost since they started playing. to playbut the problem with this is that once again the person loses again and even when he wins, he will be making little money. In other words, as long as he puts little money into a large multiplier, he has some chances of getting it right, but the amount he wins will not be enough for him to recover all the money he lost since the beginning of creating an account at the casino. but when he changes and starts placing a larger amount of money in each section, even if it is at a very high multiplier, he will spend many hours playing without winning and when he manages to hit the big one, the value will not compensate for the losses. and as strange as it may seem (I say strange because it would be enough for a person to sit down, remain calm and do some calculations and they would immediately realize that they were losing money and would not be able to beat the house)and this will continue until the person becomes addicted to gambling. It is important that people do not look at profits when gambling, because even if they think they are genius, at the end of the day they will lose money, gambling is not made for profits and get rich quick schemes. I hope people pay attention to this. The ideal is that people always have other things to have fun with in the real world, so they don't always have to think about games",
