I wouldn't buy the story but you guys are good in entering into topics and making people read what you're trying to advertise. I remember some stories on how they've been hacked and that's through joining these type of groups that contains bots on their channels. Just saying....",

However, I wouldn't be interested in a project that I just heard about. Even if I like the concept, I know that the team is good, I see that there is development going on, I will still just keep following the progress of the project to see if they are actually serious about the project or not, and if I really see something good, then I might get involved.I have seen a lot of such projects with great looks, competitive teams, a lot of products and stuff, but all of it just goes in vain after some time because the project doesn't get enough hype and they just can't sustain the developments so they decide to just call it off and let the investors lose money.",

Some people may certainly make a profit by investing sensibly in them, but it's important to be cautious about excessive greed, as it can lead to losses.we should really have confidence in analyzing it as well as possible before making an investment, because without good analysis, it will certainly result in losses over time. I think you are right that investments can make us have no real fear of bitcoin and ethereum. but if you want to try your luck in a bad market situation, it is certainly very risky. But once again, it is up to the individual to determine whether they will continue to invest in the project.But sometimes greed can forget the main goal of every action that will be taken; hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone who wants to invest.",

I can't say it is only already on the hyped but we can't just ignore it either. But must be cautious in dealing with these new projects that are hyped. Though it was admitted that many people earn a lot from joining the hype, however, if we can't sell them in perfect timing, losses are really what we get. Well, I can't definitely say that early birds are safe and have profit assurance but it usually happens that they'll get more than others.",

Is it possible for this massive APY for this new project whose domain was launched on Friday, 8th of September 2023 (12 days)?? Add that there is no information about their bubble token.[2] To check their AI portfolio tracker and to know about new buying and selling, you will find that all the lists have the same values and data. Even the Etherscan links do not exist. They appear as writing only. What else does this indicate, guys?In conclusion, I do not feel comfortable with this project, and what I wrote is enough for me as an investor to avoid it, as there are many excellent and old projects in the market.
