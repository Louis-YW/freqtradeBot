What you say about limiting the winnings because many times people think they are on a winning streak and keep betting, only to end up losing everything they have won and more. They don't realise that when they have won a good amount of money it has been despite the odds being against them, not because of a magical run or anything like that, and that winning against the odds doesn't take long to turn around. If you limit your winnings, maybe you have a lucky break at the beginning and you don't want to leave and you've barely played, you want to entertain yourself. But in any case, setting limits and learning to respect them is fundamental for responsible gambling.",

But increasing your stake because you feel you would keep winning is the blunder most people make. I think one of the best things to do is to have a maximum amount you would bet and stick to it. Even if you have more funds to bet, always ensure that you don't bet above your limits. Another strategy is to move your big winnings to another account immediately after the win and just keep the usual maximum funds in your gambling wallet. With that, the temptation to go above your limit is reduced to a large extent. Whether you are losing or winning it is important to have limits based on your gambling budget or plan. Although it might be difficult, walk out or log out immediately after you reach your limits.",

Does anyone have used similar strategy on winning limits.It's why having limits for losing and winning is a good strategy so that you know that you're still in control regardless of what the outcome will be. If you've hit already your winning limits, it's the wise choice to just stop or set aside what your capital is for that day and continue with the winnings.So whether you win or lose, you've already taken back your capital and you can walkaway only regretting that you've lost your winnings but your entire fund.I have limits for both and if luck is with me, I secure some profits and my capital.",

Dice has a very large limit which is very difficult to exceed so you can play dice as much as you like every day. But I think it is not right to pay too much attention to it because firstly you can make some profit from here but if you get too greedy and stay here for a long time your losses will be high and you will lose all your deposits here. so be carefull",

We gamble together on a gambling sites and we have experienced such in the past. If we win, we wanted to win more which later do bring losses. If you discipline yourself in a way you win little and wait till next time, it would be helpful.

You can go for lower money to gamble and win, then go for higher amount and lose. I remember a friend telling me this, and I have also experienced it several times while gambling in the past until I reduced the way I am gambling and using just the right low amount of money that would let me have good mindset of gambling.",

Now whatever money won from my sessions usually ends up being subtracted from the original amount I'm supposed to deposit for the next session, so it simply gets reduced if I ever have leftovers from my past sessions, which is nice since I can add a bit more to my savings. I don't usually withdraw my winnings, unless it was a pretty sizeable amount. Heck I even sometimes experience the same thing as OP, winning big then losing it later on in the same session.
