Probably, they won’t deal with the result seriously because they will always think that gambling addiction is still good as long as you still control your losses and you still manage your gambling activities. So they don’t have to worry at all. But when time comes that their gambling addiction has come to its worst, wherein they used up all their life savings to chase profits in gambling, that’s the time they will worry on how to control themselves from being addicted from gambling. Btw, I think I don’t have to take the test knowing I’ve never been spending most of my time in gambling, and I can still live my life even without gambling.",

I only spend 20-30 mins a day to analyze and to bet in sports and esports matches2. I always feel excited even I only bet small amount of money3. I did not cut my gambling because I have self control so I'am sure that my thinking is always straight and I always have a good mindset4. There are times that I irritable but I'm aware that it is my own fault because my psychology is not that okay. I always evaluating myself before and after gambling so I'm aware if I did a mistake or I just followed my plan.5. No! My family and my friends are aware that I do gambling, I also share my analysis to them. They are also aware to my skill and to my gambling psychology so they are supportive to me.6. No! I do not multitask whenever I work, I usually bet during morning where my tasks are so light. I never try to bet whenever I'm at work.7. No, but there are some parts of me who want to recover what I lose before8. No! That is the most dumb ways to do whenever you gamble.9. No! Because I'm aware to the risks. I also manage my expectation so that I can never experience financial and emotional disaster even my bet turn into loss. As you can see, most of my answers are connected to mindset, psychology and attitude. I do not gamble without a foundation because I learned from the OGs and I do not want to experienced what they experienced before. I also invested a lot of time for my attitude to be good that can help me to win some money in gambling.",

Then after the results, another long hour of rest until the bookies post the game odds.I have never been in a financial problem too where there is a need to be bailed out just because of it.
