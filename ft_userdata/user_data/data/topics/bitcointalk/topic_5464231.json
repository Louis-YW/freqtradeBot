  "content": "Of lately news has it that Oman the well known Oil rich city  sets aside  a mapped town for Crypto mining for which I strongly believe Bitcoin is not excluded. According to the source, this is the second mining facility set up by the Oman government which costs a whopping sum of $350m and that has so far steered up positive reactions towards the country. Looking at this, I see economic diversification if not why would an oil rich city want to go into Crypto mining. They have seen the future of the new world economy and are beginning to set up something in anticipation so as not to be taken unawares.  With this policy which they have done, I  see giant Crypto mining organisation heading to Oman in the nearest future. This has put the nation in the list of Crypto friendly nations in the world and as such would be generating huge revenue from crypto mining projects and other crypto organisation's that want to establish there as a result of their friendly Crypto policies.If Oman a nation with huge Oil deposit could do such how much more about nations with no natural resources. They have seen the future and are strategically positioning themselves to get the wind towards their direction. sourceThis might just be a good catch for other Oil rich nations to follow up.",

Crypto mining should be spread across multiple small miners(even though I know that this is impossible for Bitcoin).I don't think that this crypto mining facility would make any difference in the crypto mining world. I don't know how all this mining hardware will be cooled down. Oman is a hot country. Perhaps they will have to use air conditioners in order to cool down the mining equipment, which wastes energy, but I guess that they will be using free energy from oil and gas production in order to produce electricity for the crypto mining.",

And some basic factors came to my mind are:1. It will increase the hash power as there will be more competition and the hash power adjust itself after 2 weeks so things might get tricky and not well for miners only.2. And who knows what mindset these mining centers have like if they only mine and keep the reward limited to themselves amid of putting them in the market then the price of BTC will boost up. Otherwise opposite will happen. 3. Transaction speed and security will be increased as more nodes will add into network.",

For obvious reasons. I agree on your point of temperature, while it is not impossible to run those farms in Oman, miners who live in the extremes of the world (Chile, Argentina, USA, Russia, Canada, Greenland...) Certainly see more profitability, since they do not need to spend extra money in super efficient artificial convection machines, fans or coolers.",

I am pretty sure they have amazing location that gives them high supply of oil and thus they are really safe for the generations to come. You never know how the oil wells could get linked with each other from the ground when one empties the other might just get forced into the channels. Anyways, with the time oil is gonna get costly so even if the supply start depleting it's gonna call for the high price tag and they will maintain their repo for very long. I highly doubt country which is that rich will have to mine Bitcoin to keep up with the current status quo. They can have gold, tourism, invest more money on lavish hotels and high risers to make it wonder zone of the world and attract all the dollars to their country. Also, valid point in terms of temperature.",

I am actually looking at the economic aspect of it and the fact that Oman an oil rich city could really have look into Crypto mining business without even thinking about their status at the stance. It shows how smart they are and are swimming in the same direction with the trend of development and innovations. It takes a good, reasonable and listening leader and government to take such step. I believe with this they have done,  it would project Oman in a better position as a Crypto friendly nations and this would likely attract mm more mining organisation there and in possibly Oman would start experiencing traffic flow into their nation and you know what that means to a nations economy.",

They believe, it's the future and indeed it is. Contrarily to that, profits from mining in Asia countries is quite recommended due to low electricity costs, but mining difficulty keeps increasing; surged at around 6.17% at block height 804,384 and nobody can predict how difficult it would get in future. The only difference that I can point out why the Oman Government invest so much into bitcoin mining is what I said above, enlightening her citizen on the importance and future benefits of blockchain technology.",
