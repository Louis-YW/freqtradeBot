If they dumped it all today, they will not be insolvent. It will however make them not trustworthy for doing this. There is no leak to Binance's book yet. Someone should if they can prove they are just swimming naked.",

There is still a chance that Binance will survive, but the trustworthiness is a bit doubtful after the FTX case came out in the media.Leave the exchange for a while, sell some or all of the Binance coins if you have any doubts about their journey ahead, because there is no other way to save the assets we have, it is better to lose some than lose all. But it doesn't look like Binance will suffer the same problems as FTX, even though the suspicion of support from Investors is questionable. If we are really worried, then the step that must be taken is to sell all of these coins, before experiencing problems such as FTX.",

I usually sell to stable coins so that the amount of my money does not decrease even though there is still an intention to buy back when I see conditions start to normal again, or hold on to wait for the next increase to occur in BNB.",

BNB is similar like FTT, it can be easily get manipulated since it's centralized. The price is stick with the exchange popularity and reputation, when the exchange lost it's popularity and reputation, the price of the coin will decrease.I think many people are currently believe in Binance since they think Binance has full power to control the market, but don't forget Binance is centralized exchange, it's same like Mt.Gox and FTX.",

Not only it was much stronger than bitcoin during  bull run it also was much stronger during bear market which is a phenomenon (altcoin that dumped far less than bitcoin durting devastating and long bear market). BTC/BNB price is at ATH. So you are wrong here saying that bnb is loosing value. It hold value the best from whole crypto industry. Answer to questions:1- nothing. We will just have better opportunity to accumulate more2- how much it can dump? The lower the better. How long will binance survive? I don't think that bnb price will affect binance itself.3- The fact that FTX was overleveraged scam that collapsed due to 1 tweet does not mean that binance is weak too. https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/ - 70B founds on hold.4- store coins on self custody wallets and accumulate more",

I think @OP is just over reacting on the price movement due to the fact that CEX is hot in the eyes but the current price downtrend is due to Bitcoin sliding more to the lower lows on the past few days. I don’t see any unusual or anything that can be a red flag for a BNB holders besides for having a normal price downtrend due to the general market sentiment. I’m holding few BNB on my wallet too but I’m not that nervous no matter how much it dump because I know Binance is the top exchange. CZ has lot of funds to place a liquidity for a price support. I doubt that he will allow BNB to lose value and failed like FTT since this is his arsenal.",
