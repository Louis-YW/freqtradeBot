  "content": "Friends, I will solve your problems with privacy and anonymity on the Internet.Only high-quality VPN configs - WIREGUARD and OPENVPN. I can also do personal socks5.Why my VPN ?- private config (1 person - 1 config - 1 vds) - not public VPN- fast VPN speed- many countries- unique IP- no credit card information needed- no registration, no adsExtreme protection:- Disable WebRTC, no VPN  fingerprint, no defining tunnel (two way ping), no DNS leak, no IPv6, no logs.- I do not cooperate with the government and secret service.- I delete VDS with your config after a month of use. No trace. If you want to continue, you get a new VDS and config in the same location.GEO (all the countries listed are quickly available):US ZA CA IR UK FR DE IT SE BH UAE JP KR SG AU BR ID and many many other. The list of countries is constantly expanding.I can make different countries by pre-order. Now, compare my proposal with the public VPN  (NordVPN , Expressvpn, IPVanish and other)  :-  ALL public VPNs log your activity (whatever they says)-  Dirty pubic IP used by many people-  Speed or bandwidth limitations-  Many public VPN services cooperate with the government and intelligence services-  Financial footprint of your payment-  Limited choice of countriesNo comments ((Choose freedom and privacy !!!- Get access to sites that are blocked or censored. - You can disguise your IP address to hide your  identity while surfing the Internet.- Protect your data when connected to public WiFi Payment method :Only Crypto (BTC/ETH/LTC/BNB/USDT/TRC20/BUSD/USDC  and other cryptocurrency)Price:1 account/month = 10$30 DAY REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE. Contact me:Telegram: https://t.me/profihunter",
