  "content": "(Disclaimer: I'm an advanced user but not really a wallet software expert.)Due to the privacy limitations of SPV wallets like Electrum and Sparrow, in the case you use them connecting to public servers, I would like to know if there is a SPV wallet which does only rely on other nodes/servers to download block headers and certain groups of blocks to verify transactions myself, without sharing data like transaction IDs or addresses. Basically a client supporting BIP-157 (as ETFBitcoin wrote below) or a similar technique.The use case* is the following:Let's imagine I know (or I have stored) the times I should have sent or received payments. At least, I should know when I have created my wallet and in which years I was using it.So the idea is to download (apart from the complete block header list) only the blocks in the periods I'm interested, and search for transactions involving my keys/addresses in them. (The correctness of the blocks depends on the source of my block header list of course, so minimal trust would still be required.)The idea is that this way I could achieve a much higher level of privacy than with solutions like Electrum and Sparrow, which seem to share much more information with servers, for example address lists, so they're much less private. While the storage/bandwidth requirements would be much less than of a full node.I believe the Monero app Feather works approximately this way (although without the possibility to select the blocks you need yourself).Does something like this exist also for Bitcoin? (I haven't found something similar at bitcoin.org ...)*I'm here not looking for a unspecific solution for a \"personal\" use case, for example cheap ways to run a full node, or a pruned node. The idea of this thread is to list solutions that exist for the technology mentioned in the topic title, so that users searching for a better SPV solution also benefit from the thread.",

I'll take a look.Quote from: LoyceMobile on June 29, 2023, 07:53:51 PMSo, basically, you're looking to add fake data to your address to hide which ones are yours. This could more or less be accomplished by adding other addresses to a watch only Electrum wallet.Not exactly. That could still be used for chain analysis, unless you really add tens of thousands of addresses (and then I think it would become a laggy monster). I think the approach to download and verify blocks myself is more private.Quote from: LoyceMobile on June 29, 2023, 07:53:51 PMBut isn't it much easier to use Electrum over Tor?Of course, and that is also my current solution  However, I'm looking for something a bit better  Basically some intermediate step between \"classic SPV\" and \"(pruned) Core\".",

      "body": "The problem with your idea is its practicality otherwise it is pretty trivial to implement. Normally you don't know when exactly you've received bitcoin and when exactly you've spent those coins. Even knowing a range is not going to help much because you'd have to download roughly 6 blocks per hour or 144 blocks per day which is high enough for a light client.Quote from: d5000 on June 29, 2023, 07:31:46 PMSo the idea is to download (apart from the complete block header list) only the blocks in the periods I'm interested, and search for transactions involving my keys/addresses in them. (The correctness of the blocks depends on the source of my block header list of course, so minimal trust would still be required.)There is no trust needed, just knowing that you are on the correct chain which is easy to do. You basically have to play around in the net_processing part of bitcoin core:Step 1:Initial connection is the same as a full node, fetching a list from seed nodes and building a listening node IP address database for future usages using the getaddr and addr messages.Step 2:Exactly as a full node, start by downloading the blockheader list from the hard-coded Genesis block to the tip from multiple different nodes with enough distance that makes it safe. You can also add hard-coded checkpoints to add an additional verification for the \"map\" of the chain you are downloading.You can also do full verification on these headers just like a full node does (SPV clients should also do this). The verification includes version verification, PoW verification using the header hash and the shortened target in the header, difficulty verification with the target and finally time verifications.The network messages involved are: version+verack (handshake), sendheaders, getheaders, and ping pong messages.Step 3:Now that you have a \"map\" of the whole blockchain use the time field in the headers to select the block(s) you want to download then send a getdata message (with the inventory set to block type and the hash(es) of the block(s) you want to download) to any full node from your connection list to download the full block from that node.Then you can perform a limited verification on the block you received to make sure it is \"correct\". The important ones are deserializing and merkle root hash. This way you make sure all the transactions in the block you requested are received correctly and are associated with the header you requested. Here we rely on PoW and SHA256 both being secure.Step 4:Now that you have a block that you are sure is \"correct\" with the trust you put in the PoW, you can go through the inputs and outputs of each tx to see which one belongs to you and update your balance accordingly.",

How about incoming transactions, do not you want to keep blocks which confirms validity of your inputs?Well at least Feather (afaik!) works quite simple: You set a start date for your wallet (when it was created or when the first transaction was done) and then all blocks after that one are verified (i.e. downloaded and validated) but only the important data is kept on disk. I would like to have a little bit finer-grained control, for example if I know that in some period in the middle I didn't receive nor sent transactions, I wouldn't have to download these blocks, so I don't waste bandwidth I don't need. BIP 157 seems to provide that. I think it wouldn't even be necessary to store entire blocks (those with the transactions), the relevant part of the merkle tree may be enough.In Feather everything works smooth even downloading all blocks from the start date, something you have to wait a bit but in general it is of little issue. However, one has to take obviously into account that Bitcoin blocks are larger than Monero blocks (the difference is abysmal, XMR blocks seem to have only 15-400 kB, while BTC's are ~2-4 MB), so the verification time everytime you launch the app would be much higher.",

As for the needed data, maybe it is enough with only store block data for blocks where a prior query found a transaction to/from the wallet addresses.I was able to install the official Neutrino implementation by Lightning Labs now but there seems to be no way to run it as a standalone app. For a short moment I even thought of \"abusing\" lnd (which does run using neutrino as a kind of \"lib\"). But then I found the Bitcoin-s project, it seems to be a little bit more advanced in the direction I'm looking for, although its Neutrino support seems to be experimental and doesn't have an active mempool. I'll try to install this one, and write here about my experiences",
