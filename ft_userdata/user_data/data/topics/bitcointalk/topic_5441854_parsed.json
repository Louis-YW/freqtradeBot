There is a game called \"crash\", you should read about it, in my opinion is very entertaining and one of the most exciting games one can find in online gambling, because it offers you the chance to \"easily\" double your money or even multiply it for thousands times, but it also has the chance to make you lose, of course. only the premise of the game is exciting and not for the faint of heart   , that is one of the main reasons people gamble, OP. You can check it out here, if you want:https://stake.com/casino/games/crash",

Most of the people here engaged to gambling simply because of the belief that this is a way to be rich. Well, indeed there are really people who made fortune out of gambling such as with lotteries but unfortunately, it is quite 1:1000000 probability for an individual to be in such situation. More players are losing; let us face the truth. But for players, the slightest chance is enough for them to believe that the one of a million individual could be them.Money is that powerful but never the root of all evil; it is one's intention. Money could almost give you everything which makes it an enough reason to take risks or to simoly gamble their fate. Who doesn't want to be rich anyway? Also if there is an \"easy\" way to do so, why not? These ideas are simply pulling people towards this industry. And we just cannot stop it that simple. It takes one's initiative to do so whether to engage or not.",

When you think about it who would talk about stories/people who just had fun playing a couple of rounds and depositing like 50€ weekly, whilst having a good financial background? That would be a boring story",

If you're a gambler and want to minimize your lose, it's better if you gamble on sports where you can't constantly keep gambling.",

And I would say that it is mainly the money that attracts people, the entertainment is a side effect, not something you look for when you first decide to gamble. Eventually when you know what it's all about, you can dedicate a small part of your budget to gambling as many of us do, partly for entertainment and partly because you have a chance of making some money that week. Quote from: uche6215 on March 02, 2023, 01:57:20 PMHowever, in my observation, I found out that most people go into gambling because they think that's the easiest way to make big money. To this I would add that this is what people think, but it's not very easy to hit a big jackpot, and usually by the time people hit it they've already spent more money than they got out of it, if you take into account all the sessions. 99.99% of gamblers lose money in their lifetime if you add up everything they bet and everything they win. Another thing to add is that they are looking to make a lot of money with little effort, because setting up a successful business or having a very well paid salaried job and building up their wealth through savings and investment requires a much greater effort than gambling on slots or other games.",

You just answer your own question to be honest. That might be one of the factors but I think there's a lot of it and it differs from individuals because others might say it's about the money, the others will say it's about the joy they get while gambling, there's no definite answer to it. One more thing, it's not the easiest way to make money, it's likely the opposite and it's to lose money.",

A friend of mine who was working in a radio ststion, he gambles also. He gambles after work. He bought a toyota corolla with the money he made from gambling. People gamble after work or businesses or in their free time as it gives them relief from stress. People also gamble for entertainment reason because they love the wining feelings.

This is the number one reason why people gamble and the minority is just gambling just to have fun during their vacation or day-off from job like me. Gambling offers an instant win to your money which you can’t get on any investment platform that’s why most of the gamblers are those who have a short patience. This is the reason why the majority of gamblers loss because they are playing reckless just to have quick profit.",

Always remember, the house will always win. That means the gambling platform already have the upper hand against you. What you want to do is lessen that by playing wisely. You can try poker games where usually it's a battle of players and casinos just take a part of the whole pot for maintenance and the venue.Sports betting is also a good idea, many gamblers have stories about winning here more than casino games like Blackjack, slots, dice, etc...In my case, I pick both poker (back when I still have time to go to the venue and before the pandemic) and sports betting. I can somehow increase the chance to win although losses cannot be prevented. Just enjoy the added excitement provided by betting on your favorite sports and you will definitely not think about it's all just for making money.",

Please is it true? That's not entirely true. -snipI think by means that it was easiest, It’s simply because you will have a chance to win big with just one lucky bet compared if you do an investment which will require you a lot of time and effort just to earn big. Easiest way to win and lose at the same time to be exact. Betting all-in money is not hard. The only hard part is accepting the consequences if you lose the bet. So technically gambling is really an easy method to have a possible huge win.",

The way gambling is now structured it's not in any way meant to make anyone rich, and people that understands this idea that the gambling companies aren't charity homes have taken gambling to be just a leisure activity for fun, and time cruising subject even as they are careful not to loss their themselves financially into it. Coming to your observation of people engaging into gambling cause they see it as easiest way to make big money, I think people with such perspective towards gambling are a lazy-poor sets of persons and the truth is gambling is just a game of luck entirely, it doesn't promise wealth.",

IMO the reason people start gambling varies from person  to person and influenced by the nature of the environment the person is. People who stay in an area where Casino houses are like major businesses and they are built in a way that people visit to relax, and have fun playing games. People who start gambling in this area are usually attracted to it because it is seen as a fun activity. In other areas where the economy is not so good and people are looking for ways to make extra money, their decision to begin gambling will largely be influenced by the thought of making money.",
