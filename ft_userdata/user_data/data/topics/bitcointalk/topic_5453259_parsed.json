      "body": "Well that's a valuable lesson to learn and Im very sorry for your loss. Unfortunately you are not the first victim of the BetFlip scam casino and also there will likely be more victims unless they are shut down. It's surprising that such casinos can still obtain licenses and with many reports nothing really happens.In situations like this it's important to make a simple Google search to get help contacting other people that been scammed and fill a report or share your experience to warn others. One platform I highly recommend for honest reviews and information about casinos is casino.guru as they have listed BetFlip as a scam casino [1].If you have been scammed out of a significant amount of money i advise you to report your incident to the authorities. However if the loss was small it should be as a valuable lesson to always conduct thorough research before making any deposits in the future.[1] : https://casino.guru/betflip-casino-review",

I don't think anyone sensible here uses it,Look at their Trustpilot. 63% are negative 1-star reviews https://www.trustpilot.com/review/betflip.io",

We have to report them to the NameCheap registrar so that their domain is restricted.",

All it took was one google search to see that they are VERY SHADY.Sorry of what happened to you but that's the pay that you'll have to do if you do the same mistake of just googling casinos to gamble with. It won't take a lot of time for researching before entrusting them with your money. And with all of those links given by other members on how skethcy they were, that's more than enough that you don't have any chance of getting back your money. IIRC, I've seen them make a bounty before in the forum years ago but didn't know that they're turned to the other side of scamming people.Quote from: hulkybeats on May 19, 2023, 12:35:04 AMThey're registered on Namecheap.
