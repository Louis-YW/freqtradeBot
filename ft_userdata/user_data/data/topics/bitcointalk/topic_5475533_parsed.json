It is not clear to me what you are proposing to improve the system with that analogy you make. I think it is another of your trolling to fulfill your posting requirements.",

      "body": "So you can't give the solution instead asking theymos or Cyrus to think about it?I think they don't care with that, you need to check the feedback on theymos's profile, he received one negative feedback from Vod. I'm not really know about the case and not interested to read the whole drama, but I guess it because of perspective. Theymos think he's correct while the Vod think he's correct, so it's what it's.I believe theymos think he's wrong (that's why he distrust Vod), but he don't mind with the tag even though he has a power to make any user out from DT.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=35VodÂ Â Â 2023-11-11Â Â Â ReferenceÂ Â Â The community caught OGNasty stealing community coins. Theymos awarded him for this theft, and still trusts and pays him.I feel like isn't it kind of censorship? if there's a core/consensus, it means when there are 5 users left positive feedbacks and 2 users left negative feedbacks, that user isn't a scammer since he has +3 trusts?",

      "body": "What are you proposing? As I read what your have in OP and you other post, I did not understand what you are proposing What are you proposing?I like how the trust system has been, I wonder how theymos was able to come to the idea used to make up to trust system. The trust system is also doing a good work and it is in a way that no admin or moderator or staff have control over unless there is something absurd going on. Regardless of what you are proposing, just see this as a waste of time, although your campaign manager will pay for it, but the trust system is good as it is.",

      "body": "Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 06:18:08 AM1- when you accuse a DT2, his DT1 voters threaten and leave feedback for same reasons. That's a violation of the rights of accuser or not?It is only the accuser that can make a case to vindicate himself which in most cases doesn't work, especially when DTs are in agreement about that particular case.Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 06:18:08 AM2- how many times you can leave trust feedback for a single reason? If I trade and get positive trust, is it allowed for 3-4 people to give me the same positive trust for the same trade with someone else? If I have a successful trade with you, only your account is expected to drop me a positive trust and not random people. However, if others do, there shouldn't be a problem. I have read where theymos mistakenly sent a newbie $1k worth of bitcoin, the newbie refunded and got positive feedback by many people.What I thought you would have complained is a DT member giving more than 1 negative trust for same reason. In order to make so many negative feedbacks appear on the victims account.Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 06:18:08 AM3- can we also send positive trust for a trade we did 5-6 years ago and encourage others to do the same for 1 account we like so much to pump it's reputation?No, only send a positive feedback because of a current event. Accounts change hands and even people at some points turn scammers. Giving a positive feedback based on past events will be detrimental to the community.Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 06:18:08 AM4- can we repeatedly and excessively complement our friend on several threads over and over again, or is that spamming? If your friend did something good, there's no limit to complimenting him. It will breed good behaviour. Maybe others who are envious of the complements will try to behave well in order to be complemented also.Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 06:18:08 AM5- can we beg people to let us give them positive trust because we like them so much and when they agreed, is it Ok to do that?I don't think this happens. It should be someone who is receiving the position feedback that will beg for it and not the reverse. However, I do not see a place for begging in the trust feedback.Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 06:18:08 AM6- can we use our influence to persuade others to keep blatantly accusing a few members for spreading lies, scamming, trolling, without providing evidence, and should that happen, is there any punishment for such wrongful accusations?This is against the system. Although there is no ideal system. But if you find such behaviour, you can call the persons involved out.",

      "body": "Quote from: digaran on November 26, 2023, 03:59:03 AMTo keep it short, trust system works well, but there are so many forked clients, and some of us have not enough hash power to mine a block on reputation cases, it rarely happens, and DTs (pools, solo miners) are wandering about a solution.The rules of Bitcoin are that the chain with the highest Proof Of Work is the main chain to follow after fork instead of the the longest chain with the greatest number of consecutive blocks.By the way, I hope it's okay to ask this question because it really intrigues me. This question is not exclusively for you but I'll use the chance and ask you: You have a negative feedback on your profile. Do you believe that you were tagged wrongfully? If yes, then do you think people who check reference, will understand that you are right? For example, if I have to deal with someone, I always check their profile and if someone has negative trust, I just check the reason to understand whether that negative trust was left without valid proofs or not, i.e. I don't 100% trust how others judge things.I also think that trust system on this forum works as it should work and to be honest, I can't understand how some people lost like their life depends on this trust system.",
