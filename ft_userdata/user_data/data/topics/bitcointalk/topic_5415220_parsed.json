  "content": "New electrum version is released. No major updates though, more were bugs fixing. Check the release notes for more info.Quote from: electrum / Release Notes * When creating new requests, reuse addresses of expired requests   (fixes #7927). * Index requests by ID instead of receiving address. This affects the following commands: get_request, get_invoice, list_requests, list_invoices, delete_request, delete_invoice * Trampoline routing: remember routes that have failed. Try other routes instead of systematically raising tampoline fees. * Fix sweep to_local output from channel backup (#7959) * Harden build script for macOS binary: avoid using   precompiled wheels from PyPI for most packages (#7918) * The Windows/AppImage/Android binaries are now built on debian using the snapshot.debian.org archive instead of ubuntu. This should help with historical reproducibility. (#7926)Download the app here[1] don't forget to verify signature though.[1] https://electrum.org/#download",
