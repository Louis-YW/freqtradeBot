  "content": "It's a very sad situation that we've gotten to a point where we've accepted so many wrong practices in our society and we just get used to it with time neglecting the danger that awaits us as a result of our carelessness.We are in a situation where the police have reduced themselves so low that the only thing they are interested in is to extort money from drivers on the road and look for youths they will abuse just to extort money from them.I normally don't allow their unguided activity within the state to bother me that much but when I look at what is happening in our interstate borders, I can't just hold back on how disgusting it is and the possibility that our borders with another country might be facing similar situations.You find a situation where police that is supposed to safeguard travelers and ensure that illegal stuff is not brought into the state focus just on the  2h they will take from drivers and once the driver gives them the money, they allow him to pass without conducting any reasonable search on the vehicle and passengers. And you will see regular steeling happening on the same road with nothing less than 20 checkpoints. There are times you will get to some checkpoint and the police will be the one telling you that robbery is happening at the front and that you should wait. It's a shame.I had an experience where one of them was telling one of our fellow passengers to give him money so he would not search the man. Some will even search only the males and allow the females to remain in the vehicle, abi na only males de carry illegal stuff? Even during the covid when the borders were ordered to be locked, the only thing they started doing was to increase The amount of money one pays at each checkpoint to 500h and then they would allow you to freely pass to another state.Sadly, we take serious matters for granted in this country. Mind you, this is my personal experience in our interstate borders, I haven't gone to our borders with other countries but if this is what is obtainable there, then we are in a very big mess.",

      "body": "Police brutality is a perennial problem that have defied all solutions.  I don't see anything changing about that because \"Nigerians don't react to anything \" as former governor of Rivers State, RCA put it. Who would have imagined that we will still contend with police harassment after the 2020 Endsars struggle!The issue is even worse in Southern Nigeria. To move from Rivers State to Akwa Ibom State, there are more than 20 checking points. From Rivers State to Imo State is even higher.  This is not the same in Northern Nigeria.  Until we have a complete institutional overhauling of the system, nothing will change. Make we just dey careful how we move and ensure you don't pick calls near checking points to avoid police wahala. Also mind the kind of information you keep in your phone when travelling.",

All this kind of topics dem no need to use English take write dem make we no go gbolo our cover, like this na cast we just dey cast our country for others \" no be say na our own bad pass oo\" and e nor good. Apart from sending bad signal to tourist, like this u don sell useful information give people wey get bad intention like kidnapping, robbery and drug trafficking, I go advise make u for translate this topic to pidgin.To the topic info, omor our olokpa dem dey fuvk up, only dem naim use their mouth say bail is free but that una big lie, when dem been arrest my brother because of mass arrest activity wey dem been carry out, in the morning wey we go to bail am na 25k we pay before dem release am.",
