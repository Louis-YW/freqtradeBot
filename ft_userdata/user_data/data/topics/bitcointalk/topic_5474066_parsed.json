  "content": "We had thousands of broken image links after Imgur stopped working on the forum. Many users have replaced their old links and migrated to other services, like TalkImg. But there are still many images to fix. I didn't do anything with my old Imgur images until two days ago when I decided to try TryNinja's Imgur to TalkImg script. Everything has been corrected now.Because it's so easy to use and fully automated, I figured I should create this thread that we can use to tag active Bitcointalk members we find who still have broken Imgur images in their posts. It will help to clean up the forum and make it look better. Most users use a notifications bot nowadays, so a simple @username should do the trick and make them aware of this topic.TryNinja explains how to work with the script here: [Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images. Please read it.You will find the code for the script in his OP, but here it is again for reference: https://gist.github.com/ninjastic/36c14fb2eb1c4b750f40f332d408688fAlways verify and compare the provided link above to see if it's the same as in TryNinja's topic before you use it!Simple how-to guide:The code goes through your entire post history, finds Imgur links, uploads the images to TalkImg, and edits your posts with the new links. The script doesn't require your forum login data, and you don't have to edit the code in any way (unless you want to) for it to work. Modifying the code to fix images from other image hosts is possible if needed. In my example, I had some pictures on vgy.me that were deleted.  1. Copy the codebase from the official gist.github link. The link is provided above.2. Open any Bitcointalk forum page.3. Click F12 or right-click with your mouse and select 'Inspect' to open the Developer Tools window.4. Click on the 'Console' tab, which you can find between 'Elements' and 'Sources'.5. Paste the code from gist.github and click enter. The code won't work at the moment without applying the fix as mentioned in this post.6. Let it work until it reaches 100%. Don't use the forum for browsing and posting during the image upload process to avoid issues.If you have questions or run into problems, please post them in TryNinja's topic > [Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images.   Please don't PM users and bother them about their broken image links. You never know if someone might react negatively and report you for PM spam for whatever reason. Just mention their username and tag them here; if they want, they will respond. If not, give it up and don't bother them anymore.Use any message you want. Here is an example that I will start with.Quote@insert username here,Please fix your broken Imgur images by using the automated script that TryNinja created. Check below for more information and how to use the script.[Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken imageshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452662.0Tag a user to update their broken image linkshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5474066.0I would like to thank TryNinja for creating the script and joker_josue for TalkImg!",

I didn't do anything with my old Imgur images until two days ago when I decided to try TryNinja's Imgur to TalkImg script. Everything has been corrected now.~Well, I partially agree with your suggestion of fixing it \"manually\". I wish to have it fixed automatically. Although we have been waiting for theymos to take some action, it looks like 'Do Nothing' has been selected, which I also agree with.Tagging someone and requesting them to fix the broken images is a good idea, but it would be better if we tag and share the link to the particular post/topic that has broken images.For example, I want @Hamza2424 to fix the broken images in the posts https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232519.msg61568821#msg61568821.That's why I love TryNinja's \"Single Topic\" version.This is the simplest and fastest solution to broken images. It will not update any of your old posts that you don't want to be touched. It will stay on a single page, and only the posts on that particular page will be updated.Quote from: TryNinja on May 17, 2023, 10:36:34 PM\"Single Topic\" versionGet the code here: https://gist.github.com/ninjastic/59bde80306c32153a5775b9a570b16b7Run it on any topic and all images posted by you will be updated.IMPORTANT: only images that are shown on the screen! This means that if you are on page 1, the script won't update the images on page 2. You can use the ;all page on the forum to make all posts show up all at once (probably won't work properly if the topic is huge?).",
