There are much better coins for trading, especially the listing on only two, to put it mildly, not the best exchanges, where the liquidity is low, the trading volume is only $50,000. An experienced trader would never try to speculate on such a low liquidity coin.",

(-99.6% from epic marketcap)https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aditus/You are correct that risk free doesn't exist. However the chances of BTC or Ethereum with marketcaps in the high billions and a track record of being deflationary in the last decade, I see the risk as being extremely low if you have the time to wait the cycle.Altcoins with low marketcaps and low utility are more akin to gambling than trading. Yes you can make 1000x if you are lucky but (unless I'm mistaken) there's no good way to know which ones will succeed.Also never risk 100%.",

So with this project, they need first to survive the bear market and if they are able to do so we might see them rising and reaching a new peak again. x1000 profit is hard to find, usually a hyped and new project can able to achieve it but there’s still no guarantee that they will remain on that position, it can be a manipulated pump so be very careful.",

And with the addition of those replies above me, we can't be sure about what's going to happen in this coin in the future so if you want a better investment choose Bitcoin or Ethereum instead since it has been proven a lot of time that these coins will give you a good profit.",

Epic has done a 50x, over last 2 yearsAnd why do you think that this is an argument for its prospects and investment attractiveness? Yes, the project brought its early investors a profit, I will not argue, but that absolutely does not mean that if it was profitable in the past, it will bring the same profit in the future. Do you want to dispute that statement? If so, you can try to buy projects like LUNA, for example. This project brought its investors more than x70 profit last year, but is that a reason to buy it now? I think the answer is obvious.I always look at a project in terms of present numbers, not past or future numbers. What do we have at the moment? The project has low liquidity, the project for 2 years and was not able to reach the major trading floors. These are the main criteria by which I can say that investing in this project is very risky.Quote from: Cryptomiles1 on June 26, 2022, 05:59:00 PM@Xal0lex Have been and experienced trader for a long time now and he knows what he is saying over the market.

In the sense that I don't trade altcoins  I am convinced that altcoins reveal their potential when investing, not when trading. In trading, people often sell their coins cheaply, which over time become more valuable, and there is a great risk of losing everything altogether.",
