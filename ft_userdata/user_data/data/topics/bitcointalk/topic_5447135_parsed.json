If you can't provide KYC to them and they're not accept to return back your deposit amount to your address, it's not a Duelbits' fault because they're don't have any obligation to accept your request!You have two option, KYC in order to withdraw your $1,100 or don't KYC and leave your funds, there's nothing should be discussed anymore.",

You are using the casino for a long time with that amount of money and expecting to become a KYC free user for a long time despite they have an AML policy?Duelbits always pay and they can’t refund any balance that already deposit in the casino because your account is already subjected to KYC. This is clearly stated on the ToS and everyone here is aware about the potential KYC to all users that using their services. There’s a lot of case like this in the past and you will not gonna recover the funds unless you do KYC.",

Online casinos, just like any other enterprise, hold the authority to solicit KYC information whenever necessary. It is not irrational for them to request such data to deter fraudulence and money laundering. Furthermore, we must acknowledge the political and regulatory consequences of online gambling. It is imperative to verify that these platforms are properly licensed and regulated to safeguard consumers and preclude illegal activities.",

Also its really better for anyone to read the TOS of each gambling site they want to gamble so that we can clarify all the possibilities and we will not get surprised if KYC is been ask since nowadays submitting this information became normal to reputable online casino.

Did you make any bets on the site?Are you really unable to do KYC? If you accept and send the necessary documents you can get your money back.Try to explain to them as best as you can, without accusations, and at this point I think you'll need to do the KYC and in my opinion it's worth. Duelbits has to follow the rules imposed against money laundering and other illegalities.",

Some of the old and reputable casino is now doing mandatory KYC on all their existing players like Roobet. I won’t blame them because that’s what the law requires in able for them to operate.I don’t see the point of resisting KYC policy of the casino while they don’t force user to deposit and play their services. It’s the user own negligence for ignoring the rules after creating their account.I’m Duelbits user too and KYC verified because I always withdraw and deposit my balance whenever I finish playing. This is normal reaction from a casino since this is the typical sign of money laundering but ofc I’m not committing.",

I think duelbits will not ask you to complete KYC if you wager enough money after your deposit. You are asked to do KYC because your action is considered as suspicious, and I'm sure you will get the same experience in all casino.",
