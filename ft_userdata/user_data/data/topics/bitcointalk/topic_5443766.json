      "body": "OP, if the token is locked until 9th May 2023, then that's not collateral since you are seeking a 4-week loan... probably up to 6th April from today. This is a very high risk for lender.Firstly, if I understand well, the token is locked in an account bound to a platform that can vanish overnightSecondly, There are very high chances of a rug pull. You know, this has been very common.",
