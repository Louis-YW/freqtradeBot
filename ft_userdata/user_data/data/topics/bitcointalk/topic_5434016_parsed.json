I mean they probably have them separated for inventory/shipping purposes but if I have one of each, how can I tell without opening them?",

So have moved my few sats to them, still keeping my coins offline  I did like the KeepKey at the start, but it was less desirable when the Chrome app was stopped and we were forced to use ShapeShift to access the wallet.",

I hate it, when a crucial software is discontinued. Happend with older ledgers, too. They want you to buy their new stuff, but not interested in a fancy HW wallet with 32 bit color screen in full-HD. The less complex the better.",
