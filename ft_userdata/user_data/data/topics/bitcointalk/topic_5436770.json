I bet that would be more valuable than asking spammers to spam your trust rating on random websites with positive compliments unless that's what you want.

Personally, I'm more familiar with the other project, hence why I said they feel like a copycat considering both of them offer a similar service (exchange) if you don't look closely. I don't think rebranding is such an issue if it can avoid such negative perception, but of course it is probably not a priority if your service is not even running properly.",

Did you get all the problems and they solved them?Also, speed is not what makes the exchange good or not, perhaps because your transaction was BUSD on the Binance network so it was completed quickly, but the speed does not have to be the same on all networks.Of course, speed and support are good things in the exchange, but there are more important things. In the first place there is trust, and then comes privacy (do they ask for KYC, do they ban you based on IP...etc)",

I exchanged BUSD into my QIWI wallet at a good exchange rate.Respect.If I didn't look at your post history, I'd thought you are a paid poster to boost this exchange. Since you said this is the best exchange, mind giving some examples of how they compare to other platforms? What comparison did you use to judge them? The support part is definitely interesting since most instant exchanges don't really offer reliable support. Heck, even big exchange fails to provide reasonable responses in most cases.As mentioned above, speed is not the only factor that counts. I used many instant exchanges in the past and most of them are quite fast, but does that mean I'd recommend them to most users? Not really. Most of them rely on other parties which can flag you with a KYC anytime. Not to mention there is no reliable way to protect your funds in case they run away. In fact, if they don't offer speed, nobody would use them. A fast order speed is mandatory for a service like this, since they compete with decentralized exchanges, or to some extent centralized exchange which offers better reliability.",
