What has sometimes caused problems with Bitcoin for some time is its high transaction fees. Sometimes trading in Bitcoin becomes a difficult matter due to its extra transaction fees but apart from all this Bitcoin is definitely complete. If there was a problem with Bitcoin or if some of it had to be removed then there wouldn't be so many people around the world using Bitcoin or the popularity of Bitcoin would not have increased over time. Bitcoin is growing in popularity and will continue to grow in the future so if we are developers then we don't need to remove anything from Bitcoin or add anything new to Bitcoin.",

This will be purely for educational purposes so those who for any reason cannot run a node will be able to learn how it works without having to download the entire chain. This will bring bitcoin closer to home and show people that it is not too complicated or at least all of it is not.The goal will be to encourage more users to take the step and run their own nodes, contributing to how decentralized the network is.That is what I will do on the side, as the main course, I will create a fully decentralized system that is as immune to regulation as bitcoin is. This will replace other services that are being dominated by centralization like exchanges and mixers. This makes it much easier to stay private and not have to choose between decentralization and efficient service.I know this is not adding anything to Bitcoin directly, but that is because there is mighty little one can add, all we are left with is to create efficient, censorship resistant channels and we are not doing so well now.",

But I guess there is a lot of opposition. These recent developments are increasing the use case of Bitcoin, and these protocols have a lot of transactions every day. Miners are making money from those transactions. So, If I could set the fee limit, I Would set it lower than 20 sat/vb and see how it works. I do not have problems with the Runes and the BRC-20 tokens as long as they do not bother the mempool and the fees.",

This would be what I will first prefer to do, making bitcoin transaction fee to the low almost all the time. This should be done in a way that those bitcoin tokens will not even affect it.In a short term this looks to me as a very good proposal but on a long term basis this proposal might have to be revised again because after mining might have ended then the only incentive left for miners will be transaction fee. With 10sat/vbyte and the current limited block size it will certainly too small to call an incentive and would discourage miners to continue mining most especially with the amount spent on the mining rigs and electricity, which will reduce decentralization. . Although if some miners stop mining then it will actually reduce the power (hashrate) needed to mine and could potentially increase attacks like that of 51% attack.

I will like to have the block size still the same like this but have transactions(UTXO) on them having lesser weight, yes I know itâs what Segwit is about both I will need it to lower again than just separating the witness alone. The UTXO method seems perfect but will like transactions on an address be a single UTXO no matter how many individuals transactions sent to that address.Also would like a proposal that inscriptions or itâs likes if not removed then should only occupy a certain amount of space in the block like Just 20%.",

This should be done in a way that those bitcoin tokens will not even affect it.I agree with you because high transaction fees is one of the key factor militating against bitcoin adoption in many spheres. The few days Bitcoin transaction fee remained very low have been very exciting for people to continue their transaction without the pain of paying stupendous fees for minor business transactions. If there is any way to keep the fee very low, that will really encourage more Bitcoin adoption in businesses. The challenge of this will only be if mining will be profitable becauseÂ  setting a limit for memepool might require adjusting the mining difficulty in order to keep the business profitable.",

Haha first of all I would love to add my name to Bitcoin's development contributors list, secondly, on the Bitcoin network, I would first add an FCFS-based transaction processing system regardless of how high a fee a particular transaction signer is paying to process his transaction. Hmm, I had already discussed this previously somewhere but seems like I'm still unsatisfied and want to know more why if it was implemented they removed it.To achieve more efficiency let's split it into segments one for fee payers, one a regular random processing, and one based on FCFS, and these 3 segments should be processed in parallel.Haha, just a random bluff never mind, well I will explain more if anyone wants to know with some technical terms as well, In the removal area I would love to remove the shity ordinals in order to achieve a more reliable system.",
