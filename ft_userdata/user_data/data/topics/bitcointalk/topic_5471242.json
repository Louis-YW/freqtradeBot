  "content": "I would like to appeal to the honorable moderators gmaxwell and achow101 why they marked my report bad (although I doubt they'll answer me)?Plagiarism report on this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471024After all, this guy FbnGbz got scared and edited his post after I posted my plagiarism report here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1926895.msg63025525#msg63025525Initially there was no link to the source. You can check it in Ninjastic https://ninjastic.space/post/63025407I'm not crying over this bad report. I realize that one bad report doesn't mean anything, but excuse me, it's a shame when an obviously correct report is flagged as bad. And the moderators didn't want to look into it, they saw that there was a link to the source (after my report) and just marked the report as bad. It's not right.",

      "body": "I can't just judge everything within my power rather than to say that if a report is marked as bad then we (you) should know that it doesn't reached their evaluation standard as I can believe that before plagiarism can be marked as bad or seen as violation they have to check it properly and if not worth it then they can see it as bad or if the poster later realized and include source link then I don't see any reason to get such person penalized for plagiarism. But well let's see how they justify it from their ends as I believe that the above mentioned body may come to reply here or any other staff. Please note that I am not taking support on any side rather giving my own view based on what you posted.",

What benefit would I have in blindly copying other's?! Fine. I'll have a post up on Reddit where I'll mention my username here, as well as my activity on Bitcoin talk.https://www.reddit.com/u/Fabs_-/s/sHSWMLSrYubut it's obviously the same person.Technically at first, your report was good, but FbnGbz didn't know the rules about plagiarism. Marking your report as bad is a bit harsh, but a mod doesn't always have time to investigate. Better to have a bad report than a bad ban.",

The thing is, the source link in his post came AFTER I posted my plagiarism report. If I hadn't reported his post, it would have remained without a source link. Therefore, my report should not have been labeled as bad. Here's what I'm saying. Okay, I get it.1. The moderator is always right.2.
