I had long ago some experience with PoS coins and their price went lower to even lower until some even got delisted for low volumes.Ethereum has all the shit tokens on it (ok, not all, but most); I expect those may also fall (if nothing else, at least the panic).And my question/dilemma is... how will Bitcoin handle this, at least on short term? I'd expect another leg down, like when various DeFi \"businesses\" crashed, especially as the bear market is not over yet.But how low will that go? Or am I wrong?",

      "body": "Imho for current use cases eth was valued too high anyway, but this doesn't mean it would be in the future.So is this purely value speculation or are you saying that this is a bad thing or coin should be only valued by the cost for mining it? Regardless for the actual use case and game theory of utilizing the tokenimics for it?Are you taking into account their whole gaming theory of their tokenomics, EIP-1559 and incentivizing stakers not to sell but accumulate their stack? I mean you are comparing it wo something completely different in the first place.Comparing ETH to BTC is kinda pointless and BTC probably will end up getting banned after it hits $100k for the same exact reason you are saying it has store of value, and that reason is PoW.And before you say that it can't be banned and throw in talks from Antonopoulos or any other libertarian talk assuming governments can't fight it or about the decentralized nature of it then sure, you can mine it forever with your laptop and p2p trade it with people. But CEXes can, and without CEXes the, lack of liquidity itself would drop harder then ever, and you will go back to P2P trading.And lets say by some miracle it stays alive and liquidity against other cryptos would be stilll good and there would be a good technique to DeX it to other cryptos. FATF travel rule and other AML regulations would make sure that these old money washing techniques will be irrelevant and game left for very few people who can play the system.And if you are hoping that CEXes would fight regulators: https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1569973440496410625So good luck for people with that store of value there.",

The market does not always run as we expect, it can run before news or after a while when events occur. This has happened with bitcoin before, bitcoin never rose right after the end of the halving and only really exploded after a while. Many people are disappointed because after the merger, ETH did not increase in price for them to take profits and they think that the merger is not beneficial for ETH. Those who always want to make such quick profits are unlikely to last long in the market.",

The other change is like you said, the income of the miners. Maybe some will learn to adapt it but for the rest maybe they will try to change careers now.For the eth developers, they will surely adapt on the change because they agree to change eth in the first place. It is said that eth is gaining a dominance last time but that have reverted to normal now, now that the price of eth is dropping drastically. @piebeyb they sell it cheap but they will buy at a high price? I think that's weird. Basically, we will only sell at highs and then buy at lows.",

This may be due to several factors, some of which were consumed by the ISU negatif that developed from the system changes implemented by ETH, and others may be looking for a price gap to buy back at a lower price by making short-term trades and the current month's price is more red balloons fly",

You are basically taking money away from the market, and locking it, making the liquidity in the trading volume go lower, meaning when the bull run comes, and there are a lot of people who would like to buy ETH, there won't be any and that’s going to be the good side of it because it will go up a lot faster due to lack of liquidity.This means that locking up your ETH is similar to fed increasing the interest rates on dollar and increasing its value and dropping crypto, but for this time it’s going to be for ETH. I can literally see it go over bitcoin during bull run, it's possible.",
