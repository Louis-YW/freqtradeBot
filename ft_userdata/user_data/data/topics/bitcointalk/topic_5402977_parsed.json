  "content": "Hello, I made some profits on the trading platform TRONLINK (https://coinbaby.me). They want me now to pay my personal income taxes otherwise my USDT funds are blocked there, i.e. I cannot transfer them back to BINANCE to change them into FIAT. Strange is:1., It works like a withholding tax: I pay taxes via TRONLINK - they settle with the authorities. Does it work like that? I thought you have to declare profits at the end of the year in your home country - no settlement via the trading platform2., I cannot use my profits for that. They want me to put fresh FIAT (changed in USDT) on this trading platform. Is there anyone who has experience with this? Is this a SCAM?",

I tried to visit the site to read the C&S but I didn't find it there, how come they do taxes for you.",

I have used a browser extension TRC-20 crypto wallet called Tronlink. I do not it is the same Tronlink you are talking about. I visited the site link you have provided and I can see it's a dex that wants your wallet connection. They probably used a template to create this site through WordPress. You have said you made a profit there which means you have already given wallet connect there. It will be better to change your wallet address by creating a new one. They probably already got your privet key. Be careful when connecting your crypto wallet to an unknown dex.",

What happens is that once you load the scam site(coinbaby.me) it prompts you to connect your metamask or tronlink wallet. This is where they possibly steal your funds.",
