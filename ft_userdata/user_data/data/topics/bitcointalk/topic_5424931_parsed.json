  "content": "Hi everyone, I'm on a s9 13th and a card shows me signs of a hashrate drop after 5 minutes of mining (OS braiins ). Â I look at the logs everything is top, starts correctly the only concern being this line which appears before the fall of hashrate:Code: 2022-11-30T13:20:12.562165Z ERROR bosminer_hal::sensor: Sensor hb8[ii_hwmon::tmp451::TMP451]: read failed: I2C error: general error Hashchip: no response for read_register(reg=0x20) from chip One(61)I then looked more closely with a magnifying glass by desoldering the heat sinks, it seems okay to me on tmp541 chip, no dust, the welds are not crackedâ€¦ a friend told me that as for the s17 the welds crack over time Â and make false contacts.I noticed that on the hashboard when the sensor goes wrong, the little red light flashes more slowly like a bad contact (if it helps I say so)also in the line of code I saw write Chip 61, so I decided to test the chip as well as its surroundings and I came across the correct values â€‹â€‹of CLK: 0.9 and RI 1.8 in 12v plug.from what I understood it is, the more its heating (so after 5min to heat up) the closer we get to a crash point because of the sensor (or other)for the moment I am there without too much additional infoâ€¦ an idea maybe?Big Thanks ðŸ«¡",

      "body": "It might be capacitors near the temp sensor would you mind trying it to check if shorted or not? You can also find the shorted part by touching those capacitors while the miner is set to sleep mode.Or if not you don't have another choice but to replace the broken temp sensor or bypass the temp sensor scan but the problem if you bypass the temp sensor it may damage other components.",

      "body": "Hello BitMaxz,You are right ! I test all capacitors and this one (2R5TPE) close to chip 61 show me 0v in output :https://ibb.co/cQydy1nEDIT: I tested the resistance of the capacitor in question, it is good. I think of a short circuit on the whole track 21 with the chips 60 61 62.Also, I put a video attached of the red diode that flashes once the sensor is triggered (a new hashboard starts to make the same worry of sensor tmp451).The previous owner confessed to me that he overheated without a fan (which he forgot to plug in again) before disconnecting it (like 5 minutes)https://streamable.com/qgmfjs",

I really don't understand where this is coming from.I'm talking about the resistance of those capacitors near the temp sensor voltage output is different.Would you mind to reflash your unit to stock firmware and letting it run for a while and copy the kernel logs and post it here?If you don't have knowledge about repairing this I suggest try to contact zeusbtc and maybe they can help you with your issue",

This is the way how I repair replacing the sensor with a known working one is my way to test them as according to your logs it's pointing to your temp sensor.Please read figure 19 for the schematic and how to check them I already post the zeusbtc link above.",

Have you checked the LDO of the 11th voltage domain and the surrounding resistors, if the resistor is damaged, the RI signal will not be transmitted to the next voltage domain.",

      "body": "Hello ! Thanks for your awnser..I changed my LDO to try and the thing is identical, when I plug the multimeter I have 1.80 then a micro fall to 1.599 then 1.780 and remains stabilized there and I think that is what puts me in fault RI, I imagine that it comes from a resistor yet they are all functional. At least they show a value lower than the others but proportional to 1.72 and not 1.8 I do not understand too muchIn the video I test a track next to it which is good and the LDO of the defective track  https://youtu.be/ZvnSXT-e7l4",
