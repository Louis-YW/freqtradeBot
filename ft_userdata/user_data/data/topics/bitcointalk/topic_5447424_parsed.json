From your example someone that has actually bought $1K worth of bitcoin at 17k in January will have gain more than $600 profit now at current price of $28k, which is not a bad profit. But some traders actually gain, some gain at least 10% of that amount every week and that has worked for them. Many people came into bitcoin with the narrative of getting rich quick and holding doesn’t guarantee that in a short period of time. Although holding is more secure but there’s nothing bad in trading if you have the fund to risk and also are ready to learn. But for others waiting for just signal from others without assurance of how accurate it could be then it is better to stick to holding",

It is better for some people to change to swing trading because scalping and day trading are rinker, just like gambling. With swing trading, a trader can be patient enough to let the market fall before trading. Or better still to go for holding. Holders are not losing like traders.I have always advice people that if they want to trade and they are beginners, they should first use less than the amount of money that they can afford to lose. Something like $10 in each trade is good to begin trading.If they are making money, then they can use the amount of money they can afford to lose to trade.If they keep on losing, they should change to swing trading, they are still traders but just like short term holding.If they are still not getting it, they should wait when the market will fall and hold at low price.",

Due to the idea that a lot of the short-term profit made in crypto is from day trading, that's why they chose crypto trading. It's not bad for a newbie to learn trading; at first, they will lose money because not all trades will be successful, but as a newbie, it's wise to always learn a good strategy and become more familiar with using the strategy if it's profitable. Some newbies can still become good at trading if they learn so well and also how to handle their financial management in the crypto market. The thing that challenges most newbies, however, is that they sometimes view trading as a game or gambling.",

However, if you can also exert more effort to learn and develop skills in trading, then why not? After all, trading is way more profitable than hodling alone, and you can expect huge income if you are good at it. But as they always said, not everyone is capable to trade. Some are just good at the start, but they eventually end up quitting and just settle on hodling alone.",

No one has taught us that we should be greedy and make fast profits in trading. In fact, if you do trading hurriedly and with no caution, you will only end up losing your trades and waste your money. So it’s better to just take your time, wait until the market is perfect to trade, and just slowly earn gradual but growing numbers in time. If you lose, then try it again when you are ready again. But if you are in consistent losses, maybe you’re not really good enough to become a trader, just settle with hodling for the mean time and just return into trading when you think you are skillful enough.",
