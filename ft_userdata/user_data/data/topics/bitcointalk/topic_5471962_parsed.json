Now, whether he will really make X not just a social media platform but also a big financial institution, this remains to be seen but we know that there is really a market for things he is planning to happen with it. I remember the day that he took over Twitter so many pundits were then saying it would be the end of it all but look at X right now...slowly but surely things are starting to come rosy with advertisers returning to doing business with the site. Admittedly, I don't like the renaming decision to X but then again I am just a user there and the power belongs to the man. Now, the question is: Will X replace your bank? Maybe yes maybe no but this is a big concern so X will start to be introducing one financial service at a time as this is not going to be a one-time deal. The man is a big marketing man so we can expect some big terms and presumptions to be spewing from his pronouncements, that is kind of expected. One thing for sure, Elon Musk is here to stay on Earth notwithstanding his plan to colonize Mars.",

I cannot believe it will, though. As long as there are open markets there will be different ways of payment.It does sound a little bit like that We-Chat-All-In-One solution that exists in China. I am sure, though, a majority of people will not want to leave all their transactions in the hand of big E-Corp (Elon-Corp).Also something to note, even though the Twitter space is huge, it's kind of a bubble (not one that neccessarily bursts but one that is seperate from other bubbles). If a financial system is integrated here, it will only reach those within the bubble - I doubt it will help draw many of the people that avoid twitter right now in just because of it.",

Although I don't hate or admire his talent, in fact, I have to admit that Elon Musk is really very talented. Perhaps the hidden meaning is that he makes us feel unreasonable or causes heated debates. But what he's bringing to the fields he's in is an extremely talented person.For me, since Elon Musk started taking over X - Twitter, I can feel his intention to take advantage of part of the power of social networking platforms in an era where anyone can easily use them to spread the word, accessing a good deal of different knowledge as well as causing a good deal of other chaos. I'm not sure how successful this will be, but let's see what it does in the future.",
