Belarus is a small country with a small budget but a lot of expenses so here is another way to generate funds. Leaving out the political good / bad part of it even now they are asking Wagner mercenaries to train the military while building a large military base. That ain't free. All while more and more people are not doing business there because of their ties to Russia. Now, once again do not want to get political about that but the budget hole has to be filled somehow.-Dave",

I mean, decentralized P2P exchanges. I believe those are what you mean. But when it comes to P2P means of buying and selling that's still under any centralized exchanges, they could still be traced and request account banning of their citizens, and they could still file for restrictions for their citizens not to be able to use the P2P option; it's just for the regulatory to write to the exchange. This is the reason why if one wants to remain anonymous, they should avoid the centralized exchanges and go for any P2P option out there.",

The only solution is when people are forced to go to a centralized exchange, where all information about them, transactions will be stored, and of course, taxes will be paid for any activity with crypto currencies.The so-called 27 citizens providing “illegal crypto exchange services” are nothing but exchangers. After punishing them, scaring the rest of the exchangers, squeezing them out of the market and freeing up space, the next step is to open a government-controlled exchanger. This is the standard scenario.Perhaps for some time some exchangers will operate in the shadows, like a black market, but the activity will be complicated, fraught with huge risks, and as a result, there will be nothing left but the only centralized exchanger in the country.You didn't think the holiday would last forever, right.",

Just like what happened in Nigeria, when the apex bank banned cryptocurrency and asked all commercial banks to flag accounts associated with crypto-related activities. Nigerians resorted to P2P trading in order to stay off the radar. In my own opinion, I think this is just a bluff.

A simple mechanism that will trigger an alarm when you initiate a cash transaction to a guy that is not your family member and who has a few other transactions from his bank account at random hours to different people in different towns. Just invite everyone to the police station for an interview and face them with two choices, either tell your whole history since you've been born or go and volunteer to conquer Ukraine.Remember that when you send Bitcoin to somebody it's because you want to receive cash, not because you want to receive Bitcoins back!Guys, this is not the US or Canada or France, when you know, you have things called rights!",
