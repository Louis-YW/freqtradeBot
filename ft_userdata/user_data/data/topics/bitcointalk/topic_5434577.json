      "body": "My advise is not to rely on only the stuffs that you watch on YouTube and trade it. Always try to check on your analysis also before you pull your trigger. Don't trade blindly it is not trade worthy, you can do your comparative analysis, review your position properly and then take your trade decision. It is not gamble so don't gamble with your trade with every video you see.",

There is no real analysis except a prediction or speculation of the price which is the same as how we predict the market price. @OP, prove your self first, instead of posting this video link, try to create content that has an accurate result of your analysis, in that way, probably many members here will convince of your analysis.",

If you learn to use RSI & MACD indicators and gain some basic knowledge about, \"how to use risk/money management tools\", then you can start trading, but in the beginning, trade in spot market & avoid taking position in margin or future markets which are very risky.",

We should analyze it ourselves and not be too influenced by the analysis of other people so we can analyze it well. We can indeed watch videos on Youtube to add to our insights about how to analyze bitcoin movements, but we also have to do the analysis ourselves so we can improve our skills. That's the important thing we have to do because then, we won't depend on other people's analysis and can also improve our skills.",

I think youtube views only counts once you finished the whole video, so it's not wrong to just check it out only to see if it's really a clickbait or not. So I did check it and I see that it is truly an analysis about the BTC price but it was still up to you guys if you will believe on what the youtuber is saying or not.BTC analyses are everywhere and mostly here in the forum because it was a bitcoin forum but there might be some differences on the analysis that we are seeing. Other than the video, maybe the OP can just post pictures here like what other traders are doing. And then he should provide some technical explanations since many people don't like to click on links.",
