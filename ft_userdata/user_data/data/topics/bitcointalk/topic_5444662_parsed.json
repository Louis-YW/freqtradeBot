Please share your thoughts.So far everything points at a complete different direction. Alcoins dies one after another (luna, ftx), 99% of them are scams, NYDFS calls BUSD a security, New York Attorney General sue kucoin for offering securities (ETH). It seams that next bull run will be a bitcoin only theatre.But even if I'm wrong (which is very likely) it really doesn't matter if few altcoins will overtake bitcoin in marketcap. Its like calling a gold \"useless peace of rock\" only because apple has bigger marketcap (we are not there yet). Gold is gold, apple stock is apple stock. People who want to own gold wont buy apple stocks and abandon gold only because it has bigger marketcap. Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is a smart contract platform.",

Please share your thoughts.It is a big NO that any altcoin may surpass Bitcoin.Bitcoin is the first of all cryptocurrencies and is still the king,it has a huge market capitalization that other altcoins simply cannot achieve,most of all other altcoins we know their creators so we know which road most likely their go based on statements from their owners but we don't know yet who created Bitcoin despite knowing the team behind its development and I think this is a key point,Bitcoin is the true decentralization while most alts try to imitate it.In the foreseeable future I predict no altcoin to overtake Bitcoin and I also predict that when the Bitcoin will reach a new all time high,like always most of alts will also increase in their price,this has been history and this will continue to be history.",

Yeah, there's the price dump for bitcoin but look at the price of it again, the price quickly back to $22k and that was too easy.Quote from: FireDAOJackie_Z on March 13, 2023, 06:11:18 AMIn the current bear market, will altcoins prosper and gradually challenge the place of Bitcoin ?

Bitcoin has already proven that it won't be replaced anytime soon no matter what project is gonna come out and how optimistic it is.",

When we talk about crypto, first thing that comes in mind of 99% people is bitcoin. So far as the survival of alt coins is concerned, some alt coins will do well. Like BAT for example , it is related to Brave browser and I really like the integration of Brave and Bat coin. Getting rewarded for using a browser plus the browser has many other use cases like no ads while browsing YouTube videos. What more can a user ask for ?",

They have more than 50% ownership of those coins. but when it comes to bitcoins, there is nothing like that. So bitcoins are more decentralized than altcoins.",

However, we may see a turn of such dominance in the \"foreseeable\" future you mentioned. Things are changing and Bitcoin's dominance is gradually dropping. Before it used to have over 70% dominance. Today, it's around 40%.",

You certainly need to solve the problems it has. These Alticoins have failed to solve any problem they think bitcoin hasn’t solved. We see coins like Eth moving to POS and it didn’t solve any problem. At this time I don’t think this Altcoins can overtake bitcoin, they will follow in his shadow and even the market trend it is such",

A lot of altcoins will still react the same way as they are all denominated by BTC on exchanges. They will thrive in the market and are more than likely to surpass the ATH also during the bull run. But they will not replace BTC on top. We're aware that institutions are even just interested in BTC and nothing else.",

Please share your thoughts.As long as greed is still in human nature Altcoins will continue to thrive and we can see now that Bitcoin's dominance in the space is declining, there is a reason for this, it is because Altcoins are eating into the BTC market share. If you look at the relationship between BTC and Altcoin as see-saw effect, which is an  inverse relationship between  Bitcoin and Altcoins, when BTC price goes up, Altcoin stays the same in USDT or dumps in BTC value and later Altcoin catch up and pumps both in USD and BTC value leaving Bitcoin behind",

The current and past market position also tells that Bitcoin price movements correlate with the cryptocurrency market. The past shows us that most altcoins come and go, and the only legitimate project is roughly only 1 per cent compared to altcoins or token that currently exists. This spaces are full of empty promises, and the barrier to entry to make a project is low thus it filled the market with a worthless projects.

Please share your thoughts.Question I guess is how do you view dominance in the first place? Is it the market price? 'coz if that's the case there were many altcoins which did it in the past. Bitcoin happened to be a larger chain in this industry among other cryptocurrencies which makes it not surprising simply because it is the first crypto to ever be introduced. Altcoins do not really follow Bitcoin's shadow; it is just the fact that they are all having volatile market value and the only pattern their market prices could do is to rise or fall. Also, there's no affixed pattern with their market prices as we all know. It is just the market trend line which forms connections in between. Proof to this is difference with rate of increase and times wherein other coins are on bullish pattern while Bitcoin is not.",
