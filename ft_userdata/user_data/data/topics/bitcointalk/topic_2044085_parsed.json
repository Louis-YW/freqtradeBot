Write your private keys down to an excel file, memorize them, make a necklace, or do whatever. Just make sure that your btc address don't have a connection to the internet. Stay offline with your private keys and you'll be fine.*that pic is pure bullcrap btw*",

On the other hand, if you had control over your private keys, then you would be the one making these decisions. I suggest that people move their coins out of exchanges for about 2 days prior to the event and also for about a week afterwards. Also avoid making large transactions during these days. < wait for more confirmations too >",

The ability to fork was always there, but we had a strong consensus in Bitcoin community, so it wasn't really needed, but now, but now there's a split and some groups accuse each other of attempting to centralize Bitcoin and take it over, so people started talking about forking. But I believe that economic majority of users still suport Core and no fork can affect Bitcoin's price for a long period. So, as always. just relax and hodl.
