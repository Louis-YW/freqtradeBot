  "content": "I am a nonfiction book author who is writing a book under a pseudonym. I do not ever want my real name known. I need to be anonymous, have complete privacy and be untraceable. In other words, I need to ...# buy my crypto with cash or cash deposit which requires no ID# get the best wallet or wallets which request no ID and is secure# use a different address for every transaction. I understand there is a wallet which automatically generates a new and unique random address for every transaction. Not sure about other security features.# get the best VPN and VPS zero logs, domain and all of them need to accept crypto mas payment. # do I need a virtual machine, yes or no.# when beginning work should I first log into the VPN, then TOR on top of that to take me to my VPS login in at which place I would do all my work as far as building the website, working on the website, and doing the digital marketing for the website?# is there a better way to do all of this? More secure? Security and anonymity is my utmost concern. # which crypto exchanges should I be using, which coins, etc.# if there is anyone out there who can help me I woulod really aqppreciate it. Thank you in advance for all of your help. Citizen Four 2",

      "body": "Hi there,The only way for what you are suggesting is via BTCpay. Also, it seems that complete anonymity can be achieved by using TOR and dealing P2P to sell your product.This may not seem like a good idea, but I have used Shopify (with my real name) and they have integrations where you can accept BTC. It's not perfect. However, selling a product with complete anonymity might not make you achieve your goal of having your non-fiction title in the most hands possible.In fact, you might be on to something here. A P2P Silkroad that's benign in nature. Good luck!",

      "body": "If the security and anonymity of your merchant website are your concern only BTCpaysever is the only option. And add more privacy/anonymous coins like XMR or you can accept only Bitcoin and later use a mixer to receive clean coins. And I'd like you to suggest it is easier to implement if you use CMS like Wordpress for your digital marketing because BTCpay is easy to setup there based on my experienced.Also, BTCpay is self-hosted you need to host them with your own either in your PC or server. Quote from: mk4 on July 12, 2022, 03:10:43 PMthe BTC you receive on BTCPay are automatically converted if I remember correctly.Actually, it's not auto-convert it only automatically sends to exchanges and sells immediately but it seems they don't implement it yet according to this.",
