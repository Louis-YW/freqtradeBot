One of those 'name it and it dies' things, I suppose.That's how ponzi works though, working fine at early stage, withdraw here and there until it become unprofitable anymore then vanish. The rekt ones are the last one who entered the game. Usually, the large daily interest rate, attract greedy people to enter the game.The \"most\" words is usually used in cloud mining because some of them are still operating and still \"paying\" but the maintenance fees are so high that it looks like your not getting profits at all not until you deposit or buy another hashpower, this sounds like genesis mining, bitdeer, tophash, even binance's cloud mining service.",

I once fell for something like this years back, they said it was cloud mining and they paid me dividends either twice or thrice and they stopped my withdrawals then they started prompting me for upgrade even after subscribing for the third to the highest miner. I had already subscribed using 1 bitcoin, then 1 btc was a little over $600. I just concluded it was a scam and signed out, the challenge was that I aready introduced people into it after I recieved my initial reward of 0.005btc.  In total I was not paid upto 3% of my investment sum.
