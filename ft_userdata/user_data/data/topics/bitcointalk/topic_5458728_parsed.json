The majority of crypto freelancer choose this path for job since it’s the easiest way to get extra income online. You will need a very good portfolio or connection on the team so that they can refer you. This is how some people gets the job easily and not through random application since the team will always choose a user with experience than a newbie. I work as telegram moderator before under a the management of forum member on our local board. The only way I get the job is because the manager is from the forum which I knew on social media. You need to establish your connection or build your portfolio slowly.",

You're all suggestions are good and important but here I need to add few things as I am also recently visiting few forums for having information about Bitcoin and crypto but mostly found they are not good or having mostly jobs as volunteers because they have no good income sources. But still if you want to do then you need to be expert about all things which are important for the mod role or job with you also need to be good in bitcoin and crypto with following forum rules are also important because you have to guide newbies and others for this all just keep going hopefully you will get something positive if you will do this all with consistency.",

So you want to become a moderator of some group or community but for that, you have to get some experience. Because once I filled out the application form to become a community support in a telegram group. And the question asked in that forum were easy like qualification and experience plus CV etc.Well, basically at that time I did have not any experience so I just wrote that I am willing to learn but they were not so I got rejected. For you to get accepted, you must have some experience or at least enthusiasm to work as a dedicated moderator because if you will not love the job it will become non-productive for you.",

      "body": "Generally being a moderator during the pre-crypto days were entirely a thankless job and you wouldn't really have a great time dealing with trolls and shitposters regularly. But with the rise of crypto centered social platforms such as discord and telegram, it has become relatively easier for the applicant to gain a job provided they have good connections with other hardcore crypto enthusiasts and they have established themselves in the community with a good track record of handling insane level of participation and posts.With regards to being a moderator at platforms such as reddit, you won't be paid as it is a voluntary work and getting anything in return will go against the rules of reddit as well. I currently serve as a mod of r/BitcoinIndia which is one of the most popular crypto platforms in the country where we cumulatively handle an average subscriber traffic of more than 115k bitcoiners. When it comes to forum where you get paid for the moderation you do, as I have already stated in a thread you need to gain tremendous level of trust and report a lot of shitposts from a particular section for you to be considered for the role.How I became a mod of r/bitcoinIndia was a kinda boring story and I think this happened back when the sub-reddit was so small with 5k bitcoiners and I have been reporting shitposts and requested myself for the role as a helping hand to the head mod of the sub. When Bitcoin boomed during the last bull run, eventually a lot of bitcoiners from India joined and the sub started gaining traction and hence it became a popular and large sub of the country",

How they got their is through networking and recommendation. Networking- they attended crypto events and were active in the sessions. They move around during tea breaks introducing themselves to the guest speakers and other participants. One even requested for a trial, some others got to get a second meeting after the introduction. And they got offers.For Recommendation, these folks were consistent and built a solid social media presences that they the CEOs reached out to them direct saying we are looking to fill this position and you came highly recommended. And that was how they got the job. A couple of them had no coding skill or background in STEM.",

The others that pay with bitcoin is difficult to get, because the project always need experienced people to take up the position. The only method is to keep on searching until you get one, you can also take the free jobs to build portfolios for a better mod job in future. Visit crypto subreddits and freelance forums, there you can find such openings. Also keep an eye on some projects shilled on telegram and reddit, a few of them may need mods for their channel and groups. Goodluck!",

If no, (cus you sound like you don't) then how are you gonna deliver the job satisfactorily to the clients? Making enquiries on things you dunno at all is as good not even knowing anything asking about it.Secondly, the crypto space is very competitive and we've got alot of trusted peeps in the system already; it'll take time and much more concentration on any new cat.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

Do you have a portfolio?  because nobody would want to hire a novice to moderate their community because that alone is a disaster not to talk of when he or she is being paid to do the job. If you lack experience, you can start as a volunteer at first and doing the job for free would grant you more exposure and experience so you could build your portfolio and CV.

What you need to do is create your work proposal and sent it to new projects so that they can look at it and employ you if you have the kind of service and experience they needed.

Preferably make your service free for the first few projects you get in contact with so you can build a very nice and attractive CV that you can used for future application and get hired for your experience and exposure. Do this and you will get one or two projects that'll hire you especially as your service is kind of free and they won't spend money to get you to manage their social platforms. You can also write the managers of the bounty to link you up if the project they launched campaigns for will be interested in moderators for their social channels. As you get experience you can then search for newly launched project and offer your service to them. Your charges this time shoudn't be too expensive, when you can start requesting for what you feel is worth your pay is when you start getting job offers from other projects looking for moderators on for their platforms. Remember first you need to get the exposure and experience before you start demanding payment.",
