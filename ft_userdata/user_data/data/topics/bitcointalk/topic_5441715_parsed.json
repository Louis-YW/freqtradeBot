      "body": "To expand on what ETFbitcoin already said: Logarithmic scales make it easier to evaluate growth in terms of percentage.A steady growth of, e.g. +10% a year, looks like a straight line on a log scale but hyperbolic exponential on a linear scale. If you look at a short time frame this may be barely noticeable, but if you look at decades of data (or deal with a much higher yield, as is the case with Bitcoin) the log scale will remain readable while the linear scale would just seem to curve into infinity.",

Thanks for pointing it out, fixed it in my post above!",
