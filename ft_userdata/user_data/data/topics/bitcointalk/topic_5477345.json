A few hours ago I read an article where the founder of Cardano says that the crypto industry does not need Bitcoin for survival. Further, they elaborate these arguments through an example that in the old times a window was needed for computers to run and now the mobile phone does not need a window and can do good work. (actually showing the shift from windows to mobiles)The meaning of the example is that in the old times, Bitcoin was necessary for the industry but for now the industry is independent or maybe some want a better option but in my view, the survival of the crypto Industry without Bitcoin is not possible because Bitcoin is a very huge system and the miner and users make a strong base for the cryptocurrency security and stability. This is just one and I know more factors also show that without Bitcoin crypto industry does not survive.Guys what you think share your taughts?Source",

Cardano was promising for six years that \"soon\" it would provide a great product, reaching a capitalization of $90 billion at its peak. It's a pity that as soon as they delivered the product, it turned out that no one needed it, no one used it, they didn't build a user base for 2 years and the price dropped by 90%. The question to be asked is \"will anyone in the industry notice that Cardano has disappeared?\" Of course, apart from investors soaked in promises.",

Their opinions don't matter in the grand scheme of things. This is exactly what I would guess an altcoin owner would say. I'm not surprised, not shocked, I'm not even angry. It's his view and even if I don't respect it, it's still his view.

(actually showing the shift from windows to mobiles)He just shot himself in the foot. The mobile phones and other innovations were more sophisticated and technically more advanced than the windows and they've been working hard to keep remaining at the top, but these altcoins have not done anything more unique than Bitcoin.The fact that you can't see the creator of Bitcoin sitting down to give an interview should tell us all we need to know.",

But as long as the government still supports it and they don't fight it with bad regulations - then I will keep using bitcoin as the main option.",

Some shiny ordinals flowing around and the institutional sector and retailers are no longer interested in the market because it's not mature at all now.The entire liquidity cycle will get destroyed if we remove Bitcoin from this industry, I would even say that there will be no new capital because in crypto money starts flowing from Bitcoin to others because Bitcoin is the name of decentralization, reliability, trust, motivation, maturity and much more I can't write everything here. From an investor's point of view, it's no longer a risk-investment market it will be another form of gambling industry where by luck you can gain some otherwise you'll lose all because in Alts maximum supply is controlled by the team, hehe you know what i mean to say rug-pulls etc etc.",

What a madness, chicken comes from eggs and eggs are being made by chicken so why would someone love one and hate one. Comparing to Cardano CEO is saying he want to say that altcoin can operate independently without bitcoin being the accomplisher, which you and I knows that such isn't possible why basically bitcoin attracts more investors than any other altcoin out there before someone would get to know about any altcoin he must first be aware of bitcoin or having pre-knowledge of bitcoin before digging down to other altcoin in the cryptospac today. Basically I myself do not agree to his statement because the 4 years cyclic period gives investor the hope to constantly stick tight to the market especially to remain active for profit maximization this same thing also attract investors to altcoin that causes altcoin gain much more popularities.",

I would say that BTC is the cryptocurrency that is telling us where the industry is heading. If BTC were to take a severe hit such that it would be in danger from continuing to exist, I doubt that any other cryptocurrency could take over because the reason for Bitcoin to be in danger would also apply to any other cryptocurrency. Since he has developed one of those wishful BTC killers that never killed BTC, I believe it might be his bitterness. But I am sure we couldn't care less about his thoughts concerning BTC's future and its importance for the whole industry.",

Bitcoin is n’t the first cryptocurrency, it is THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL CRYPTOCURRENCY. In addition, based on this success and the fact that it has been adopted by a very strong community, it has a guiding nature in the cryptocurrency market.Yes, the cryptocurrency market can survive without Bitcoin but it is more difficult to predict under what conditions this will happen. For example, let's assume that Bitcoin has lost its power in the market, considering today's conditions. In this situation;Following Bitcoin's current dominance and strong community's decision, there will be a serious decline in the total market value in the cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, based on this situation, shocking price declines will occur in the prices of other alternative cryptocurrencies.A second possibility (almost impossible to happen) may occur with the emergence of a different cryptocurrency that can dethrone Bitcoin and take over the dominance of cryptocurrency market. Although this is a very low probability as I mentioned in parentheses, if it happens it will prove that the continuity of the cryptocurrency market will be ensured even without Bitcoin.",
