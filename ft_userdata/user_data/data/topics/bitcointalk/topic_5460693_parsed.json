What are bitcoin developers doing to make bitcoin safer?The answer to your question lies in the text you quoted. The algorithms are good enough 'at least' until 2030. That does not mean that they will instantly be insecure from 2030.'Definitely secure before 2030' ⇏ 'Definitely insecure after 2030'But: 'Definitely secure before 2030' ⇒ 'No definitive judgement starting from 2030'Basically, the authors don't yet want to definitively state whether they think Bitcoin's crypto algorithms will still be secure enough in the year 2030.

BTC developers don't have to do anything now because there is no existing threat, but as quantum computers develop, the network will also develop and work on moving to an algorithm that is resistant to the threat of quantum computers.",

In case of Taproot, all that is needed, is probably just disabling spend-by-key.For SHA-256, the situation is more difficult, but in that case, we will be alerted in advance. If you ever see block headers with 128 leading zero bits for SHA-256, that would mean reaching the collision level, and transitioning to something else. I wonder if that process will start even faster, when chainwork will reach 2^128, just to be 100% sure.Protecting SHA-256 is harder, but still possible. It requires rehashing everything with some new algorithm, maybe even in some backward-compatible way, where you could have some 512-bit hash, with the first 256-bits being always identical to SHA-256, and the next 256-bits being generated by some other hash function. I also expect the same kind of stuff that happened with SHA-1: you have the real SHA-1, and some hardened version, that can protect you just from some discovered attacks, and nothing else.",

SHA256, or other symmetric crypto are not vulnerable to this and are not affected by Shor's algorithm, and Grover's algorithm doesn't provide for a sufficiently high speedup.Collision and pre-image resistance for SHA256 will be weakened gradually, but I have my doubts that they would happen overnight or within a decade. Transition for ECDSA is actually quite difficult. You face the conundrum of securing the older Bitcoin addresses, where they are vulnerable with P2PK or even those with the public key exposed. Quantum resistant algorithms are in the works now, but even if it broken the economics of it wouldn't make Bitcoin any more attractive than government secrets.",

Quantum resistant algorithms are in the works now, but even if it broken the economics of it wouldn't make Bitcoin any more attractive than government secrets.It was discussed in other topics, but in general, when it comes to ECDSA, you don't have that many options:1. You can just introduce new address type, and do nothing with old addresses. This is what would probably happen, because it is also compatible with all other options.2. You can burn old coins after some time. To make it compatible, you can use \"do nothing\" option, and make some huge pool for cracking and burning coins, that will be stronger than any single attacker.3. You can redistribute old coins into miners. In case of any successful attack, miners will probably be powerful enough to take coins from any attackers, it is a similar case as with SHA-1 puzzle, where in practice only miners can safely claim those rewards.Because it is hard to know in advance, what would happen, I guess people will keep status quo, as long as they can, so there will be option number one, and then if any solution will be needed, it will be just compatible with \"do nothing\" model.Also note that speculating about the solutions now, can easily lead to totally wrong results.

But that was not the case, for example Git still uses SHA-1, instead of switching to SHA-2 or anything else. The world is simply unupgradeable, and relies on soft-forks everywhere, if something is \"legacy\". So, in general, I think no matter what will be broken, the actual \"fix\" will handle only this particular attack, nothing more, nothing less.If SHA-1 was turned into \"hardened SHA-1\", then I expect secp256k1 could be also replaced with \"hardened secp256k1\". Even if private keys will be reached by the attackers, there are still many options, like \"a proof that some key is a part of some HD wallet\".

I would assume something that is especially important as Bitcoin wouldn't be able to be replaced so easily. The algorithm that hardened SHA1 uses doesn't defend against all collisions and any sign of weakness of an algorithm would be a good reason for Bitcoin to move onto another completely. There are no redundancies to the network, especially for something worth more than 500 billion USD.Quote from: ertil on July 24, 2023, 08:22:48 AMIf SHA-1 was turned into \"hardened SHA-1\", then I expect secp256k1 could be also replaced with \"hardened secp256k1\".

It provides no protection for any keys which are not part of an HD wallet (which likely includes all P2PK addresses as well as many regular P2PKH/P2SH/P2WPKH addresses), and by locking all such addresses pending a proof which cannot be provided, you will undeniably be depriving some users of their coins against their will, which is unforgivable as far as I am concerned.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on July 24, 2023, 10:30:12 AMBut don't forget the competition still exist between miner/pool.

I believe that there are merits to both sides of the camp, but I personally stand on burning them. I can understand the dilemma behind this and what your POV is. It'll be quite interesting to how it pans out, pros and cons for both directions.By the time ECDSA actually gets broken, there might be more than a few million Bitcoins that are vulnerable still (forgotten or lost used P2PKH, just normal P2PK, etc) . A sufficiently long time for transition would be required, though arguably you're right in a sense that it does rob people of what is rightfully theirs. In the worst case scenario, an adversary gets access to the majority of the Bitcoins and wreck havoc in the markets. While in the best case, they get access to only around 1-2 million, ie. 5% of total possible circulation, not accounting for burned ones.Regardless, we had this conversation quite a while back: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335069.msg56971465#msg56971465.
