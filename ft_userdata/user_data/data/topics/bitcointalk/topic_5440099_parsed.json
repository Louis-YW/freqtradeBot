The current crisis between Russia and Ukraine had deprived many people of there right and acces to good food.Just a question, does holding Bitcoin give them access to good food?  I wonder how can holding Bitcoin help these people in accessing good food?  Isn't it more convenient to them if they have cash to pay for their food?  As far as I know, there isn't much retail stores that accept Bitcoin as payment, and there are still many suppliers that are not into Bitcoin.  So I wonder, what change does it gives holding Bitcoin against holding cash in hand?Quote from: Bushdark on February 16, 2023, 09:37:00 PM We might not not the effect now until we get a grasp of what people that are there are suffering. War is not something we should encourage but the use of Bitcoin since had been helping many Ukraine citizens on donation and free will to help the injured and dead Ukraine soldiers.Isn't fiat donation helping them the same way Bitcoin donation helping them?The only thing I see holding Bitcoin become advantage is that it can increase in price in the long run, meaning if you are holding $100 worth of BTC today, there is a possibility that in then next years you will be holding more than $100 but there is also a possibility that you can hold less if the price of Bitcoin crash.In time of crisis and people have no way to earn money, I do not think people will hold on their Bitcoin when they don't have money to spend for their needs, they will eventually cash out to pay for rents and bills.  I am not negative about holding Bitcoin but I am just saying the obvious when crisis arises, unless you have lots of money that you do not need to touch your cryptocurrency holdings.",

Other than these, you'll still need financial institutions to keep the fiat in circulation at the time.",

Bitcoin being deflationary makes it best against the traditional fiat. The usage of bitcoin helps in all situations and we need to make use of the characteristics than just staying idle out of fear and with the mind that doesn't take risk.Bitcoin have helped people all over the world at different circumstances through its growth as well as the volatile market that lets people earn something out of the difference between buying and selling unlike the market trend of bitcoin.",
