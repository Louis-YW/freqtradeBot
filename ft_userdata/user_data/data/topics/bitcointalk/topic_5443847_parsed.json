I remember there is some command or script that allows you to do this with any topic, of any size. Does this technique still work? Please share, I lost this method and can not find its description on the forum. Thanks.Well you can use https://ninjastic.space/search and enter Topic IDI mean definitely you are not going to read all 25+ pages but you will be searching something specific, right?Good thing about ninjastic.space is you can provide the search parameters and even narrow down the search with Start and End Date.",
