If I'm consistent in what I'm doing, those will only take time, but one will definitely get there some day as long as the merit system keeps on going.¬†Those who have such merit and even more than that are devoted to their task; they have areas in which they are good, and they are creative with them. If you want to be among the high merit earners, I will advise you to put more of those energies you are using to do the imagination work.

Personally, I have doubts about this perspective. In order to progress on this forum, one must actively pursue growth and development. Being intentional entails setting goals. Generally because it is not what the forum was created for. It was just to distinguish people some prominent and helpful members or find a way to appreciate people on the forum.

This doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt appreciate and feel some kind or pride when they get them ( this is gotten from their personal threads to show their reputation on the service board). But I don‚Äôt think they care. Because if they do they would been creating threads just to get them similar to this kind of threads you just created.",
