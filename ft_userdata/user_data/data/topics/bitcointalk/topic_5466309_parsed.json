  "content": "So I happened to find a seed phrase for an old wallet used to receive the five free coins from the faucet in 2010. Unfortunately I have no clue about which wallet it is. The seed phrase is only 8 words of 7 characters, and is not BIP39. After whole lot of googling I encountered this wordlist, and all the words appear there http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/dics/amerlen/length07.txt Several of the words are not even proper english words, but do appear on that list and nowhere else relevant. The wordlist has 108824 words, and the words in phrase seem to be spread over the whole range.Will pay 10% for tip leading to access.",

I don't think it is a deterministic wallet aka starting from a seed. the best guess is that it is password recovery (mnemonic words). Use the search feature here https://github.com/blockchain/unused-My-Wallet/blob/master/mnemonic_words_v3.html to see if those words belong to it.In addition, you will need the wallet UID, which you will find in the email you used to create your account at Blockchain.info/com.If it is not Blockchain.info, use the image search feature with the names of old wallets and you may remember whether it is a wallet or a faucet.",

Nowadays most seeds are still 12words length drawn among a word list of 2048 items. So even if we don't take into account the checksum bits, the entropy of your seed is higher than a current common seed (with the checksum there are 128(11x11+7) real bits of entropy instead of 132(12x11) which is equivalent to 204811.64 combinations)So if you don't know which software has generated it, you won't be able to break it until several computer generations. Because currently the only way to break that is to know the potential shortcomings of the software that created it",

I'm afraid that whenever wallet you were using at the time, has already shutdown.Something is wrong here. There were no deterministic wallets in 2010.as far as i know, you only had a bunch of private keys back in 2010. There wasn`t even electrum yet.",

So it is impossible for it to belong to Multibit.As for Electrum, considering how it is not user friendly to generate a custom seed which for example would require having a much bigger word list that would generate smaller number of words in the phrase, I'd say it is unlikely.",
