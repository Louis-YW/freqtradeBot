It could have been one of the best investment decision they could have made that would have earned us so much returns. Unfortunately,Â  our government have not been much interested in making productive investment rather much of our income are spent on privolities like buying exotic cars and houses for elected/appointed government officials who are already rich and comfortable. Imagine the proposed president yacht of N5b, car for the wife of president at N1.5b and other unnecessary expenditures on things that does not generate revenue. To further buttress the point that Nigerian government are not thinking investment, the took loan worth billions of dollars from China to build railway and roads and these project did not add a penny to our treasury neither is the railway functioning yet Nigeria is servicing these debts years and lavishing our scarce resources. Only Nigeria will change tomorrow, but I don't think our government is thinking about investment and even if they are, Bitcoin might not come into the picture because it will not afford them the opportunity to looth.",

So our own money, they are supposed to use them to do roads, build schools, hospital and also make the economy standard to be in a friendly position, if the government can do just that I really believe that they can save save up money to pay the loan that the country is owing.",

We hear this or that governor squander money but even if they are ask to pay back how can we know except its made open for everyone to which Blockchain would help in this part. How can you tell if they don't have bitcoin now as a private investment or as a way of hiding their money. If they opt for investing in the country and its possible to release the wallet address then this is actually better for us.

It would have been better if our government invest our money on bitcoin to recover our dieing or epileptic economy. But am am afraid even if that is possible it would be for there selfish interest. I believe those our politian are great investors of bitcoin. The money they loot from our reserve are used to invest in bitcoin. They make more profit while the economy die gradually. For your information they have no plan to recover our economy. All what they want is to enter power and take there own national cake. Haven't you been woundering why EFCC hasn't been probing the politicians? Because money laundering is no longer on GP tank and suckaway but has been upgraded to bitcoin investment.If you check the top 10 contries that adopt bitcoin massively you will discover that Nigeria is top 10 but if you check properly you will see that CBN has pertialy ban the use of bitcoin where as it still stand as top 10 where do you you think those money is coming from? Consedring the inflation of our country where the youth manage to eat a 3 square meal a day, will spend about $562.9b in 2022. in bitcoin investment. My only advice to you is to forget about how the government will invest in bitcoin to revive the economy because they are doing it but for there personal interest so you should invest for yourself and forget about them because even if they invest and the money grew, when they will share the money you not be there, probably it will still be channeled under a proposed project where dey can perfectly shear it amongst themselves.",

I know that there are many cryptocurrency users in Nigeria, but the government doesn't actually have the policy that citizens can freely use cryptocurrency, and that's why the Nigerian banks are not allowing cryptocurrency interaction in their banks because of the CBN policy. So, if the government is not 100% supportive of cryptocurrency, then they will obviously not accept investing in it.Yes, you know the chances of the government setting regulations is getting higher and remember about a post here which is about Tinubu's plan for Blockchain and eNaira is appealing despite lacking details.. If they are in support in Blockchain its more likely they will support cryptocurrency since its built on Blockchain and if they probably do a feasibility and analytical study about investing in bitcoin now, they may accept it, especially when they know what they can earn will go a long way on the debt and they also getting their share",

It could have been one of the best investment decision they could have made that would have earned us so much returns. Unfortunately,Â  our government have not been much interested in making productive investment rather much of our income are spent on privolities like buying exotic cars and houses for elected/appointed government officials who are already rich and comfortable. Imagine the proposed president yacht of N5b, car for the wife of president at N1.5b and other unnecessary expenditures on things that does not generate revenue. To further buttress the point that Nigerian government are not thinking investment, the took loan worth billions of dollars from China to build railway and roads and these project did not add a penny to our treasury neither is the railway functioning yet Nigeria is servicing these debts years and lavishing our scarce resources. Only Nigeria will change tomorrow, but I don't think our government is thinking about investment and even if they are, Bitcoin might not come into the picture because it will not afford them the opportunity to looth. You are talking about government and you are also talking about government and their lavish lifestyle. That lifestyle you are seeing started not today but since everyone become woke about the last election, attentions are everywhere and opposition parties are using that to attack them.Let's talk about the bitcoin adoption and the government. From day one, the government position about bitcoin remain the same, no commercial banks nor any type of banks must engage in cryptocurrency or any form of digital currency as directed by the monetary policy enforcers. So, don't expect our government to look at that acceptance any time soon but perhaps when there is a new change in government, they will allow the policy to be review.Bitcoin and economy, do you think right now is bitcoin that Nigerian need to protect her economy amidst this high inflation that is earten everybody, I don't think so. Have you conidered the negative side of bitcoin to economy? What will happen if the price sink and a country put everything on it as reserve, the country will suffer hyperinflation anytime bitcoin enters the bear market, it's not even a debate but reality.Argentina is a green flag for Bitcoin because the new elected president loves bitcoin but that doesn't mean bitcoin will be a thing of investment for the country but rather people will have the free will to buy and sell and possibly be allow as legal tender which is a good thing for Bitcoin.",
