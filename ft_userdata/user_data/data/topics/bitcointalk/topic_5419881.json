If you just keep your money to any custodial wallet or exchange imagine if they were hacked and file bankruptcy like many exchange did this past few months. Your hard earned money will just vanish like it isn't yours because of that irresponsibility to keep your own money.",

You can create as many backups as you want and in different formats - on paper, on CD, on USB, on metal sheets and so on. The problem is that some people treated it as just another password and made only one backup copy and then misplaced it, when in reality they should have treated it as nuclear launch codes.",

Without these secret keys, it wouldn't be possible to provide decentralization and censorship-resistance, and it certainly wouldn't be possible to give people what they have been seeking - financial freedom. Bitcoin liberates people from the shackles of the old financial system and gives them a way to escape from ever-growing inflation and political corruption. Of course, the inability to restore access in case of accidental loss implies full responsibility for the actions you perform and also the thoughts that come into your head. But you can't be really free without also being responsible for your own actions. You either accept this new reality growing up financially or continue to rely on banksters seeking your money, time, and freedom. Backing up your wallet is not that hard; it is definitely worth it to learn about the best practices of dealing with private keys, especially if you value independence and freedom.",

And people should save the seed phrase to any safe place.Let me suggest to those who forgot phrase or lost it.1. Make a locker.2. Purchase a notebook.3. Write all phrases on it.4. Save that notebook in the Locker.You can get everything at anytime.But if people keep safe the locker key and forget the key place. So they should consult to Doctor for treatment.",

The real problem is that some don't understand that non-custodial wallets don't have any insurance in case you screw things up, and those who are active in Wallet software could see dozens of cases over the years where new members asked for contact from Electrum developers, thinking that they could help them to recover lost seed or password.Quote from: DaNNy001 on November 07, 2022, 10:41:23 PMWhich is supposed to be ones wallet security pin, but you know as humans forgetting and carelessness is a must in our nature.It is human nature to constantly change and adapt to new circumstances, and if you want to be successful in something, then you have to change or face the consequences.
