Money comes easily in cryptocurrency market but it goes quickly too if you can not secure your profit. If you are bad with capital management, your initial capital can go quickly too.You should only quit your jobs if you are already a millionaire and have some years in this market to know that you are good with risk and capital management.",

Bitcoin is not all about happiness. You might get excited hearing some success stories, but you never heard of the extreme failure of people. I do not see any reason for someone to quit their job because of Bitcoin only. They can quit their job if they want to start a business with Bitcoin like Binance owner CZ did. Some people have started their companies relying on Bitcoin and must be happy about it. Some people could hold their nerves to survive the bear market and hold their coins long-term, and they are successful today. But there are other sides as well. Countless people had Bitcoin in the early days, and either they gambled it or traded and lost their Bitcoin. If you are new to Bitcoin, follow these steps.Quote from: mk4 on July 12, 2023, 12:41:55 AM* If you like reading articles: https://coindesk.com/learn* If you like reading books: https://theinternetofmoney.info/* If you like watching videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPQwGV1aLnTuN6kdNWlElfr2tzigB9NnjSecurity related:* https://chainsec.io* https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/security.htmlIf you want to get more technical* https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook#chapters",

Bitcoin has brought joy as well as sadness to a lot of people. And you might say bitcoin has transformed lives but i don’t know about bitcoin inspiring people to quit their jobs. Perhaps you could share some of those articles with us. Bitcoin hasn’t inspired anyone that I know of to quit their jobs. On the contrary, people are sourcing for and getting side jobs to earn more so as to comfortably purchase more bitcoin and of course to relieve the burden on your pockets due to the constant rise in goods and services. You mentioned you’re new to bitcoin. I hope you won’t get so excited reading about those testimonies that you would get inspired yourself to quit your job. I’d like to add that you shouldn’t believe just everything you read online. Especially on blogs.",

People who share their stories on Bitcoin understand how they struggle to survive holding Bitcoin or making it from scratch until they manage to get a lot of profit.You can learn from the stories of these people and how they survived until they finally experienced how Bitcoin has changed their lives. And you also have to know that behind investing in Bitcoin, there are risks that we must face. And if you are willing to take the risk and still not give up, you can change your life.And if you haven't made much money, you should keep working as usual and don't quit your job. Especially if what you make from Bitcoin hasn't provided much profit for you.",

People who leave work to focus on Bitcoin are because they somehow set up a business related to it, or switch to a Bitcoin-related job.

I was having a bad time there, which was followed by a whole year of depression and hypochondria.After bottoming out, I found this forum, joined some campaigns and recovered hope and, yes, smile! It is true that it was another time, 2017, when the market was not so mature and I think that there were more opportunities, but I hope other people who learn about Bitcoin and/or members who join now the forum can tell a similar story in a few years.",

Imagine not needing to work for the rest of your life because of the amount of money that you have gathered with the investment that you have. That's amazing, to be honest, to have that life-changing amount. For me, discovering Bitcoin has made me wiser in terms of having to invest in the right places like knowing what really matters and what doesn't and it has given me opportunities that I wouldn't have now if I hadn't known Bitcoin. It brings a smile to my face because of that.",

And also how some other persons have incured some drastic losses as well?Every  good has is bad and that also applies to bitcoin and I believe that its advantages outweighs the disadvantages but the truth be told that it takes patience and some good research to stay blessed in the industry and i some little advice for you which includes:1. Don't be in a haste to invest but rather take your time to study about what you're about getting into it.2. When you begin investing, don't store your coins on exchanges 3. Don't be too greedy and don't click on random links, they might be scam4. The make profit rule of cryptocurrencies is buying low and selling high so you always have to stay active.5. I will also advice that you hold for longer term as this is one of the best and less risky way to profit.Goodluck.",

Everyone thinks that if you invest a certain amount, it will grow by leaps and bounds.OP, land on the ground. If you currently have a good amount to invest in Bitcoin, it means that you are already doing well. If you think that you will invest a little and soon make a good profit, then you are in for disappointment.In addition, you do not need to invest all your funds. Life is unpredictable, and at an unexpected moment, you may need money that you do not have. I will not talk about volatility or the safety of storing your funds in Bitcoin, but what I read about changing jobs specifically for Bitcoin is, in my opinion, complete madness.",

I'd love for all of us to share our happiest moments when Bitcoin brought a smile to our faces and the steps, we took to experience that happiness.Seriously, Bitcoin has not yet changed my life financially because I have never witnessed any bull run since I started my Bitcoin investment journey. I just started to invest in Bitcoin last year, despite being aware of it for Long time, but I believe it will soon change my life financially because I promised myself that I would not sell my bitcoin unless I have witnessed at least two bull runs to come, and we are expecting one to come soon after the Bitcoin halving period we expecting next year. But honestly, despite the fact that Bitcoin has not changed my life financially, it has changed my lifestyle. Since I started to invest in Bitcoin, I have learned how to economize, like not lavishing money on unnecessary things because once I bought it, it was always hard for me to sell it back. So I just believe there are many ways Bitcoin can put a smile on someone's face. As for those who claim that they quit their jobs after making good profits from their Bitcoin investments, I don't think that's a good idea unless someone wishes to establish their own physical business with the money they get from their Bitcoin investments. But apart from that, if you rely on bitcoin as your only source of income, they warn against it because of the risk that bitcoin involves and because nobody knows what will happen in the future.",

Take some time to know more about Bitcoin, learn about the market, the best time to invest and when to take profit and also learn about wallet security. Bitcoin has no doubt positively touched a lot of lives among whom I happened to be one but I just want to say that I don't think it's wise for a person to quit his job because of the money he makes from Bitcoin. Bitcoin investment is more like a side hustle and shouldn't prevent anyone from doing his personal business or working in an establishment.",

In other words, why work 7 or 10 hours a day and not be able to earn enough for a decent life, if there is something that has changed the lives of others for the better.Of course, stories are one thing, but reality is something completely different. Everyone's life can change overnight if they win the lottery or find a treasure chest.
