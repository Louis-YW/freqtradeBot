I'll see if he can make a video of the peeling. no that qr code simply takes you to their website. there is no public address provided at all. as for redeeming it - 1000 sats should be doable - I have processed in the neighborhood of 70-100 txns thru a pay to many and the fee be less than 2k sats. so depending on the mempool load it is doable - though is it worth it? no... spend 700-800 sats to retrieve 1k sats - cheaper to just buy bitcoin than to buy this coin to get the sats.",
