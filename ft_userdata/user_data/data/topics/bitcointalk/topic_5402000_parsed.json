  "content": "This is an auction for 2x 1oz .999 silver rounds (pictured below).  They are a 2017 Chinese Panda and a 2018 Year of the Dog Chinese Zodiac.  I'd say they're a bit more rare than your typical 1oz rounds, but not impossible to find.  I purchased these from jmbullion and have never taken them out of their original packaging/capsule.  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to get them answered before the auction ends.  Sorry for the bad pics.  Good luck to the bidders!Starting Bid: 0.002 BTCMinimum Bid Increase: 0.0001 BTCEnding Time: 24 hours from this postAnti-Snipe: Ending extends 5 minutes from last bid  Shipping: FREE (USA ONLY)",

      "body": "I guess this was priced too high? I couldn’t find prices for these coins near this price. My bad if they can be found elsewhere for this price. Thought I was offering a great deal on these. I’ll lock the topic now as the auction has ended with no bids. If you want to take advantage of this deal feel free to shoot me a PM.",
