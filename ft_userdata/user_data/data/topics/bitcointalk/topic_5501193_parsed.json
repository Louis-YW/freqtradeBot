  "content": "The U.S. government's involvement in the BitcoinBTC market has been notable, with Jameson Lopp, co-founder of Casa, tracking their activities since 2014. The government has seized and sold at least 195,091 BitcoinsBTC, making a profit of over $366 million. Currently, it holds 213,546 BitcoinsBTC, valued at over $13 billion, positioning it as one of the largest BitcoinBTC holders globally. This significant holding underscores a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. Meanwhile, the German government holds 46,359 BitcoinsBTC, making it the fourth-largest sovereign BitcoinBTC holder behind China and the UK. These substantial holdings by major governments highlight an increasing interest and involvement in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting a broader trend of recognizing BitcoinBTC as a strategic financial asset. The legitimization of BitcoinBTC by such influential entities not only impacts market dynamics but also suggests an evolving regulatory landscape and a shift in economic strategies to include digital currencies.",

Different agencies have always sold assets.A lot of politicians played online poker, and the us government never specifically prohibited it, until one day\"Black Friday\" operators were facing charges.  Which always seemed weird that people could be charged for breaking laws implemented after the fact. Ijs i wouldn't put a lot of stock into the perceived stance of the us government. esp since 13billion is a crumb to them.But i would say a lot of the smaller countries with weaker economies investing in it is a big sign. They believe it's a good investment to create wealth for their country.",

That doesn't mean they are involved in drug trafficking market!The actual \"involvement\" and the biggest is still El Salvador because the government has actually made an investment in bitcoin and they see it as an investment. What US government sees those bitcoin as is NOT an investment, it sees it as some valuable items seized from criminals that are waiting for the court order as the process completes to be auctioned and liquidated the moment the order comes. That order may come when bitcoin has crashed and they sell those nonetheless since as I said it is NOT an investment.BTW 195k bitcoin seized in 15 years is not that big. The US border petrol alone seizes an annual amount of $50 to $70 million cash (that's about a billion in 15 years). https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/currency-other-monetary-instrument-seizuresThe sum of what they seize is so massive that this amount of bitcoin is like a drop in the ocean.",

While this accumulation may seem at odds with the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, it highlights the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in both criminal enterprises and legitimate economic systems. As the government continues to navigate the complexities of the digital currency landscape, its Bitcoin holdings may offer unique advantages in regulation, security, and economic strategy.

Besides El Salvador, I don't think there is any other nation that has shown genuine interest in investing in Bitcoin. However, they are interested in attracting Bitcoin-related businesses so that they can create employment and increase tax revenue. This is the reason why many countries have increased regulation and also approved some Bitcoin-related services like the ETF. The government will only be interested in the Bitcoin they can control.

They don’t hold bitcoins to say that they are pro-bitcoin, in fact they are always against with how the nature of bitcoin works. It is true that it was confiscated from suspect criminal activities but the government values it. Some of them are hodling it for a long time so that they can make a profit from it. They are aware that the price will appreciate which is why they are keeping these Bitcoins. They might not be pro-Bitcoin, but they know it is profitable. The recent increase in the price of Bitcoin has given the German government a profit of about $1.1 billion from their hodling, that's big money.",

They cut they seek is what is called extortion or extorting. Some say that the government itself is a mafia that uses its own legal branches to make money for them. Which according to my point of view is correct. It is why most countries globally are now no more fearing with the consequences from the US. They are now independent with allies that are after the US government.",

I think the bitcoins they confiscated from the criminals all went into government funds and they are already the current owners of them so it can be said that they are the holders. As OP also mentioned, the US government once sold 195,061BTC and earned 366 million USD, it can be seen that they used them as a real owner. If the government is indeed holding Mt.gox victims' bitcoins and they intend to return them. Why hasn't anyone received their BTC back even though 10 years have passed? I know that there was an announcement about Mt.gox releasing bitcoins this month but the victims only received 20% and the value of those bitcoins was calculated at the time Mt.gox declared bankruptcy and not the current price. Do you know how bad that is?",
