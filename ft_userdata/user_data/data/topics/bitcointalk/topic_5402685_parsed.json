  "content": "There is a saying which goes like this â€˜â€˜Youths are the leaders of tomorrowâ€™â€™ and a nation that has a strategic plan for the youths always reap a better future. So on that note, I decided personally to go share my little crypto knowledge about Bitcoin with some college students in the community and it all went well. But before then, I always knew Bitcoin has come to stay and as such there was a need to recruit more Bitcoin lovers, of which the only way that could be done was by creating awareness among these young ones now in their early teens so that as they grow up, they get to love it, use it and grow the crypto/Bitcoin community at large. So that was how the idea of this thread came about, and I will be happy to walk you through as you continue readingâ€¦According to the statistics i got from blockchain.com, I am meant to understand that Bitcoin has a total supply of 21 million, of which an average transaction of 267,490 takes place daily, and the last Bitcoin is said to be mined in 2140, which is approximately 118 years from now, so imagine if after this generation there is nobody to succeed us in our crypto journey, who do you think will mine the remaining Bitcoin meant to be completed in 2140. Have you ever thought about that? So thatâ€™s the reason why there is a need to educate the young ones now than ever before, of which I like to thank the school management for giving me the privilege to talk to these students. So please pay close attention as I share with you guys how my journey about trying to teach college students about Bitcoin all started, the challenges, and possible findings. Â Â Here are my Aims and Objectives1.Â Â Â To test their knowledge about Bitcoin with my Questionnaire2.Â Â Â To introduce it to those that will be hearing the name Bitcoin for the very first time3.Â Â Â To explain it to those who could have heard of it but never knew what itâ€™s all about4.Â Â Â To explain its pros and cons5.Â Â Â And, to show them the least place to start investing in Bitcoin with the least minimum of $2 to $5 (since they are students and donâ€™t have much).So letâ€™s start,When I arrive at the school for the 1 hour Bitcoin briefing, the very first thing I did was to issue a Questionnaire to these students to test their knowledge about Bitcoin, and it was fun as I came to find out that 60% were hearing the name â€˜Bitcoinâ€™ for their very first time, 30% have heard the name but has no idea and 10% have heard it and could give a try that â€˜â€™itâ€™s a Â cryptocurrencyâ€™â€™ and these data gave me a clue that I needed to start the briefing from the scratch. How it started (Brief Introduction)So I began my crypto briefing with the students by saying just as Naira, Dollar, or Pounds are physical currency we use on daily basis to pay for goods and services, issued by the central bank and controlled by the government, Bitcoin on the other hand is a digital currency independent of its own, not controlled by either the central bank nor government. Launched in the year 2009 by an anonymous fellow known as â€˜â€™Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™â€™, by which the name is called anonymous because till date nobody knows who he is or his whereabouts. As the name was only mentioned in its official whitepaper (i.e a manual which shows the road map or how to use a crypto project). That with the use of Bitcoin, one can now transfer money to anyone anywhere around the world within just a few seconds, which is unlike before that you have to pass through several processes just to receive or send money to a friend or family member studying overseas, which at times takes weeks or months to be delivered. As all that is needed is just a creation of a wallet of which we have got a lot of them on google playstore, but the most commonly used one called â€˜â€™Trustwalletâ€™â€™ which has a 12 digits seed phrase that is just like the key to your wallet funds and needs to be written down and placed in a safe place. And you are good to go. I told them that just as every other thing has both pros and cons, that Bitcoin is no exception to that, as it is also good to know its advantage and disadvantage, and one of the advantages is that it can be used to transfer money to anywhere in the world in few seconds, it is the best choice for long term investment, it is easy to use (i.e anybody can create a bitcoin wallet to received bitcoin within few seconds e.g Trustwallet). And one of the disadvantages is that it is highly volatile (i.e the price always goes up and down), it is irreversible (i.e in case been transferred to the wrong address) and its transactions canâ€™t be traced.I also told them that Bitcoin has come to take over the worldwide currency because just as back then in 2010, how 10,000 BTC could only afford to buy 2 pizzas, that today the price of just one Bitcoin can not only buy 2 pizzas but 2 standards fast-food selling pizzas, since as the year goes by so is the price of Bitcoin increasing, which is why it is a good option for long term investment. And no amount of money is too small to get started, as they could only invest an amount they could afford to lose, because of the nature of its volatile market.So I went further to tell them that getting started with Bitcoin is very interesting, as we have got a lot of already made tools which make things easier for us, e.g coinmarketcap (a website which helps us to track the price of all cryptocurrencies), Binance (a site where we could buy almost all kinds of cryptocurrencies), and Bitcointalk.org (the official Bitcoin forum where you can learn everything about bitcoin and crypto). And I told them in other to buy a coin, Binance and Remitano both offer a p2p where you can buy crypto with the least minimum of $2 and $5 directly from your bank by just doing transfer. And I told them that for more information, they can get it from blockchain.com, google, youtube, or contact me via my phone numberHere are some pictures belowBelow are the Questionnaire test results 1.2.3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. ConclusionSo as a result of my questionnaire and brief interaction with the students, i got to know that thou Bitcoin has been around for over 13 years now, there are still some persons who hasn't heard the name \"Bitcoin\" before, and that create a sign that we all have much work to do in creating awareness campaign to enlighten the young ones about this currency for the future. So i have done my own part by teaching the young ones in my community, and its left for you now to play yours now. Because if only we could educate the young ones in each of our communities, Bitcoin will have a better future tomorrow.ThanksUpdate ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡The photos have been blurred and everything back on track. So I hope to update you more on this coming soon",

      "body": "Great initiative to bring Bitcoin closer to the younger generations!A few comments:- You should teach the kids to never search for Bitcoin wallets on Google Play Store or via the Google search engine. Neither of the two services care and they will gladly advertise scam and phishing wallets. Your recommendation of Trust Wallet is also not the best. First of all, it's a closed-source multicurrency wallet. You don't need that for Bitcoin. Stick with a community-trusted open source Bitcoin-only client like Electrum if you want a light wallet or Bitcoin Core as a full node.This hasn't been updated for some time, but it's still a good place to start:[General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?- Bitcoin won't become the world's #1 currency. Those in power won't allow it. But that doesn't stop any of us to use it. It is and will remain a viable alternative that will be developed alongside the traditional financial systems. - When you describe P2P markets, mention Bisq as a great alternative to centralized exchanges who make up their own rules of who can and can't use their services.",

However, from the photos I can tell they are secondary school students because of their school uniform, I believe you are in the one in photos whose face is covered, it will be good to also cover the faces and names of the students too. I think the questions are simple enough for beginners and gives an insight on how much they know about bitcoin. Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on June 15, 2022, 07:44:07 AM) and its transactions canâ€™t be traced.Again, this is not entire true. Bitcoin is not anonymous but pseudonymous, Bitcoin transactions is public on blockchain and can be traced.

Children need to be taught the basics, but I don't think they should be encouraged to invest until they become independent and find their own jobs. Yet the greatest attention should be focused on security and on how to avoid online scams.As far as teaching is concerned, in some African countries the situation is probably different from that in the EU or the US when it comes to education, and special permits should be sought for such things - in other words, you can't teach in public schools about something that is not in the education program.As for privacy, I agree that faces should be blurred, as well as that the names of children from tests should be covered.",

The questionnaire gave you are clear understanding of the level of knowledge of the students as regards to Bitcoin. You have really done a great work theoretical and the next stage should be the practical learning. Although it might be expensive, but using a projector for practical explanation would be nice. You can also use diagrams or charts to do the explanation if a projector is not available. I can see your school is still using the chalkboard, please tell the students to darken the board so that your drawings would be clear. You can also get smartphones that would be used for practicals. As the class continue please identify students that have interest in Bitcoin and separate them fro other serious one. You can keep mentoring the interested ones until they are fully grounded. Please ensure you reiterate the fact that Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme because some individuals have been brainwashed by ponzi schemes and shitcoins. Great work sir.",

This would build young minds to be able to handle financial decisions and begin the journey of being independent much earlier.My takeaway would be not to give close ended statements, like Bitcoin is the best investment, the students should be able to explore and study how investments work, read books and then make up their mind on that.",
