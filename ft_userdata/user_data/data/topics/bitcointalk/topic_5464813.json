  "content": "Point 1When I think of bitcoin I see Bitcoin like treasure and their is desperation in me that bitcoin can not disappoint people who embrace bitcoin, but I'm not having the instinct that bitcoin will make us rich or bitcoin will make us poor because of the information I obtain from people investing in bitcoin. But I want to ask people who do emphasise on teaching their grandparents bitcoin what are their instinct of teaching their grandparents and their parents bitcoin, is it necessary to teach people that is above 70 years bitcoin and if they invest in bitcoin how long will they benefit in bitcoin before they die. I do see bitcoin investment like an asset and investments plans that is meant for young youths until they get to old age and its not something that is not something thats meant for old people that is above 70 years to 80 years.Point 2It's good to give a proper information to whom you want to introduce to bitcoin investment because I use myself as case studies because I was not properly informed of bitcoin investment because someone who introduce me in bitcoin did not give me the proper ethics of bitcoin marketcap scenario, when bringing people to bitcoin investment some people doesn't not teach the negative part of investing in bitcoin they only concentrate on the positive side and that is one of the things that discouraged some people not to invest  in bitcoin. Point 3What bitcoin investors needs is a proper research by the person concerned so that the person will get the full gist of bitcoin before investing its funds, I know what's bitcoin since 2014 and I knew that during creation of what I have to write down my seed phrase and document it, so after opening a trust wallet and I purchased bitcoin through luno platform with the directions of the person that introduce me to bitcoin and everything concerning the wallet was written by him and after two months I misplaced my mobile phone and that is how misplaced my bitcoin, when I asked my instructor of way forwards of retrieving my bitcoin he said since I have lost my phone its the end of my bitcoin",

If your children inherit your bitcoin, it is better than fiat.I saw this on Twitter:Most old people will prefer to have their money in saving fiat but which are devaluing assets. If an old person understand about bitcoin, he can have some of his savings in bitcoin which is possible that his children will benefit from it than fiat.",

My question to you is, how would you convince a generation that practically lived on cash & plastic card in their entire lifetime. They are in living on the verge of death & life now. They all have retired from their work and want to live their life in peace with thier medical issues. You cannot ask them to go ahead and invest in a new technology, which by the way is just a decade old. In my country old people don't think about investing in anything new, they do encourage in investing the old ways like gold and property. In suc a scenario it is hard for the young generation to invest in Bitcoin.",

Instead, they can pass it on to their children after they die. Let take it from another perspective Why can't people over 70 invest in Bitcoin? It's likely less stressful than someone of the same age running for the Post of a president. My point is, as long as these older people can still read or are physically capable and are willing to understand the technology and risks involved, they can take part in the cryptocurrency market. There's no age limit for using Bitcoin.Quote from: Riginac111 on August 28, 2023, 09:20:58 AMPoint 2~before investing in anything it is always adviced to DYOR (do your own research). carrying out research helps you understand further in details about1. what you are putting your funds into.2. how long such investment has existed.3. what you will benefit from such investment.4.precautions to take before and after investing.Quote from: Riginac111 on August 28, 2023, 09:20:58 AMPoint 3/b] At this point, I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying. I thought since you know about Bitcoin since 2014, you'd know that if you lose your phone, your Bitcoin isn't goneAs long as your seed phrase were written down and kept just as you said, you can always recover or have access to your funds. Bitcoin or cryptocurrency are not stored in your wallet, but are recorded on the block chain. the wallet serves as device which connect you to the Blockchain and displays the total amount of funds related to your wallet address.  I think you and your instructor still needs to learn a lot about Bitcoin because from what you said Quotewhen I asked my instructor of way forwards of retrieving my bitcoin he said since I have lost my phone its the end of my bitcoin it shows clearly that he is still a newbie into the crypto space and he is misleading you mate.",

I would like to ask Riginac is the difference between a young person and an old person who does not understand bitcoin? It is just age of course because the both persons are ignorance in bitcoin. What I'm trying to say here is that age does not really matter or limit one from knowing bitcoin or accepting bitcoin. Bitcoin can be useful to anybody irrespective of the age, what should be concerned when using bitcoin no matter the age you fall into is, why do you need bitcoin and what do you need bitcoin to do fall you( understanding the main purpose of bitcoin ). If one can answer this questions about the reason for Bitcoin then the person is free to use Bitcoin no matter the age the person falls into. I don't think Bitcoin is only for young people,  I can agree with the rate at which young people are into Bitcoin is high and the rate of old people is low, but having a conclusion bitcoin is not for the old people is wrong.",

But I do understand the part that these people who have told Bitcoin to the others and don't tell them the negative side of it. Actually, the negative side of it is that it is highly volatile. But with that, you can think of it as an opportunity if you're able to understand what Bitcoin really is.The price fall has always been the discouragement of many newbies and that's not a problem on them.

I have come to notice that most of the complaints about bitcoin scams and possible hacks are from newbies and as a result of their I don't care to know approach. You do not just wake up one morning and start investing your funds in what you do not have knowledge about irrespective of the fact that a family member or friend did tell you about it. It is good you are told about the bitcoin and the investment aspect of it but it is better you gain more knowledge on it by doing your own research so as to be well equipped with knowledge before investing your funds. When you are too hasty to invest without acquiring the right information, you definitely will hit a brick wall in the cause of your sojourn into what you have no idea about and that would be very  disastrous.That is how people get scammed and they cry foul and call bitcoin a scam because they fail to do the right thing.Looking at the other way round with respect to getting knowledge about credible and reliable wallets, one can do a search via google to see for themselves as there is nothing hidden online. There are lots of wallets which one would need to make choice from on which to adopt. Most of the wallets have been mentioned here by members for which anyone who cares  to see for themselves should do.Lastly, it is not advisable to hold your assets or keep your assets under the watch of a third party such exchanges as it invariably means that you are not the owner of that assets as you have no keys to the wallet holding that assets.Remember \"not your keys, not your assets\"",
