Advancing on ranks here isnt simple, you need to contribute, interact meaningful ideas and topics to be able to receive merits. But thats not gonna happen in a jiffy. Understand the forum rules, collect intellectual ideas about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Sometimes being humorous is a plus, and you frequently have some nice logical response. But for the meantime, adhere to rules of the forum and focus on dos and dont. This will get you somewhere in the future.",

Don't generate a post using A.I \"especially Chat G.P.T\" as it is against the non-written forum rules.8. Don't scam other members on this forum, because you might likely be given a red tag that will damage your account.9. Focus on creating valuable contents and merits will come naturally, please don't beg for merit or do merit trading as it could be harmful to your account.10. Lastly, Always try to study any post you happens to come across which has a lot of merit, and try the know the reason why it got so much merit & try to apply it in your next post. (i.e Maybe the post was educative or it answered a question in a more detailed manner that everybody could understand).",

Here are a few things I have learned over the years of being here:- If you take your time to read and learn about bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world, you will be able to make meaningful contributions to the conversations that goes on here. If you do, some members may show acknowledgement and appreciation by sending you merits.- You do not have to comment on every topic you don't have anything to write. You would be considered a spammer if you do so.- Take the time to go through the posting and writing patterns of higher ranking members on the forum to understand their writing style, research ability, and from there, develop yours.",

The thing is you must earn merits from others, thus you might be a high quality poster, but the boards you frequent is different from where the users with the most merits visits, and in that case you might stay a long time before being noticed.If you post naturally and learn at your own pace, you'd prolly rank up; but the speed at which you rank up depends on the knowledge you have at your disposal, this is the reason why certain users would definitely rank up quicker than others, so just be yourself and grow at your own speed.",

There is nothing wrong if a newbie come to ask forum users on such question even as they may have the knowledge from people that introduced them here. You should understand you have been in that shoes before now and no need to criticize them a lot Asking is perhaps to get a confirmation from other users and also to try their luck to be merited on their thread. Nobody likes to stay stagnant in a place, everyone strive to be at the top and that is what newbies try to do and if they don't succeed, then they give up. They need some level of encouragement.",
