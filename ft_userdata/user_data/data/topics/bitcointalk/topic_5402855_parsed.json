The vulnerability was reported by Tom's Hardware Computer Division.Earlier this year, Intel introduced its own processor for cryptocurrency mining.Hertzleed attackHertzbleed is a new type of side-channel attack based on dynamic frequency management features (hence the name: Hertz (Hertz) and bleed (data suppression)). The study states:\"In the worst case, these attacks allow access to cryptographic keys on remote servers by analysing the computation time in cryptographic libraries. Previously, these libraries were considered hacker-proof.The Hertzbleed attack analyses the dynamic frequency under various workloads and breaks the encryption by guessing and manipulating the ciphertext.Dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) is a feature that reduces power consumption. However, attackers can understand the difference in power consumption by analysing the server response time to certain requests.\"Hertzbleed is a real and practically possible security threat,\" the researchers noted.How to protect yourselfIntel and AMD currently have no plans to deploy Hertzleed firmware patches, but there are steps users can take themselves.Chip manufacturers advise disabling dynamic frequency control to protect against Hertzbleed. On Intel processors it is called Turbo Boost, and on AMD it is called Turbo Core or Precision Boost. Companies are confident that this will not affect processor performance.According to senior director of public relations and incident response Jerry Bryant, this attack has no practical application outside the lab, as it would take an hour or even days to steal the keys. He also added that \"cryptographic solutions that are immune to side-channel power analysis attacks are not affected by this vulnerability.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-hertzbleed-cpu-vulnerability-boost-clock-speed-steal-crypto-keys/https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/vdlsv2/if_you_own_bitcoin_or_cryptoshitcoins_use_amd_or/",

To make matters more interesting, another BSV shill replied to bump the thread after you posted, and it got ignored. I know you are alts but let's just say, \"BSV fans, very amusing!!!\"Secondly, who in their right mind even uses a regular computer that connects to the internet to store lots of crypto  It's fair for small amounts, but not your big stash or long term HODL.",

If you spend all your time worrying about these types of attacks, you are going to wind up doing so many bizarre things to attempt to mitigate them that you are probably going to make it worse.I really wonder in the end how much more money was lost due to efficiency hits as people disabled all the performance enhancements worrying about Spectre / Meltdown and wound up buying newer machines vs. the potential financial / cost of data loss if they just kept running with them enabled. -Dave",

It is possible to construct input data for the algorithm SIKE where it can get on a sequence of all zeros in its calculation. They do describe in section 5 countermeasures.Only because the selected crypto algorithm generates a sequence of calculations with zeros is there a big difference in CPU calculations, which lead to the CPU changing frequency. I don't see for now a general problem. Nonetheless software developers should be aware of this type of attack.",
