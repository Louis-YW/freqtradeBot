(Or maybe, I am not understanding you)In the case you import both of your wallets and then start syncing, you need to download the blockchain only once, even if pruning is enabled. If you run a full node (pruning is not enabled and you keep the entire blockchain), you can import as many as new wallets you want without any need to redownload the blockchain.",

      "body": "hosseinimr93, This is what I understood:Available option 1:Download full node, then you can replace wallet.dat as often as you want without necessity to do initial syncing again. No need to sync the whole blockchain. One can have 2 or more wallet.dat and use one today, another tomorrow, then the first one again etc.Available option 2:Place chosen wallet.dat into Core first, then sync in prune mode. This option doesn't enable to change wallet.dat that easily because every time you replace wallet.dat you need to sync the whole blockchain again.Option 3, unavailable and impossible:Sync in prune mode and replace wallet.dat as often as you want without need to sync the whole blockchain. Did I understand you correct?",

      "body": "If you want to replace the wallet.dat file, you must have multiple backups first. You must name it transparently so that you can know what a file is for what specific wallet, just like wallet1.dat, wallet2.dat (you must know what 1, 2 represents for).Because when you copy & paste that backup to the folder, you must rename it to wallet.dat to be readable. Then if you don't have previous note about that, you will not know what that wallet.dat represents for your specific wallet.",
