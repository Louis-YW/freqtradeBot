      "body": "We should not also forget to continue our fun discussion on Bitcoin price guess for 2023. As for the month of June, bitcoin may remain less volatile in my opinion. I checked the monthly BB and I noticed that it has been three months now that bitcoin has been unable to go beyond the middle band and slightly going down in price, maybe bitcoin may not go up further but I am expecting it not to go that high or low. The price will be less volatile this month.",

And we have the BRC-20 ordinals that has been clogging the network for sometime now that might have cause investors to be wary and not to pour their money on the market for now and till this month.And history June lean on a bad month, so I'm not expecting significant movement, perhaps highs of $29k, but that's remain to be sign and it will depend on the sentiments of investors.",

But it was not really bad, I think. I don't know how to analyze the market, but based on a few things I know, I think this month will not be as bearish as the month of May, but a bit stronger in price.",

      "body": "If we trace the history, in June there was usually a drop in prices or a sideways movement. Now the Fed rate is almost at its peak, but there is no overly positive news either. Therefore, a prolonged sideways movement is the most likely scenario. It is unlikely that there will be a particularly strong drop or a rapid rise. July might be hot and June might be a period of accumulation.",

But yes, can't assure anything because investor's behaviors had also changed, and with their experience, that possibly brought something different to the market. Well, I'd predicted to have a few price pumps this month, a 9-10% increase seems to be possible. Not really it is good but can't push the market and the people to just hold their coins for the sake that the price will grow high as well. Generally, we just rely on how the investors strategies their investment, the more they hold, the better results.",

Usually, it's the last 3 months that really will have a good bounce after a worst bear market year like 2022.So with that, not seeing anything that will push the price to higher levels, $30,000 will remain the resistance for this month.",

Was thinking this might already occur in May, a re-test of $25K or $23K, but clearly this is taking longer than expected. Hence I voted for sideways for this month.I'm thinking the same way.There might be a short correction that will occur this month of June, the same goes for last month's history, with price correction first right after there's a price increase.This month could be a sideways pattern the same as the previous history. But this is just personal speculation which is we know that the market can be influenced by sudden news events or changes in investor sentiment, making it challenging to accurately forecast short-term price movements.  So I encourage everyone to hold for a long period of time just like more than 6 months right after the next halving comes.",

But I think it will be good for us, this period of inactivity might be a good time to just re-invest again.",

If they announce a halt to rate hikes, that would be good news for us to hit our target of $30k or more this month. But if they continue to raise rates, the market is unlikely to perform any better. For my part, I like the bear market, I don't expect the bitcoin price to go up that fast, and I will only think of a bitcoin price increase as we enter Q2 2024, meaning after the halving takes place.",

The moon may mean that we will rise to levels close to $60,000, which is also impossible.So the moon, even if the moon means that we will rise from the close of May, you are using it in the wrong place.During the middle of the year, trading is usually slow and trading is boring. Therefore, if we maintain these levels, the matter will be great, and I do not expect any rise above the $35,000 level.",

But as we all know, once buyers created a pressure, then we are more likely to see a continuous price increase. The market is now showing higher volatility than last month seeing altcoin prices with 40% increase while the price of Bitcoin plays aaround $27 - 28k. I'd say there's a higher tendency for the price to fall and fill the mentioned gap above mentioned. There's no concrete reason for an uptrend right now to trigger an uprise movement so it would more likely go the other way around.",

I do not see it go 32k+ for example, that would be too much for one month and I am guessing that it will hurt the price and all. However, if we could end up with something bigger and better, then we could do bigger and better as well.I think the realistic approach is that it will be either barely going above 30k, as in literally just 30.1-30.2 etc type of small increase, or it will probably end up with something under 30k again, but I still think that it will be higher. Whatever it has been so far, it may see higher than that, and that is the road we are on because of the halving, people are afraid of selling, and they are a lot more willing to buy at this moment as well.",

I still think it will go to moon, and opted for them on the poll, but I have been thinking that for like months now and been wrong so far, I hope that this time I won't be and it does well enough. At the end of the day we all know that it will do fine eventually, maybe not this month, maybe not next but it will start to go on a bull run eventually. This is why I keep thinking that will be the month we are on, whichever month we are on. I hope that we really start going up a bit, we really need to, it has been pretty disappointing since that 30k+ during April, because since then we haven't been able to see above that again, I am guessing it could be this month. Lets hope that we get it, and we see above 30k at least, even if not like a moon or something, 30k would mean that we are back at the top again and something is cooking, that will get people excited a bit more.",
