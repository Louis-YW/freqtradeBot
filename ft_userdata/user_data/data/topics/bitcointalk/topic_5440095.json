  "content": "Recently, as you may have noticed, I presented a CLI tool called Bitcoin Message Tool aimed at helping bitcoin users to sign/verify messsages and bitcoin signatures, without them having to install a specific wallet. Despite the fact that terminal or command line is the most effective and secure way to do things in your computer, unfortunately not all people consider it a convinient approach to interacting with applications. That made me think that something like web application accesible from all over the world would be a better solution for this type of functionality.Let me introduce https://bitcoinmessage.tools/I tried to make it as user-friendly as possible while preserving some powerful aspects of command line interface. What it has:1) Support for signing and verification from different types of addresses (Legacy, Nested SegWit, SegWit)2) Support for multiple standards of signature verification, namely you can create \"classic\" signatures supported by Electrum and more modern type of signatures supported by Sparrow Wallet and Trezor.3) With this web tool you can create signatures both deterministically and randomly (Sign using RFC6979 standard option)4) Detailed error messages (even too technical for some non-standard situations) that will explain what is wrong with the inserted information;5) Both CLI and web tools are fully open-source, you can find relevant code here and here6) Website has two themes: dark theme and light theme. Which theme you will see depends of your system preference. At least that is idea. See below:It is on mobile, but it also should look decent on desktop (didn't test on all resolutions).How to use it. Well, it is pretty straightforward. You insert an information and you get a result like the following:You see a green notification if everything is okay.Otherwise, you see a red notification telling there is something wrong with the information you put in.This is my first serious project developing which I did many things for the first time: I never used web framework before, I never used HTML and CSS before, I never made my own server up and running, and i never had my own website before. Hope you'll enjoy it.Please try it out and let me know what you think and how it feels.Important note: you must not use your real private keys while testing this application.",

But you have other options to run it offline:1) Use a command line tool instead, which is more suitable for offline interactions.2) If you have Docker installed:Code:git clone https://github.com/shadowy-pycoder/BitcoinMessageTools.gitCode:cd BitcoinMessageToolsCode:docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -dEDIT:3) If you don't have Docker installed:Code:git clone https://github.com/shadowy-pycoder/BitcoinMessageTools.gitCode:cd BitcoinMessageTools/webCode:python3.10 -m venv envCode:source env/bin/activateCode:pip install -r requirements.txtCode:export SECRET_KEY=<some_random_dataCode:python run.pyGo to localhost:5000 in your browser and your shoud see a website running offline.Quote from: PX-Z on February 16, 2023, 11:50:03 PMThanks, didn't read the whole thread just go to directly to site :my bad: Unfortunately, this was written on python, so i can't implement it on my site.As far as I know, JS and Python have very similar syntax, you can try to convert it manually or using any online tools like https://extendsclass.com/python-to-javascript.html",

Hopefully, bitcointalk users and other people from bitcoin community will also find this website useful for some of their cryptocurrency-related affairs.Quotethe trust factor will be for those who want to try this tool and put their private key at the beginning is not enough, you can try to gain the community’s trust by clarifying the full safety of this tool, I understand what you mean by saying \"gain community's trust\" but let me clarify some things. Importing a private key to an online resource has never been a right thing to do, especially if it is your own private key associated with an address containing funds. This site is no different from other ones that deal with sensitive bitcoin information. I simply cannot guarantee that your private key won't be intercepted by hackers upon transferring to website, signing process or transferring information back to you. The only thing I can do is open-source everything related to backend and frontend and also offer other solutions, such as offline tools that eliminate trust altogether. Hope you understand all that.QuoteI see that this is a good achievement compared to the fact that it is your first project that you developed, well-done buddy, and I hope you add some other features and continue the development and good luck to you.Thank you, mate!

Everyone is free to download the source, alter it in such a way that will allow for the collecting of sensitive information, and deploy a malicious copy on a public server. Even worse, if you have no evil intentions and you run a clean code, 1) you still can't prove it and 2) users may still lose their funds because sharing private keys on the Internet is dangerous.I will add the following warning on sign page:the online version of the message signing tool is intended for testing purposes only. Please do not share your real private keys with anyone because it may lead to loss of funds. If you still want to use this website with real private keys, you should run an offline copy of the website locally on your machine. All necessary instructions can be found here:",
