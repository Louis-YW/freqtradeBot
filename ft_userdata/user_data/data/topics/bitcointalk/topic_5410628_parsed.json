      "body": "I will buy both. Both have the same potential. It's hard to pick one from them. That's why i prefer to take both as my long term investment. OP is also a very good second layer and lido dao is still getting hyped. I personally think that if you can get both and then why not? It's not always picking which one as the best thing to invest but sometime there are some projects that have the same potential as well.Think about that.",

Both are looking good for long term. We may see very soon trend of DAO and Layers 2. Between these two I will give more value to layers 2 then DAO because DAo system is little bit complicated then Layers 2. Optimism,Azero,snx and Matic are some top class Coin which can be top 20 coin of the future. So I will be looking to fill a bag if I find them in dip Optimism was 0.49 around 1 month ago and i didn't wasted the opportunity to buy it since it pumped to 1.9$, now it get back to 1.2$ which i find it another good to opportunity to invest in layer 2 but be careful because Arbitrum could also launch their token which will create big competetio between the twoIs Optimism max supply not a barrier for you? The max supply is over a billion which sucks to me, I don't even understand how this token costs this much, maybe some part are locked or something, I think Lido Dao is better with this point of mine.",

You are wrong, Max supply do matters because with low Max supply the token will easily pump even in a short term bull market, they easily appreciate in price since supply is very low, take a look at PYR token for example, millions of supply is better than billions of supply.",
