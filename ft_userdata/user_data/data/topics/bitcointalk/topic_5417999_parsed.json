They accept BTC though so maybe there are people playing.Dragon tale graphics are just like the games we play back 20 years ago. if it's not a popular place, it certainly is not a place for players.",

A lot of people were actually able to win some coins out of this but I have never made it. I still hold my old account, you can try to find me in case you instal it and start playing the game. I recently installed it again and got in a couple of times eve though the game seems to be pretty silent.",

However \"metaverse\" shouldn't be diluted with all these dragons tale, decentraland and such projects because these are just games, they are games where you use coins of those games and those coins are connected to blockchain, compared to all other games which doesn't have coin connected to blockchain, thats it. Metaverse should be something much bigger, don't know how but it should be a second reality, and if we can reach that level then we can call it metaverse.",

Obviously newer versions, which have since relabelled themselves as the metaverse, have more computing power available which will always improve them over time - but the whole idea has existed for such a long time now. Let's hope that the latest leach, Facebook, is prevented from stealing any patents in relation to their new open world environment because that is often what stifles new competitors from later joining the market, it often isn't about them being the first creator but the first one attempting to patent it without useful opposition.",

It just a matter of time when the world will be transformed into a metaverse.[/quote]I guess that's debatable. IMO, Dragon's tale is much like an embryo of what the Metaverse is today when compared to decentraland or Sandbox. If you take a look at the Metaverse significance \"In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets. In colloquial use, a metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.\" it does imply that online games such as Dragon's tale which is capable of gathering thousands of players in the same virtual environment are in fact an embryonic depiction of the Metaverse.",

      "body": "I'm not sure if it's obvious from the op what they're site is so I found the start of a description on their website (trying to keep it brief but with enough info).QuoteDragon's Tale is home to games unlike any other casino. You wont find a craps table, roulette wheel, or black jack dealer like in other online gaming sites. Instead you will discover a persistent 3D world filled with original games designed to attract casino gamblers and MMORPG players alike. While about half of the games in Dragon's Tale are simple as a slot machine, others require deep thought and skill. In addition to solo games we've also included unique player versus player games so patrons can stack their wits against others. Scroll your mouse over a game icon to view a short description, or visit the Dragon's Tale Wiki to get a more in depth look.It looks like an interesting concept that might have something working well behind it but the lack of adverts have probably stunted its growth (games might take a long time to be matchmade too for pvp versions).I'd be skeptical of how little it's being advertised though in case it has quite a few bugs and they're trying to keep it fairly hidden until those are fixed - unless it had its hayday and re-emerged as a lot of companies and products do (like wearable tech).",

I'm not sure if the game still working i will give it a try this weekend.I actually haven't tried that casino/game actually and it is my first time hearing it. Based on your description it's like an MMORPG game because there are other players that you can enjoy with your drinks. 0.001 is a big enough amount for a faucet if we are talking about the current value today so I might think that it is a very old game and addition to that is the graphics, It's like RAN online (a MMORPG game that I played before).I believe that even we don't have this casino/game before, we all will head towards metaverse since there were a lot of MMORPG games and concept before that is almost the same as this.",

This kind of games give a sensation close to those FPS games (First Person Shooter), I would call this gambling experience as First Person Casinos (FPC)Another good examples of this kind of casinos used to be the ones in Second Life:And as i mentioned before, the experience is totally different than online casinos or real ones.",

They mixed gambling and mmorpg elements to create an online game, although the gambling games presented by them are also different from the traditional ones we find at virtual casinos such as slots and wheel.I think to consider it a metaverse, games' features should go beyond. There must be more freedom, interactivity and customization on the virtual world, otherwise it is just an open world online game like GTA series or mmorpgs.",

Mir4 did this, although the game ended up to be a classic MMORPG where everyone only wanted bragging rights, less about the money-making aspect but still it is somewhat successful even up to this day.Imagine if all old games will be revived with the word \"metaverse \" on it, I'm pretty sure people will jump on board not because of the metaverse but rather to relive their memories and satisfy their nostalgia whilst playing the game.",
