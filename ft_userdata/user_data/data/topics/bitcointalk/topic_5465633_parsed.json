If it happens to me, I can't stop thinking of it, but definitely one day I will stop thinking about it and see it as history or not yet, my time for big wins just like how it happened to me when I lost a bet that would have given me  long-term smiles.",

It will just make you agonizing on the fact that you missed something if you always think about and check your potential winnings. I experience this a lot when I’m newbie playing dice game. I’m always itching to bet all-in on a single dice bet but I’m always hesitating and turns out the roll that I should bet suppose to win.After that, I stop checking the result of my what if whenever I decided to stop betting on a certain bets that I was aiming but don’t have money.",

You can think like if you have used $1000 to go 10x to make it $10000, that if you put it on altcoin like doge in 2020 and it actually pumped that you would have become a million in dollars by now. And this keeps repeating, but you will only notice that you lose more. That is life. I do not think about something like that. If my day will come, it would, but we should risk responsibly and not think like we would become rich in just one day.",

But we are coming those point of our lives that we just want to bet for specific games but we just can't.Normal not to stop thinking about it because you're feeling the regret of not betting it. Just don't indulge on it and let it pass because sometimes we win, sometimes we lose and sometimes we regret.That's all, so don't be emotionally attached to it. You can feel that in a day but move on the next day.",

We all at one point in our life have missed out on an opportunity that would have changed our life from the way it is now to an even better state but when it happened we all thought about it for weeks or even months but now we don’t even remember that something like that happened back then, same thing will happen here; at first we might contemplate about it and have some regrets but as times pass we will start to forget about it and move on with our life after all it is gambling not a job.So Op think back to the things you have missed out on and you’ll see that the feeling won’t last forever and if you decide not to let it go and start dwelling on your past mistakes you’ll only keep yourself from moving forward and progressing.",

Anywho, the problem with people who gamble for profit is that they think everyone thinks the same way as them, so there's no point in gambling for entertainment anymore especially if it stresses the fuck out of you on the daily. But in reality, life-changing winning or not, people who truly gamble for entertainment will know to not let that into their head, whether it's a loss or a missed win. The point I'm trying to make here is that when you're in a mindspace where you are positive you'll be impenetrable even to the hardest of gambling stresses and pressures, you'll never falter, most of disciplined gamblers fall in this line. Sure, some of them may feel agitated or even angry the moment they see their missed win, but it's not gonna stay with them for as long as people who gamble for profit relishes upon their missed wins and losses.",
