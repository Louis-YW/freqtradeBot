      "body": "We should be spending that amount on Opensource phones/OS that allow us to connect with like-minded people with similar preferences.Certain OS/phones like the one you mention are not pro freedom in developments. And the little freedom and fundamental rights are reduced with new releases until their users nolonger have any.Lesser freedom means more enslavement to the head or the one at the center whom everything is connected to. When users are more controlled by the head they become as evil as he is and they will be cursed with all manner of disasters. So, basically the newer ones attract curses or problems to their owners because they will be more connected to the very bad entity in the middle who is so cursed. I know it would be abit hard to see friends, family and countrymen buying the latest technology while you are left with the old but it's for our own good. The world is drifting fast to the pit and evil makes the drifting faster. I hope decentralized people learn to live without centralized world and begin to rely more on the good alternatives.  That's what we will be communicating with when freedom is completely gone with choas and tyranny reigning on earth.",

      "body": "The new version of the phone will be more expensive, it is normal in terms of features, but such an expensive phone is not for everyone, because a product depends on the status of people.I cannot buy such an expensive phone because I do not have that much money. Yes, the phone is very good But I think somebody will definitely buy and a lot of people will buy because in today's age many People not doing not buy any product just for work but for hobby or luxury only those who want luxury will buy.This is actually quite a surprise in today's context but not surprising to many.Personally I think it makes no sense to spend so much money and I would never buy it as it would create a disparity.",

So long as the iPhone continues to offer enhanced value for their business endeavors and they possess substantial reserves, why not?I aspire to acquire an iPhone 15, should it serve my productive interests. However, at present, my current mobile device adequately fulfills my business needs. Hence, it is not yet the opportune moment to replace my old phone.",

There isn't anything creativity. At least they adopted to USB-C.   (after 10 years though). We don't need it but photographers need that camera mega pixels, and the gamers as well as performance enthusiasts need that extra CPU power. A basic user doesn't need those features but someone who's really a power user can utilize those in the best way possible. The Apple iPhones are known for their quick performance and great camera quality, and iPhone lovers can spend a lot of money to avail every new version of the smartphone that Apple releases. I agree the USB-C port is the best new feature in iPhones and overall the iPhone 15 is much improved from its predecessor. Although, I'm not a fan of Apple products but I still think that Apple doesn't sacrifice on quality when it comes to products. The price tag for those products is always much higher than other brands but still I believe that most other brands doesn't focus much on quality of the products.",

Well yes here is that thing about the USB-C port. Its that this already is out with the other products that can use it. This port is being used since 2014.So I think you are correct it could have been on older Iphones.  But they are waiting to add it to this one to act like it is such a new thing.",
