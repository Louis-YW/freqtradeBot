  "content": "I am selling a Bitcoin trading robot software with full source code.I am selling the actual software with full source code, not a service. You can transform it into a service or do whatever you like with it. I can also sell exclusive rights for the source code.What it does:- It monitors Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) evolution and sells/buys at certain points in time such as to maximize profit according to your rules (but it also comes with its own rules). Features:- Written in Javascript/NodeJS- Uses Binance as trading platform- Trains a machine learning model on the specified period and uses that model to make predictions- Also uses a bunch of indicators such as MACD, MACD Zero-Lag, RSI, ADX, Parabolic SAR, Stochastic Oscillator as inputs to the AI model or to an heuristics model.- It can monitor each and every transaction (via Binance API) and can buy or sell immediately once a transaction has shifted the indicators in a certain direction. It does not wait for \"candles\" like minutes, hours, etc.- It can do simulations, you can vary certain parameters between certain values and it can select the value that worked best- Everything is configurable via a config file- Has a web console in which you can see simulations of what would have happened in the past if using the robot- Can work in dry-run or real mode- It can currently use BTC to USD transactions but it can be Â - It can run on a Raspberry PI or any virtual machineThis software is written from scratch, it is not based on anything already available and does not have many dependencies.The ideal customer for this is a Javascript developer (or software company) which is interested in either turning it into a service or using for own purposes.If you are interested, please let me know. I can provide screenshots, source code screenshots or any information may be of interest.This is a very serious offer.",

If yes, then can you share the result?Every software has dependencies. A dependency is a standard term in software development, referring to the libraries or other external components used as building blocks for that software. The AI will update with the frequency that you set it to and on the past period that you select.The bot has so many configurable strategies and strategy building blocks, its performance simply depends on how it is configured.",
