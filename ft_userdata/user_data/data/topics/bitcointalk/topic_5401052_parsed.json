  "content": "The moving story about the bitcoin emergency last night has helped me, last night my wife gave birth to my first child at 02:45 at one of the nearest clinics about 500 meters from my house and at that time I didn't have any cash, which I actually had prepared for ATM birth fees.because the ATM is far from my place and I immediately took my wife to the clinic and all I thought about was my wife's safety, and at that time I was confused about the delivery fee because I didn't have cash and if I went to the ATM it was very far and also my wife no one to accompany and provide support during childbirth.and after my wife and first child survived, the doctor took off his robe he wore a t-shirt with a small bitcoin image and spontaneously I asked if the doctor was involved with bitcoin and he said yes. And then I rubbed my chest and I said can I pay all the birth fees in bitcoin and I ended up paying in bitcoin about 0.007 or about $210.sorry if my words are not good and also incomplete because this is my first experience paying using bitcoin by accident and it doesn't mean the clinic accepts payments using bitcoin but coincidentally the owner and he himself is a doctor and happens to be involved with bitcoin.and my son's name: Muhammad Alvan ...... (male) and born on June 2, 2022 at 02:45.And it's also my first time to create a Thread because of the unexpected and unforgettable experience",

Through his birth your child have made you experience spending in terms of bitcoin. The birthdate looks really special with  June 02/2022. You've got a person in contact who is using bitcoin (The Doctor). Take care of Mom and Kid.",

The birthdate looks really special with 02/02/2022. You've got a person in contact who is using bitcoin (The Doctor). Take care of Mom and Kid.Thanks @KennyR. All of this was completely unexpected because the doctor predicted the birth on June 4/5 and it turned out to be an early delivery so I didn't have time to take the cash because it was so sudden.and I also didn't think the doctor was involved with bitcoin even though I had come twice to check my wife's pregnancy and the third time came to give birth.and I will take very good care of my wife and children.",

I believe that was a good coincidence and things work out in some ways you cannot imagine. Considering your fiat situation and the time it would have taken to go to the ATM. It is gradual and I believe that Bitcoin will eventually be global in acceptance, and the rest of the people will catch up.Congratulations to the family again.",

I think this day you're lucky enough and I wish you with your families in good health.Anyway are you really don't have any problem to wrote your child name and the born time? I think it's not really a common name and someone might find you from this information, so my suggestion is to wipe it.",

You need to go back and find an atm to pay for it. Well actually, I was thinking if they dont accept debit card right or some sort of remmitance for easy payment. Nowadays, almost all services accepts it now for conveniency especially its a clinic.",

I am sure a lot of other people have similar stories that didn't come up to light. Bitcoin personally had saved me from an motorcycle accident where I didn't have any cash on me. So I had used my mobile phone to convert some bitcoins to fiat currency and paid through bank transfer to the clinic. Bitcoin was indirectly involved there. Wish you all the very best. It's a big responsibility and may god provides you all the strength.",

I'm aware that this incident could also make us find out the other bitcoin holders and investors but I'm more worried about a wrench attack.",

In fact, for bitcoin you can buy anything in this world if the seller is willing to accept it like a doctor with a \"t-shirt with a small bitcoin image\".A small life-hack that I learned from this story: if you are ready to accept payment at bitcoin, then wear BTC logo on your item of clothing. So anyone can understand what you know about bitcoin and, as the author of this post, they will be able to offer to accept payment at bitcoin for your help or services. This will allow you to immediately understand each other that you are both in the topic of bitcoin.",

Great to see Bitcoin being used in real life situations and accepted by different professionals.It would be a cool story to tell your kid in a few years the circumstance around their birth, and maybe how expensive it would prove to be, if Bitcoin continues to rise and does a ×10 or more. Teasing them with how much it costs.Might be better to keep names and other details private as this forum is privacy designed, except you particularly wish to reveal such information.",

The combination of excitement to share it here (because you paid thru Bitcoin which is very rare if you ask me) and the happiness that you already have a child. For sure this will be unforgettable and a few years from now, you will share this experience from you that you paid the doctor thru Bitcoin which is at that time isn't been accepted by many establishments.Congratulations on your baby and I hope that it will grow like you, an investor. Maybe remove your son's name here because we are in the internet and that might cause you and your family trouble. Just for security purposes though.",

In my opinion that is all what is it about when it comes to crypto currency, financial independence. You were not limited to some plastic cards, bank machines and ATMs or cash. As long as we gave Internet access we are free with crypto currencies, and of course the place needs to accept bitcoins. To me it seems that your son now already has a strong bond to bitcoins. You paid his birth with bitcoins, that's a story you and your son will always remember. I hope becomes interested in cryptos already at a young age. It's something you two can share together.",

The payment of the hospital bills for the birth of your child isn't a mistake, that the hospital in question does not accept bitcoin payment does not mean that you paying them in bitcoin for their services is an accident, there is a first time to every thing, and that you didn't see the sign \"Bitcoin accepted here\" in the hospital environment shouldn't make you conclude that the hospital does not accept bitcoin, the doctor might have in time past accepted bitcoin payment from other patients before you. There are several businesses around the world today that accept bitcoin Payment, though they don't have a sign to show it, and they won't immediately tell you they accept bitcoin payment until you opt to pay in bitcoin.
