      "body": "To me the impact depends on the area you’re looking at it. If it is the price impact, I don’t think we will have the same impact as the other past halving because the percentage of the price movement is reducing this is due to bitcoin facing less volatility than before. For example in the early halving you can easily get a movement of more than 10X but now it is hard. If you look at even the current market price speculation you will notice that the highest the predictions are expected to go is 4X from the previous ATH ($69k). And as we go later in future I think the volatility will still reduce more. As for adoption rate, I think the later we go into more halvings the more impact it gives",

I think if something is obvious in crypto world then it should be the investors attracted to invest after BTC halving occurrence. These type of incidents are the ones which can be used to have profits for sure so we should try our best to get the right value of our investments.Especially newbies should try to get a good amount of profit so their confidence in crypto increases. That type of events are for sure and taking benefits from them rather than only discussing them is the best thing we can do.",

It only reduces new supply in next 210,000 blocks for next four years if you compare next four year new supply with bitcoin mined in previous four years.Quotepreserves decentralized notations on a specific max volume of Bitcoin in the market to maintain stable rewards on the Bitcoin industrial structures.I really don't understand what you want to say and discuss here.QuoteAnd thereafter the halving comes the bull run and the OP will agree with me that every bull runs is accountable to surge an ATH which is resulted just after the halving.A bull run does not need to lead to a new all time high. With Bitcoin, so far, with three previous bull runs, it is true but it can be changed in this cycle or next cycles. Bitcoin already broke 2021 all time high before the halving but will it break 2024 ATH again, make a new ATH, no one knows.By saying \"A bull run does not need to lead to a new all time high\", I implied about altcoins. Many of them don't make new all time highs with a new big bull run of cryptocurrency market. We can say Bitcoin is different than altcoins but in many years later, when Bitcoin block subsidy becomes very small, effects from a Bitcoin halving might be smaller and very mildly. It will be not surprising if in future, Bitcoin will not make a new ATH after a halving.",

As IMHO, halving cause an increment in the ratio of demand and supply, and considering the current situation adoption is increasing day by day due to ETFs.And as the block reward has been reduced by half lesser BTC will come into the market which will decrease the supply as along the block reward more people are now preferring to hold BTC, and during this holding phase many new people join this holding group and end up losing the wallet's key which do the work of burning here. The point is IMO Halving has good impact as it drives people's emotions towards BTC and thus adoptions changes accordingly. What you think?",

It's a little complicated LOL. But anyways, the bitcoin halving impact in the market is not gonna be a huge question mark anymore. Yeah you are right, it is a common knowledge for everyone who is here longer enough to experience at least the last 3 halvings that there is indeed a huge impact positively when the event occurs.

I thought halving was going to be different from the past three but it is no different. They all follow the same similar trend which is that, the movements around halving events were often characterized by a period of stability in which neither significantly increases or decreases sharply. In addition, noting from the past events, we should expect the impact of the halving on bitcoin's price to occur weeks to months after the halving, rather than immediately following the event.",

      "body": "although history shows us that after the halving the price rose a lot, we still need to be cautious this time, I say this because with so many people buying bitcoin and the price is already very high, it is difficult for it to rise much, for example the current price and more than $60,000, so having a 4x increase, for example, we would be talking about $240,000, this is a very difficult task, unlike in the past when we had a price of $10,000 and with a 4x increase we are already at $40,000 , it was easy to see or think about increases of 8x or 10x. Today, with the current talk of 10x increase, it is an almost impossible mission, even a 3x increase is difficult.That's why in my opinion we need to be cautious, those people who bought at $15000 can dream of 10x increases, but for people who are buying today, dreaming of big increases may not be realistic even if a lot of money enters the market, A lot and a lot of money would have to come in and a lot of people wouldn't have to sell, so that we could at least see a 2x increase. It turns out that every time people see prices of $80,000, they will sell $90,000. We will see if even with this current price it will be possible to have a large price increase in the coming months or years.",
