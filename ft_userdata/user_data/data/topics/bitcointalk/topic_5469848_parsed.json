At least the forum has enough space to accommodate whatever it is that's hiddeb in the privatekey link provided above. If really this was a problem that you're battling to solve, why not expatiate it here for us to help you. Must you have to make it look that you're also offering us a favor in return?Secondly, aside from the above-mentioned, it is not just every link you want visit, hence the essence why photo uploads are provided here to help you explain your poin better. How I also wish there are some automatic tools here in the forum that verify links, that will go a long way.Lastly, your level of uncertainty by adding a \"Maybe\" to the bucks you're offering will further disinterest other well meaning members here. I mean, there are a couple of generous experts here that could proffer a solution to your problem for free, but your statements could also easily chase them away.",

That's what I was thinking an I was ready to comment, but you beat me to it.I guess OP just wanted to troll or something?And as others have said, 50$ is quite some greedy reward considering what he could win if it wasn't solved already.Â  Also he wrote \"MAYBE I'll give you something good\" . Yeah right.",

Most likely someone solved the puzzle took the 10 BTC and forgot about the BTC forks.BSV is like $30 and BCH is $200 so for 10 of those itâ€™s like $2300. So paying someone $50 to get $2300 is a great deal.",

Even i asked to chat gpt but that AI has no clue about it. So, the puzzle was solved but no one posted the solution in the past.Maybe with the current hints you can find the solution, i will not even try, for $50 isn't worth it. But will keep an eye on this thread, would be nice to know the solution just out of curiosity.",
