And lately there have been large movements of bitcoins supposedly towards external addresses or rather to the detriment of exchanges, this suggests that perhaps for the first time we are beginning to understand how important it is to keep your savings safe.",

For many, this did not work out, because bitcoin almost always showed negative returns, and if we take quarterly reports, then for the first time in the history of bitcoin, all quarters turned out to be unprofitable.It was pretty bad from the get go, and to think that the bulk of the reason why this downward trend is continuing is because of two events that are not really related to bitcoin: Luna (TERRA) and FTX. We were showing signs of stability and a possible push back to at least $20k in November, but all of it fell down because of the uncertainties brought forth by FTX's downfall. We were so close into seeing a stable $20k pricing, but SBF and Alameda Research really has to go bonkers and bring with them the whole cryptomarket. Quote from: Ratimov on December 30, 2022, 08:13:49 PMBut the gloomy market picture of the current year does not affect the accumulation of bitcoin by long-term holders. On the contrary, savings increased:Long-term savings continue from mid-2021.It is also worth noting that there is less and less real bitcoin on the exchanges, the constant withdrawal of bitcoin from the exchanges has led to the fact that 88% of all bitcoins are not currently on the exchanges. Apparently, people have finally begun to understand that digital gold should only be stored on wallets for which you have a private key. And the exchanges themselves are not credible now, each exchange can now be the next FTX. Keeping your valuable bitcoins there, to put it mildly, is not reasonable.At least people now try to learn at the expense of others. A lot of hacks have happened in the past but people are still not that keen on taking their funds outside of exchanges. They literally waited for one of the biggest exchange to have this scandal before they learn and get their funds to the safety of their own devices/machines. That adage rings true after a lot of people lost their money in FTX due to SBF and Alameda's great money management skills: not your keys, not your bitcoin.",

Pretty much everyone is in a holding situation this year. People now understand and learn how to hold their own assets in their wallets with a private, which also applies to me. After so much drama with FTX no one wants to risk their bitcoin. A well written post on the last day of the year. Happy new year!",

Yes, I totally agree with this very statement of yours, because this year 2022 was equally also the best year to accumulate more Bitcoin for those who could when the price fell to below $16k and still currently fluatuating around the $16k resistance. So for me, Bitcoin remains the idea best option for long term investment at all times",

Even return investors who are interested in buying or even averaging bitcoin this is the best opportunity for you.I see this information as good news that is worth celebrating. These exchanges have caused more harm than good. Before this time most unenlightened bitcoiners had their coins in exchanges but the fall of these firms created so much awareness of the indispensability of keeping your investment in wallets that you have its keys. Some people also learned the hard way because they lost their coins in FTX and others.Most people in my area heard about bitcoin from exchanges but they now know that these firms are not dependable. Hopefully, in the nearest future, the collapse of theae exchanges would not affect the price of bitcoin because most of the coins will be in private wallets.",

Even return investors who are interested in buying or even averaging bitcoin this is the best opportunity for you.I think so, although we have to keep in mind that this cycle has been a disappointment in terms of expected returns and that probably for future cycles we would do well to think that there will not be returns as spectacular as those of the first years.That said, I think we are in a clear buying zone, as they say in the stock market, or for those of us who do DCA, to increase the amount to buy if your economy allows you to do so.If we are clear that Bitcoin is the best digital gold, and an excellent payment system especially for transnational payments and in large quantities, we must also take into account that more than 90% of Bitcoins have already been mined, and that within 4 years we will reach the figure of 20 million. With all this, we must accumulate Bitcoin to the extent of our possibilities because it is an excellent and very scarce commodity.",

Even return investors who are interested in buying or even averaging bitcoin this is the best opportunity for you.It seems to me that several factors influenced here: not only the decrease in the value of bitcoin, but also the fear of storing them on crypto exchanges, which once again showed their fragility.Those who are interested in saving accumulate no matter what, no matter the downs or the ups, if their goal is long-term.It will be interesting to know if this dynamic of accumulation bitcoin will continue next year if the price doesn't change much from the current one.In general, useful research and charts to understand what is happening with the bitcoin market.",

They have come to realize that if it is necessary to use cryptocurrency,therefore, it is their responsibilities to keep it in their custody,in other for them to enjoy the benefits attached to bitcoin and can also hold for long,due to the incompetency of exchanges.Satoshi purpose of creating bitcoin is gradually being achieved and in no time all the bitcoin investors will be keeping their coins themselves and will dump this exchanges as their wallets. The exchanges will not be able to do whatever they like with their customers funds,exchanges will only be needed when necessary. This is really a great improvement on bitcoin from the safety of scandals,as scammers and exchanges will find it difficult to steal peoples funds. Its is time to extend the period of your hodlings.",

But this will only be temporary when the bear season ends and the bull season comes. People will massively send money to centralized exchanges because there is nowhere to sell and trade bitcoins other than centralized exchanges. If people get scared and learn their lessons, people won't use CEX since the mt.gox crash because, in my opinion, Mtgox is much bigger than the FTX crash. We're in the bear season, and people are holding assets, so it's not uncommon for people to withdraw to non-custodial wallets for holding.",

Not to pass judgment, but it often fails or doesn't work.Investing in Bitcoin is more convincing if done on a long-term basis and we think that is still very relevant given the constraints on the crypto market during 2022.Starting 2023, Bitcoin is still at a good point to buy at $16.5K and that price can still be expected to be profitable by choosing to hold for the long term.Here's hoping the new year brings something new.",

I really thought the rally would be one sided and me thinking that having more than 1 bitcoin is just a dream.
