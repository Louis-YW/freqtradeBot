  "content": "Hi Everyone,We are from the EvoPix Studios that has created our own NFTs collection Santa Approved Reindeer Club (SARC) and also create an independent minting website to mint the NFTs. (Link).Now we are also assisting other NFTs developers with creating their own NFT collection that has a own storefront. While OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces are coming up with their own minting features, it has to be noted that these storefronts are not independent ones. These are part of the OpenSea storefront and creators don't have full access. Hence we are providing these services to new NFT developers to have their own storefronts of NFTs. Plus these storefronts will also enable NFT creators to create drops of the NFTs to their followers.In this regard, our fees for establishing your storefronts and deploying the smart contracts will be NIL. We will even bear the initial gas cost of deploying the NFT smart contract and setting up your storefronts. You can set up the NFTs with claimable options, delayed reveal of your NFTs after minting, royalties of any percentage that you want (and not restricted to 10% as in OpenSea). What we will charge is 1% of the revenue from primary sales at the time of actual sales and 1% royalty on secondary sales at the time of those sales. Therefore, you don't have any upfront costs and you pay us only after you have sales. Plus we will be taking a minor portion of your sales, as this incentivizes us to promote your project as well.We have limited slots for availing these services as we are also developing utility into our own NFTs. Hence, we will be prioritizing the requests on FIFO basis (with higher priority to our NFT holders). Reach out to us by replying to this announcement and then we can have a call to discuss your project, feasibility of the project and how we can deploy them and then we can work on the same together. Happy Creating!",
