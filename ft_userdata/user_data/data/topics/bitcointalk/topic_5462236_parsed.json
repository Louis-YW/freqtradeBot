As a result, he tried to reject the inheritance and was spared from having to argue with the lawyer who was reading the deceased father's will, which was being read aloud.

If your friend had shown some effort to learn about the coins, he could have learned about them in a shorter period of time. I am still wondering how your friend isn’t aware of Bitcoins, whereas his father was (assuming he was old). Nevertheless, if you want to make him understand Bitcoins, then do a basic introduction, like why to choose Bitcoins and its advantages over the banking system. The rest regarding how to create a wallet and secure the coins can be easily found on YouTube.",

And because I've just recently joined the forum and have only recently heard of bitcoin, I also need some further recommendations that I will need to share with him.You have done the right thing, i am agreed with you, Because from what i understand with your post, is: Your Friend had not a slight idea of BTC, He/she might be thinking of it as a scam or useless tokens which might have no value. And when you show him the value of some BTC which you might have, Then he must be convinced.I hope my father would know about BTC because if he will, he definitely would teach me, i sometime thinks, what if i came to know about BTC back in 2010. I might be rich but for now i am not regretting on that instead moving forward with future. Quote from: tbct_mt2 on August 06, 2023, 09:04:27 AMYou are newbie and want to teach your friend.

Well, you definitely spent a long time here so you will have more knowledge then i have or OP have. But, judging others knowledge is not advice able, as from the acts of OP i agreed with him because if he is sharing the true story then there was no need to judge him/her.",

People nowadays ignore something they dont understand but when see its worth their eyes glow. Also you didnt mention any amount in this story?Your account was newbie means you just created an account here? Or you already have knowledge about bitcoin even without knowing this forum exist?",

And due to the lack of knowledge it is possible to spend or just use Bitcoin in the wrong way for sure based on your story.",

Are you knowledgeable enough to teach your friend?A member of the forum can be new but knowledgeable about bitcoin and other tasks that need to be completed. Did you realize that a large number of people are unaware of the presence of this forum but are aware of the methods for storing bitcoin? In other words, just because someone is new here doesn't necessarily mean that they don't know anything about bitcoin.

If such individuals join the forum at this time, will they already be novices both in terms of information and the forum itself?QuoteIf your friend inherites it from his father but wants to reject it, why should you engage in?I think the OP accepted the offer since he knew he would earn greatly if his buddies accepted the bitcoins, but this guy doesn't know about it, which is why he is refusing it. I thus believe that the advice they gave him was sound. Additionally, the subsequent father claimed ownership of the bitcoin since he was aware of how it could benefit the guy financially.QuoteI am unsure how his dad can leave information about bitcoin private key, seed to your friend and how the lawyer engages in this case.

Nobody knows they are date of death. For if I'm a bitcoin investor, I'll find someone who I trust among my family members and give him my private information so that anytime I die, they can get access to it, and it will not just be there when my family members maybe have some financial issue and I have the money, but because I'm not on earth, they couldn't get access to it.

You have done a good job by teaching your friend about Bitcoin and letting him know that it's not a waste of inheritance but the classic one. I am just getting bugged up with one thing, if his father was so much into Bitcoin then why his son was not? Did his father never teach him about Bitcoin and have at least a basic introduction to it? I mean its a father who inherited Bitocin that means he had everything planned properly and he must have been a hardcore Bitcoiner for sure. I am not sure what happened in between the Son and Father, but the Son seems to be disinterested from the beginning itself.
