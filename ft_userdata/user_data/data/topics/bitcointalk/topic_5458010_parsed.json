Like we don't want to be forced to use only the US. dollar or any fiat currency.Choices, we need choices and Bitcoin can not eliminate all choices globally. We will still have fiat currencies, soon CBDCs and altcoins, together with gold, other metals, and other things can be used as currencies, commodities etc.Such world with only Bitcoin exists in memes and no where else.",

It’s not a currency but something that was implant or tattoo to people in able to make a transaction. While the world will have a single currency to transact.I doubt that this is Bitcoin since it's decentralized while the currency being mention in the Bible shows a centralization since there's someone controlling the people to use it. I think it will be the currency of the super power nation in case world war 3 happened or CBDC since this starting to be implemented globally.",

This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666 You're telling me that Bitcoin is a sign of the coming of the Antichrist? Besides, if you're a true believer of God you should refuse the mark, so you're making it look like all Bitcoiners have signed a pact with the Antichrist and all the no coiners are martyrs.Seriously!!!!

      "body": "I haven't heard of this before, so I decided to google it. This seems to be a great article because it overviews what the Bible actually says, referring to specific fragments that can be interpreted as relevant to the matter of one government and one currency. As one can see, there's nothing specific about a single currency there. Also, keep in mind that we're talking about the apocalypse here, so thinking that Bitcoin will be that single currency isn't really giving it a good reputation, considering that it's supposed to be the world at its lowest moral point, pretty much.Only some of us are Christians, so to many these interpretations and prophecies don't matter at all, but those who are Christians must remember that there are very different approaches of religious hermeneutics (interpretation of texts): some believe in the literal meaning of the Bible, others advocate allegorical (figurative) meaning, and some argue for the double meaning. You don't need to take the Bible literally to count as a Christian, and you surely don't need to commit to far-fetched interpretations like that there will be only one currency at the end of the world, even if you do believe in the prophecy overall.",

I don't know the religious background of your statement but if you are thinking Bitcoin will be the last currency in the world, you are surely over-thinking. Bitcoin can't be the only currency used in the world. It can neither be the reserve currency of the world. Bitcoin can't handle such huge affairs. The network has a limitation and Bitcoin can play well within the limit of its network. Anything beyond its capacity will destroy the network. If something is used as the last currency of the world, it will be gold and nothing else.",

Notably, such teaching has been overtaken by the lure of modern material appeals that no one seems to care anymore what happens next. People are getting less godly and to the point they're less concerned about rightful living.Well, to tell you the truth that the \"one-currency\" spoken off (if it ever gets to that point) won't be Bitcoin. I say that with confidence because Bitcoin depends on the internet for its workability. Sadly, there are nations of the world that don't have steady electricity supply let alone internet facilities. How are those nations going to assess the \"one-currency\" then? So, obviously it's not Bitcoin.",

      "body": "A currency to fulfills the requirements of the prophecy has to be a centralized one, because that is the only way it can be controlled by a single party or institution which will enforce it to the whole world. And as we see, centralization's enthusiasts hate Bitcoin, due to its decentralized nature, as it guarantees freedom and privacy to its adopters. Bitcoin isn't accepted by most governments and businesses, so it's definitely not going to be enforced the other way round.I believe the currency mentioned on the prophecy has something to do with the subversion of Bitcoin. That is, governments corrupt Bitcoin's nature and technology creating their own cryptocurrency following BTC's model, but in a centralized format. The \"Last Currency\" must be a kind of CBDC, although so far we have no idea of when it's going to happen and who is going to propose it.",

And i am also not a scholar of bible book because i am a muslim and i have knowledge in Quran Majeed (Book). And your question is really excited me to learn about it. Because bible is an old book and the last book was Quran (which covers almost all the topics covered in bible and other books). So, i do know that if this topic is present in the Bible from the start then there must be something relatable in Quran too.So after asking from one of scholars in Quran, i came to know that, at the end , there will be only one nation and thus there will be one currency but at that time there will be no technology. Because those who are muslim they do know when Israel (issa) will came into this world as a human (not prophet) then he will join imam Mahdi against Dajal and the fight will be fought using swords and such related weapons not with new technological weapons which also indicates that at that time, the chances of technology are zero which also indicates that then there will be no blockchain thus no BTC. Note* this reply based on my religious beliefs so i hope in some way it could be of help for you or atleast give an idea to you.",

It is not even accepted by the whole world, the possibility of global adoption is very low.I think we should take it easy with all these analogies about bitcoin and all.
