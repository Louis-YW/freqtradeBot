  "content": "I created a project as a hobby in July. It's an fun concept, but I do not have time to dedicate to it.In the simplest sense - it's an ecosystem on Arbitrum that births unique gemstones with varying characteristics. The goal was to emulate the natural occurrence of gemstones on the blockchain.Here's the mechanism:- Users generate RC721 tokens by paying a fee, which is directly transferred to a burn address (this process is immutable .-The cost of the ERC721 token incrementally rises with each creation. (There's a tiny increase of +0.000001 with every mint).-Users have the option to either \"lock\" or exchange their ERC721 token in a smart contract for ERC20 tokens, named SDX.Stack:-React-BootstrapI'm open to handing over this project to anyone interested in keep it alive. If interested, please PM me. Note: Please understand that this project isn't structured for generating profit, and aspects like token supply, distribution, and fees are intrinsically set by its design and cannot be altered. This is in line with the project's ethos of preventing the enrichment of any single entity.
