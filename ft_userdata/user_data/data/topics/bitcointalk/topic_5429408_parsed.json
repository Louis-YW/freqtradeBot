  "content": "The recent discussion about some politicians wanting to introduce KYC/AML requirements for miners (which I of course do hope will never come, in no country of the world) brought me to think about the censorship problem, i.e. the dangers of miners blacklisting certain UTXOs or addresses.Currently, Bitcoin's censorship resistance is based purely on incentives. A miner can include or censor the transactions he wants to, but if he doesn't chose those with most fees included, he will make less profit. And if a transaction gets rejected but pays significantly more fees than the current lower bound to be included, it is likely that another miner will include it in one of the next blocks.Now: What if e.g. 99% of miners blacklist an address or UTXO, would the current system be enough? Would there be a way to improve that, introducing new protocol rules? I have basic understanding of computing and blockchain tech but not advanced enough to know if an improvement is principally impossible or if there only hasn't been enough research on this.If there was research, even the goal it was deemed impossible, I would be grateful for links, possible BIPs, mailinglist discussions etc.As a layman one could imagine, for example, a mechanism where signatures of transaction data by potential miners are collected before the \"real\" inclusion of the block. (Edit: I clarify here that this is not a serious proposal but only an example where an idea for an approach could be starting.)The example I had in mind: Miners could publicly first sign all transactions to acknowledge they have received them. Three new rules are introduced for tx inclusions in blocks:1) They can only include transactions which they have publicly signed before.2) They cannot include any transaction which has a lower fee than another transaction they didn't include but have previously signed.3) Any node (\"challenger\") can challenge a recent block proving that the miner hasn't followed rule 1 or 2, and if he can prove it, then the \"challenger\" node gets the block reward and fees (this would need major protocol changes, but should be possible as similar mechanisms exist in \"slashing\" PoS protocols).This is in the end also a \"financial incentive\" to not censor, but it should be much stronger than the current mechanism as an entire block reward + fee would be in danger for the censoring miner.The problem is, obviously, \"where and how do the miners exactly publicly sign the transactions\"? There would have to be a \"global state\" of all these signatures.If they have to sign the complete transaction data on-chain (i.e. as an \"attachment\" to an earlier block, which later could be pruned), then they could censor transactions in this step based on blacklisted UTXOs, like they would when they decide which transaction they include in a block. Probably nothing would have been won, although I could imagine situations where a \"cartel\" censoring transactions could have to be bigger with such an approach if two different miners have to intervene in a \"approval\" of a transaction.Where my doubt is if there is a way to make them sign only the TXID or incomplete transaction data without the identification of UTXOs, without possible \"challengers\" being able to game the system, never transmitting the complete data to the miners. Is this perhaps possible with zero-knowledge approaches? Or could there be a second step, i.e. once the challenger has proven a miner has violated the rules, the miner gets some kind of second chance (as then the transaction data would be publicly known due to the challenger)?",

At the moment, I see no reason to change it any time soon.For now, I was interested mainly in the theoretical possibility, for the case censorship could be a problem eventually. The example I gave was only a possibility I could imagine where, from a layman's perspective, a solution may lie, not at all really a \"proposal\". I've clarified this now in the OP.Maybe Lightning could also be an instrument to mitigate the threat, although of course the channels with coins with problematic history which could be blacklisted would have to be opened before the 51% censorship attack begins (and the problem is that those could then also not be closed during the censorship attack).@NeuroticFish: Exactly that is the problem if we don't collect the signatures on-chain in some way; thus the idea to \"collect\" signatures of partial transaction data in earlier blocks, but of course if these include the UTXO data, then these could be censored too (as the miner mining this block would see they contain a blacklisted UTXO and simply not process the signature); basically the problem would only be transferred to another miner (who in the case of an 51% attack will also be part of the censorship cartel).",

You can't censor what you can't see.I had definitely thought about Monero as well. But I thought that there could be still a censorship problem, as I supposed miners still see all the origins (i.e. the UTXOs where all inputs of the block originate) of the transactions, only that they apply a mandatory CoinJoin to it.Maybe I'm wrong and they can't see that (due to a kind of stealth address, perhaps?), I unfortunately don't know the Monero protocol that well. If I'm wrong and miners can't censor anybody in the Monero protocol, then at least we can say that the problem is theoretically solvable and that would be awesome Then of course the question would be: could such a mechanism also be added to Bitcoin eventually in a way censorship is prevented? Or perhaps other mechanisms, coming e.g. from Zcash, Grin/Mimblewimble etc.?What about Taproot and P2SH?Edit: Just searched the Web a bit and found an interesting article leading me to this research. The essence seems to be that tracking/censorship would be still possible in Monero but only with a complicated \"elimination\" process, and that a recent upgrade made these attacks even harder.

Another possibility to prevent this kind of miner censorship is to expand upon coinjoins.At the moment, if a miner wants to censor your transaction, then they simply don't include it will lose the fee of your transaction only, which is like to be a few hundred to a few thousand sats and therefore of no real consequence to them. Let say instead that your transaction is part of a much larger coinjoin transaction, with 50 inputs and 100 outputs, and a combined fee of 100,000 sats. To censor your transaction they would need to exclude the entire coinjoin transaction, and lose out on a much larger fee. What if that coinjoin transaction included 200 inputs, or 500, or 1000? At some point it becomes worth enough that a miner is going to want to include it to cash in on the very large fee, especially over time as we move more and more towards the scenario of fees (rather than block subsidy) being the primary source of miner income.",

While it is theoretically possible to introduce new protocol rules to achieve this, it is unlikely that such changes would be accepted by the wider Bitcoin community and would likely require a hard fork of the network.In general, the best way to ensure censorship resistance is to maintain a decentralized and competitive mining landscape, where miners have incentives to act in their own self-interest and include as many high-fee transactions as possible in order to maximize their profits. This helps to ensure that the network can continue to process and validate transactions without interference or manipulation by any individual or group of participants.",

Especially once fees start being worth more than subsidy.And still, if not via Stratum then it is still a good concept which we could see developed and rolled out in other software. Improving decentralization by allowing every individual miner to craft candidate blocks if they want, rather than just settling for centralized control via the pool operator, can only be a good thing.",

      "body": "The problem is when people say \"the government\" it really comes down to which / what government.Worrying about a transaction being blocked is not any type of a concern since there are large mining pools across the world operating under different rules and government regulations and some of those government don't like each other. A pool operating in the US will probably listen to the US government and possibly others. Do you really think that one operating in Kazakhstan or Russia give a crap about what the US government says? Malaysian pools may care or may not. And so on.Not something worth worrying about.-Dave",
