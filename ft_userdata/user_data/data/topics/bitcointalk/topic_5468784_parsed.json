  "content": "\"Monday's sentencing hearing promises to be very interesting, as the government will be arguing that I should pay restitution to scammers' victims who lied to me to get me to sell them bitcoin. Please join me 10 am, Oct 2nd, at Concord Fed Court.\"SourceI was surprised to learn lately that the person who first introduced Roger Ver to Bitcoin years ago was Lan Freeman. According to the record he (Lan) has done alot of work and evangelism for Bitcoin which was also what led him to be targeted by the FBI in 2021 for opening the people's eyes to the facts about BTC, Censorship, KYC, etc.This is another eye open for every BTC enthusiast, if you must evangelize BTC do it smartly because just as the government blinds the people's eyes to the facts and makes us see what they (the government) want on the news, social media (an example is when Elon expose the government intervene on Twitter and others), etc. They also don't want the people to know the facts about BTC and that's one of the reasons for their game about BTC spot ETF approval.",

One thing I have understood so far is that the government would always look for ways to distract us from anything that would make us realize the truth and change the way we use and transact business with money. A lot in happening and I am very sure that many people are going to see the light and see for Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin had been an eye opener to many of us that had chosen to adoption Bitcoin which had created a world of cryptocurrency. The crypto market is growing gradually and very soon the government is going to look for ways to make us reduce our interest on Bitcoin with the use of tax and other means.",

If money laundering and romance scam is the reason for his (Lan Freeman) crime, we will know soon cause he claimed he was accused of selling BTC. For the disabling of KYC, I wonder if that's really a crime since the whole process seems to be through physical P2P, and if I remember correctly KYC was mandatory for crypto exchange in the year 2019 in the US Quote from: Bushdark on October 05, 2023, 07:43:35 PMQuote from: suzanne5223 on October 01, 2023, 02:36:10 PMThis is another eye open for every BTC enthusiast, if you must evangelize BTC do it smartly because just as the government blinds the people's eyes to the facts and makes us see what they (the government) want on the news, social media (an example is when Elon expose the government intervene on Twitter and others), etc. They also don't want the people to know the facts about BTC and that's one of the reasons for their game about BTC spot ETF approval.

You have a point because the government never liked the decentralization concept of crypto. What Ian Freeman said is that was accused of paperwork violation for selling Bitcoin but the government's end, the story is different.",

BTC, fiat, gold bars, cars, whatever. Remember here in the US you still have to pay taxes on your sales of stolen goods and narcotics sales:https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/3909450-yes-the-irs-wants-you-to-report-stolen-items-unless-you-return-them/People gave him 'dirty' money and he gave them 'clean' money. Had he actually paid the 30% tax and kept records then he would be in the clear of this. Still would have to deal with the facilitating crimes issue, but that is another case.-Dave",

Money laundering existed and still exists before and after Bitcoin, while governments and banks turn a blind eye to the billions of dollars that were laundered under the eyes of the government and banks.You must have heard of the FinCEN Files, as these secret files leaked over the years revealed secret deals, money laundering, and financial crimes.QuoteLeaked documents involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world.They also show how Russian oligarchs have used banks to avoid sanctions that were supposed to stop them getting their money into the West.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54226107",

But I guess we can be very sure this played a part as well.Although to be honest, I have never heard of this guy before. Probably most of you haven't either.It's more or less another case study in what happens (especially) when you do the two things the IRS hates most - not paying taxes and laundering money.",
