Not Solana, right ?Hello Neverlonely and Welcome to bitcointalk forum.1) Why don't you provide further info about your career? A portofolio containing some of your previous works can help a lot. With a portofolio, your offer may get much more attention than what you've expected.2) This is a bitcoin forum, so you have to set bitcoin as main (or alternative) payment option for your service. You can also accept altcoins as a method of payment but in this case you will have to move your topic to the altcoin board.",
