      "body": "It might depend on what happens next. The two nations making peace might be harder than the 3 or more that could come out of Russia if they have some sort of split and revolution (but that might be a while away - the one that collapsed the Soviet Union took a long time to happen). I could see something like that starting if the EU chose to only accept certain individuals from Russia (such as those closest to the border) but that might be unlikely and isn't the only way. I still believe the enemy of your enemy is your friend is less accurate than the enemy of your enemy is probably worse... Russia and Ukraine might be able to draw up peace deals and come to terms with the war and perhaps even reconcile over it only if Ukraine does well out of it and Russia doesn't do too badly (as a country doing very badly from a war normally leads to strong nationalism - so instead of only having 300k people that'll comply with Putin''s demands, it'd spiral into millions for the next generation wanting to take back what they're owed). Russia isn't a wealthy country either (materialistically or financially so they'd be able to blame the war for that and not the government mismanagement it was). I doubt the World will heal quickly from Russia's invasion either. Even China probably added extra troops to their border after learning a neighbour could still be hostile enough to invade.",

I hope that Russia and Ukraine can make peace soon. but maybe, will it be difficult for these two countries to make peace? Reconciliation would be very difficult and costly. Almost all parties in this war have their conditions for a peace deal. Russia wants to integrate occupied territories and it is achieving this through a referendum. Russia also wants Ukraine to commit not to join NATO in the future. Ukraine wants Russia to leave all its territories before any peace deal would be discussed and they want to reclaim all. annexed territories including Crimea. NATO wants to ensure that Russia is discouraged from invading Ukraine and other allies.Peace can only be accomplished through compromise, dialogue, and sacrifice. All parties have lost so many things from this war but the cost of the war should be set aside and the present and future consequences should be considered.",

      "body": "The war may intensify before peace is reached, but there is honestly no other option.  They are neighbors and neither of them appear to be going anywhere.  The dispute isn't going to end one of them and is more likely going to be solved with an agreement about their behaviors and borders.  Otherwise the fighting will just continue.  I doubt one of them is just going to give up the fight.  It's possible that finances or leadership issues may bring a ceasefire, but at the end of the day I think the people want peace and at some point in time they will get it.  It's just a matter of how much more damage has to be done before both sides agree that fighting is not in their best interests.",

In a perfect world, yes, both states must take steps toward reconciliation, and the rest of the world must force and ensure peaceful solutions, as it is known that ordinary citizens are suffering. However, war is not and can never be a solution.",

      "body": "Can they reconcile? Well, I personally doubt that. Not in the near future, at least. Russia has had Ukraine in it's sights since after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. And despite being neighbors, you'd think Putin would relent in his pursuit for supremacy, but no. I mean, he won't pass up on the idea of amassing to his collections the rich mineral resources  Ukraine is endowed with. Ukraine is blessed with Earth metals and lithium reserves with an estimated value of deposits ranging from $3-11.5trn and imagine him laying his hand on these! More avenue to boost his economy since lithium is one of the metals needed to create EVs.",

Looks like this war will not gonna end soon because of how the other nations getting involved in it each one of them have its own mission and they are making it like a ground where they can test some of their weapons for real.",

Many countries have had disputes in the past and now it almost seem like they never did, so it is not an impossible. on a public scale reconciliation can happen, but individually Ukrainian citizens who have lost friends, relatives, immediate family and some very difficult to replace properties will hoard personal grudges against Russia which can be extended to any russian citizen they come across. Before all the wounds that Russia have caused  Ukraine can completely heal, it will take some time, time is what heals after all.",

      "body": "Of course, this is not far from happening, but it remains a hypothesis related to what will happen next. According to preliminary indications, Russia is not ready to sit at the negotiating table before achieving all its goals, including Ukraine's disengagement from its European neighbors and with NATO in particular. Of course, this is difficult to verify, and it is what hinders peace from the Russian side. At the same time, Ukraine can impose this peace if it succeeds in achieving parity of forces on the ground, which will convince the Russians that this war will drain them.There are many scenarios that could lead to peace between them, including international support. However, it seems that all international efforts are in the interest of one of the two parties, and therefore the crisis will prolong as long as there are beneficiaries.",

I hope that Russia and Ukraine can make peace soon. but maybe, will it be difficult for these two countries to make peace? No i don't think so. One could dream but, even if there would be an \"official\" peace deal, and it would be in any way russians terms, that wouldn't suit for some people who lost relatives, and they would probably take justice in their own hands and could even form form terrorist cells against them to repay all the horrors they went though. Maybe if Ukraine got their original borders back, they would accept it.Worst case scenario i can think of now is Trump becoming president and withdrawing funding. Because that's roughly what happened when US left afgans on their own to deal with ussr and look how that turned out. And now it would happen to very skillful highly trained soldiers. They would blame US as well and that wouldn't end well.",

I think is possible they will reconcile the differences after the war is over. Politics is different from home affair and the people fighting will one day die and new people will make the new friendship. Those leaders causing the fighting now will retire, old or die and recognise they did wrong and institute committee for reconciliation.

I doubt there's gon be a reconciliation after the war has ended, because even if a wound can fade, the scars will remain. This invasion by Russia is in my opinion, an attack by a bully who's somewhat selfish..  On daily basis, the innocent citizens of both countries live in fear and uncertainty. This war, when ended would serve as history to those unborn and as such, they will never forget. Personally, if there'd be a relationship in the future between the two, it will be strained.",
