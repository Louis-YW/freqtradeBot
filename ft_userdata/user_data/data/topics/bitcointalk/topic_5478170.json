  "content": "After holding my bitcoin for a long time, i think i have somehow completly fucked up and they are gone. I have my bitcoin stored on a ledger and use ledger live. I have had a new pc recently so decided to install ledger live on my new pc. It dosn't show up my bitcoin account. So i went back to my original PC and ledger live still shows my bitcoin there. However when i try and make a tx i get an error message which i will provide in photos. Also when i connect my HW wallet to another bitcoin wallet like Electrum or Sparrow wallet they find absolutely nothing either, apart from a small account with some dust that ledger live also finds, which i sent the bitcoin from. I am gutted . For some reason in 2019 i sent my bitcoin to this address here 19NduweV3Hn8RXHFBQ32pKwCtbP5RBKwQwledger live on my old pc still still shows this account as mine as you can see in the photo. Yet dosn't let me send any bitcoin from this address. My life savings gone on some dumb error on my part.The only saving grace i can think of. Is that this account is a 'secret account' where you can add an extra word to your 24 word pass phrase. Which i do remember setting it up as i have it wrote down. However i am not sure i ever sent bitcoin to this. The problem is i had to recently buy a new ledger hw wallet because of the screen dimming issue on my old one. So maybe i need to set up the 25th secret word on the device propely? and by some miracle the bitcoin is in that account. i dont know how though?And i havn't input the 24 word key into my new device wrong because this key has some shit coins on it which it found. I know its only 1.7ish bitcoin, but its basically most of my life savings. Thinking i had done everything right buying a hw wallet and storing my coins myself and now its gone is heart breaking. I know this is on me, somehwere i have fucked up and dont know how but still.Any advice much appreciatedi am sorry i am not sure how to add images.",

So you can see this small amount in Sparrow, Electrum, and even in Ledger, but the difference is that Ledger also shows the 1.7 BTC which you say you can't spend? It would help if you could share a screenshot (by uploading it to an image provider) of the error you're getting.",

Without it you will be getting a total new different wallet, it works like a passphrase. The extended seed in electrum is basically to create multiple wallets from one seed phrase with just different custom word at the end.",

I'm aware of that but I'm asking about the \"connection process\" between Ledger and Electrum/Sparrow. Do you actually need any of that instead of just plugging and authorizing the connection from the device?",

Do you actually need any of that instead of just plugging and authorizing the connection from the device?Not at all I read your post wrongly, i thought it is about importing the wallet. The connection between the hardware wallet (ledger is this regard) with any of the software wallet doesn’t need a seedphrase because logically that will defeat the purpose of offline wallet concept offered by the hardware wallet. Quote from: mikeywith on December 16, 2023, 08:47:22 PMbut that address he posted is P2PKH aka Lagecy address which starts with '1', when he connects the wallet to Electrum, he probably uses P2WPKH aka Native SegWit starting with 'bc1' and thus those Lagecy addresses won't show, I also think this is the default behavior for the new ledge live app.The reason why he couldn't spend from the old ledger which does show the balance is probably due to outdated software \"common with Ledger\".This is also my guess, but my suggestion is if the hardware wallet back up seed phrase is available and he is finding it hard to connect it can’t he just import it into another wallet like electrum and the choose the right address type (legacy address type). This could be easier than the other methods I think",

These wallets utilize a standard seed phrase, which can consist of 12 or 24 words, depending on the user's choice. Wallets that support multi-signature transactions or other more sophisticated features usually use the extended seed phrase format. Quote from: Zaguru12 on December 16, 2023, 08:06:13 PMYes you need to add the custom word that you use to extend the seed. Without it you will be getting a total new different wallet, it works like a passphrase. The extended seed in electrum is basically to create multiple wallets from one seed phrase with just different custom word at the end. Yes, it is a really good explanation of how Electrum's expanded seed phrase functions. In order to generate a new wallet with a distinct set of addresses, the custom word (also known as the passphrase) is effectively a \"salt\" that is added to the seed phrase. This feature helps users to keep their money organized and distinct by enabling them to establish several wallets from a single seed phrase. But in order to get into the wallet, you have to remember the personalized word.",

For some reason in 2019 i sent my bitcoin to this address here 19NduweV3Hn8RXHFBQ32pKwCtbP5RBKwQwElectrum or Sparrow need to know the proper derivation path to know about the correct addresses and keys of your wallet. If you have used multiple accounts in your Ledger Live wallet then this needs to be setup accordingly in Electrum or Sparrow.Your address 19NduweV3Hn8RXHFBQ32pKwCtbP5RBKwQw still has five UTXO that sum up to ‎1.54580626BTC. I can only guess that this address is part of another account index of your wallet and therefore doesn't show up automatically unless you setup this account in your new Ledger Live wallet, too.Could also be an issue of wallet gap limit. I'm just dropping key words that pop into my mind regarding your problem.My personal advice would be to always properly document the creation a another wallet's account (when created, for what reason and purpose, ...). Anyway, I don't think all hope is lost for you. Just don't do stupid things and particularly never input your mnemonic recovery words into an online website.Quote from: skiddybop on December 16, 2023, 06:27:56 PMThe only saving grace i can think of.

So maybe i need to set up the 25th secret word on the device propely? and by some miracle the bitcoin is in that account. i dont know how though?To my knowledge of Ledger Live crap an optional mnemonic passphrase (that additional \"25th word\"; it's not necessarily a single word, it can basically be anything) generates a whole new wallet which itself can have multiple accounts. You can't apply an optional mnemonic passphrase to a single additional account of a wallet. But I'm no Ledger and Ledger Live crap user.I suggest you learn a bit more about hierachical deterministic wallets, derivation paths and account indices and maybe gap limit, too.See here: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/hd-wallets (it's beneficial to look around all pages of that site to learn more about Bitcoin).",

There will be an options button or a gear symbol or something you can click on (sorry I can't be more specific, I don't use Ledger Live) and in that options menu it will tell you the derivation path of that account which is holding your coins. It will look something like this:Code:m/44'/0'/0'Link your hardware wallet to Electrum, and when you get to the script type page, select \"Legacy (P2PKH)\" and enter the exact same derivation path as from Ledger Live.If that wallet is empty, go to the console tab in Electrum (View -> Show Console) and paste the following to increase the gap limit:Code:wallet.create_new_address(False) for i in range(100)If that wallet is still empty, then chances are you used an additional passphrase which you will need to brute force if you don't remember it.",
