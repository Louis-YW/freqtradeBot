  "content": "In my opinion, the existing POW algorithm consumes too much energy, and POS weakens decentralization, so we need a more energy-efficient POW algorithm. Disk mining is a good option. But Proofs-of-Spacetime is too complex, and we need a simpler disk mining technology. Here are my thoughts:1. First, the miner needs to precompute the hash and store it. In order to prevent miners from giving results through real-time calculations, the hash calculation process must be complex enough so that the cost of storage and query is much lower than the cost of calculation. And the cost of verification must be low enough.2. We need an ASIC-friendly algorithm because ASICs are more efficient, which means that the data center's CPU or GPU cannot be used to challenge the security of the network.3. In addition, in the long run, the miner's income must be greater than the energy cost, otherwise the mining machine will be shut down. This means that a fixed number of coins which slightly larger than the mining energy consumption will be sold in the market every day, which is undoubtedly not conducive to maintaining prices. So we are motivated to reduce this energy consumption. In addition to disk mining, using ASIC-friendly algorithms is also a method.Welcome to receive your discussions and opinions.",
