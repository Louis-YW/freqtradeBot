      "body": "It is not advisable to go short now. If done, it should be done in a short time like less than a day because if the bull market start, it will not be easy at all. Also as traders go short, they also still go long and make money from it as bitcoin price is volatile within certain price range recently. The price of bitcoin has been significant plummeted and likely at its lowest level for now, while people that short can make money for now, it would not be a surprise if the bull market will start and some people will fall into bear trap at the time. Advising people to short this time is very wrong, it is better to hold and if you want to use leverage, best to go long.",

The growth that can happen on it is having the demand and most people will pay stable coins and their choice might be USDT.But aside from that, I don't see anything correlated from what you're saying as it'll grow like bitcoin.They have difference on their growth and their value remains different, USDT as a stable one while bitcoin is highly volatile for its price.",

It seems that's the point of what you're saying about this bear market.No doubts about the volume of it as it's really known that stable coins got more volume than bitcoin. Well, that doesn't answer anything from my curiosity of what you're telling me with.",

It's not enough to say \"go short and stay short for a bit\" because if there's no one providing liquidity to help you exit, you're stuck with an open position until there is.That might not happen as much since this bear market has a lot of volume but it's not a low risk trade.",

Any shorts should have been placed at $69k to be profitable not at $16k. Any profit made at this point is tiny with a high chance of actually leading to losses.",
