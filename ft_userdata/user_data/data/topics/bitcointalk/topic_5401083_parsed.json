Can I use UST tokens as collateral?Under normal circumstances I would be 99% certain this is trolling, but after looking at your post history I'm not so sure.  You might actually be serious.  Why don't you just buy Luna directly with your Terra tokens?  Anyway, the transaction fees are more than the interest you've offered, so even with collateral it's not something likely to happen.",

If it was possible to get recovered, we wouldn’t see Luna Classic and Version 2.0. Also, for your info, Luna Version 2.0 is another of the same quality product as it was. This will also have the same future as of the old Luna. Be careful, you better sell your UST and get $1 as in future, they are most likely to get more devalued.",

After all, bybit will give only $20, it cannot immediately close the commission and interest on the loan. I am registered on bybit exchange and passed KYC, but they did not return the UST peg to $1, so my deposit was stuck in UST candy wrappers",
