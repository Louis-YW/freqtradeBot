So, why don't they use it on people if it is so effective? I think you will find that almost none of those animals you listed, if on fenbendazole regularly, ever gets cancer. Could it be that they don't want a cure for cancer? Seems logical. If cancer was cured, no more cancer treatment money for the medical people.Now, I know that you weren't really trying to help people. You were simply putting in a plug for the murdering medical, so that, hopefully, they can keep on making money at the expense of the people.So, take your own advice, and look up the reports listed at the website in the OP. I mean, results are results. Something like 600,000 deaths a year from cancer under the care of the medical.",
