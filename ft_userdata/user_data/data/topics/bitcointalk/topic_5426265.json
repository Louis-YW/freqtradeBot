On the website go to wallet details tab and import the key in a plain text format. If it returns a valid bitcoin address, your key is correct otherwise some letters might be wrong. The error code you just mentioned usually occurs when one or more letters in the priv. key is invalid, might be a human error from your side.",

That's the recipe for disaster (ie getting your keys stolen).If you want to make this kind of tests, learn to get the source and open it in an offline (and safe) environment.My guess is also that you've probably mistyped something or confused some letters.",

Then, there was very little knowledge sources available online.This sounds like a scam to me.Only you should know the private key, since that's the only \"thing\" that allows spending coins.If the seller also knew the private key then:* there's a high probability he gave you from start a bad/invalid key* if by chance the key was good, there's a good chance that meanwhile the seller has checked back and spend those coins/sent them to his own wallet.When you buy bitcoin you should get your own wallet (if you are not knowledgeable about this and it's a meaningful amount of bitcoin then you should use hardware wallet) and give the seller an address of yours where he will send the coins. The coins are really yours only if they (are confirmed and) show up in a wallet only you can spend from = only you have the private keys.Quote from: Tofee on December 07, 2022, 01:21:05 PMSince the privkey has not been activated for many years, is there any possibility of keys invalidity?

Your story sounds very strange, and you must have been victim of fraud. First of all, CoinPal didn't give private keys. No legitimate business does. CoinPal, as far as I've read, was a service which asked you to submit a Bitcoin address, pay the Paypal invoice, and have the bitcoin received. Secondly, there's no way a legitimate business told you to \"destroy the email\". Emails from large email-corps don't get deleted either way, they sit on the email server's just in case. Have you deleted those emails? There's a chance you used a fake CoinPal site.",

I am only talking about things people could send you in private.CoinPal was a legit service back in the days, but it didn't work the way you described above. You can take a look at this YouTube video to see how the purchases used to work. The one thing CoinPal used to send to its customers via email is a transaction ID that could be entered into a blockchain explorer to check the transaction data online.
