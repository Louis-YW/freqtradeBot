  "content": "Increase community and customer engagement by leveraging high quality Live Support & Community Management servicesLive Support & Community Management are crucial to ensuring that the maximum amount of engagement with your community and/or customers is achieved both in instant messaging platforms such as Telegram, Discord, Element (Matrix) and Slack as well as directly from your website. You could be losing hundreds of customers who may be potentially interested in purchasing your product/service or community members who are potentially interested in contributing to your project. Managing a community and live support desk can be tiresome and can take business owners and team members away from tasks that utilize their skills to their maximum potential. By hiring one or more of my team of live support agents and community managers, you can put time back into growing your endeavor while taking full advantage of potential clients and community members!Multiple team members are constantly on call, with more on standby in the event that demand exceeds what the current team can cater for. The price of services for community management and live support are based on per agent which can be allocated to one of the shift times listed above. For example, if you'd like 24 hour coverage, you would need to hire three team members to cover all time periods. Prices are allocated per shift, meaning that you will receive 8 hours of work for the price listed.
