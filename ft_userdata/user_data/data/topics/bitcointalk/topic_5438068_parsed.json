  "content": "Bitcoin has been in existence for the past 14 years, with its creator Satoshi Nakamoto unknown till date. For the majority of its existence, bitcoin drew the attention of three major communities: the small community of original investors and true believers, blockchain technology enthusiasts, and speculators looking to make a quick buck. Bitcoin’s main objective was to serve as an alternative to fiat currency which is been controlled by the government. It was just a money with philosophy, having programming and Satoshi’s whitepaper unlike the fiat which has a central bank that regulates it. Today, as the price of bitcoin has risen, it has become yet another investment vehicle for the financial system it was designed to replace.Bitcoin has grown from nothing to something significant in recent years. It has overcome all obstacles and is still alive and well today, gaining popularity and adoption by many people all over the world. They have been transitional development of its stance in the world of digital market since its inception. Many investors, including miners, continue to glide in and support the process.With all of these people working together to keep the project alive and running to this day, there should be no doubt that bitcoin will fail like any other Ponzi scheme to which some people attribute bitcoin to. If someone does not want to join the bitcoin market, he should not be forced or persuaded to do so; instead, they should join at their own volition, but they should stop spreading false information about it, as we can see how it has thrived today since its inception despite the false news against it.The graph above shows how bitcoin price has moved from ($0.09 at 2010 - $18,000 at Dec 2022). Bitcoin latest ATH was $68,991 at Nov 2021. From the graph, they’ve been a transitional movement upward in price of bitcoin. The graph shows how bitcoin hits a new ATH the year following every halving. Halving takes place after every 4 years, and bull run usually takes place after the halving. All of this information indicates a promising future for bitcoin trading/investment/mining. Bitcoin is winning, and its adoption is spreading. There are no restrictions or age limits to understanding and joining the bitcoin community. Nobody is too late to join now, as bitcoin still has a long way to go before the final block is mined into the blockchain around the year 2140, or approximately 117 years from now.https://www.investopedia.com/https://www.theverge.com/",

      "body": "So the best idea that could be suggested here after the long grammars is the conclusion that bitcoin should be invested, hodl and earned, because it's a decentralized currency that allows you to have control with full authorization to how you handle your finances, in addition, that bitcoin has always been volatile upon these journey of 14 years and yet it's value remains intact, people are investing and it's still a profitable currency and asset for an investment.",

It is such a blessing to be alive and to be able to experience this moment. The detractors who claim bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme will keep burying their heads in shame.What we are witnessing is a promising future geared toward enhancing bitcoin and the Blockchain technology in the near future. Bitcoin will continue to grow in leaps and bounds across the globe.",

Blocks are needed to keep the blockchain going and would keep being mined as long as bitcoins are transacted.It would also not be too late to invest when the final bitcoin is added to circulation and anyone would still be able to buy a piece of the pie.- Jay -",

Last year was bear thoroughly that made some newbies to opt-out of the system. Fro those of us that are still in the crypto market as investors or traders, we need to look at the future from and what it will bring to us whether we are currently in loses or not. Just like we have seen the table of how Bitcoin had been moving, it shows us that Bitcoin is still going to hit a height that would surprise everyone of us. This is the time to buy and accumulate some amount so as we ride the market to the moon.",
