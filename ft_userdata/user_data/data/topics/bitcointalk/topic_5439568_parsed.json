This thread should belong to gambling section.Quote from: VinSlied on February 12, 2023, 11:02:38 AMThis is an review on bets.io.Who asked you to give a review on \"bets.io\" right in your first post? You would be better off posting it in their ANN thread instead of making a separate topic. However, bets team seems to be inactive in the forum, not sure if you should still gamble on this site.",

Give them a try üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThere is actually something very fishy about all of this because I see no reason why a newbie account just springs up from absolutely no where with claims against a casino that has long been absent here a d another newbie account also coming out from the blues with clams to defend same casinoWell I'm not pointing fingers at anyone but from closer look, you'll also see that the first account with claims against the casino made hut a single post and same thing with the defending account as well.Whatever the case might be, rather than all this dramas, I think the casino should simply just reactivate their thread and get things straight.",
