  "content": "Edited: I am no more buying this coin again, it does not worth it, it is more of an airdrop coin that people receive and sell. Blur marketplace is good although.Blur is an Ethereum NFT marketplace, it is now competing with OpenSea which is the largest NFT marketplace so far. They have a token which some was airdropped, it is called Blur. Blur price today is $0.8. Coin name: BlurPrice: $0.8All-time-high: Almost $46All-time-ow: $0.43Marketcap: $316 millionI was notified on Kucoin about this coin, I made research about it to later know it is a good project because it is a project from the second largest NFT marketplace. I like the time this coin was listed, it was not in the bull time when the price could have increased, but during this time when crypto market is neither bullish nor bearish after a long bear market time. I think this is one of the good coins that may increase more than 10x to 50x in the next significant bull run.What did you think about this project, can the price get to $50 in the next bull run? I am planning to buy small amount of the coin and continue to DCA with little amount of money. Is it good?",

I think that you shall see the tokenomic and token distribution first. Ir's around 13% of tokens available in the curculating supply now while there are 3 billions tokens in total has been minted. Let's take a look at the tokenomicThat being said that there are so many angel investors who have been still holding (locked) their tokens. The problem is the inflation gonna be preventing the price to go up but potentially driving the price to go down. I can't deny that this one possible to reach billions valuation but this may need whole of crypto users regularly used blur. https://docs.blur.foundation/tokenomicsYou can see that if the first 4 years gonna be a difficult thing for blur. I expect there will be a huge drop for blur during the token release schedule. Angel investors may potentially drive the price to go down caused by angel investors have big pie of tokens.

You can expect the price to go to a few dollars for the peak price but it will not even touch two digits. It's only good for long term but im also still worrying to invest while token release can drive the price to go down so hard.",

I will even edit this topic now for me not to misinform people.If you check the NFT marketplace, you will see how Blur marketplace is a rival of Opensea, even I read recently that the transactions on Blur surpasses that of Opensea recently.

See when it was listed, most of the coin was sold and the price falled significantly as it was listed on many exchanges almost at once and people that were given the airdrop all sold at once, driving its price into the dept of an ocean. I prefer bitcoin, but just want to hold little altcoins too. I bought $37 worth of the coin at $0.804, I am now selling it immediately I post this, the coin do not look promising for me again.",

I have nothing against blur, and it would be good if someone actually challenged opensea as monopolies are never a good thing and competition makes everyone step up their game. Opensea even removed their fees (for a moment at least). I am guessing they have noticed that there could be a mass move happening to other site.But i will wait and see if that volume stays up after the airdrop fuzz calms down.",

It just launched last February 15 and then that's the top of its price, $5. That's why it made me curious to look if the ATH was almost $46 just as said in the OP. But then, the chart doesn't look good as it's an obvious drop and dumped by most of its holders. The NFT sector is no longer that quite good and in the hype, unlike its glory days of it, just as a marketplace alone there could be value in it but taking it as an investment and holding it hoping for the pump on the next bull run, we don't know if it's a wise choice to make. The chart doesn't really good, it's like going to the pit hole unto its depths.",

I know people say they are but according to coinmarketcap, if we filter AI coins, most of them are down, and relatively to other sectors i don't see that much difference. And in top of that, when people realize that they are not getting what they imagined or that token or blockchain wasn't needed for the tech, they end up holding worthless crypto without volume or liqudity, and they wil bel harder to recover than meme coins.",

But I think blur is much better with open sea in terms of features and rewarding platform. Yes nft is a bit overrated right now. But once the market fully recovered from such down, and nft season once again takeover I think blur can up its sleeve for competition. I dont have blur airdrop or investment but seeing their neat platform and cool feature, theres no way this wouldnt do good like any other platform.",

Is the team publicly doing predictions on the marketcap of their own token? There's so many things wrong in that. I most definitely am not touching this. I've seen this happen before and it never ends well. Also i am not sure how legal that is. CEO is doxxed and there are \"the expectation of profit\" if team is really estimating future price.",

I NFT marketplaces such as Opensea and this Blur will just slowly collapsed.For someone who are interested on Blur for now, they can still invest on it but only keep it for the short term. Bull market on the other hand can start on its own with or without a fresh/new trend but I think newer trends intentionally come out during the bull market as it might give them a good boost than if they start when the market is still in bear where people have a little energy in crypto stuffs.",
