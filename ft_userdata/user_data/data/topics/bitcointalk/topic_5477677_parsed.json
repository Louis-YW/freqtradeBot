Additionally, once you place a bet, make yourself forget about that bet and return to the casino when it's over.If the result is a loss, you will not be disappointed because you only placed a bet with an amount you can afford.And if you win, you can cash out the winnings and enjoy it.But usually, a gambler who places a bet on a match will watch the match too so they can find out whether their team will win or lose.So it is a normal thing that gamblers feel when they lose.",

Based on my experience, when you are watching a game you bet with, you'll be able to experience mixed emotions, and that's normal which I think that would give a thrill in sports betting. Of course, when you lose you feel sad, but it's not something that would stay for long, you still have time to bounce back and try to win. I guess if you are really serious with gambling, you need to learn how to control your emotion first. The fact  that we are dealing with money here, it should be properly handle in order to grow it, but being weak emotionally, it might create problems along the way.",

If we have the same experience, how do you cope up with that problem, after all, gambling should be fun but why we have this kind of feeling that we feel disappointed when our bet loses?I am sure many will agree that watching with a bet is more fun but for me personally when I am watching my favorite team playing I love watching without a bet.That for the simple reason that when the bet goes wrong we tend to get mad and we lose the real enjoyment of watching our team playing.Yesterday I was watching a team I love to watch without betting as they did not win and I would be mad double the amount,one for not winning and one for not winning the bet.",

But whenever you are watching the game without you staking your money you won't attached any feelings because you are neutral not losing not gaining rather watching to ease oneself.",

If we have the same experience, how do you cope up with that problem, after all, gambling should be fun but why we have this kind of feeling that we feel disappointed when our bet loses?It depends of how big the bet actually is. The bigger the bet, the most stressful experience you get. I don't know about any sports bettor, who would be stressed out about a 1 dollar bet.  If you bet your life savings on a single football match, the stress level would probably hit the roof.Sports betting is fun, but in a different way, in comparison to the traditional casino games. I don't know how to describe it. In traditional casino games(for example poker) you are the one, who is playing the game and making decisions. This is what creates the fun experience. While in sports betting, you have to analyze your team(or athlete), place your bet and just wait for the end result. This is a more passive experience, in comparison to the active casino gambling experience.",

I think that when I watch it and the game doesn't go as expected, I worry that it will ruin my mood during the game.

If we have the same experience, how do you cope up with that problem, after all, gambling should be fun but why we have this kind of feeling that we feel disappointed when our bet loses?I feel like you are becoming extra frustrated because you bet with huge amount of money that you probably cannot afford to lose. It has been mentioned here oftentimes that we should not stake amount of money that we cannot afford to lose for bets because of the psychological trauma it comes with. We all have our mental health to protect at the end of everything and that should matter most to us.If you are gambling for fun sake, stake some few cash that you can afford to lose. In fact, to make it more fun, you can stake for higher odds with no much expectations since the amount can be ignored when things go wrongly. I suggest you should take it from that angle of staking what you can afford to lose and not some huge cash or your income. It will end up affecting you and instead of enjoying the fun that comes with it, you end up being frustrated and in worst cases, you become depressed.",

Using huge amount or the amount of money that you can not afford to lose to gamble has been the reason you will be watching the match and be panicking while losing. Gambling should not be like that.",

Or at least what's painful is that like in sports bet, you want to bet on the other team and then you change your mind and suddenly end up losing.As to how we cope, I guess we should let it go and not think about it. Maybe you just have to take a walk or something, talk to your family member, at least do something that will get away your mind from that losses. And then after that, you will feel good and might go and bet the next day.",

It happens to me sometimes most especially at a wrapping (finishing) points of the game While it is not going interesting and no hope of my winning.Then I feels like leaning on someone behind to just tell me how it ended instead of having my eyes and attentions on the board. Sometimes too I would take slow back steps like I am walking away with the believe that I have lost but yet I am expecting the least seconds before the end game to make an exciting different then I could step up again with a cheers of yeah..... I made it.",

With gambling perhaps the appeal makes people blind to decisions and believe in a chance of making money.But still honestly, if you want to get out of that situation, manage your assets before playing, considering that money will definitely be lost and you have nothing to regret. I don't believe too much in life-changing opportunities based on gambling, because luck is inherently fair, if it's not good enough, don't expect much luck.",

It's likely to cause you an immediate behavioral change when watching the game. Although whenever I play a game I'd always go to check on the scores much frequently but I wouldn't just glue my eye to the screen or the game because it gives me some sort of discomfort and I don't like that. Although there are people who really prefer to watch their game, so they can see every detail and maybe know when to start praying just Incase their game is going the contrary direction lol.",

If we have the same experience, how do you cope up with that problem, after all, gambling should be fun but why we have this kind of feeling that we feel disappointed when our bet loses?Disappointments and anger would really be just that normal since we are really just that humans on which emotions would really be felt out on the time that we are losing bets. It would really be just that normal to have this kind of emotion or feeling since we dont really like for our bets to have that losing situation on which it is really that considered to be part of the thrill.Yes,its not enjoyable or something entertaining but if you are really that making bets just for the thrill then you should really accept out this kind of scenario or situation on the time that you would really be getting involved with betting on sports on which this what really adds on the fun. Play for the thrill and cant really be avoided that we would really be that aiming for win because we know that we could also make some profit or wins too.How you would really be able to get rid? This is via longer experience with betting on which you would really be that to make yourself that emotionally stable or somethingthat you would really be tough already on the possible situations that you might be able to face on. You wont really be that ending up on being too impulsive because you are already getting used to it.",

But if you are someone who is trying to make money through gambling, then it’s obvious that you will be stressed. Rich people gamble for recreational purpose, hence when they place bet, they don’t have any fear of losing the money. On the other hand, a middle class man places a bet in order to make some extra bucks. He is risking his hard earned money for it, so how come he will be calm while the match’s outcome going against him?",
