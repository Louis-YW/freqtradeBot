If I did, I would have utilized them for a swap rather than seeking a loan. Thank you for your understanding, but it appears I may not meet your collateral criteria. I will patiently await alternative lenders who may be able to fulfill my request.",

And hopefully he decide to pay back at some point, I mean we only speaking about $63 to pay back at days date. (But if he really wanted to pay back he should already has started to pay back like $5 or $10, so it's just prob a poor kid)I didn't know people actually scammed others for this amounts before I stepped in to this forum. A lot of scam, drama and guessing on this forum. ðŸ¤¡Now I understand that people can be that disgusting, a good lesson learned. Thanks Bitcointalk! ðŸ« But you know, only a scammer himself would call a honest person a scammer, a honest person would never go that far.",
