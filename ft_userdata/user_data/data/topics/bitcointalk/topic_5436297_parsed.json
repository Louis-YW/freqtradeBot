This should not happen if they have generators or starting to invest with the solar power, though if the power outages came from the fault of the provider, I guess it can be valid but Iâ€™m sure they are valid reason for outages or else they have to pay for the damages.",

It was not out for so long as compared to what most countries, in West Africa, go through. The reason so much was spent or lost is due to the over dependance on these power companies. Or should I better say, the confidence they have.What South Africa is facing is same scenario, wherein they have gotten so used to having power and have grown their economy with it, only to run into huge losses once the power is out. I am indeed empathic towards the plight of those who have made some losses. I hope the power company resolves it quickly.",

Considering that hospitals does really have those apparatus or machines which do mainly needing up some electricity, which does means that it would reallybe that crucial if there would be some power outages.It is understandable somehow basing on which or what country we are talking into which is really that sad that they cant be ableto produce it out but generator prices to support some back up power wont really be that much a huge expense considering on how an hospitals do makes money.Power outages does really affect lots of businesses which is heavily reliant on power source which i do believe that most of us does really need it. And since it could be a threat on our businesses, then we should always prepare back ups for that like installing a generator or a solar panel in case power outages suddenly happen due to unforeseen bad weather that could cause a great loss from our own business. However, if the power source do it for their own personal reason, then maybe suing the company will certainly be valid.",

Instead, I headed most of the hospitals will use the big batteries called UPS, and in some cases and depending on their location they will use Solar panels to decrease power usage for the hospital.",

So if a poultry farm only needs lighting, why did those chickens die? Because they were afraid of the dark?The main problem with indoor farming is the temperature, I've just checked the weather in the town where the farm was located and it was over 30C every single day, that means temperature went up by at least 10 more degrees inside there, without power ventilation or the HVAC unit kicking in those chickens probably either died of heat or suffocated because high ammonia levels. With temperatures still hitting 28-29C by the time the sun sets and solar panels are already at half capacity you won't be able to do anything with them.And for the others talking about back-ups and so and so, there were back-ups:QuoteIssues started in mid-December when a faulty transformer prompted Eskom to connect the area to another line, causing voltage damage in his pumps and motors. The backup generators that were powered by Eskom didn't kick in.",

      "body": "Yes, I have a lot of friends that are living in South Africa .. and they have a system called \"Loadshedding\" ...where whole suburbs are shutdown for several times during the day for hours. The Electricity provider (Eskom) are doing this, because they cannot produce enough electricity for the whole country and they want to protect the grid from total collapse. During this time several businesses (big and small) have to run on diesel generators to keep their doors open for business and this is a huge capital expense for those businesses. (The increase expenses are being pushed onto the consumers, because they simply increase their prices to cover those costs.)Many small businesses are forced to close down, because they cannot afford the increase in the expense to run these generators. Cellphone towers cannot charge their backup UPS to provide power to the towers, so you also have communication failures and the batteries in people's house alarms cannot recharge enough to keep people safe) It is a total disaster for South Africa ...and this is caused by bad political leaders and corruption in Eskom. (Syndicates are sabotaging the Coal power plants and mismanagement and theft are everywhere)",

For me I'll advise the farmer to rather use the more he would spend in pressing charges and hiring of attorney to purchasing a power generating set so to avoid a reoccurrence of the situation.

Sometimes there is no electric supply for months and years. The majority of businesses in my country depend solely on generators and other sources of power. We have had issues when a power outage and the breakdown of generating set caused the death of over sixty babies in incubators in a well-known government hospital. None of the parents took any legal action against the state because the government would always influence court judgments.As regards this case in South Africa, I might not blame the poultry farmer for not having an alternative power source because maybe they have never experienced a power outage for a long time, hence there was no need to own a generator. But this would serve as a lesson to other business owners that relying solely on a particular source for a vital service is not advisable.",

The farm mentioned in the article (the one owned by Herman du Preez, named Lichtenburg Frangipani Boerdery) lost around 50,000 chicken to extreme temperature. The same article mentions that farmers were forced to cull a total of 10 million chicks as a result of power outage. Smaller farms have closed down, and Astral Foods alone suffered damages worth ZAR 138 million in 2022. This is what happens when the same party remains in power for more than three decades. Â South Africa needs to look beyond traditional sources for electricity. They are a country of 60 million people and have only one active nuclear power plant (Koeberg). There were plans for new plants, but those were rejected and the country will not see any additional nuclear power capacity before 2030.",
