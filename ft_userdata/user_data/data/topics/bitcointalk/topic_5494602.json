  "content": "I first heard about Bitcoin around 2016 but then I had no idea what Bitcoin was. Someone online was saying to work on it because I don't know anything about it. Then I heard about Bitcoin again in 2022 when the price of Bitcoin was 21000 dollars. I did a little research on Bitcoin and saw that it was good. From whom I heard, I said to a brother, brother, let's invest. Buy a bitcoin and keep it.Fifty percent and I invested fifty percent but that brother did not agree then. Day by day the price of Bitcoin was increasing and the price was going up and down around 25, 30, 31 thousand dollars. Still I told my brother to invest but he did not agree. That price eventually reached 74 thousand dollars. I regretted very much why I didn't take a risk. If you want to do something, you have to take a risk, nothing happens without a risk.",

So you don't need to think about the 50/50 scheme when you intend to invest in Bitcoin. I assume you don't have enough proper knowledge about how Bitcoin works. So you need to study a bit more. I will advise you to spend more time on the forum and read as much as you can, especially related to Bitcoin technology. It's true that if you can't take a risk in crypto, you won't be a gainer at any point. Crypto isn't for panicky people.",

That is why before you invest to any asset to get the best decision investing always do a DYOR and ask professional traders as a sample of what will happen to Bitcoin in the future or here on the forum you should get some ideas that can increase the decision making and probability what will the price of BTC in the future. You need to gain some knowledge about Bitcoin and ask yourself why \"Bitcoin would increase in the future?\" one sample answer is block halving since the price of Bitcoin is based on demand and supply once the block halving happens the price of Bitcoin will increase because the supply will drop came from miners due to the half block reward and even the demand is the same as before the price should increase.",

You saw how big the potential is for Bitcoin's market value; are you investing now? It is easy to tell other people to invest but if we don't have the courage to do so, simply because we saw the price on a decline at the moment, then what's the point? Take the risk if you want to achieve something or gain profit. If you know how to properly manage the risk then at least loss won't hurt that much. Taking the risk is different from being reckless, keep this in mind. It is Bitcoin we are talking about and we all know how capable this digital currency is, to be bigger in the future.

It is also noteworthy to always dig deep into such opportunities and ensure that your evaluation is solid enough to merit your investment after you must have gotten some well informed clarifications about the investments.The biggest mistake most people do when it comes to investment is to have only a surface understanding of an investment opportunity then they go straight venturing into it instead of having a deeper understanding of it.

Because investing in Bitcoin requires you to believe in it and have the courage to take risks. In the beginning, many did not have the courage to believe and take the risk of investing in Bitcoin, as you did at the time, and now regret it as the price has surpassed its previous record. But if Bitcoin didn't reach its new ATH and instead the price continued to decline from the price you saw, you might not have regretted it. Instead, you would regret ever thinking of investing in Bitcoin.  However, I think you need to further educate yourself by gaining proper knowledge about Bitcoin before investing in it. Because you said, you told your brother to invest 50%–50%. But what you may not have known is that instead of buying 100% of your entire bitcoin, you can buy any amount, however small. And then, if you could have done your own research and gotten the right idea about Bitcoin, you wouldn't have needed to ask anyone; you would have taken the bold step to invest yourself and hold on.
