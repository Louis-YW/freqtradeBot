  "content": "The banking system is a gigantic scam and a ponzi. It will soon collapse.Banks create money from nothing. If they have $1000 rules say they can create 100 times more in loans.Fake loans of course. Called fractional reserve banking.Global debt must always increase or the house of cards collapse bringing everything down.Unless this ponzi is transformed to something that benefit humanity many will die.So the bankers through WEF are proposing a new system where they are still in control.A carbon credit system where if you behave well you get your credits.Massive surveillance and a social credit system. To save the climate they claimÂ  When it soon collapse they will of course not blame themselves. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzX3YZoMrs",
