  "content": "I like to take a broad view of things, and understand 'bitcoin', 'blockchain' + 'crypto' for what it is, or is meant to be. I have a few selected people on 'youtube' I follow (obvioulsy it's not where I get my knowledge from) and now and then Andrea's videos pop up and he's got that rare inspiring spark that can really make the complex seem simple. A lot of his older videos from say 2016 talk about Bitcoin as being the next revolution in mankind, a tool to free us of bureaucracy and so on. But where are we now, ETFs cumulatively own something like 1.2 million bitcoin, Blackrock 550,000, MicroStrat 400,000 and so on.. Is Bitcoin really the saviour of humanity?Is it a trojan horse?Will it become the Pets.com of Internet 3.0?I like Andreas's explanation that Biycoin is not money for the internet, it is the internet of money, or something along those lines, but what will happen if 90% of the BTC available are owned by huge corporations? Wasn't the idea that BTC would free humanity? I am still open to the idea thta BItcoin is a deep state operation, or created by a very well known tech entrepreneur.",
