It's not like they will get merited easily because that thread is indeed for meriting posts in local board that deserves merit and are not merited. I do agree with not directing newbies to merit threads but it is also not bad as it is to help local board posts that are not merited and I won't worry about newbies getting merited since it is up to hugeblack to merit the post or not but I also believe that it may cause spamming in the forum just for the sake of getting merits.",

Giving merit in this forum is personal choices of members, so you can make the most quality posts and nobody will merit it, perhaps the members that might merit it are not on the thread that you made the post, so the system is not really fair regarding merit distribution. Although as a newbie, you should be more concerned about learning and increasing your crypto knowledge, eventually the merit will start to come, but don't ignore merit help from source members, every eligible ranks apply for merit, so why can't you?",

For sure with that all the efforts they exert to build up their account will be wasted. So much better if they create their own way to create a good post and for doing that they must need to be knowledgeable about crypto and latest trend since this could help them became a good contributor and a relevant poster in this community.Newbie's should know that there are more better than using those AI and if they just research for sure they can learn a lot for exerting some effort for doing those research.",

You guys think that is a must or compulsory that one's you make quality post you surely get merited wrong!! You getting merit is individual personal choice just as kelward said. You might post quality post but if no one found it not impacting or drag any of their interest you would end up getting no merit. Just try and be active and focus more on learning new things you could impact on others. Posting quality most time help to make you to be well known not way for magneting merit. Just try and be posting relevant and helpful posts. Fyi posting bulky  posts doesn't mean, you're posting quality post.

Besides those merit that being given on that thread is not free, if your post ain't worth meriting you won't get any merit so I wasn't trying to course any harm to anyone was just trying to encourage others that are also finding it difficult to rank up because that is the main reason the thread was created at first to help those who's finding it difficult to rank up. The stuff by choice you might decide to not do it but don't discourage others that found it helpful. if the post actually casue any harm I'm sorry for my ignorance back then.",

Anyone who wants to be merited still needs what you said earlier: they must learn about the forum. But not only that, the forum members merit only quality content that deserves to be merited. Merit always serves as a reward when you create educational and helpful content for the community. However, the link you provided is not for all boards; the thread is for only local board posts; they have less merit as it’s supposed to, or any post that doesn’t get merit, and it’s for high quality, so the OP of that thread asked for the links to those posts so that he will help them merit the post.Quote from: dockrun on January 22, 2024, 02:26:48 PMI think newbies like me shouldn't think too much about merit, just think of it as a gift from forum members because there is value in the post. at least that's what I've learned from several months of being on this forum.

People tend to write long posts just to get merit, and I can see some newbies also do that, which is wrong. Someone can say something in two or three lines, and you will see such posts with merit because it’s worth it, so it's not necessary to write a long post. Let learning continue, and everyone will get to where they want. Newbies should not rush; everyone here started like they are currently doing.",

Many veteran users who wouldn't give a damn meriting below average posts are doing so now and that's because they've relaxed their criteria too.",
