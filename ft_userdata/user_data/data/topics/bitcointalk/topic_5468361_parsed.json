This is now sitting in cold storage in your digital wallet, and you want to cash out 100 million usd.1) Are Coinbase and Gemini your only convenient options? Will they be able to cash out such a large sum, and send the proceeds to your financial institutions without issues?   2) FDIC insurance only covers up to 250k per bank account. So, you would need more than four hundred accounts in order to cover all 100 million dollars. Is there a better way? Can you just send all 100 million directly to your Vanguard brokerage account? How do the ultra-wealthy do it?? 3) What would happen if you suddenly sent a hundred million dollars to several banks/financial institutions? Would the IRS be immediately notified? Would your accounts get frozen? How do you avoid this?No snarky answers, please. The above are only hypothetical examples. I don't own 5000 Bitcoin. Not even remotely close.",

Plus there's no bank nor financial institution out there that would want to facilitate your transfer or saving, that's a huge amount of money and your best bet is with a swiss bank if you don't want to face tax consequences, but we all know how that works. I say if you want to withdraw your money really, withdraw it slowly and with different accounts, don't do it all at once. Give the market time to recover from your sales.",

It's for sure going to ask you some important matters and will certainly ask for KYC. But do you have the choice?You want to sell it and it's like you've got few options to do that.

I think it depends on the country, if in my country, you won't find any real estate brokers accepting payments in bitcoin or cryptocurrency, or buying cars or houses...what they want to receive is cash or bank transfer. Regarding cashing out large amounts of money from cryptocurrency, I think P2P trading is the best and that's what big investors in my country are doing. But in general, if the amount is too large, whether we use a bank or use P2P, there are potential risks. In that situation you should only withdraw money gradually and not withdraw money a few times.",

Not sure how the ultra-wealthy do it, but if they live in my country there is no way they can cash out all at once as mentioned above. I doubt they want to sell them all at once in the first place. 3. That is likely even though my government tax agent is not as 'evil' as the IRS.
