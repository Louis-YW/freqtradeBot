The only thing keeping them from attacking Bitcoin would be game theory. At present, the rewards from attacking Bitcoin with a 51% attack is overwhelmingly low and it is not remotely profitable for them to do so. The opportunity costs of executing any attack on Bitcoin is far higher than the benefits.There is nothing much that you can do to discourage centralization as long as people are willing to mine in pools. Pools have controlled more than 51% of the hashrate for many instances but nothing much has happened.",

If the attack were to be made by a miner, bitcoin is not mined with the help of GPUs, which can then be resold to players, but with the help of specialized devices used only for bitcoin mining. Hence, in the event of a bitcoin collapse or a sharp drop in prices related to an attack, mining units go to the trash because they have no other use, and we are talking about billions of dollars in hardware. If the pool were to attack, individual miners will automatically turn away from it to avoid the scenario described above eliminating future profits.",

What can be done is for the network to overwhelming reject any alternate chain created by a miner with majority hashrate making it unprofitable for them.Other than this it's a capitalist game. Miners should of course abandon a pool if they try anything malicious, meaning they will drastically lose their hashrate power, further making it unattractive for anyone to even attempt to attack the network.Quote from: sesterceshop on August 03, 2023, 07:21:42 AMSupporting more decentralized poolsUsing easily installable software that allows anyone to create a high-quality mining pool would create more competition and diversity among miners• What do you mean by decentralized pools?

I have been professionally mining BTC long before this topic took place, and I have been following hashrate distribution years before Foundry USA pool came into existence and the fact that 2-3 entities owning over 50% of the hashrate have been the case since at least 2016, it's a lot more than just looking at a pie chart and thinking you solved the puzzle, you need to understand how are all these pools are connected, then use that knowledge to compare hashrate distribution for the past decade, and you will come to the same conclusion.Furthermore, pool distribution is pretty irrelevant compared to gear ownership and the physical location of that hash power, at least 80% of the hashrate comes from a single manufacturer, that's more to worry about than some random pool distribution which can change drastically over the course of a few hours, the physical location of the gears and the law which they operate under is also a serious matter.I'd rather see 3 large pools each owning 33% but hashrate divided between 50 different countries where no country has over 10% of it, rather than seeing 100 pools, each with 1% hashrate but 70% of that hashrate located in the same countries with the same laws and regulation, even worse, that majority of that 70% is owned by a single entity.I agree with him 100%, the importance of geographical situation of miners is too often underestimated, I think that a distribution in more countries would be beneficial to the general health of the Bitcoin hashrate. With too large a majority of miners concentrated in just 2 or 3 countries, the risks associated with a change in legislation are too big.",

But it must have a purpose, right? After all, then there will be other miners who will connect more equipment and be able to regain control over the network. That is, we are talking about some kind of short-term action, the main purpose of which can only be to damage the reputation of bitcoin. But why do miners need it?In addition, in order for so many large miners to cooperate for something destructive, it is necessary that they all have the same interests at the same time, and at the same time no one has option to connect additional equipment so that the first group of miners again had less control over the network.I am not saying that we shouldn't think about how to increase the level of decentralization and reduce risks. It's still necessary. But it’s also not worth worrying too much about possible risks, they are practically zero today.",

I've had a small farm at one point in time and switching pools took a good amount of time, especially if the webui isn't very intuitive. They probably don't want to have to deal with the hassle of going into every one of the machines and changing the pools for no good reason. If anything malicious can be detected, it is already too late. P2Pool is just not really that good.Anyways, BTCGuild and GHash.io were the closest in recent memory. BTCGuild was more proactive in this regard and had a proposal with cascading fee structures. The onus is largely on the pool owners to force pool users to move.",
