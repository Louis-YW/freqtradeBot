Even coins which never moved from 2012-13 may just be moved at anytime.You would have to look at news website and things liker that , but that source isn't always reliable.",

Only a very limited number of people will know about your loss, maybe those who are close to you and knew that you are a Bitcoin holder. The fact is you are never going to have access to your Bitcoin again unless you can provide your recovery seed, in this case, your Bitcoin is lost forever.  In a wallet that no one has access to anymore. Bitcoin has no burning feature if that's what you mean, in altcoins cases, you have to burn some supply to reduce the max supply, losing access to your coin is different from burning coins to reduce max supply.Bitcoin max supply will remain at 21 million, even if 10million is lost it's not coming back, it is forever lost.",

For instance, if a bitcoin was sent to an address for about 8 years ago and there was no output (sent out) and the only input (sent into) has been there such wallet may likely be considered to have lost access or owner is dead IMO, but I believe there may be other ways to detect wallet that have been lost access.",

You can have an information probably through analysis of the blockchain and public data through blockchain.com or coinmarketCap.com but still, that won't make any sense. This won't ensure if it is truly lost based on its latest transactions.Lost wallets or ledgers. I agree, scarcity is what creates its value. So protect yours.",

But according to Chainlysis, ~20% (or almost 4 million coins) are lost[1].As for your suggestion about making a site, then I personally don't see the point because you can prove that you own an address by signing a message with your private keys, but there's no way to prove that you don't own an address. In other words, anyone can claim that they have lost their funds but there is no way to confirm if that's true or not.[1] https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/chainalysis-up-to/",

How can we use this knowledge? What is the benefit of knowing this? To subtract lost bitcoins from the total stock of bitcoins? What will change from this?Technically, such a website will not be easy to implement due to the lack of complete reliable data on wallets. We will not be able to determine in any way which of the wallets has access, and which one doesn't. There is another curious moment. Today you may have access to your wallet, but tomorrow you may lose it. In principle, you can add information about well-known wallets (like Nakamoto's wallet) that are lost, but there are few such wallets and, in principle, this is already known. I don't think it's worth building a website for.",

The tiny thing got lost accidentally in the furniture back and was stuck there for 2 years and I did not even know about it. I was so scared about it but I had the mnemonic phrases stored and asked for help on the forum. I created an entire thread about it and got good support from the community as well. Figured out how the ION Colman tool works and could be a good help when you lose your hardware wallet or software wallet. But the only rule is you should have your phrases stored properly. With time we will definitely have lot of wallets lost in the deep cold and may not have chance of recovering back. This will definitely short the supply.",

Some people hold onto their BTC in their wallets without moving them for years. So, if you come across a wallet with funds from 2010, it's possible that the owner still has access to it but is holding onto their bitcoin. As a result, it's impossible to be 100% certain if a wallet is lost or not. Only cases where individuals confirm that they have lost their wallets would be reported in the news, and any other speculation would be just that - speculation..",
