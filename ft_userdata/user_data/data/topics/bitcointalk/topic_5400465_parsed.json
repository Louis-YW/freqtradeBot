      "body": "You can mix different brands and models, no problemYou'll have to install both drivers (AMD and Nvidia), and you can even mine with only one miner like Gminer who mines with both cards at same timeHere in my main PC I'm using RTX 3080 and RX 6700 with Windows 10To overclock cards I suggest you to use MSI Afterburner for Nvidia and AMD Radeon Software for AMD (you have more control with AMD to reduce voltages)",
