  "content": "QuoteOver time, cars have become more expensive — but also more durable.The average age of a car on U.S. roads rose to a record 12.2 years in 2022.Here are the models with the greatest potential lifespan: The top two are Toyota SUVs, with the Sequoia and Land Cruiser both able to last nearly 300,000 miles.New cars are getting increasingly expensive. But they’re also more durable than before, which means drivers have a better chance of getting their money’s worth.As the average transaction price for new cars reached an estimated $45,872 in November — the highest on record, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive — the average age of cars on the road also hit an all-time high of 12.2 years in 2022, a separate report by IHS Markit found.The average age had been just over 11 years a decade ago. In 2002, it was 9.6 years.Advancements in everything from materials to technology have helped, according to Will Kaufman, news editor at Edmunds, “and it doesn’t hurt that today’s vehicles have better ways to alert owners when there are maintenance issues.”10 cars with the greatest potential lifespanAmong the models with the greatest potential lifespan, Toyota Sequoia topped the list, with the ability to travel nearly 300,000 miles, followed by the Land Cruiser, according to a recent iSeeCars study, which analyzed more than 2 million cars over the past 20 years to see which vehicles could last the longest. Overall, SUVs and trucks are the most common vehicle types to rank in the top 10, while more fuel-efficient passenger cars, including the Prius and Avalon, earned two spots on the list.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/mG3gNSQ/cars-greatest-lifespan.jpg“Shoppers really, really value reliability, and automakers are definitely sensitive to how big an impact a reputation for reliability — or unreliability — can have on their brand,” Kaufman said.Six of the top 10 were Toyota SUVs, trucks or cars. Other contenders in the top five include the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon, both three-row SUVs.Every car and truck on the list can reach nearly a quarter-million miles or more, the report found.As a general rule of thumb, most drivers consider the 200,000-mile mark the upper limit of a car’s lifespan, although some models clearly have the potential to travel much farther.A limited supply of new cars and trucks due to the ongoing chip shortage has pushed consumers to use their existing vehicles for longer, according to IHS Markit, which tracks vehicle registrations in every state.At the same time, millions of people who previously commuted to their jobs put fewer miles on their cars while they worked from home, further extending the life of their vehicles. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/04/these-10-cars-have-the-greatest-potential-lifespan.html....Does anyone feel the growth and success of upstart automakers like tesla are finally forcing american automakers like GM, chrysler and ford to produce quality products for a change? Japanese car manufacturers like toyota tried for many years to advise american carmakers on various methods they could use to improve the quality and reliability of their products. For many decades americans resisted the change and choose to not use methods devised by foreign automakers. American automakers essentially refused to use manufacturing methods and techniques that they did not invent themselves. They preferred to produce inferior products, rather than upgrade and update their manufacturing lines to more closely resemble their competitors.With tesla on the prowl however, all of that has changed. Its no longer about pride, its about survival. Its a good time to buy a car. However, unfortunately the median price appears to be rising to all time highs thanks to inflation and shipping price hikes.",

My country is a third world country,people living in the average class can afford to buy a second hand car,most time if someone wants to buy a car,when you ask him what product will you buy,he will say Toyota. Youths are also rushing into Toyota car productsToyota cars are rampard and has been helpful to its owners here in the sense that it is cheaper to maintain and also easy to repair. The parts are also easy to find, the manufacturers have the techiques on what it takes to give it a long life spam. Good one from the Japanese.",

      "body": "Sequioa and Land Cruiser are my dream cars that someday I'll own but they're quite expensive and the price differs per region and country. It's because the cost of living and wage aren't the same from country to country.Japanese brands with their flag-bearer, Toyota really has proven its worth and durability. Quote from: Hydrogen on December 06, 2022, 01:48:03 PMIts a good time to buy a car. However, unfortunately the median price appears to be rising to all time highs thanks to inflation and shipping price hikes.That's what stopping most from buying a new car this time. Inflations are that much and when you're in a country that has a good public transportation, you'll just save that money and keep it instead of buying a new reliable car or a dream car.",

Toyota Now, due to the situation in my country (Ukraine, against which Russia unleashed a terrorist war), I decided to take it for a while.Friends, after Peugeot 3008, several \"Italians\", took a new RAV4 hybrid in May of this year - a wonderful device! Traveled on it, liked it very much!",

      "body": "I choose to differ. Yes Toyota makes very strong cars that’s the truth i especially like their Toyota Hilux it’s very strong and have a very long life span. But I don’t think Toyata makes the strongest , long life span cars.In my opinion I have to give it to Mercedes Benz. This car company has long history on cars built with the best materials that are strong and long lasting. My issues with them is that their spare part are not readily available everywhere in the world.",

      "body": "This as to be a US survey because here in the EU nobody uses pickup trucks. We mostly use vans as work horses here. Also, note that they based the list on the mileage, which is why most cars there are work horses. Pickup trucks or cars used by various services. Tahoe for instance is a popular police car.High mileage doesn't mean the car has a long lifespan. It can as well mean that it's driven and serviced a lot like a typical service car. The fact that you don't have a honda civic there doesn't mean it breaks before it reaches 300k miles. It means not many people make 300k in 10 years, which is the average life of a vehicle. A work truck on the other hand can easily make 500k in 10 years.My point is that if you take care of your car it's going to last. It doesn't have to be a pickup truck or an SUV.",

I’m not a fan of Toyota but if you’re looking for a long time out of your car & value for money then you can’t go too far wrong with them can you.Out of the options listed, the Land Cruiser would be my choice, it’s probably great in bad weather & obviously safe to drive.",
