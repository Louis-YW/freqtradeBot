  "content": "It's been a while since when I first started wondering about this and searching online didn't really help. I know there's some sort of an internal system keeping track of everything but how does it work? For example, the Phemex wallet I make deposits to for USDT has 10 or so million USDT in it, pooled funds from different users. How does Phemex keep track of which money belongs to who? Is there a system out there that's already made and ready to deploy?TYIA.",
