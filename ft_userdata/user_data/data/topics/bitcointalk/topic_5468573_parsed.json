In other words, what I am trying to say is that when what would make us happy is not there we should always try to utilize the little we have and to keep hoping for the better ones to come, already from the part of my country out of 89 percent of people aren't happy with what they are doing but yet are still working harder to make sure they achieved what makes them happy. Note \"the only way to go forward is to move forward' so for we to be happy we create happiness by ourselves instead of depending on the government or anyone else out there.",

Success has a lot of recipes and one of them is being happy, why do I say so? because you may achieve a lot of things but can't be happy at the end of the day, you may sleep in the nicest bed in the world, take yourself with a fancy car, swim with your money, and still not be contented with it. Being a successful person can be measure with physical things at first glance but is measureless beneath. So if you want to be successful, just dedicate your time to what you love the most, could be your job, your passion, your talent anything and you'll be successful some day that's for sure.",

Of course, it will make it easier for us to achieve success in what we are planning. Moreover, we must be ready to go through stairs that will stop us from carrying out the process, so that's where our self-confidence is tested so that we remain consistent in what has been designed from the start until we are able to achieve ultimate success.",

Is it some way to manipulate people or that's the right thing to do? I don't know how motivational speeches are related to the economic section, but if they are, then let's talk in that sense. In order to be successful, you must have a plan on which you can work. Instead, you should not do what makes you excited, because I am excited when new movies or series come out; I am excited while playing games with my friends, watching cricket, or reading the news, or gossiping with friends. But these types of excitement will not take me towards success.I have to follow a path that might not be followed by everyone. For example, on a single bench in school, there are two students, one of whom is a doctor and the other is a taxi driver. They both had the same opportunities and resources. One had a plan and knew the world was changing and he had to change himself now, while the other was enjoying the world and thinking that life is short, but he didn't think that even if life is short, everyone has to play their role in society by providing some type of service.",

Is it some way to manipulate people or that's the right thing to do? I heard a quote from where I don't remember now but it's related to your topic that The whole universe will make an effort and help you to achieve what you desire. In this sentence, the idea is clear that a human will achieve things for what he does. A time ago I was sitting on a bench in a park and asked myself a question why the rich people are rich and the poor the poor. After some time I concluded that the reasons behind it is that poor people do work only or may not be wrong that poor people impose to do work for their stomach while rich people work but from the heart and that is the key to their success. A poor person if he has a vision and wants to improve himself then nobody can stop him from success. Success depends on your will for the work if it is high then you will be successful and if not then you may be at some lower rank where your daily uses were just completed on your monthly salary.",

Is it some way to manipulate people or that's the right thing to do? This is where you need to undertstand that life is not fair because what you just compose those is not relative to how life really works. You can do what makes you excited as in like a hobby but you think that can make you successfull? You can get the satisfaction you want, the inner peace but that successfullness comes from how far you were able to reach people and how many people want what you do, it is not your own satisfaction that makes you a successful person but people, you can be doing what you don't like and still be successfull you know right!Furthermore, to be succesful in life, lot os sacrifices has to be made, you have to let go of some need to get to that top, its how the world works and not how you really want to be happy. You need consistency to reach a goal, when you failed, try again with improve version, try it over and over until it work. However, there is elastic limit to what you can do as a normal human who have two ears, two nose and two hands, if you reach a breaking point in life, take a break or quit, not all your idea must be accepted the way you want it to be.Also sometimes, too much motivation makes you think out of the line, Donald Trump is an elder state man of US, it's not everything he says that you must think as it is to your own life, he is politician that has back up of the party and also a business, I believe you don't have all this, let's remove politics from the discussion, you might not have quater of his network and that is why when someone stood up with inner confidence to motivate the public, think again before you follow their advice because they have secrete ngredient that you don't have.",

No matter how hard you do work and even if you do love it, there's no way that you could really make yourself that being rich or financially free because you are really that working for others and they are the ones who are becoming richer. Not on the sense that you are really that selfish but it would really be always better that you should consider on creating your own business or side hustle on which you could really be able to earn more aside from the money or income that you do get on your day job.On the time that you had saved up enough then it would really be just that wise that you should really be having your own business and investment on which it could give out that chancefor you to make yourself that having those shots on achieving financial success but of course its not guaranteed because there's no such thing about guarantee about on this world.You would need to work hard for it and would be needing that ample time and sacrifices for you to work out.",
