  "content": "Hello everyone,I want to share the story of this Bangladeshi scammer who used a Telegram account username @Tunpa365 in a scam operation. He requested $10 loan from Gladitorcomeback in June 2023, claiming that he wanted to buy milk for his children and will would it next Friday but has not returned it till this day > [ # ]. This scammer also stole $30 from a member named @GMaxiCrypto in the @GMaxiCrypto, which provides an escrow service run by us. This scammer initially conducted some trades with the second victim to gain trust without using the escrow service. In the end, when he received $30 first, he disappeared. After that, the victim wrote that this scammer stole his money > [ # + # ]The scammer returned after several days, and wrote in the group, claiming that his brother-in-law had been admitted to the hospital three days ago and urgently needed surgery. He didn't have money that day, so he used GMaxi's funds. He claimed it was a mistake and promised to return the money on November 20 once he received his salary from his company. A month passed, and I regularly contacted him, asking about the money. When the expected day of November 20 arrived, this scammer said he needed an additional seven days due to not receiving his salary. He pleaded with me a lot. I warned him that this deadline would be the last. The days passed until December 12, and he still hasn't returned the stolen amount. He completely ignored my messages, and it seemed like he was reading them on Telegram.------------The complete information about this scammer:------------Forum Username: RaselShorifName: Md Rasel ShorifEmail: raselshorif169@gmail.comBEP-20 Wallet Address: 0x06d06C01Aaf0Af1b88824A7bcCaBD0743f8D026ABinance pay id: 213284388Binance username: Rasel3333One of his alt accounts: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2461727 | FLAGTelegram Username: @Habib1445 - @Rasel365 - @Masud333 - @Tunpa365 - @Ratan333 - @Ratan333 - @Rubel258000 - @Sohel365The complete evidence: Google Drive Link------------I understand that the amount is not significant, only $40. Still, even if it were a dollar, theft is entirely unacceptable. [A person's need is not a justifiable reason for engaging in dishonest actions.] I even blame these good members for trusting this scammer, and even as an admin of the Bptrades group, I always warn that we are not responsible for any transactions or deals that take place outside the group without using our escrow service, and whoever violates this or the group rules is his personal responsibility.I have banned this scammer's multiple telegram accounts from the official Bprades group and posted warnings about him to alert the members. Also, I created this topic late because I was busy the previous days. Still, this story will be helpful to many people, as they will learn that there is no trust in strangers, and they must use the free escrow service that we provide or the escrow service of any reputable member of the Bitcointalk forum.------------In conclusion:------------** It's now up to you guys to decide what actions should be taken against this scammer. He has participated in COMBO bounty rounds managed by Bountyportals before. Is it possible for me to request that the bounty manager consider addressing this matter and replacing his wallet address with the wallet addresses of the victims from whom he stole?✉️ BPTRADES GROUP: https://t.me/bptrades✉️ BPTRADES ANN THEARD: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472222.0",

It's a bit of a delicate situation because Irfan was not part of the deal you're presenting here. Given that he also offers an escrow service, it may not be the best image that he arbitrarily disposes of the user's funds. You have to understand his side here.Is there a possibility to get RaselShorif to announce himself in this thread and possibly confirm that he is willing to pay off the debt?from my end, I supported your flag and gave negative feedback.",

As me along with my friend, who was a victim of a scam conducted by Shahangull with 3000.72 ETNY a few week ago as we failed to use the Escrow service provided by @bptrades, scam is a scam it is entitled to a person even if he/she stole a penny from you. The scammed amount could be less but the person is capable of scamming more in the upcoming future, its like the person lacks honesty and morality which is totally against the rules. And exposing scammers helps to aware newly joined member in the bitcoin forum to trust no-one.Quote from: albon on December 07, 2023, 09:16:19 PMIt's now up to you guys to decide what actions should be taken against this scammer.

Is it possible for me to request that the bounty manager consider addressing this matter and replacing his wallet address with the wallet addresses of the victims from whom he stole? As the distribution process is still pending for COMBO bounty, i think the scammer must be payback, so its okay to exchange the scammer wallet address with the victims wallet according to the amount they were scammed. Also if he has pending amount from others BM, i suggest not to pay him.",

A begging scam is one of the easiest ways to scam as it does not require any technical skills as this is what the scammer did and will do it again. I do not think there should be any sympathy given to this guy as he would come up again with the same kind of situation with a different ID to any member. I do think your idea of sharing his reward would be a good idea as it will make him realize how much it can cost to scam anyone for $40.",

Yes, that's correct. The last communication with him was on December 1, and so far, he has not shown any interest in the messages sent to him. Additionally, another person has complained that this scammer also stole $10 from him in May 2023. This is in addition to the two victims I mentioned in this topic. Thank you, Mr. Irfan, for supporting this wise decision that will compensate those who have been defrauded and serve as a penalty for this scammer, preventing him from repeating such scam activities with others using his alternative accounts.With the help of the information provided by me and the inspecting members, logfiles #4, and nutildah #10, his accounts in combo spreadsheets can be identified, and the victims can be compensated with the stakes allocated to the scammer.I appreciate your assistance and excellent presence here, ensuring vigilance against fraud and protecting the crypto community from scammers and cheaters.",
