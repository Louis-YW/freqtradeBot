Some of them will also spread lies and promote some shitcoins. But it will not be a bad idea to listen to Edward Snowden as he speaks on privacy and decentralization. Listening to Stella Assange the wife of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange might be interesting. Maybe they might have something new to add to the community since these two key speakers support privacy and decentralisation.",

Maybe they might have something new to add to the community since these two key speakers support privacy and decentralisation.I did not expect that the wife of Julian Assange would be interested in cryptocurrency or BTC technology. Well, I tried to find out but as a result, I found out that Julian Assange was also a user and enthusiast of BTC ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaB3Zw5_p9c ) and this video is also 9 years old. Well, if his wife is a crypto enthusiast then the interviews would be very interesting. I will look into it. Thanks for bringing this information in front of me. Besides that, Such events are really healthy for the crypto market, even though investors or big minds might try to come up with centralized or shit projects but still, we can not come to conclusions instantly and cannot judge books by their covers. So, we should slow down and enjoy such events. Although I can not go there hehe. still enjoy at YT. I actually came to know about Julian Assange recently when I was making my last topic about him and what he did was awesome but unfortunately, he was captured for that, but BTC is doing the work now.",
