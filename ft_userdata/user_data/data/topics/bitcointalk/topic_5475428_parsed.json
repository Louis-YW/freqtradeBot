If a mod moves your thread to another location, you can move it back or move it somewhere else entirely. But that's about it. If you feel that a thread should be locked, then you can report it and explain why you think that is. Point out what rules it breaks. Btw, where is that link he posted to avoid detection? I don't see it in his thread. Did it get deleted?",

Where is the red line of misinformation and deliberate spreading of lies to damage Bitcoin?Even without any evidence, no moderator will lock the thread because of that reason. There are many lying posts that I have seen on this forum and non were locked becuase moderators also do not know if it is true or not. Also from the thread, some people will learn from the thread as some people will explain why using cold wallet to store your coins is safer instead of hot using wallets.",

If it was a phishing link, malware, or something nasty, then I would be in favor of banning the person doing it. Other than that, I don't think the forum and its administration will (or should) take the route of censoring information they don't like. If someone wants to discuss how bad Bitcoin or a piece of software is, let them do it. Point out why they are wrong and what knowledge they are missing or ignore them for your own health. We have that maniac (fxsurfer, antikvark, whatever the name is) who returns every couple of months and creates a few threads bashing bitcoin, everyone argues with him, and then he disappears, only to come back again some day.",
