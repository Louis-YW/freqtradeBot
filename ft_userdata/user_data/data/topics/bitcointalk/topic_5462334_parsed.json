Up until recently I had $2 in mind as to when I would be selling but I am not sure if I should do or just hold till we are well into the next bull run in 2025. Selling at $2 would give me just under a 5x which I would usually be very happy with but because it is XRP and with many saying it is going to be massive in years to come I am not sure if selling at $2 is a good idea or not. Just curious to know those who also hold XRP what your plan is and at what price would you think of selling? I have seen price predictions range from $5-$100 for the next bull run - I think $10 is a fair prediction myself so may just wait till it reaches that price as it would be a 24x for me. I just feel that as the price does start going up quite rapidly in the coming months/years , it will be hard to hold on.",

I've also purchased some XRP, but my intention is to hold it for at least a year. As for making a precise prediction, no one can do that. I'll just suggest waiting for the bull run and then making your decision based on the market conditions.",

What you should rather consider is your personal need to sell and not necessarily others opinion to sell. If you have a very salient financial need, you are free to sell since you are not selling at loss. If you do not have any critical financial situation, and you are willing to wait for bull run, it is also for your own advantage. Nothing is actually guaranteed in this market, the $5 - $100 predictions may never happen. Who knows if this will be another BTC bull run where altcoins will sit and watch.",

I just curious about you. You have been putting very high target to sell your XRP. Tbh, $2 is a very high target to be achieved this year. Why don't you try to lowering your target? It will take years for XRP to be able to reach such value. I would prefer to sell it once it already given me around 50% - 100% ROI. It's good enough for me rather than waiting for years. If you are even waiting more than $2 and then you shall wait till the next decade to sell your XRP. You can use your sense to think how high XRP can go. It doesn't even surpass its ath but how can you expect more to be reached by XRP during the next bullrun. It's not clear when the next bullrun is gonna happen.",

And with $10 price it would have almost same marketcap as bitcoin has today, so i doubt it. Next bullrun would need to be something in biblical scale. And people who are saying $100 don't understand how valuation works. That's just insane moontalk. I personally wouldn't hold XRP as i see way more safer options that i see getting higher, but i am not in any way saying that you are wrong to hodl it. I've been wrong before. Not $100 XRP price wrong but in some other aspects of the market.",

How come XPR didn't reach it's all time high during 2021 as well? I mean it has gone down a lot more during the bear run, which makes the bull run increase do not matter. While bitcoin went from 20k to 3k to 69k between the same period, XRP went from 3+ dollars into 20 cents and back to 80 cents.As you can see it did not end up higher than the previous bull run, in fact it was less than four times smaller. This is why it doesn't do well during bear runs. Same is happening now, dropped as low as 50 cents, even lower, and we can see the bull run coming, I am telling you, it will not peak above 3 dollars on the next bull run neither.",

Ever since I'd never seen XRP is on bullish. Yes, it pumps but not to the point that we can say it was bullish. Not even it reaches $3, how much more if we think about reaching $5 - that was impossible. I really don't know why but based on my experience and upon checking on its history, the price remains low, it is somewhat to say that there is manipulation on its price. So, if you think holding this project will make you profitable, that was wrong. Better sell them and invest in BTC or ETH, surely it went bullish 2 years from now.",
