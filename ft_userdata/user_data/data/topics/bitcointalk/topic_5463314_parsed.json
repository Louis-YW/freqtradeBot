Only people trying to stay sane can reap those benefits without any desire to get greedy and want more money.People can get greedy easily, but some people can still hold back their greed so as not to harm themselves. And it depends on how strong you can hold that greed so it doesn't grow big.If you can, that's great. If you can't, that's a problem for you so you will follow what other people have done.

There are those who carry out trades or investments in a patterned manner by putting forward methods and strategies patiently waiting for predetermined targets and continuing to study so they can analyze when the best time is to buy and sell for profit.Basically that's what makes people different/not the same.Well that's right, everyone, especially us as traders, has a different path in achieving success in this field. And also in my opinion the personality of people is very influential in this field, as we know that trading is very involved psychologically and also mentally self, so in my opinion for those who have a personality easily fooled or provoked in terms of meosi then it is very likely they will experience many losses in trading. As an example, for example they experience a loss and when it is very likely they will feel emotional and then return to open the same position and eventually lose again. So in my experience and some of my friends, most people will get stuck there when their psychology is disturbed, they will find it difficult to predict the direction of prices and in the end they open long positions in a bearish and strong down market, of course they will experience losses. In addition to the difference, there are also those of us who do it with some analysis, for example some trade with technical analysis and some use fundamentals, in my opinion this is quite a lot of differences.",

Even when the desired result has already been obtained, it seems that it can be done better. Therefore, it is better to always place the upper and lower points, upon reaching which to exit the transaction.Another big common reason is the fact that it happened to someone and we think that it will happen to us, but the situation is already different and the deal is different and time has passed and everything is flying down\"This time will be different than yesterday\" - You can write a separate book on this topic.

Those who use charts may know what is happening in the market, but it will not be 100% successful. There will definitely be some losses incurred, even though they have good technical analysis knowledge. This is all related to mental trading issues and how to use the right strategy. There is no guarantee that someone who has technical analysis knowledge can always succeed, there will be some obstacles such as trading psychology which includes mental health such as greed, fear, panic, and others.",

That is to say, we all make mistakes in trading, learn from them, try again, and keep trying until we increase the rate of profit.
