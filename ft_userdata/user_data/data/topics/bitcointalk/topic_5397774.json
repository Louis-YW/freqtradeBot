  "content": "Cyber ​​thefts intensify as cryptocurrencies take more ground on the planet, which has led countries to track them, managing to obtain some information from the groups involved in this vandalism. One of the nations that has insisted on capturing them is the United States, which after its process of regulating these currencies, especially Bitcoin, has taken its task of protecting its citizens seriously, for which it offers a total of 15 million dollars to those users who have any kind of information about the whereabouts of one of the most wanted organizations in the world, which goes by the name Conti, is a group of hackers that have operated from their headquarters in Russia and have caused uncertainty in several places , causing over a thousand attacks. The objective of this operation is that: QuoteBy awarding this reward, the United States underscores its commitment to preventing cybercriminals from exploiting potential ransomware victims around the world.So says the State Department official.I wonder if with these rewards that are granted, these criminals can be captured, or simply prevent them from continuing with their illegal acts, I think it is difficult to stop them completely, these types of events are very common and are very similar to the money laundering as it grows and gets stronger and stronger.Do you think the United States can meet its goal?Source: https://bitcoinist.com/wanted-conti-hackers/",

      "body": "It looks difficult even if the reward amount is tempting. But it's good that at least a country has stood up against such ongoing nuisances which has caused a lot of troubles already. But the group of hackers are already super smart and they know how to hide their trail. Also, they are located in Russia which could be the biggest road-blocker for US considering the current US-Russia relationship. So we can only hope for the best but not sure if it going to bring any yield or not. Unless these hackers make a rookie mistake, it's very difficult to locate them. Once they are located, they will have to be arrested in Russia which is another tough job. But at least we are seeing some traction from the end of a government, that's a net positive!",

Also, cyber thefts did not intensify as a result of cryptocurrencies, it has been a thing years before the blockchain or any cryptocurrencies where invented. Crypto does not directly motivate crime, anything of value would be used for illegal activities, especially the popular fiat.",
