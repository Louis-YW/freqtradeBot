I fit develop imy influence to a reasonable level wey my influence go dey work for me.I agree with you, and after  more than four months in office, things are worse than it was before he entered which proves his influence is destructive. Destructive influence is a threat to humanityQuoteCraftiness- Tinubu have ability to turn and underturn tables before you realize. Is craftiness a tool I need to get for Naija?You can be crafty yes, but in all, let people benefit from your craftiness. Cos when the reverse is the case, it becomes a total waste of talent. Imagine how good Nigeria would've been if his craftiness as you said was used efficiently. Abeg no learn that type of craftiness.QuoteMoney- Jagaban hold money them dey call am Bullion Van but Me I no know how e get the money.Me and you know very well how he got his money. Its all over the news and judging from his jail terms served, the reasons he went to jail, forfeited properties and number of countries he's banned from entering. You're totally dishonest here.QuoteInconsistent Data Record-[/b] So many contradiction on date of birth, age, family history etc. Me I go say e good make person get straight data recordThis point is very contradictory, your outlining things you're learning from him and you're still contradicting yourself?. I don't think you thought over this very well before posting.QuoteThis na few things. Abeg make you put mounthI just get one thing to say to you, check the morality standard and implication of the posts you drop here. No dey increase our vex level with all these mumu posts.",

Abeg make you put mounthBy the time they succeed in institutionalizing rascality in all agencies of government, then you will realise we are sinking as a nation. E still dey sweet now for those wey support the rulling party because \"first to do no dey pain\". Who in Nigeria will believe that PDP will relinquish power to another party? They had everything and were so arrogant. Today, they are history and some of those people in PDP that felt too big are in prison or have gone to prison or detention. At the moment, we are at the lowest level as a country in terms of moralty, freedom, progress and what have you. So I don't have anything to learn from people who are desperate to force themselves on the people.",

While others dey invest in things wey go only benefit dem, tinubu was investing in humans. He gave many man and woman political positions wey dun help them stand on their feet today. As wike help tinubu win rivers state for last election, I hear say when wike been dey do rerun, na tinubu help am defeat amaechi for rivers state as Amaechi been dun already they use federal power collect power from him hand.

And na all these things dey kill our economy and the country.

This thing go make whoever no dey their cacus no go fit win election.

It's true. There is no body that is perfectly. Your enermy is another person best friend. What favoured me might not favour you. And every good person has also a bad side and one should not only concentrate on the bad aspect because of how you fell about the person.

If you think that yes is the answer to the question that means you are absolutely wrong.As a human being, we can not be completely good among our self's, there are places we do wrong and sometimes do right, so what I am saying is that our presido is not completely a bad person.Although, jagaban hasn't done anything good that I have seen, but I have sat down to think that what if what he's doing might be of help tomorrow, besides when Peter obi dey for seat as governor people been no know em value untill e comot.",

As I said you can either learn from the bad or the good or you can learn to replicate the bad things the person stands for in a good way. For instance you can observe an elderly person that wasted his or her life and decide not to make same mistake.One major lesson I learnt in this season is that I have seen how evil people or corrupt politician rally around themselves for support and even arm twisting the law for their gain. The question is how many times have I rally around a good person for support or how often do good people come together to stand and defend their own or push their own agenda.",

Don't you see how exposed he was in U.S when he was doing those alleged drug business. If we continue to as a people to have a structure of people like Jagaban and Buhari, just forget about things coming to normalcy in Nigeria.  The influence your talking about, is not influence of Ideas and technical know-how to improve the lots of Nigerians, but that of hunger, as he seems like their source of income. In today's world, Idea rules the world, I don't see Jagaban possessing any ideas or what so ever to turn around things.",
