Except say them do things, I no sure say the rigging for election go stop anytime soon and one thing I don also notice be say e come be like say this rigging mentality already dey instilled in us even at every little opportunity an election is to be conducted both in churches and in schools, you'll see that the contestants are always seeking for all means to com out the best candidate even if it means rigging.",

The only thing wey you go fit do as country man, nah to cast your vote and wait still the votes counts in your unit are being counted on by the INEC officials and you take record of am. Any other thing apart from that I no know ooh. As this our country d so. Nothing peso go fit do stop rigging wey d happen for the country during  election time. We d think sae introduction of electronic voting go stop am, but still yet em no stop am. Our politicians still find ways to maneuver am by overvoting and changing of figures to their favor to win elections. You know how this country d so, if you d for party wey d run the country, and you do overvote to win election, you no get wahala but if you d another party and you do over voting and INEC to find out, you don lose be that cos INEC go talk sae you use woroworo to win the election. As for this forth coming election d so, the high rate of rigging go minimized due to how INEC programmed this year electronic gadget for voting. Wetin peso d afraid of na make hackers no hack into INEC system cos INEC don d complain how hackers are trying to hack into their INEC portal server",

The only loophole way dey now na vote buying, but FG don dey try to do something about that one, way people no fit go bank withdraw long sum again and also the use of old naira notes during the election period.",

So for me, this forth coming election will be the worst and most eye-opening presidential election ever conducted in the history of this country, as many persons will be force to engage in our collective responsibility of choosing the right candidate by casting their votes, which has never been so before as people do always think votes don't count, due to ballot box rigging and other electoral crisis perpetrated by party loyalist. So in this year's election, the only way we can fight rigging of election is if INEC officials can be truthful to themselves by conducting a free and fair election, while citizens be truthful to themselves by only voting to the right candidate of their choice and avoiding any form of rigging",
