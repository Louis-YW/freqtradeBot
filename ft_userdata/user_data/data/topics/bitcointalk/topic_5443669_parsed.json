Now I am worried: if I download the blockchain, would that in effect mean that my hard drive would contain content that could get me in trouble?Thanks for any help / info you can provide.",

Secondly, you can run a pruned node, and therefore avoid storing any inappropriate / illegal data.But, in my opinion there isn't much concern anyway. If your government wants to punish you for happening to share illegal content when running Bitcoin, they're likely just punish you for running Bitcoin. But even in that case, I don't think Bitcoin nodes are seen as targets.",

And as long as the pools exist behind a domain , control is possible . Pools can be forced for example to accept work from specific IP regions .
