  "content": "Hello,Let me introduce myself briefly. I have been in domain business for as long as i remember, where i buy & sell domains & websites. A programmer too, the online world led me to bitcoin back in 2016Few days ago i came across an expired auction for btcusa.com but what caught my eyes is the registration date which is March 1996 ðŸ¤¯ 13 years before bitcoin I went to archive.org and checked the website over the time machine & btc meant â€˜behavior tech computer corpâ€™ but we all know what btc means so i said to myself that i had to get it.The auction went from $20 to about $600 where i was bidding against few people, i was willing to get it even if it got to 4 digit mark.I am thinking about turning it to a business, hence i listed it for $30k â€˜1 btcâ€™ at Dan.com since i am in no hurry to sell.Anyone got an idea if what i should do with btcusa.com?Thanks in advance & have a great day!",

It may happen due to negative news correlation with US and crypto right now this domain would get less attention. You know peeps are undoubtedly confused about various regulations in US against crypto currencies. It may lose value temporarily but not permanently. Moreover, try to auction it in the forums Auction section where you may find more relevant buyers as compared to listing it on general brokerage website.

Probably btc was short for something other than bitcoin, but that's very noticeable.After starting with the history of Bitcoin and giving technical and basic information, you can make presentations about its philosophy. There may be short presentations describing the storage conditions and trading of Bitcoin. You can locate the map locations of Bitcoin-used areas in the United States. It could be atm or something like that.If you get the offer you want, I think you should sell it. BTC is a remarkable address, but unfortunately not as remarkable as 1 Bitcoin.

Here is my advice due to the upcoming rally market, you can put the domain up for sale at $25-30K and put the money into Bitcoin for the next few years.",

I have a bunch of domains sitting in my account that go back to 1995-1999 and keep them just because of their age. It's one of those odd things in the internet. Domain \"X\" is worthless, domain \"Y\" even though it's worse in terms of the number of characters or spelling or some other thing is worth more because it was registered 25+ years ago and never dropped.-Dave",

There are indeed unlimited options for btcusa.com & I am still navigating every possibility in order to make something great at the end of the day!I am leaning towards an idea that has always been at the back of my head, which is to create the next 'local bitcoin' specially that they closed their business. but the question here is:Do people feel safe meeting potential traders in real life & make a trade? but this is where reviews comes handy to check how much is this seller/buyer is a trustworthy person.about making an exchange for the US, like coinbase or binance.us is a great idea but i have to say that i don't have that budget to start it since it requires a much bigger budget with alot of legal assistance, since the US is not really 'btc friendly'.probably making a dex for btc would be a good option here.btw, here's a snapshot of the website 20 years ago showing what btc meant! it's really amazing how ONLY one party held the domain since it was registered in 1996 UNTIL today without dropping! this in domain world adds alot of value to the domain, as many internet enthusiast would love collecting a piece of internet history, think of it as an 'antique'.https://web.archive.org/web/20020327112431/http://www.btcusa.com:80/",
