The other thing that I didn't want on the casino was lack of customer support. Some casino has live support but only answer like a bot which doesn't help at all on special cases. I experienced this frustrating issue before and it makes me sleepless thinking that I will not recover anymore my funds since support is not answering to my email.",

When I'm allowed to make an account, not asked by KYC when I deposit, then I win some money and suddenly I get a KYXC request. It feels like they're trying to cheat me, slow down my withdrawal, find something suspicious like fake documents so they can ban me... It really feels suspicious when they request KYC when you try to withdraw big, but haven't asked for it for weeks when you were losing money.",

KYC should be only for large amounts, but we have seen users getting their money stuck for low amounts like 2LTC.One of the most annoying feelings of all, I've experienced it myself when I've been gambling at this casino like I usually do and after being on a winning streak for the first time ever, I stop gambling as I'm contented with the amount I've won before I lose it all. I've withdrawn all my winnings along with all the funds left in my account however it was strange at it took quite a while to be sent to my wallet however upon checking it once again, it asked me to do KYC for the withdrawal to go through. It took them quite a long time a few weeks to process my withdrawal as I insisted on not going through the KYC process and even told them to close my account afterward. It took me quite a lot of emails back and forth. After that incident, I never bothered going through all that again and let other gambling platforms keep my funds. (I stop putting a considerable amount on other gambling platforms that I don't usually play on)",

KYC should be only for large amounts, but we have seen users getting their money stuck for low amounts like 2LTC.This is the current norm on crypto casino nowadays. Younare lucky if you will still receive your funds and recover your account  but most of the time it ends up on losing the funds and banning the account for the reason of connecfing you on other players if you manage to use an exchange address for your withdrawal.The other current annoying trend on casino are bet limitation or account banned if you win too often on your bets. This is very unfair since they are allowing players to lose big time without a break but limiting them when they are winning. Using the casino itself is already a gamble.",

      "body": "Crazy requirements like when you can get banned for VPN use or when you have to play a lot of rounds to be able to withdraw. KYC doesn't drive me crazy but it usually makes me avoid the casino, especially random KYC when you don't know if they will pick you. Some people give those a try even though they don't want to do KYC and they just play as long as possible until they get asked for documents. What makes me mad in KYC itself and avoid submitting anything is the proof of residency. It's stupid to demand something like that because many people rent apartments and the landlord pays all the bills in his name.",

We all want a fast and smooth withdrawals at most times and when there are issues and delay in withdrawals, asking you to do this or wait for that.Then that changes the mood.Design also gives that factor for gamblers if we're going to stay and play. Because if an ugly design is there despite even how good the casino is, there will be gamblers that won't like it.",

That’s also what I hated the most and will definitely drive me crazy knowing that I just won but it will take a longer time of withdrawal and then followed by series of KYC requirement. That’s really frustrating to know because the fact that we mostly often lose in gambling even losing almost every penny we have but when it’s time for us to get our reward, some casinos are really annoying that they also make it a point not to be fair by giving us longer and hard time withdrawal.",

KYC is not requested just because the customer has recently created their account. If you've lost almost all your deposit you are unlikely to be asked for your KYC to withdraw your remaining funds, they will let you continue to spend your money at their casino without any trouble. You're even likely to receive bonuses if you stay too long without visting them again. It's when you will start to win more money than your total deposits that you will encounter troubles, even if your account has been created many months ago.",

That is very frustrating plus the withdrawal takes 4-5 days which is you need to wait. The main problem is the withdrawal and the KYC which most gamblers try to avoid, they always want a convenient way of gambling. However, I think OP you must add selection on the poll so that we will know if what is the most majority choice that the reason they annoy on the gambling casino.",
