  "content": "It is in the news this morning that PayPal UK will halt purchase of Bitcoin, and other crypto currencies, on their platform beginning from the 1st of October, I've not really confirmed how authentic this news is, but it was posted on telegram by a news channel/group I am a member of and following ..Many have been posting all sort of comments like \"dump\", which means to them, the news may likely affect the market negatively and lead to a dump, which I personally do not agree with though, since like one guy in the comment asked \"what is PayPal?\" , that is to say that, PayPal is unknown to some people, and for many of us here, PayPal is an outdated payment system or should I call it a service rather..But then again, one particular comment caught my attention, a user by the username \"You\", posted this comment, and i quote Quote\"Told you.. Btc to 40k will never happen again\".Though I particularly find this comment amusing, and sure disagree, but then, i just wanna find out what you guys think, do you think such news as this, coming from a company like PayPal, has the strength enough to stunt the price growth of bitcoin?",

At times like this when the price hasn't had any big move (up or down) the traders start getting antsy because they can no longer make profit and most importantly they can't predict the next move. Their best bet is for bitcoin to drop, specially those who love shorting bitcoin. Hence their negative waves talking about \"dump\"; they are just trying to make some quick profit.Quoteone guy in the comment asked \"what is PayPal?\"LOLQuote\"Told you.. Btc to 40k will never happen again\"I'm getting 2017 flashbacks where some people said \"BTC to $1k will never happen again\".QuoteThough I particularly find this comment amusing, and sure disagree, but then, i just wanna find out what you guys think, do you think such news as this, coming from a company like PayPal, has the strength enough to stunt the price growth of bitcoin? Directly? Absolutely not. Because PayPal is an actual exchange where people trade bitcoin to have an effect on the price. It also doesn't share enough of the market volume to have any effect even if it were an actual exchange!Indirectly? Maybe, if these idiots' FUD could scare some other idiots into panic selling but so far I haven't seen any major moves so the chances are low.",

I don't think PayPal is yet relevant enough in the crypto space to have any meaningful impact by halting trading. We've been through much, much worse in that regard. Bitcoin did well before PayPal started acting as an exchange, Bitcoin will do well after.And that is assuming there is some merit to this claim to begin with.",

Yeah, I never connect Paypal and crypto in any way.I am surprised it was even possible to buy it via paypal, in the long run crypto will take many of Paypal's customers away I think. It's just more convenient. You always have access to your money. Nobody can just randomly block your account (of course if you store your crypto at an exchange this still might happen). And the fees are better as well.By the way, years ago paypal blocked my account because I logged in from too many IPs. That's what happens when you travel a lot. Even when I proved I am me they still made it supper difficult. I somehow got to withdraw my money closed my account. Just a joke site for me.",

The news says that paypal will only temporarily stop BTC and crypto purchases for U.K customers, and they can resume using paypal for such purchases as early as early next year: https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2023-08-16/paypal-to-halt-uk-crypto-sales-until-2024Nevertheless, paypal is not even a crypto exchange, and i don't know the average number of people in the U.K who purchase BTC through paypal for people to even think that this will cause a dump in BTC's price, and as well stop it from rising above $40k, ridiculous! Though there are a lot of weak hands that might be moved by this, but i can't imagine they will be so gullible as to sell in numbers that will be noticed in the price of BTC.",

Neh... This ain't that much-hyped news to keep BTC down. I want to know the real news if it is true or not. But if it's true, who TF cares? To me, these are some drama that takes place before every Bitcoin Halving. We have heard lots of news regarding the Bitcoin ban in many countries before. Has that affected the market that much? Well a little, but after some time, it was back to normal. Market sentiments are real and news like this does influence people, but it is short-lived. Those who put ban on Bitcoin will be the first to accept it when the time will come. Before every halving, those who are in power will spread fuds in order to dump Bitcoin's price. That way they can fill their bags with less money. These news are not worth it if you are focusing on the long-term plan. It will fade away soon enough.",

I don't think that a small exchange like them has any significant influence on bitcoin price.There are big exchanges that will come up with such news that instantly,you might begin to see the dump in Bitcoin price. If PayPal temporary halt cryptocurrency transactions,it will only affect them as they will loose more customers and not the entire crypto market. The halving is near and such news is weak to turn the movement of bitcoin downward.

Btc to 40k will never happen again\"This is another indicator that the statements of those who are not experts in the industry should not be taken seriously (the opinions of experts should also be treated with some degree of doubt). In general, everything is the same: those who don't understand prophesy bitcoin limit in the N-sum, but after a while bitcoin will still surprise everyone with its new indicators.Indeed, PayPal already looks like a dinosaur, which many have not even heard of, don't know what it is and, of course, have never used it, despite hundreds of millions of users (that's just how many of them remain active at the current time). Now there are plenty of other alternatives. The introduction of cryptocurrencies into their system on the part of the paypal looks not only like an attempt to keep up with modern trends, but also to survive in its niche.",

PayPal to me doesn't have such capacity to influence the market and control the bitcoin and besides does it has any direct market such ( trading whereby someone will buy and sell through the app or their official website) that could possibly influence bitcoin price, if they suspend their service.No! I didn't see that capacity or market volume to control bitcoin price if they announced their suspension of operation, even as that, stronger things (events) had already happened to the market but yet did survive the market pressure there's no way bitcoin could face any strong rejection in price.Btw, there are some comments you aren't meant to take into heart or action since you didn't know the experience of such poster as I believe such comment could be likely be dropped by newbies or an amateur who doesn't know what they are saying ( such group are comprises with lots of individuals) so such comment are inevitably to come over time.",
