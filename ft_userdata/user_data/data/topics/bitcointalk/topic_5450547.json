Don't panic if the price dumps because it will pump again. Also be positive that you will grow in the forum and give yourself more time to learn and make research on your own. Bitcoin investment is like a new born child that takes time before he/she becomes a toddler. Having the market analysis knowledge will keep you stronger to hold for long.",

Avoid listening and reading wrong informations from Bitcoin haters.I must first of all commend you for your contribution to help the new comers to crypto but these are not only peculiar to Bitcoin rather to every of our daily dealings. Patience is very important in every aspect of human life not only when it comes to crypto. Not being patient will lead to wrong decisions and loss of funds. Learning and asking questions when necessary is very vital as it helps one to be current and prevent from being led astray. One who asks can never be lost. A proverb in my local dialect  Listening to BTC haters kill one's spirit of BTC investment. Make and your decisions and stick to it. Never allow anyone to discourage you. We've seen stories of people been discouraged and later successful with Bitcoin here and outside this forum as well. Self research is highly recommended thou. QuoteOne of the things I have learnt on this platform is to learn, make research more than comment And i have learnt a lot and still learning and opened to learning Be encouraged btc will make us smile...You're right mate bitcointalk.org has been more helpful than Google when it comes to Bitcoin. Majority of us here owed Bitcointalk founder a very big gratitude for initiating this space and serving people with the right information needed. However, one should also embark on self research to be more acquainted with what you're investing into.",

Since this forum is always available to help, feel free to always ask questions and make corrections What I'd like to add is that beginners tend to trust people too easily, especially if they have a lot of experience in the forum or are knowledgeable about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both of which I believe increase your risk of being scammed. As a beginner, come straight to these forums whenever you're confused or have a question; don't let anyone else know because they might use that information against you. Once again, I'd like to thank the OP.",

But you need to add on how to do good money management so that your patience and consistency are not wasted. Financial management will refer to how much money is used to buy and purchases are made gradually which can be called the DCA method. Because if it is not balanced with DCA, you will only be silent when the market starts to crash, even though it is a good opportunity to increase Bitcoin assets. Make sure the main target is achieved and always be optimistic and don't panic when the market crashes. Use money that you can afford to lose, don't use money that is still being used for other purposes.",

Bitcoin is good for rich people, and if you have a small investment of 1-5 thousand dollars, and you want to get 100-500 thousand, then bitcoin is not the best choice.Analyzing the growth of Bitcoin price, it maybe the two.  Adoption or the valuation of dollar become weak.  I agree the possibility of Bitcoin getting into a million dollar a piece can be due to weaker dollar purchasing power caused by hyper inflation.  But there is also a possibility of Bitcoin reaching 1m dollar value because of global adoption.  Though it is easier to achieve with the mixture of both inflation and adoption.Bitcoin is good for all people not only the rich one,  anything that can bring profit regardless of being small or huge is good for everyone but of course we should set our expectation in reality.",

Financial change is when you, who is someone that normally don't have money and always lack, begins to have money to spend. Bitcoin may not offer you that because even when the bitcoin your have rises, you will still want to hold for some more time, and even if you decide to withdraw the bitcoins you have that has gained, because you are financially wise, you will not be able to take it all or even a greater amount than what you will want to keep.",

Just think of it HODLing it long for at least one full bear/bull cycle, and that is going to be 4 long painful years. There will be obvious challenges that sometimes you want to sell your stash because the price is going down hard. But you keep on grinding hard, accumulating in the bear market, DCA weekly/monthly and then staying in the game. And after that, we enter the bull run and that's where all our hardship is going to pay off. Those sleepless nights, the stress and pressure are now gone. So I will suggest to really have that resilience inside of us and soon we will be rewarded. Delayed gratification is the key.",

Every Bitcoin holder must be patient, consistent, and brave. You need patience because the price of Bitcoin is volatile so you need to keep holding even in the face of uncertainties and a price drop. You would always hear scary news from different news outlets that might make you sell your coins below your purchasing price. This is why you need to be brave and stand strong no matter the pressure or attacks. The title of your post is \"It won't be long\" but nobody knows how long it will be. That is why we need to consistently follow our investment plan. To be free from pressure, it is advisable not to use loans or credit facilities to buy Bitcoin. Most people feel that it can make them rich overnight, so they go as far as using loans to buy the coin. Personal and other savings is the best type of fund to use for Bitcoin investment.QuoteOne of the things I have learnt on this platform is to learn, make research more than comment And i have learnt a lot and still learning and opened to learning Be encouraged btc will make us smile..The best approach to learning from this forum as a new member is to open your mind to learn, your eyes to observe, and let your hand be fast to ask relevant questions but slow to contribute until you have learned.",

This will help with better conversation and get better clarity.As most users suggested going for a buy at any point is good. Find the right chance to buy at the bottom to avoid the time of holding.We'll get to see more and more wrong information and fearful information getting circulated around.

Learn to be patient and stop learning strategy when you found your own system. Don't get caught up on system hopping. Instead learn when to take profit, when to take stoploss, and more importatantly when to wait and when to engage the market.2. Be consistent and be willing to ask questions where confused or better if you DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Everything is one search away. Don't rely too much on to other people's comment.3. Always be optimistic and put in your best effort. Be truth fully honest with yourself and your development. It's okay to be discourage sometimes but it's your responsibility to get back in track.4. Remove fear, buy when it's best for you and hold as if you don't care. Wrong! Do not be a holder. Be a smart investor. Don't buy unless you have a plan and a system properly laid out. 5. Avoid listening and reading wrong information from Bitcoin haters and bitcoin slaves. Always remember, all us here aims to make money and not to be right. There is no right or wrong information.
