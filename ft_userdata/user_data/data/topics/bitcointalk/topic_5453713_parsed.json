  "content": "I tried to send a transaction ~2 weeks ago or so, since there was no rush, I went with the \"economic\" fee, which was expected to get confirmed in around 2-3h.I send the maximum amount, so there was nothing unspent to bump up the fee (CPFP). Despite getting additional funds, I still can't bump it, when trying, I'm getting this error: \"Transaction has no utxo to form a child transaction or utxo has already been spent\".I rebroadcasted it a few times, just in case, but no luck so far.Transaction details:4e7d9250a5571008fc385fef67c3e6cef7d8adc8d6d171de0133eaff564779b2What are my options now? Does Mycelium auto-rebroadcast unconfirmed transactions? If I delete the transaction from the wallet and it gets forgotten by the network - the message says I'd need to synchronize the wallet, how do I do that exactly?Or is it just easier to use a paid-for miners tx bumping service?",

(By default, transactions are dropped from the mempool after two weeks.)Import your wallet into electrum. Wait until your transaction is dropped from the mempool and then make a new transaction on electrum. With electrum, you can make RBF-enabled transaction, so that you can bump the fee if required.

Quote from: pawel7777 on May 22, 2023, 10:35:45 PMNot quite sure what do they mean by synchronizing - does it just mean refreshing, or is it more complex process?In a SPV wallet like mycelium, synchronizing means getting required data from the server.

Does it always take 2 weeks for it to be dropped, or can it take longer?Different nodes have different setting. The default setting is that transactions are dropped from the mempool after two weeks. It's possible that a node drops your transaction from its mempool after two weeks while another node will still keep your transaction.After two weeks, most nodes will probably drop your transaction from their mempool and most block explorers will no longer display your transaction.",

Not quite sure what do they mean by synchronizing - does it just mean refreshing, or is it more complex process?It means if you delete the transaction and it has left most mempool and the mempool of the servers that mycelium is using, that the transaction will not appear again but show on your balance and you will be able to spend it again. To make your wallet synchronize again, some wallets have a button that you can click on, or better just close the wallet and open it again and it will synchronize again.Quote from: pawel7777 on May 22, 2023, 10:35:45 PMps. How do I know if the transaction has been forgotten by the network, will it just be no longer visible in block explorers etc? Does it always take 2 weeks for it to be dropped, or can it take longer?hosseinimr93 has answered this already. But also that if the mempool is very congested and become full at 300MB, low fee transactions would be replaced by high fee transactions and be dropped from the mempool. The low fee transactions can be rebroadcast again with higher fee.",

If your transaction is stuck, it is better not to open the wallet, or making sure the wallet do not synchronize with the blockchain. With this, if you import your seed phrase or private key on Electrum, with time, a server or some servers will drop the transaction from their mempool so that you can rebroadcast the coin again in another transaction.
