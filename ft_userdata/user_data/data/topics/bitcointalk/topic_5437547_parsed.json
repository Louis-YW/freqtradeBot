Healthcare is an issue around the world, for being too expensive or for not having proper architecture and care. But today I was surfing on some CEX and DEFI and I found on Mexc the $VITA (That is not a new project) and I kind of surprised by how low exposure this project (and others like these have). Only introduction, Vita is a project that develops and researches solutions produced by longevity and it has a lot of strong supporters and investors. The last year I encounter Galeon which was mainstream for a little bit (also another project that I think has a lot of future) and others like Aimedis as a competitorBut Do you think crypto and blockchain can give the Healthcare system solutions in any way? Do you know some good projects or the ones I mentioned? One topic that I think can be crucial is having your Med history on blockchain and letting them be accessible in any place so you don't have to be in a specific place to get the proper one (this is an issue in my place I don't know in yours)(Galeon, in the other hand,  thought of this issue)",

As crypto is seen as possible financial solution in the lives of its adopters, instantly we tend to believe it must also bring a solution to healthcare system. However, so far I don't see any practical usages blockchain could have in order to maximize the efficiency of healthcare in our countries.I believe what could make the difference is investment from governments or private companies on technology regards this area, so new devices and kinds of treatments could be developed and introduced in our local communities. However, I fear it's not through an ICO money raise or pump and dump token scheme that we are going to see improvements on this area.",

It would require next level tech to make something like that even possible and there are like handful of coders in the world that could design such a system. Anyone can make a \"solution\" but for it to be useful is another case. It would need L1 zero-knowledge proof KYC solution to start with, and mountain of other stuff with cutting edge unproven tech. That would also need real world adoption and that's not going to happen with some generic erc20 tokens with anon team and dao.",

As for the usage you mentioned a well-thought and well-designed system should suffice to cover that kind of problem, especially the availability. Even if blockchain is somehow can be utilized, it doesn't have to incorporate crypto, they just need to simply design the blockchain with much centralization. Although, I doubt that even \"blockchain\" is required for this kind of problem.One thing is for sure, any crypto that claims to offer a solution to a medical/health problem is very likely worthless.",
