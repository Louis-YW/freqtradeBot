Our whole team is gathered in our offices in Lille (France) and we thought it would be a good time to introduce ourselves to the Bitcointalk community.Currently, we are building a complementary proximity economy via a payment application 3.0, all composed of a central core on a hybrid between 2 large blockchains!1- Our first token is known as OZAPHYRE (€OZP). (by Stellar)It is a stable \"fidelity token\" used to facilitate cash-ins, payments and investments via Ozalentour (guaranteed on a EURO reserve)This token will be exclusively available through our Ozalentour application.2- To complete our offer, we have also developed an \"placement token\" to facilitate investments in crypto-currencies: OZACOIN ($OZA). (by BSC)https://i.imgur.com/VAFISST.pngThis token will be available via Pinksale for pre-sale, then via Pancakeswap and various listings for this end of 2022. (see the whitepaper)Also note that our Ozalentour app will allow you to start your own crypto-currency business within a community of verified professionals and individuals (KYC/KYB/AML ON).Payments will be made mainly via QRCODE and cash transfers via Stellar (2x faster than VISA, no cap and contactless).Note that we are a company composed of 41 shareholders with a capital of 210.680€. In the fund raising phase, we are also followed by several partners to obtain our PSAN VISA (95% finalized).Do not hesitate to join our Telegram if you have any questions.Sincerely,The FounderJDPS An ICO for the $OZA token is approaching!
