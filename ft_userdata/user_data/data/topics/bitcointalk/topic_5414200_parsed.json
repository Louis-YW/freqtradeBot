You just have to proceed to stake it as on their documentation page information(https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms), then just let it do the work. Staking on PancakeSwap in a sense doesn't similar to running a 24/7 staking node, the underlying smart contract will do its job after you approve to farms CAKE-BNB.",

Anything that needs to be done must be connected on the dapp but no need to continously connect it since the farm will work even without it.",
