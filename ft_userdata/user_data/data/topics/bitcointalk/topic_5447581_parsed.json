  "content": "\"A message from RayCEO of PaxfulToday, Paxful will be suspending its marketplace. We are not sure if it will come back.This will probably come as a big shock to many. While I cannot share the full story now, I can say that we unfortunately have had some key staff departures. Also, regulatory challenges for the industry continue to grow, especially in the peer-to-peer market and most heavily in the U.S. While we work through these issues, we have taken the most secure option and ask you to explore self-custody and trade elsewhere.\"Happend today.. not a suprise.Its 100% greed from both paxful and LCB instead of running 100% legit business without being greedy as fuck they choose this path.'What is the best platform for p2p crypto trading right now?",
