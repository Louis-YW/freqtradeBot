  "content": "Wondering what peoples sentiment for 2023 is right now, negative, neutral sideways or still aspiring higher.I see the price challenging the lows of last week here, we achieved 24k as a low but the majority of the price action remained above 25.5k.  That resolution in the sell was some slight positive, a sell off can reverse but it appears to be failing in that resolve right now.   Right this moment we are trading and threatening a wider move.     How do we finish 2023 if this move isnt finished with just resolving purely back to March prices.Here is the price action on 15m bars in last few hours, this does appear some attempt lower.   I think we observed this before also, main markets close negative sentiment (repeatedly)and after hours approaching the Asia open around midnight forum hours the price becomes weakened.  Failing to hold here does make me think of 25k or lower could be the wider range required to establish strength.I've forgotten how to do a poll, maybe its a mod only thing now.  But I'm wondering, Going forward into the 2023 finishing price action and sentiment & using 25k as a pivot:BTCPositiveNeutral Negative[Quick follow up chart.   Lets see it resolve higher and prove me wrong, of course Im fine with being wrong lol.   I do think we have weakness just look at the volume but never look at any wider picture just once, its worth discussion imo ]",

If it can be recovered in a short time, I would like it to come to the prices you said.I wonder how long it will stay at what price level if the price drops further. After all, Bitcoin can suddenly increase its price.",

      "body": "I think it's still a bit early to assume whether the rest of the year will be bullish/bearish/neutral, but I'd say relatively neutral for now between $20K and $30K. Price needs to reclaim $28.5K in order to return bullish, which for now I find unlikely given the months of distribution that has occurred at this level. I'm otherwise not entirely bearish until the $25K lows have been taken out, then I imagine $23K will be next.Earlier in the year I was anticipating a re-test of $23K support/accumulation level, but instead it never occurred with $25K resistance being turned into new support. However I think this level is back on the table with $30K confirmed as resistance, especially since bulls think that $25K will continue to hold while bears are waiting for $20K again, so somewhere in the middle around $23K seems more likely as a new support level.The recent $BCOIN ETF launch otherwise didn't help, as expected, with price immediately dumping afterwards (as per always with ETF/future launches: ProShares, Bakkt, CME & CBOE). So hopefully if we can avoid any ETF approvals this year then price can probably remain relatively stable/neutral. Otherwise we could see not only $20K but a return to the lows if ETF's get approved this year. Let's hope that's not the case.",

You may not be a short term trader so you are not very interested in finding out why Bitcoin has decreased in price this week, because those who still like to trade with Bitcoin especially in the short term will continue to find out why Bitcoin has decreased in price besides they are looking for potential which could make Bitcoin rise again before next year.Quote Maybe in this month BTC is still struggling to break through $30k because the selling point is quite high on that wall.

Because many people were also expecting and saying in August bitcoin will cross $35k but so far we are even trading at $26,000 and more likely to drop to $25k. Historically, halvings have not activated an immediate bull run, but a real bull run usually occurs 1 year after the halving. So that won't be a reason for bitcoin to rally and hit $40k before the end of the year. To do that we need big positive news.",
