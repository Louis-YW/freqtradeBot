They are pioneer of Play to Earn GameFi industry but they stopped it and shifted away from GameFi.Who invested in Axie Infinity before the bull run or early of bull run did get very great profit. Others who joined later and hoped for a new all time high would be in pain now. But Axie Infinity is not a scam project.RACA did have good hype and it is normal with altcoins. Pumps and dumps and altcoin investors should know it, accept risk and know what they are doing.",

In the article given, Alex as the author attaches various data that most likely leads to deliberate market manipulation, then, is this not considered a fraud? I think that includes mate.They made those manipulations to trap investors into buying $RACA. There's nothing wrong with the OP's and Alex's allegations in the article, as long as he provides strong enough data.",

      "body": "Apt analysis. I remember back then I always saw KoLs and the so-called influencer hyping RACA, I immediately sense the shadiness back then. Turns out well, it's not far from scammy and manipulative behaviour.The address analysis strongly suggest that the manipulation are being done behind the scene and should be a preminent part of how they execute their plan. Well, there are many indications that show there's something wrong with this token, a sign of simply PnD token.",

Pumps and dumps and altcoin investors should know it, accept risk and know what they are doing.Yes pump and dump is normal actually but with thr evidence and data shown in the article it seems manipulation is quite real. I myself trading raca before and did some earned some profits with it. I expect some pnd with it but didnt realize a bigger manipulation could be somehow underlying this project especially it got listed on top tier exchange.",

The price was slowly going down without any chance to go up. The metamon that already announced in the past has become a failed product. How can people call that would become the best metaverse? People can't even know which aspects that will make raca to be another dead project soon. This project is only fooling its investors. The dev didn't have enough skill to develop the product. It can be seen from how all of products from raca were failed.",

And it some cases, project just die a natural death in the bear market.",
