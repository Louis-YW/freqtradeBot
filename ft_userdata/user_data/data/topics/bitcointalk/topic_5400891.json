Imagine the blockchain network fails that's catastrophic and it's almost impossible, similar to the currency (bitcoin) that was built on it. As for Alt coins, people should stop rating coins eligibility to succeed by its prices but, the use case behind it. Just like I said about blockchain network its the use case of bitcoin and many companies that condemned bitcoin in the past like JP Morgan are working on the technology today. So, use case is what matters when investing on any coin or project on the cryptocurrency market.",

Altcoins are pump and dump projects, short term 'stuffs' that sooner or later will dump, it was Luna a couple of weeks ago, mind you that the problem isn't solely with Luna, as it can be any altcoin next.Bitcoin on the other hand can plunge/correct in price, but it is a coin that has an actual utility in our society today, that is something most, if not all altcoins can't boast of, thus a coin that has an actual utility can't dump and stay down permanently, it would definitely rise back up again, and history is in its favor as regards that.",

Unfortunately people keep comparing things with bitcoin and think that the reason why bitcoin is so successful is because \"it is big\" but the fact is that bitcoin is successful because it is useful and well designed.Comparing it with altcoins you can see that regardless of their size or rank in the list of market caps, altcoins are not useful and their design is flawed some of them have serious flaws like top altcoins including ethereum. This is why shitcoins like Luna fail, a centralized flawed design was practically guaranteed to fail.",

Its not just terra but even the top coins out there are all risky. Yes they could be blue chips but we cant anticipate such event that will occurred to them whether its good or bad. The only thing we must do is be ready and always invest only you can afford to lose.

Doing this won't really be a loss but rather an experience gained to do things differently, smart and better. Problem is some people forgot or don't know anything about risk management. They invest too much because of the get rich quick mindset. With the parabolic growth of luna in the beginning I'm pretty sure there are some people that only invested because of the hype. But with the Terra Luna collapse, their 6 digits investment became 3 digit just in a week. Some people got depressed to the point that they took their own life because of that experience.",

But what if the market will become saturated, there will be very little new investors who believe in \"Bitcoin to the moon\"? Then a downward spiral might begin, investors who are tired of waiting for massive profits will dump it and be satisfied with modest profits, investors who barely made any profits would dump it fearing potential loss, and so on.",

With bitcoin, it's still the best and if not safe for the others, it's still the most trustworthy crypto that anyone can invest with. Yet many don't like to buy it and chooses their path to altcoins because they're looking for better and quicker gains whilst for bitcoin, it's steady and slowly.",

Even in the worst case scenario, there will be those who, under no circumstances, will not sell their BTC. Faith in bitcoin has already grown so much that, in my opinion, this is impossible. Just as important is the fact that not all investors evaluate bitcoin as a speculative tool for enrichment. Undoubtedly, these investors at the first incomprehensible situation will sell everything at once. But there are holders of a completely different kind, for whom bitcoin is something more than just a tool for increasing money.

Why do I say that?I believe the crypto investor is making the same mistake because you just invested in the Terra Luna coin without reading the concept of the project.I don't know maybe most people invested in the project because it claimed to be backed with BTC but the project concept was \"price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of Bitcoin (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements. \" and it was said to \"use of fiat-pegged stablecoins\". Whereas no crypto is stable in price.Which they are just creating another version of the mistake made by the Central Bank. I don't know if they have learned from their previous mistake but people to stop investing in hype base projects especially those that the influencer claimed to have invested real big money without doing their own research.",
