I do not see any evidence that he personally endorsed this casino or anything.As for the Bitcointalk.org forum, how do you expect them to determine which sites are legitimate and which are scams before allowing them to post? They managed to fool you, didn't they?Quote from: Ptolemy on January 07, 2023, 05:17:54 PMthey are Vietnamese owners from my research. Pieces of shit, soulless people.I understand that you are upset about being scammed, and I can imagine how difficult that must be. However, it would be helpful if you could provide more information about what happened so that other forum members can avoid similar situations. Do you have any evidence or details about the circumstances that led to this situation?",

I managed to win in the end and had about 12.000 to 14.000 USDT to withdraw there after countless withdrawals and deposits.They suspended my account and refuse to send any money. The reason? Nothing, just some stupid made up excuses because I won money at these scammers.STAY away!",

Pieces of shit, soulless people.Scams are not moderated here and don't include the Bitcointalk community and the admin team they have nothing to with it, you should blame yourself for not doing enough research, and don't generalize the Vietnamese people, the sin of one individual is not the sin of one country, you have to think before posting its racism.Its good that you posted this issue here not people is aware that they should not play here.",

Stay well away from these crooks!I did not say that you have already committed a violation, but I say that sometimes some users commit violations without knowing, this is a possible possibility.The other thing is, it is your fault why are you depositing more money on a site whose reliability you have not verified yet? Casino and gambling sites have a lot of scams, so you should check first before depositing more money into your account.In any case, it is useful to post your experience here so that other users are careful and do not make such mistakes.",

It's about time that OP creates a flag on this casino, but OP needs to calm down and follow the right format in creating a scam accusation, this casino's existence in this forum is over, and this is why people should only trust a huge amount of money to the well-established casino, its ok to try out or test a new casino but never commit thousands of dollars, not because you are gambling you will also gambling away your money to a new casino with a high risk of scamming you.",
