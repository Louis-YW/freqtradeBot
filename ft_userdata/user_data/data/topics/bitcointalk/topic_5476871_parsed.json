The posts could simply be good by itself and therefore it doesn't necessarily prove the functionality of our service. In this case we prefer if someone can test it *directly* with his own posts and let us know his feedback.  Thank you.You want someone else to try it on the platform you're talking about. I actually chinecked him, and I saw that it was necessary to subscribe to perform the upvote. I guess I would buy or pay for my upvote depending on the plan you have there on the platform you showed here.For example, if I choose 12$, I have the opportunity to make 3 votes per minute, and if I total it in 1 hour, I will earn 14.4$, so I can grow by 2.4$ within 1 hour. That's why you can't show anything proven, or is what you say true? In short, we come out the losers and you are the winners. It's hard to tell the truth. First, prove that it's true.I will explain. 1. On the platform you can purchase votes: The more you buy, the less you pay per vote. It is not a subscription, it is a one time payment. 2. If you decide to get 150 votes, that is $12. You can use these votes on as many as 30 posts because 5 votes is a minimum to be sent towards a post or you can use them all towards one post. You can also send 5 (or more; 200 is maximum) votes towards the same post multiple times. 3. The speed is 3 votes per minute; per submitted request from our service. This is how fast the votes are going to change on your reddit post. You can also send your votes towards multiple posts, and each submitted request is going to have a speed 3 votes per minute. You can also send towards the same post twice and the speed is going to become 6 upvotes per minute. (We will change the wording on our website)To explain this a little bit further, on reddit normally if you create a really good post you are unlikely to get 10 votes a minute! This could make your post look strange and that's why we choose 3 votes per minute (per submitted request). It looks much more organic. 4. I hope my reply made it a bit clearer. If I showed you an account with boosted votes you couldn't tell if the votes were boosted by our service or if the post was simply good and people upvoted it themself. In this case we would offer a vouch/test copy (free votes) to reputable members for free, for them to try our service and leave a feedback below this post. Why use our service? Because it guarantees you that your post will be seen. On reddit people need to upvote, but even if your post is good, you might be unlucky and have your post shown to the wrong people that are not going to leave you a vote and suddenly new posts flood the subreddit and your post is no longer seen and is less likely to rank good. This is how reddit works.Let me know if you have any more questions!",
