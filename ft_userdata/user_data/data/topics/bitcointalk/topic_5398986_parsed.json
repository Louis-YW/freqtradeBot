I personally am not surprised because Bryce and WSM are stuck in the last century and are more hurting the sport than helping it transition to a more modern and recognized sport.",

They can train specifically for those events and gain an advantage over other participants.The format and events for WSM should be identical every year. That way no one can gain an unfair advantage by knowing what the year's *surprise* events will be.It could also be good to introduce a balance between raw strength and cardio challenges for health purposes. Former World's Strongest Man, Mariusz Pudzianowski struggled with cardio when he made the transition to MMA. Pure bulking and massing isn't good for the human immune system and other aspects of health.",

I'm not all that into weight lifting, but I find the sport quite intriguing, since they do push them self to the limit, potentially more than any other sport. I recently rewatched the Eddie Hall documentary, which is fantastic if anyone hasn't watched it. The amount they go through behind the scenes is quite remarkable, and his wife is very much part of his success. Quote from: TheNineClub on May 24, 2022, 05:30:52 PMIn the wake of WSM 2022, some accusations  To be fair, accusations are always made in this sport, and you can see why.
