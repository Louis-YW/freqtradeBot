Both requiring more Holders and Volume for enlistment.We would like to propose, always with the collaboration of the community, teamwork for the lifting of the token and its publication in these listings.Among the closest objectives of the project we find the creation of \"QG WALLET\" the decentralized wallet of Quieroganar that will allow cryptocurrencies to be safely stored, traded with them and even purchased by credit card.The QG WALLET will have a service cost of 0.42%. Thus equaling the 0.33%/0.80% that Metamask charges per operation.Undoubtedly we are facing a project for the future and a good chronology. Well, QG is dedicated to creating projects at the request of users, creating nft games, metaverse, exchanges, among others.We are currently 1000 Holders. 18 BNBs providing Liquidity.If you want to buy our token you can search for it through the contract:0xfb8bf58b23e3cbcbabb169cfc704ebb2878cb48aRED BSCPANCAKESWAPIn the following link we find a YouTube video where they present the project: https://youtu.be/eSyMkLeG4Lc It is in Spanish but you can activate subtitles.The CEO of the QG project: Jose Stiven (the current user who is publishing this post) will answer all the questions that you ask. Well, we are transparent in every way.Web Project: Quieroganar.es",
