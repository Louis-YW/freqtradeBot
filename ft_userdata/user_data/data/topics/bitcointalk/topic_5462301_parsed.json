Since I don't hold any of them, the best thing for you to start with if you wanna believe on these projects is to look at their websites. From there, you'll get a glimpse of what these projects are all about and what they're working on. Honestly, with that way of checking these projects, I think that near has got some good things about its progress. But that doesn't mean you should invest already on it. Look at many markets where it has been and how they're doing as a project and progress that they've been working with. If you think that if all of those points are found in any of them, then start thinking whether to buy or not. It's not just all about the hype or what not but it's all about what you know about the project so that you're not naive upon buying it.",

I hope their users who were robbed can find a way.",

I think near protocol and harmony ONE are fantastic project. Near Protocol is best coin i think. It’s future is bright i think. In 2022 January Near protocol price was $20. And now it’s price is $1.34. Future bull session Near Protocol price will boom many people are telling. I also think in future bull session Near protocol price will hit new ATH. Who will buy now and hold Near Protocol he will be huge profited i think. Now Near Protocol 39 rank on coinmarketcap. And Harmony One is also good coin. Past bull market in 2021 Harmony One price was $0.3789 and now it’s price is $0.0115. I think future bull session it’s price also boom. So how are investing in this bear market he will be huge profited there has no doubt. So i think both coin is best for investment.",

I can say that these are not the most popular protocols and the projects that developers deploy in these networks are not characterized by any high level of distribution in various crypto services. If these networks do not have any clear advantages over others, I do not see much point in using them. The native tokens of these protocols also indicate a low demand for such blockchain spaces.",
