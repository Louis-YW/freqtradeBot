Most of people just rely with any words written on the whitepaper without verifying anything since there's no way to verify it. I think if there's a thing can't be verified on the project, it's better to avoid it. But do you think do you will have a lot time to check every project's whitepaper? there's around 20,000 cryptos.",

There are a handful of white papers worth checking out (well, I like to think only one or two other than Bitcoin's but I haven't read them all). You'd be surprised to realise most new projects don't even bother coming out with one because they know they got nothing new to bring to the table.",

So for them what is the most difficult part to understand or why they are not getting into it ?I also believe that the fiat system of it being centralised has made it difficult for people to really venture into crypto because they don't see a familiar setup of Bitcoin being centralised and the prefer to watch from the side lines....not knowing BTC means financial freedom for them.

      "body": "A few things.What's it good for.Since Bitcoin is still very early in its adoption the fact that you can't really use it to buy anything (except in a few small pockets around the world) means people generally think its not useful. And they don't yet understand the value of hard money compared to weak money like national currencies.Not understanding the value of hard money.This makes people always think \"oh maybe Bitcoin won't go up again\" so they think it is very risky and always at risk of going to zero. Even my mom is always worried about my money because all my money is in Bitcoin and everytime she asks I have to explain to her that Bitcoin will always keep going much higher in the future so its fine this is just a normal once in four years bear market. She's always asking me \"how is bitcoin doing\" so she's very concerned with short term price movements of my money, which brings me to the next thing.People don't understand the difference between long term risk and short term volatility.Because Bitcoin is volatile they think it is extremely risky. They view risk from the point of view of \"will it ever go down a lot for any amount of time?\" It seems REALLY hard for people to look at long term price charts and see the growth and instead they just focus on only the times Bitcoin has crashed and so they think it is very risky and very easy to lose money.The difference between Bitcoin and Crypto.People tend to think all cryptocurrencies are the same and they don't understand why Bitcoin is unique. So some people even think Bitcoin is not scarce because they actually think all cryptocurrencies are the same so they think if anyone can just make another cryptocurrency that means Bitcoin isn't scarce. Some of these people are trolls but some just really don't understand the differences and they think there is no difference between cryptocurrencies so they don't understand why Bitcoin has value when new cryptos are made all the time.They don't understand what it means to be decentralized.So people think Bitcoin can just be gotten rid of by the govt and then it'll be gone. They also don't realize how big Bitcoin is so outside of totalitarian regimes no govt is just gonna ban Bitcoin. They basically don't understand the reason Bitcoin was created and they think the govt can just decide to end it.They don't understand the difference between negative things happening in the crypto industry vs Bitcoin.If cryptocurrency from a website gets hacked they think Bitcoin got hacked. If there is a crypto scam they think Bitcoin is a scam. If some altcoin collapses they think Bitcoin failed. If a crypto exchange goes under they think Bitcoin failed. Another mom story, in December my mom was very worried about my Bitcoin because she heard about FTX and I told her its fine its just a normal bear market and a big exchange went bust its just a temporary thing and she was like \"no I read it is different this time because of FTX\" and I had to try to convince her one exchange going down does nothing to stop Bitcoin.",

Even veterans in the market still fall for this. Though it’s easy to say and tell yourself that this is just a part of crypto’s high volatility, but when you’re in the real situation and you spend your hard earned money to purchase bitcoin, then it’s price suddenly crash, you will really see yourself panicking thinking if the price can still recover or it will drop consistently. Good thing if you are not bothered and still continue to invest for long term, but for most of us particularly those newbies in the market, we will be thinking of cutting our losses and just sell the coins at a lower price, which I think will put us losing in the end.",

This uncertainty is a significant barrier to many people investing in cryptocurrency. Those who were able to overcome that fear still find it difficult to cope with market trends and, as a result, must adapt to it with a changed mindset in order to simply believe and accept the outcome of their investment without feeling guilty about it. Others may not see this as a barrier because they understand market trends and believe in speculations about them which works for them.",
