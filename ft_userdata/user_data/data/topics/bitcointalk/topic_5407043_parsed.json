We do not want a locked thread to be an excuse for not giving a red tag, in case some members need to exchange more on this subject, here you have an open thread that is never going to be locked.It's on you!

This would actually fool even more victims if you don't red tag scammers, and encourage scam behaviour for other members since they know they'll get away with it like Royse777 did.People reading this should also in most part distrust anything promoted on this forum (of course some will still fall for the trap)Quote from: mindrust on July 20, 2022, 05:51:28 PMWhy would he get any red tags?

Depending on the mistake of course. Everyone is free to read the story and make their own judgement. You don't have to be DT to leave a feedback, and not everyone is going to agree. Everything is based on a case by case basis man. Imo users aren't being biased towards anyone, some have just shown who they are in a better way then others.",

They contribute lot of things in the forum and scam busting is one of such.But not all accusations are correct. Let me dig into the past that with Livecoin campaign in 2018 or 2019, in forum, there were two sides: one support it is non scam, one consider it as a true scam.Now, after a few years, they actually exit but back in the days, years ago, the story is not clear like nowadays.I used to confuse with it, but I believe Livecoin is non scam, and after a long and careful consideration, asking for opinion of some members (that are more experienced than me) they even could not say solid conclusion about Livecoin, I joined their campaign but it is because I believed Livecoin is not scam back in that day. I did not attack Livecoin, called it as scam and then joined it later as a two-faced guy.Now, for now, I believe Royse777 is non scam but it can be changed in future. We can not say about future at the moment. ¬†Please stop the drama about Royse777, except if you have something new (evidence) to say.",

May all of you who read this make the right decision!And wish you all the best.When looking at her behaviour in that now locked thread, Royse777 came across as immature, temperamental, aggressive and of course the list goes on but she never once came across as remorseful or apologetic.I think Royse777 locking the thread after posting another wall of text containing nonsensical drama to misdirect away from any questions posed at her, did not surprise me especially after she was being asked questions why she wanted to carry out KYC on a victim when Bitlucy did not exist any longer. After all, Royse777 made a promise to make victims whole again but is now escaping that too by citing another round of nonsense and misdirection.Also, by you alluding some members would not tag Royse777 because they were in receipt of payments for wearing the signature, you should either apologise and withdraw that comment or elaborate further because you are calling in to question the character of several members without naming names.Quote from: decodx on July 20, 2022, 10:46:26 PMConsidering Royse777's actions since the BitLucy fiasco, it shouldn't be a surprise that he locked that thread.

The goodwill is because of the trust he gathered before the scam incident happened. To some members who aren't trusted nor have track of positive trust in the forum, there would have been pills of red trust. But it is very fair that some DT members after reading Royse777 version of the story turned their red tag to neutral. I believe that by now Royse777 would have been vindicated and the remaining red trusts removed, but I am surprised it has lingered. I sincerely wish Royse777 can come out of this 100% because for the little I have seen him/her in the forum, he/she is trustworthy.",
