  "content": "When I knew about bitcoin I asked about the creator and a name was given me as Satoshi Nakamoto. When I researched about the name I was told it was a pseudonym and at the same time the Satoshi is anonymous. I did not bother myself more about his identity. Coming to this forum and I saw Satoshi profile, that showed that Satoshi actually communicated here, I now have the feeling that Satoshi is in this forum. Since there is no KYC and there is privacy allowed here. There is every chance that Satoshi is here.Here is therefore my 20 questions to you Satoshi:1. Why did you create a technology as big as blockchain and bitcoin and gave it out for free?2. Why have you not withdrawn your coins including the genesis block and other btc in 20+ addresses?3. Are you afraid that if you withdraw them, government can trace you through that means?4. Did you lose the private keys or you were unable to backup all your folders then and as such lost your keys?5. Are you seeing that bitcoin can make $1m in the future and decided to hold tight till then?6. Wait! Are you still alive? Or you died of earthquake in the North?7. Are you a man or a woman or a group of people?8. Do you have any regrets in creating bitcoin. I asked because a scripture said that God regrettable creating man.9. How about if you sell your coin for charity rather than allow it waste.10. Is the way bitcoin going now, the way you planned it to be? Have the bitcoiners altered your initial plans and arrangements for bitcoin?11. Do you something feel like to appear in the court one day and 100%Â  prove Craig Wright wrong?12. You don't want to withdraw your bitcoin because if you do, there will be great panic that may collapse bitcoin. 13. OK! Your coins is serving as bitcoin reserve to prevent 51% attack?(No, this is not it...51% attack is about computing power and not about coins)14. Why did you choose 21 million as the maximum amount of bitcoin to be in circulation? Why not 20 million that is a round figure and why not 50 million. Bitcoin would still be a scarce commodity if you made it 100 million.15. Why is halving 4 years circle and not 2 years. Is it related to the world cup 4 years interval?16. If FBI decides to uncover your identity, do you think it will be difficult for them?17. Bitcoin is more than 10yrs you created it. How many more years do you have in mind that bitcoin will last when you created it. I do not believe that you had in mind of creating an everlasting currency when you are not a government. 18. When do you intend to re-appear as Satoshi Nakamoto?19. Do you still contribute to the bitcoin network by maintaining the codes or you totally hands off bitcoin and started playing ruby in the streets of Alabama?20. Do you have kidsÂ  did you teach them about bitcoin, are they into bitcoin now?I am sorry if I have bothered you with so many questions because only you have better answer to most of this questions.P.S Community, did Satoshi grant any interview before his disappearance. If yes, someone should please point me to it.@Satoshi@all",

Why did you create a technology as big as blockchain and bitcoin and gave it out for freeSatoshi did not create the technology out of a selfish interest; he created the technology and Bitcoin for everyone in the world to use, and despite his absence, the purpose for which he created the coin is still a success.Quote6. Wait! Are you still alive? Or you died of earthquake in the North?If he's dead, who do you then expect to come and answer this question? But perhaps even if Satoshi is here with us, he would not respond.Quote7. Are you a man or a woman or a group of people?LOL, these questions is dumb. What will you do with such information? ðŸ˜‚Quote8. Do you have any regrets in creating bitcoin. I asked because a scripture said that God regrettable creating man.Satoshi is not God, and as long as Satoshi's vision for creating Bitcoin is fulfilled, he will not have any regrets.Quote15. Why is halving 4 years circle and not 2 years. Is it related to the world cup 4 years interval?That's because halving is supposed to occur when 210,000 blocks have been mined, and these are completed approximately every 4 years.Quote18. When do you intend to re-appear as Satoshi Nakamoto?He will not, because he doesn't have any need to do so and his technology is still efficient.Quote20. Do you have kidsÂ  did you teach them about bitcoin, are they into bitcoin now?OP, Satoshi did not pass any interview that I am aware of, and really, you don't expect Satoshi to come and answer all these questions. But because Satoshi is a human, he could have children that we are unaware of.",

Since Satoshi is not active in this forum your questions are of no value.Satoshi is anonymous and he won't reveal his identity for his own safely, he has created something for the good of humans and still people like you ask those childish questions. Some of your questions are so meaningless that no one is going to answer those questions.I will answer only your first question: He created Blockchain and Bitcoin for those who wanted a way to trade their goods and money without any interference from a centralized entity or government. Â He gave this technology free because his intentions were positive and due to his kindness we have this blockchain technology in our hands. I must say that we are lucky to have someone like Satoshi who invented something very special and named it Bitcoin that made our lives easier. We should appreciate his efforts rather than asking questions that doesn't make proper sense. You can get answer to most of your questions by reading more about Bitcoin and Blockchain.
