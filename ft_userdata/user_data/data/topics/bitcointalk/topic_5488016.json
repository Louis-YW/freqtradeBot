      "body": "Well, from what I saw, many users already said where the address came from but only the platform, but if who is the person who owns it, it is impossible to know that because the only identity we have in crypto currency is the wallet address. So, sad to say, if you sent assets from that address accidentally, then you might not be able to return them. That's why it is very important for an asset holder to be mindful whenever you are sending assets from one wallet to another because the wallet address is a crucial thing to be cared for because one wrong letter or what will send your asset to another person who you don't know.Anyway, maybe there are some who can trace the wallet address of the person they belong to; the question is, is it worth it? I mean, is the asset you have sent too huge? I hope not, because maybe the person who receives it has already secured the asset.",

You could have checked your receiving wallet address before sending your coin out as that is the ideal thing or measures to have been done. From what other members have said, seems your BTC was sent to an exchange wallet address which means you can have a way to communicate with the exchange to see if they could help you get back your coin. Possibly the exchange could listen to you with proven evidence to claim ownership of the wallet address. You just could try this measures and see how it goes.Goodluck to you.",

But this situation could in fact help OP with the case.Correct me if wrong.  But considering the situation OP is in, if the owner of that Address has not logged on to KuCoin for over an year then the Exchange could send out a notification through Email or other methods of communication to the owner.  Something like a deadline 12 months for now.  If the owner never responds and never logs back to KuCoin either, the Coins be returned to OP.In fact.  I believe most Exchanges have this clause in the Terms where if you do not log in for a particular amount of time, they reserve the rights to claim your funds.I do not have a better idea than this, and even mine could be very stupid.  Anyway.  I do not think KuCoin would bother with a complicated situation like this.  Exchanges barely bother with much simpler situations, let alone this one.But maybe there is hope for a shine at the end of the tunnel.  Who knows.  OP can only hope.",

The thing should be that the person that the coins was sent to his address is a honest and upright person, because if he is then OP wouldn't have any problem getting back his coins. It is when the account owner is the opposite that it will be difficult for OP to get his coins soon.OP needs to be patience to see if there will be a positive result from Kucoin, or forget about the coins and move on.",
