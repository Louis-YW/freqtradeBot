  "content": "I don’t have enough Bitcoin (yet) to borrow for anything significant, but this is my ultimate plan. When I get enough Bitcoin, I would borrow no more than half its worth (in case the price drops), and then I would still have Bitcoin along with whatever property I buy with the borrowed money. This seems like a smarter move than to sell the Bitcoin for fiat money. If I sell, then I have to pay capital gains tax. When the cash is borrowed, there is no tax. Since I still have the Bitcoin, then I will gain when the price rises. If I only have fiat, the “price” will always go down because of inflation. I hope Bitcoin will eventually replace the fiat system, but until then, the market for cash favors borrowers over savers. This seems like a win-win situation.Does anyone else plan on doing this?",

Michael Saylor talks about this. If I have to pay 5% interest, but Bitcoin’s price raises over 5% a year, then I would be making money. If I sell the Bitcoin for fiat, then inflation will eat up that money. This is apparently what everyone from Elon Musk to Donald Trump does. They don’t actually have any money. They just have property, and borrow against the property because the property is more valuable than the cash.",

If more Bitcoiners followed this strategy, the price of Bitcoin would also rise because we would have more holders. Basically, you buy an asset that is sure to appreciate. What you lose in interest, you gain substantially more in equity- allowing you to borrow even more. This is why I said I wouldn’t borrow more than half of what Bitcoin is worth at any given time.

Are you referring to a Bitcoin? You didn't say anything about the amount of bitcoin, you just said that when you have Bitcoin, do we know if you are only targeting half or 1 bitcoin. It's a bit like what you're saying is just confusing or just a little messy. But in my understanding, maybe it's better not to borrow money if you have 1 Bitcoin. It's like you injured yourself if your body is fine.Also, there are many ways in this forum to earn bitcoin or even altcoins as long as you just research and ask questions here, there are even other members on this platform who lend here like @darkstar, Shasan and others as long as they will see that you have a source of funds to pay what you borrow.",

This is so 2021 what you are saying.The one who popularized this last year was Michael Saylor, to the point of recommending to people that if you have a paid off house, take a mortgage and buy Bitcoin with the money they give you. Soon other Youtubers jumped on the bandwagon, like Max Kaiser.The problem is that we are in 2022 and many of the entities that allowed you to borrow against you Bitcoin have gone bankrupt, and people who had deposited Bitcoin in them, to borrow against it, for trade or other reasons, have been left without their Bitcoin and we will see if they get it back. Remember: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\".If you acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin it is much safer to sell or spend small parts than to borrow against it, even if you have to pay capital gains tax. Better to pay tax than to lose your Bitcoin.",

Just get a FIAT loan without touching your Bitcoin and buy more Bitcoin with it. Timing is everything and I have done it 6 months beforethe halving then 12 months after the halving sell the Bitcoin you bought to do whatyou want or just part of it to pay the complete FIAT loan back.* of course i cannot guarantee this will actually work just based on fast performance alone!",
