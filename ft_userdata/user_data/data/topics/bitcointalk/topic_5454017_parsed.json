The length of time you give in to the forum will determine how fast you are learning, that's if you are reading quite a lot, it will also determine the number of posts you may be capable to make per day. You can make as many posts as you want, as long as those posts are not some kind of meaningless shitpost. You don't need to be afraid to make a post when you really need to. In my newbie days, I think my strength was only able to carry me for a maximum of 10 posts per day, which was not so frequent; some days I did five or even nothing. Just do any amount of post you can be able to do per day, but let them not be shit post, plagerised post and AI generated post.",

As a newbie, any board you can see the reply link button available for you, you can post there if not you can’t post in such boards. As a newbie, you’ll have a limitation between the time you make a post consecutively after the other, it lasts for 360 seconds (6 mins) but will continue to reduce over time until there’s no such limitations on your account again. Even with that time restriction between posts, you can make as many posts as possible but make sure you don’t spam the forum with low quality posts and comments to avoid been penalized.",
