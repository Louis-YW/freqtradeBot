In my opinion, the effects of digital currencies on our lives are as follows:In simple terms, digital money can be defined as a form of currency that uses computer networks to make payments. Breathless media coverage of the future potential of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has made digital money a hot topic.One of the main differences between digital money and physical currency, such as cash, is that digital money lacks any identifying features that make it unique. If you take a glance at any bank notes you might have sitting in source:theconversation. com/beyond-just-cryptocurrencies-digital-money-has-changed-how-we-live-181681 your wallet or purse, you will quickly notice that each note has a serial number ‚Äî a unique string of letters and numbers that marks the uniqueness of that bill.But as we know, digital objects, such as songs or images, are easily reproducible infinitely on the internet. What prevents us from reproducing the digital money in our bank accounts so easily?Most of us have been using digital money all along. It is not the digital nature of cryptocurrencies that differentiate them from digital money, but rather how they ensure the ownership of digital property that mark them as transformational.a) Nope, Its fine! -o- b) Yeap there is a big problem hereee!3) You sat all night and prepared a very good topic.

If you get banned (temporarily or permanently) and create a new account to continue posting / sending PMs, it's considered ban evasion. The only exception is creating a thread in Meta about your ban.If you are banned from the forum and you think you are innocent; All you have to do is create a new account just to post topics on Meta. If an account has been banned and you plan to open a new account and continue, remember that sooner or later you will be caught. Also, even if your disrespectful behavior is tolerated, remember that this forum and community is respectful and you may find yourself left out. Therefore if your account banned wrongly just wait for your request handled!Therefore, the correct answer is \"D\".And if you've come this far without any mistakes, congratulations my friend üëèüëèüëèüëè 9th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM30. This includes (but is not limited to) domains, software keys and membership invitations. What's considered similar is up to the moderator handling the situation.16. Do not have more than one active sales topic in the Currency exchange board.

No on-forum altcoin giveaways. [6][e]29. Sending unsolicited PMs, including but not limited to advertising and flood, is not allowed.27. Using automated translation tools to post translated content in Local boards is not allowed.You want to be successful, but the old ways are starting to get boring. For this reason; You can't get anywhere by sending promotional messages to members' private message boxes, opening a giveaway topic in the forum and using translation applications on local boards. Because these actions are prohibited in order to maintain the order of the forum. Also, be more rational otherwise the end of this road is gettin banned!Go to next question7th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM20. There are restrictions when selling accounts and invites for invite-only sites. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=134779.0 [2][?]Being a member of sites that accept membership by invitation can be really challenging, even I have experienced this situation. People who are banned from these sites or who want to engage in any fraudulent activity continue to act by purchasing invitations. Apart from being restricted by the rule specified in the forum, if these people detected by moderators or admins you may banned too. All your efforts and reputation will gone in that situation.Go to next question6th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM8. No threats to inflict bodily harm, death threats.Q: Why haven't you banned <insert scammer username here> who is an obvious scammer?A: Possible (or real, not for me to decide) scams are not moderated to prevent moderator abuse. If we start picking out which ones we call \"scammers\" and ban, we would make a lot of decisions based on biased opinions.6. No linking to phishing or malware, without a warning and a valid reason. [e]First of all, God save us from such people. Secondly death threats and using malware or sth is forbidden due to forum rules. If you try to scam using a phishing or malware, you will be banned sooner or later. The best thing you can do is to warn forum members by posting on reputation!Go to next question5th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM14. All altcoin related discussion belong in the Alternate cryptocurrencies and its child boards. [3][4][e]If you want to open a topic about Ethereum or any other altcoin, the Bitcoin discussion board is not the right place Go to next question4th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM9. Discussions in the main boards must be in english. All other language discussions should be posted in the appropriate Local board.It may be a problem for him to trust the person who says he is Satoshi, but this will not be binding on the forum rules. However, it is unacceptable to open a topic in a local language on the main board Go to next question3th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM13. Bumps, \"updates\" are limited to once per 24 hours per thread. Bumping multiple threads at the same time is allowed if it's not annoying. [2][e]7. No begging. [5]29. Sending unsolicited PMs, including but not limited to advertising and flood, is not allowed.Almost all of us have experienced it. We have had messages or topics that we have been thinking about for hours. In fact, when we wake up, we look and there is neither a message nor a merit. However, we are not the decision maker here. Let me give an example, you may not want to send a message or merit to a topic that someone else has worked on, this is your decision. Likewise, it is the decision of the members to send a reply or merit to your messages and topics. Therefore, if you want to update the topic again in accordance with the forum rules, you should wait at least 24 hours, you should not abuse members via private messages and you should not beg by doing actions such as demagogy.Go to next question2th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM33. Posting plagiarized content is not allowed.[e]So our trick question is here  If you look carefully, there is a space in a second paragraph. If you press and hold there you will see \"Source: Link\" the message is hidden. That means this user copy and paste this text from somewhere. The problem is he claimed at the beginning this is his research. However nowadays, many web sites add information with the name of the site in the copying action with some plugins in order to prevent plagiarism. This member didn't notice this, so how did you miss it Go to next question1th QUESTIONQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM1. No zero or low value, pointless or uninteresting posts or threads. [1][e]2. No off-topic posts.3. No trolling.Clearly worthless, off-topic and trolling posts are forbidden in the forum rules. However in some situation, messages such as +1 or -1 may be meaningful, but in this message clearly they aren't.Go to next questionSPECIAL THANKSI would like to thank our admins and moderators who have been keeping this forum organized for years. Secondly, a special thank you to our Global moderator @mprep for bringing these rules together.
