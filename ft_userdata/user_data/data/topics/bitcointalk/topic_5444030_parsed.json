  "content": "Report: https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-money-laundering-rules-apply-crypto-trade-govt-notification-2023-03-08/Legal explanation by tech lawyer Jaideep Reddy...QuoteCrypto & NFT businesses are now 'reporting entities' under India’s Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA). Contrary to some Whatsapp chatter, this does not mean that they are charged under the PMLA for any offence! The implication is that such businesses need to follow similar reporting standards and KYC/AML norms to other reporting entities like banks, securities intermediaries, payment system operators, etc. In other words, KYC norms are no longer a best practice but a legal obligation.Also, such businesses now have the legal status to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).Happy to say we had made this recommendation as far back as Dec 2018, and the notification has come exactly under the suggested provision.An AML regime is the first step towards effective regulation of intermediaries. It would have been ideal though to have an explicit transitory provision so that covered entities had more time and certainly while getting their compliance processes in place.Source: https://twitter.com/jrtechlaw/status/1633338812242731009",

I am not from India, but it is possible that the use of decentralized exchanges or P2P applications to swap crypto/crypto or crypto/fiat might become illegal in India. Since, Bisq is open source and P2P, as far as I know it would not make sense it can comply with the AML rules imposed by the Indian government. Still, I would like to know the opinion of anyone living in India about the implication of this official Notification.",

      "body": "This is a strange thing because they don't seem to understand the range of the Internet.The way I understand they want a business that allows for trading, exchange, etc. to report such activities and follow AML laws so they have to ask you for your ID and hold that in case the government want to see who traded what. The business is responsible for that, not the individual.So if an individual uses a business that isn't registered in India and doesn't report to Indian authorities, what happens? Are they going to start blocking IP addresses the way China does? There's no other way to stop people from exchanging cryptocurrencies on platforms they cannot control, the way you can't demand a torrent site to delete files. All you can do is block that sites IP so that people in your country cannot use it, but that's a long and costly fight.",

To me it seems that they do not have a negative effect on users but on legal businesses residing in India.  I would suppose non Indian businesses are not affected by their decision.  If they are, I assume they are going to shut down their activity in India and stop accepting registrations and logins from over there.  Because if I was a Belgian Exchange, I would see it pointless to now start focusing partially on reporting to Indian authorities unless a vast majority of my clients were from there.Just my assumptions however.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "^That's what I think too. What if an Indian individual exchanges crypto for crypto using a business not registered in India? What happens if the same Indian citizen exchanges crypto in the Internet for currencies not legally accepted in India?The Indian government cannot ask an exchange in Japan to send them their AML report for someone who was trading in Japanese Yen, therefore I believe this is only for local businesses, located in India and trading in Rupees. If citizens of India trade crypto and exchanges back and forth between stable coins, I believe they're also out of the country's jurisdiction and outside of their AML laws.",

As long as you're not making any of the four things mentioned on behalf of another person or while you're running your own business this law is not affecting you, the moment you act like a broker or trader and play with user funds over these platforms it's getting complicated, normally you would have to keep track of the payments this way also, with full details of the recipient.Quote from: coolcoinz on March 08, 2023, 08:21:38 PMWhat if an Indian individual exchanges crypto for crypto using a business not registered in India?

If India and Japan have an agreement on mutual assistance over FATF then it's more complicated, without one such request could go unanswered but if a protocol is in place the Japanese branch could determine it's their job to choose to assist the Indian one and the exchange will then be forced to provide all the data for Indian customers, no matter what they are trading on that platform.Besides a lot of exchanges have a LERS system or equivalent in place, designed especially to take requests from government agencies.",

Virtual is used when people especially governments want to build up something really vague around cryptocurrencies. They use this term to prevent their citizens to start off their interest in cryptocurrency as well as actually try to experience and use it.How will government (Ministry of Finance India) know that two people are exchanging their bitcoin or other cryptocurrency at Bisq (no KYC)?I doubt that they will be able to build up technical tools to find those trades.This news is not strange with India that is one of the most fluctuating and chaotic countries in their regulations on cryptocurrencies. Two other nations are China and Russia.",

That could be the case! But it's not clear yet as the gazette notification doesn't explicitly speak about this regime. But brace yourself for such legislation to be put in place. As of now, it should be OK if you are reporting your crypto income in your income tax return and pay 30% tax on it. In that case, you will be saved from future hassles because then you will be able to prove your good intention. What I foresee, is an effective death of crypto market in India. Firstly, the government discouraged crypto to fiat transactions by imposing 30% tax and now its regulation under PMLA act. Probably that's what the government wants!",

If a user on this forum trades with another user through non-custodial wallets, how could the Indian government detect it?
