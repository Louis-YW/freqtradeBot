      "body": "Calculate your potential savings with BucksBus using our new calculator!We've simplified the process for you by creating a calculator that determines your potential savings with BucksBus. Simply input your current (or potential) fee for your crypto payment provider service, the number of transactions, and the average transaction amount, and our calculator will show you how much you could save by switching to BucksBus  For example, let's consider a scenario where you have 10,000 transactions averaging $100 each month ($1M/m). Most crypto payment service providers charge a percentage of your turnover, typically within the range of 0.3% to 3%. Let's assume it's 0.5%. With this fee structure, you would be paying $5,000. In contrast, our solution offers the same service for just $250. That's a 95% optimization in your costs!Visit bucksbus.com now to calculate your potential savings and see how BucksBus can help you maximize your profits!",

You said you made 2 deposits, but then there are some 109 payments. From where does number come from? I have checked out the screenshot and it doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's a bug?OP was online today after your post, have you received any response via PM? Please keep us updated on the issue. It's very important feedback for potential future customers.",
