That is the meaning that Accardo told you, that it could take much longer time before this present bear market is over, but no matter what Elon Musk said, bitcoin does not depend on any one speech or tweet, the bear market may be over soon, it may take longer. Do not let anyone discourage you to invest at low price like this.",

People like him just wish to be relevant or maybe have something to tweet but it does not affect the market. If you are thinking on investing into bitcoin do not be discouraged because the market cannot be predicted. Do not let speculations drive you away from this great opportunity",

Nothing new though, in 2018 we have this kind of sentiments as well, very negative the price of bitcoin started to decline March and onwards. And then we have the Covid-19 scare in 2020, hitting all time low that time around $3k.So if we have seen it before, then I would say that we shouldn't be scared or surprised because it will be a long bear market, January to December of 2023, and then early part of 2024, prior to the halving. So around 16 months of this bearish sentiments. So it's just a question on how newbies are going to cope with that kind of crypto winter as this is their first obviously. For battle tested investor, could be another hump but they know how to get over.",

If Elon Musk says about BTC will succeed in the long winter, it's because he himself already knows that BTC has been successful since ten years ago where when there is a decline, there will always be a bigger increase even though it takes a little longer patience.So this thing is actually quite simple to understand, because he (Elon Musk) just said about BTC will succeed at a certain time which may be through a bigger price increase, but what needs to be understood is, BTC has been successful for a long time.",

Elon Musk is just speculating. Nobody can predict when this Winter would end, it might even end tomorrow. Bitcoin has always proved so many skeptics wrong because this coin is unpredictable.Everyone has freedom of expression, and Elon is using his rights. For me the meaning of that tweet was he recognized the indispensability and eternity of Bitcoin but he also predicted that the recovery from this perilous time of Bitcoin would take a long.",

Let's see when would be a next halving day of Bitcoin? We don't know the exact day at the moment but we can estimate it based on Bitcoin block time (in average it is 10 minutes). Halving happens after 210,000 blocks and a next halving would happen in May 2024.https://bitcoinblockhalf.com/Did Elon mean 1 more year and a half is a long winter?",

Last year he used his fame to manipulate the market and gradually people see his intentions, and they no longer trust his tweets. I believe his goal is also profit and I also believe that he is also quietly buying bitcoin at this price, he sees its potential and the profit it will bring, he's like us, here for profit. In this tweet, he is creating trust and hope in the market, I only wish that he would tweet such things more often than shilling some coins.",
