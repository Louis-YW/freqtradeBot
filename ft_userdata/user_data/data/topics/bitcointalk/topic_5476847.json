  "content": "In our eyes, the foundation of this bull market will be built on the prosperity of the BTC ecosystem. From this point on, the current representative is the inscription. We believe that ORDI represents the most primitive spirit of blockchain: freedom, fairness, and not being controlled by powerful conglomerates. Anyone can post their own inscription on BTC, driven by the community. Institutions can no longer obtain a large amount of tokens from the beginning and manipulate the market. This increases the cost of the institution and lowers the participation threshold for ordinary people.Yesterday, the core developer LUKE expressed opposition to the inscription, although he quickly adjusted his attitude. But we can see how intense the controversy is. Surprisingly, this time, the community and miners stood firmly together against LUKE. This represents a desire, as if it were an internal controversy within religion.",

Bitcoin has already been big enough to not be controlled by centralized parties for a good while now. The Inscriptions/Ordinals just gave miners more revenue, that's all.",
