Well, we the residents of the country had to switch to using the P2P on these exchanges. And this is exactly what we did. Initially, it was uncomfortable because we were concerned about the security risks of doing transactions with a stranger but once we knew that the centralized platforms though not perfect had put things in place to reduce scams, we become comfortable with it. I know this story is the same both for us in Nigeria, Algeria, kenya and so many other countries where oppressive regimes against bitcoin still exists.",

These 2 things are completely different.As Oshosondy said, most centralized exchanges are usable from your country. And if you want to ensure your privacy then P2P is the solution but there is also a risk because the seller can reveal your identity and you will be in trouble because as you said, your government bans bitcoin. If you have difficulty finding direct bitcoin buyers and sellers, I think you should use centralized exchanges for more assurance.",

Our forum is the oldest bitcoin forum but it is not the largest nor does it represent any country. Bitcoin has become very popular and spread all over the world, buying bitcoin today has never been difficult, even in countries that ban bitcoin. What makes it difficult for someone to buy bitcoin is their lack of knowledge about bitcoin.

IIRC, they used to have some countries with no mandatory kyc. I could be wrong though lolTBH, if crypto was banned in my place, I don't think I would risk it with centralized exchanges unless it's no-kyc and has end to end encryption for their chats. It depends on one's risk appetite i guess. Some places can be lax when it comes to enforcing their laws though you'd be playing with chances.",

Thank you for reading this.Try checking on how did others manage to buy  Bitcoin in your area, for sure debit and credit cards are not the only way to do so. I am also living in a third world country but we do have access on other ways such as third party wallets that are partnered with exchangers which allows me to invest. As long as there are other people who managed to invest, then for sure things aren't restricted in your area and that there are other ways for you to check regarding this concern. Never settle for p2p on social media platforms. Exchangers are the best way and you just have to figure out what would work in your situation. I assume Bitcoin is banned from your country, but restriction varies I believe. Not supporting this technology is different from fully restricting its usage and the proof to this are some people in your country who have Bitcoin and other crypto holdings.",
