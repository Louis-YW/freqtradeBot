  "content": "I decided to create this topic to raise an awareness and also to thank merit sources. Though not all merit sources, but to a few who are dedicated to ensuring circulation of merits to deserving posts.Firstly, I discovered that some merits sources who also have good amounts of merits earned are denied of merits (maybe unintentionally) by other members of the forum. The unmentioned reasons could be that;They have enough merits, any need of wasting more on them? Someone that generates merits from the vacuum and issue people, should have the power to increase his personal merit count This might sound silly but it's actually the reality. I have seen countless times some merit sources make quality posts in a particular thread and they will go unmerited. Yet, in same thread, you see them issuing merits to posts that are even of lesser quality to theirs. No wonder when I was a newbie. I made a post that I so much believed was of high quality but no one sent even a single merit to it. I decided to merit myself since I got some smerits . But I was disappointed to understand that I could not merit myself. In same vain, can our outstanding merits sources have the supper power to send themselves a few merits every month? (Not actually a proposal, but an idea decorator).There is a thread to report unmerited good posts, I hardly see posts of merit sources reported there. It therefore means that all good posts from merit sources have received cool amounts of merits (irony).Thanks to all dedicated merit sources, needless of mentioning names. I appreciate you all.",

I try to just merit those that are posting quality content, but at the end of the day it does feel nice meriting someone who might actually need them, and its even better seeing a newer user that you've merited in the past, actually get motivated by it, and turn out to be a top quality user. If I was in the predicament which I'd nearly exhausted my conjured merit source, and it was between a merit source with a very good quality post or a newer user with a slightly less quality post, but good quality I'd probably give it to the newer user, because it might encourage them to continue. I can always go back to the merit sources post at a later date, which I typically do revisit a lot of old threads, and replies to merit. I've also seen this behaviour from other sources too.",

I guess it depends on which sub-boards those members are active in. I like being in the technical Bitcoin boards. And in those boards you have maybe 20 regulars you can come across almost every day. We all receive and send merits (merit sources or not), and very often you end up meriting the same people. There are a few reasons for that. They are the ones who know what they are talking about and how to solve technical problems, and low-ranked users are hard to come by in those boards. And those who are there, usually have problems and and ask how to solve them. They aren't the ones doing the solving. So if you are a merit source very active in technical Bitcoin boards, you will often come across quality and merit-worthy posts of other merit sources and high-ranked users. Usually, a high rank and being a merit source goes hand in hand.",

In other ways, it would bridge the no meriting or should I say exchange of merit with alts rule.How would you feel when you praise yourself? If we are to take a look at it for a minute, it makes little sense. Self love, praises and others is some way to encourage yourself but, its always much better when someone tips a hat in your recognition. Like some user @Davidvictorson shared his dairy of quotes for us a while back!Well the truth is, its of no use. Yeah, merit sources might need to get some credits to let them know, they are making impacts but, it often comes in the least expected way for most of them and I'm sure they see no use to it otherwise. Haven't out grown ranking profile on the forum, merits begins go look like the nothing that it is.A grate job they are doing, they get more exposure to the posts of users than every other user due to the burden of dispensing there duties and that's a plus for them too on the knowledge they are exposed to daily. It's never easy but some have been coming through.Quote from: The Pharmacist on June 14, 2022, 06:41:50 AMI've actually written a number of times that people should pass on meriting any of my posts and instead give some merits to lower-ranked members who need them to rank up.  They're useless to me aside from adding to my personal stash of sMerits, but that's unnecessary since I haven't tapped into those in many months.This is the reason why some merit source applications don't go through vey well. As a merit source, the idea is about meriting  quality posts wherever you find them but, its often about low rankers and when you ain't doing much of that as a merit source applicant, it tells what could be the result when you become a merit source. Where we would have low rankers looking to merits to scale the ranks because of an expectancy on sent out merit.Having  a mentality  such as The Pharmacist, of caring very little for merits and even go the length to urge users not to merit his post but instead, redirect the merit to merit deserving posts of low rankers is surely some way to go, a good one at that and we ought to be more like that towards other low rankers.Needless to say, the merits go out and they revive the system with a new each time they do there job. The not caring is a plus for those looking to rank up. Should they care, it would mean trouble for those yet to scale the ranks. Hence, not caring if you get merits as a merit source becomes a quality!",
