I don't think it's possible to achieve a corrupt free society. Putting yourself in a position unreliant on the corrupt systems is a better solution.If you start with the notion that economic systems are inherently corrupt, you would find that Bitcoin relieves dependency of the traditional economic systems ran by the government. Of course that's not fair presumption to make, but seeing as nearly every major currency is a sinking ship, self inflicted no less, it may be a prudent one (perhaps the system is not responsible, but individualsÂ  )",

The challenges on this implementations would be on associating keys to one's identity and actually pushing so these standards become a reality, which is unlikely to happen in the short term, due to obvious reasons.

But it is not going to be useful to eradicate corruption from a nation as no technology can do that. The corruption is built into the minds of the corrupt people and unfortunately these days most democrats are corrupt by nature.However, in some cases if blockchain technology is incorporated into a government system the probability of doing corruption in such nations might be a difficult job for those democrats. Specially if all the activities related to money should be done through blockchain. Incorporation of such system is not possible currently because those corrupt democrats hold complete power over the decisions of a nation.",

      "body": "It is impossible for bitcoin to reduce corruption because corruption is from human mentality and activities. If the government is corrupt,and they know that bitcoin can reduce corruption, it will not be accepted by the government. This is exactly what is happening presently in our society, the government wants to have control over their citizens financial spending and some countries have chose to banned bitcoin because it wouldn't give them such access. Since bitcoin is only an alternative currency,the corrupt and oppressive government wouldn't adopt it because they can live without bitcoin. Bitcoin is only a digital currency used by man but corruption is an habit that has eaten up the bone of man. On the other hand bitcoin can also enhance corruption due to its anonymous feature.",

We all are aware that even in the most transparent societies there are crooks who take advantage of the system. Even if some blockchain technology in your country does not end the corruption but rather reduce it 35% down, I would call that a victory and more encouragement to continue working on that topic.

I'm afraid that as much as you think politicians use Bitcoin to perpetrate their fraud, they do not. Bitcoin uses a public ledger that can be seen by everyone and possibly traced, and they (politicians) also steal quite a lot of money, running into millions/billions which would definitely be difficult for them to convert when they need to (if it's held in Bitcoins). Thus they stick to their old ways of money laundering, which is to use fiat/cash, they can always hide as much cash in their well secured homes, or pull some strings with their local banks or even international banks, who'll be more than ready to accept the money without asking questions, afterall they need it to also fund their own personal trade.",

While some countries ban Bitcoin but accept blockchain technology since it can be used in several sectors of the economy to improve the overall performance of such sectors with highly verifiable and transparency dealings in those sectors that could eliminate corruption.",

How can we take advantages of this fine Blockchain technology to achieve a corrupt-free society?Tehcnically blockchain tech could remove corruption, but when people talk about removing corruption they usually don't understand that it will need surveillance and that applies to everyone, not just the organisations they don't trust. And to use bitcoin blockchain as something as important as you said, it would require bitcoin / fiat pairs keep being legal, so that chain would have enough incentives for people keeping it secure.Meanwhile permissionless and immutable transactions are poison to aml laws so i am not as sure about the future of it as people in here generally are. Thankfully transactions are transparent, otherwise we would have different set of problems in a different level.Quote from: swiftxi on April 30, 2023, 03:00:19 AMBitcoin is already reducing corruption all over the world , providing them with a secure anonymus way of transfering massive chunks of wealth at any time or place. Bitcoin is far from anonymous and how exactly moving \"massive chunks of wealth\" in permissionless way has anything to do with removing corruption?",

This is because bitcoin and its users want privacy and anonymity at least to a considerable extent like how it is now if not entirely anonymous while the government wants transparency and control over the things it governs in order to maintain order and safety (at least that's what they say as an excuse). The perspectives of both sides are just too far apart making them seem like water and oil. Who knows though, maybe in the future both sides would find some common grounds that would make both sides benefit giving equal compromises that are fair and acceptable for everyone. Until then, I don't think both sides cooperating would work out, let alone thinking about Bitcoin reducing corruption in the government. That is, if I'm not 6 feet under yet to witness that future.",
