  "content": "Their are lots of investment platforms where people save and lock up their money, and they feel comfortable with it thinking that is the best place for them to keep their money. An investment account or online banking can get hacked and it will be gone forever,  some people make mistakes by saving all their life earnings in an online bank and investment account. Usain Bolt reportedly missing $12.7 million from investment account in Jamaica, this is his life earnings that has got missing from his investment account.  It would have been better if this money was invested in bitcoin in a safe hardware wallet. Don't trust online banks or any investment platforms, it can be hacked by scamers at anytime. https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/19/sport/usain-bolt-fraud-allegations-jamaica-spt-intl/index.html?utm_source=twCNNi&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2023-01-19T19%3A31%3A04&utm_term=link",

      "body": "so sad, but we are find similar case very often, many people should have understood this potential. scam or even hacked. No matter how good the service provider someone chooses, it is possible that it will turn out to be a scam. In my country there are also a case of people saving for Hajj, in large companies and this companies have won many awards already, but in the end they become scams, and this is not an online provider. If offline ones pose a threat, how about online? Anything related to money, be it offline or online, should always be careful with any financial services. just like in btc, not your keys, not your money. hopefully Bolt still able to get his money back",

That's massive!I don't really get the point why people are investing with that kind amount of money without hesitation. He just left a couple of thousand dollars to his account. I think he will do his best to sue the team behind the said investment stocks.Anyway, I disagree with you OP that much. Yes, we should not trust the online platform about investments. But, how we are going to invest without risking our money in online platforms? The best thing that I could say is that, we have to be vigilant for every single platforms that we are using. And investment is not 100% guaranteed, therefore putting all your eggs in one basket is totally a dam* idea.",

On the other hand when talking about bitcoin/crypto investing, you can simply not trust centralized platforms and do things peer-to-peer — which is heavily recommended all the time here on Bitcointalk.",

I mean, how will you own the public stocks anyway in the first place? There's no such thing as non-custodial public shares. Everything needs to be done on a centralized platform.",

You just silently declared Bolt a dumbass because you don't think he fits the parameters of a financially educated person.But seriously, we cannot be insured against everything. Account Manager is suspected of stealing money from Usain Bolt's account. How can we protect ourselves from such people who directly work for firms? How can firms be insured against such people? Usain trusted this firm for 10 years, and suddenly something went wrong. Let's hope that the culprit is punished and that all the money that was in Bolt's pension fund will be returned.",

I do not think this is about investment platform, I believe Usain Bolt can not be very stupid to go for a kind investment that is not trustworthy enough and that can just go with his money like that. Know that wallet too can be hacked, even an hack can be an offline attack or online. Even 2FA wallet setup on noncustodial wallet can be hacked if not done properly, like by having the 2FA app on your online wallet device. I hope this would be investigated and the criminal would be known. There are many investment platforms that are not legit, it is what we can advice people against, but not related to this.",

I think it's not all the money, it's one of the investment accounts. Usain and others invest in Jamaican Investment Firms to appear credible. Usain and other wealthy Jamaicans are looking for normal financial gain.I hope he gets his money back. Moreover, I read from the article from the OP, he has done many things for Jamaica such as the gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, London 2012 and Rio 2016. He still holds the 100 and 200 meters world record with a time of 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds, both scored at the 2009 world championships in Berlin.",
