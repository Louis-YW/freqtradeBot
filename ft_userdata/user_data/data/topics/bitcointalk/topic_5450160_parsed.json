  "content": "Last week, I have updated my android phone and also all the applications. The current version of electrum on my phone is 4.4.0.0 as I can see through the app details.If I can remember correctly(a bit confused too, am I mixing with electrum desktop?), with previous version, we could see the inputs and outputs of a transaction in our wallet but now, when I tried to check the inputs of a tx and I couldn't find. I have no other options but checking with explorer.",

I'm looking for checking transaction input. Both are different. I think you have misunderstood my post above.Quote from: Charles-Tim on April 25, 2023, 07:54:58 PMYou can always use blockchain explorer with Tor for now.Yeah. But sometimes, it seems too much hassle to be honest. I was checking some of my old txs and trying to figure out the inputs as they were relevant for me but I couldn't. The only way to check is explorer now as I'm not on desktop + the seed key is generated for android only.",

They are also not available in the older version I am using, only the outputs are along with the txid. Could be available on much older versions, but I do not think it was.- Jay -",

Its too buggy and not well developed. Sometimes, even the tx doesn't go through due to their server issues. Its better to leave it rather than trying to fix it.@Little Mouse, you should better download mycelium or bluewallet on your android and import your keys there for better user expirience and much richer interface.",

Its better to leave it rather than trying to fix it.@Little Mouse, you should better download mycelium or bluewallet on your android and import your keys there for better user expirience and much richer interface.I have used the wallet very well and I know about the bug issues, and the main bug issue I have experienced is when you leave the app or go the other app and scroll back to Electrum app, the keyboard will disappear. Update it to 4.4.0, no such error again.About connecting to servers and making transaction, I have not noticed any issue before.Let us check the first five 1 star reviews on playstore to know if the reviews are valid. This are the reviews and let me reply to it:What kind of security? This is having no meaning or not able to explain better what he meant. He or she is against virtual key board? See how wrong this is. Yet Electrum virtual keyboard can generate all the seed phrase words.How is this a scam? Not a scam. It has never happened to me before and best to reinstall the Electrum app and not connect to a single server if you do not know how to change servers.You will know that this person is not having enough knowledge about Electrum wallet.I have never faced this problem since I was using Android 9 and now at 12, unless you scroll to other app or leave electrum and go back to Electrum, the keyboard will disappear, but this has been solved now in 4.4.0.@EdwardardI have been using Bluewallet and I can recommend the wallet, it is better than mobile Electrum because it has coin control and you can also customize the fee. But you can not customize the fee on Mycelium. I do not think Mycelium has coin control too, even not having address freeze? Can you pump the fee on Mycelium? Also can you directly use CPFP? Bluewallet can do all. Electrum can also do all except that it does not have coin control. Let me make it clearer and you can give us anewser to these questions about Mycelium:1. Can you customize (edit) the fee? I have used it before, not possible on Mycelium.2. Can you pump fee using RBF3. Can you pump fee using CPFP?4. Is it having coin control?5. If not having coin control, is it having address freeze? Coin control is better because you use it to control input, and all inputs of an address can be controlled. Bluewallet is great, but I still so much recommend Electrum mobile wallet.About Mycelium, it has bugs too. Go to Mycelium board on this forum to see many bug issues.",

But my post was not at all intended to compare these two wallets, Â but to say that they are both better options against electrum (as both of the wallets can show inputs of the tx, which is the main query of the OP).But still to answer some of your questions, yes we can't customize the fee on mycelium but it has got a wide range of fee options itself i.e. I can choose anywhere from 1sat/vB upto 32sat/vB currently by default, so I don't find any need for a custom fee option. But still custom is useful in some cases.I think we can do CPFP with mycelium too.About coin control, I believe its not possible here.Quote from: Charles-Tim on April 26, 2023, 09:24:08 AMBluewallet is great, but I still so much recommend Electrum mobile wallet.If we do make a public poll, Im sure not many will agree upon this statement! But I do respect your opinion, maybe its good for you.",

In addition, Electrum does not use only one server, and it cannot happen that at some point not all servers function properly, and maybe people who use Electrum should look under the \"Network\" tab and make sure that their settings are set correctly.I've been using the desktop and mobile versions for years and never had the kind of problems you describe.",

Background: recently I was choosing a bitcoin wallet for myself and settled on Trust Jack. He seemed perfect: friend of Binance, rating 4.7, open source. When I began to thoroughly study the information about him, it turned out that he did not have an open source, he was not properly tested. And then I came across an Electrum. His code is really Open, 14k edits on github. Everything is open and clean. But here's the problem: the score on Google Play 3.6. I understand that it may be inconvenient for someone, but this score is too low. I read in the reviews that people complain that their old wallets are reset. But I'm sure the reviews are fake. As reviews in your post. I have a feeling that someone is doing the anti-advertising of the Electrum.Ratimov what do you think?",
