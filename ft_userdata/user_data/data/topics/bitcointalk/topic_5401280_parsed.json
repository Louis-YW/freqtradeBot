  "content": "Catcoin was originally launched by Miaoshi Nekomoto on November 26, 2021. This is a project with a huge community impact, but very little funding. Catcoin was abandoned by Miaoshi shortly after its launch, after which the project authority was transferred to the black hole address.    Catcoin has gone through several stages from its birth to the present  The first stage: The earliest project party abandoned the project in 2021 and discarded its authority. At this time, Catcoin entered pure community autonomy and there is no project party.The second stage: After the dissolution of the project party, people from the original community formed a marketing team, and they began to form a work. All the motivation came from everyone in the community who cooperated. During this period of time, two NFTs were launched to be used as community donation projects. At this time, there were no major hidden dangers in the community, and the marketing wallet reached a maximum of 250,000 US dollars.  The third stage: After this, some problems began to appear in the community one after another. Without a community vote, the marketing wallet was misappropriated by sharkcat, and then it was explained in the voice channel that it was for advertising, but then it was deceived. Then it spent 50,000 U.S. dollars to put Catcoin on the LBANK exchange, and then launched the so-called Asian marketing, looking for a bunch of micro-business cooperation in WeChat, and then the micro-business WeChat circle of friends released Catcoin, etc., but there were no follow-up results. After submitting to CERTIK for audit, the team's actions began to slow down after that. The former head of the Chinese community communicated with the so-called core team that using WeChat as a marketing tool was completely unfeasible, but the response was that they believed that as a team, they knew the market very well, and proudly stated that the Chinese in the group did not understand the market as well as they did, and the proposal was rejected. At this time, the Catcoin community has entered an opaque stage.  The Chinese COMMUNITY ONCE SUGGESTED TO THE \"CORE TEAM\" THAT IF YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE Chinese MARKET, YOU NEED TO IMPROVE THE TOKEN POCKET WALLET AVATAR. The NEWS IS THAT WE ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO YOU, BUT THE MATTER IS OVER IN THE END. The REASON IS THAT THEY THINK THIS AVATAR COSTS 400 U.S. DOLLARS AND IS NOT IN LINE WITH DEVELOPMENT, SO THEY REFUSED.The fourth stage: On the basis of the previous, the so-called core team began to become more and more excessive. At this time, the community autonomy is no longer community autonomy, but a group controlled by the core team. Then the core team suddenly told everyone that they need to release the so-called \"Catcoin V2\" without the community knowing and without voting. This is no longer seeking community opinions, but the community needs to cater to their team. From this time on, this team has been separated from the original intention of community autonomy. There are supporters and opponents of this behavior, but they directly block those who hold objections, making it impossible for opinions to be raised, and in the telegram Everyone was prohibited from speaking, and it slowly created the impression that most of the people in their community were supporters, and all opponents in the group were removed. Before that, the Chinese community had already clashed with this team twice, which led to the Chinese community directly breaking away and reorganizing.The fifth stage: Since Catcoin is a decentralized meme coin, the core team cannot obtain any dividend benefits and operating authority from this coin, so the core team began to unite with the remaining large investors to concentrate the catcoin held at one address, and launched a smashing operation on Catcoin on April 21, 2022. The catcoin held was sold in exchange for BNB to be injected into their new coin pool, and the original address was airdropped with new catcoin. At this time, the nature of the event has changed. At this time, they already belong to another currency, and the sale is complete. After that, they kept promoting to the outside world that they were “cat coins”. At this time, a group of people in the original Chinese community began to resist, because after the previous team had completed the operation like a leech, they also planned to obliterate the old cat coins like their father on social networks, trying to cause panic among the consensus of the old cat coins, and they are still constantly brainwashing in the community to convince them that the so-called V2 is safe and reliable. This (once autonomous) community has completely packaged itself as a project party, intending to consume the people who believe in them in their high-tax contracts.You need to pay attention： 1) The original marketing team is not a project party. They do not have project authority. They are coin holders like you and me. At present, they mainly occupy the right to speak on Telegram groups and Twitter. 2) The so-called \"Catcoin V2\" is a new coin, and it has nothing to do with the old catcoin. The opaque and autocratic management will have the transaction switch of the new coin. They can decide everything in the coins they issue. This is no longer a community autonomous meme, which is contrary to the original intention of Catcoin. 3) The current behavior is like I am the owner of the SHIBV community, and then I start issuing my own currency, and then tell my community that SHIBV2 is the future, and will eliminate people who are aware of this problem.",
