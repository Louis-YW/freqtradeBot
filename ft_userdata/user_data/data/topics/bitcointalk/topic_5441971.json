  "content": "Anything different from bitcoin is a pure gamble, before you start telling your friends and family about how crypto investment can change their lives, let them know that they are in for some pure gambling. We could act like we know what we are doing, based on how we handle research but it's still all a hopeful gamble on the future,  let's not forget that even crypto experts have fell for the bad eggs im the past too. I prefer keeping my mouth shut, rather than ending up looking like a clown when things failed to go my way after talking about how this coin can be 50x and how the other can 100x. Instead of carrying your burden and that of your crypto investment, imagine having to carry the burden of others that invested based on what you tell them to,  without understanding the risks involved. And when things failed to go your way, you will have to worry about how others are feeling about you because they are also in losses. You will end up regretting taking someone along on that uncertain journey. The only way to avoid these is to accept that you are just like everyone else with a specific interest, keep your mouth shut when it comes to crypto investment, and only open up to those that are into crypto just like yourself. I am talking about those that already understand how the market can be highly volatile at times and how even a good project could end up in a bin of waste. No matter how good projects look in this crypto space, the risk is always present.",

Possibly they are using that as a tool to do shilling and gain from it. There are really some cases of gains like that like the last bull run and I could tell that many experience it too but failed to gain due to greediness and expect a lot of return. Al2ays appreciate gain no matter how big it is. Avoid those 1000x gain when you already have 100x.",

At the moment, it's by far the best, and the most promising in terms of increasing your personal wealth, but it's not bulletproof. We're still going to face challenges in the near future, and well into the future, and there's going to be a element of risk that we aren't successful as we'd like to be. I think investing into Bitcoin not expecting some of these challenges is risky in itself, and will likely lead to panic when we do hit these challenges. So, while Altcoins are definitely a lot more risky, Bitcoin isn't invulnerable to issues itself. Since, I've been involved we've had to solve several issues that have popped up, and while none have them have seriously threatened Bitcoin up until now, they have affected people's perception of Bitcoin, and therefore lead to higher, and lower rates of adoption.",

If they get rich, what will I get, maybe nothing. If they fail, they blame on me.I have to mention another risk that they can think you are inviting them to something Ponzi. This risk is smaller nowadays than in 2017 because this industry has grown up more since 2017 and made more noise on media but I won't exclude it.I am ready to give them advice if they knock my doors and ask for it but I'd like never proactively do this first.",

What kind of gambling you are talking about here? Because there’s stablecoin and other large cap crypto like ETH that does not have high volatility compared to typical shitcoin. Everything can turn into gamble even Bitcoin if the user that investing on it didn’t know the risk. Bitcoin has a high volatility too and it can cost a high loss when the user invest on the wrong time like on 65K. Gamble is when a user didn’t know the risk what he is entering.",

According to what I understood from his words, he introduces people to Bitcoin on the grounds that it is a source of wealth and will change their lives, and that its risk is similar to the risk of gambling. This is relatively reasonable, but it is not the whole truth, nor what we can recommend the rest to do. It would have been better to introduce people to Bitcoin, given that it is a good way to achieve payments and facilitate exchanges between individuals, in addition to providing degrees of independence and security that even the largest banks may not be able to fulfill. On this basis, talking about the degrees of danger turns into another direction.",

You basically said it all in these two lines. People are slowly starting to realize that the power of bitcoin is because the guy/group who started it is/was a good person. He/they had great intentions because of the fact that his/their coins haven't moved for over 14 years now.Yes and no. Bitcoin is still risky too. Clearly not in the way it was 8, 10 or more years ago, but still risky, let's be honest. Some accept and embrace that risk, some get scared and end up buying high and selling low. Some don't even understand that if Bitcoin will be an even bigger success than now, it will be even farther than now from what it was 10 years ago (as privacy - KYC, as hacks, as technology - see LN for example). Plus the war and a (bad ass) blizzard can still drop the hash rate significantly in 2023!So bitcoin is still fair to be seen as a risky investment. Riskier than some others (like buying a house and renting it out, for example). Better than some others (imho bitcoin is less risky than many stocks!).Altcoins, omg, yes, much, much riskier. But pure gamble? No, I wouldn't call them that. I would call 95%+ of them scam, simply because their sole use is to get money flowing for no good reason. Then there are the actual altcoins that may worth attention. Now and then they have good gains even vs bitcoin. Now and then they fall badly. A skilled trader or even investor can earn nicely. Some are strong projects that even worth more support. But gamble? A beginner, probably he can see them as a gamble and they will most probably lose in that. For somebody with enough experience it can be.. just a higher level of risk.So if one wants to go that route.. it needs years of research before the first move is made. Clearly at that point one is no longer beginner. Before that... yes, avoid.",
