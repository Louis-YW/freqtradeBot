      "body": "Pay 2 and get 4 is definitely a scam. This is not even just pay 2 and get 4 if the victims should pay 1 BNB in order to receive 20000 USDT from the scammers. That is $20000.If 1 BNB is worth $280, that would be pay 2 and get 71 or so. Is that realistic? Definitely anyone that falls for this scam is very greedy and also not having any experience about scam.People should know that no money is coming from anywhere, everything like this in the past are all scam. Legit business profit is usually very small.",

But yeah, nothing new about this scam attempt.Quote from: Pandu Geddon on September 15, 2022, 01:23:26 PMno one else should be fooled by this kind of scam. I doubt it managed to get a victim. if indeed there is a transaction made, I believe it is part of the fraudster's own efforts to convince. we've seen too many scams like that. no one should fall into the hole.There are loads of newbies who think that crypto is some sort of magic money so for them this offer seems plausible and that's the scammers target audience. And there is no lack of those..",
