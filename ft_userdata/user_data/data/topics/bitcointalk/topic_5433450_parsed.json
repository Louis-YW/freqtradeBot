Strategy is like a plan you've prepared and you're going to use in gambling while luck is something like a force or event that we don't know when will it come and if it's good or bad. You can't control luck while strategy can. They are both important but plays a different role.",

Nevertheless gambling is still based on luck, perhaps we just want to find ways to explain our losing and winning and we blame it all on some belief, specially some higher UP that might change the course of the game in our favor. And so if you feel that you are unlucky then you should stop so that their will be no more bleeding and play the next day and test again.",

You'll never know if you're lucky if you don't play. So either way you'll be playing at some point, though I won't call it a strategy as there's no strategy in luck but rather testing the waters. A good strategy is stop playing after you have a profit, take a break and enjoy your winning. Then play again the other day as playing again at the same day would definitely increase your risk in losing. After all, the longer you play the higher the risk you'll be losing.",

      "body": "The problem is, you don't know when the wind is going to favor your side. For example, the winning spin (in slots) can be on the 1st, 10th, or 1,000th spin. If after 100 spins you accumulated loss and then quit, it may or may not be a good decision depending on the future result. It could be that you'll get a max-win on the next 100 spins that will make a lot of profit. A similar thing also happens in dice when you search for a high multiplier, low winning chance bet. Moreover, the feeling of \"it's my lucky day\" sometimes is not accurate and it will turn into \"a bad day\" if you continue to play with this martingale strategy.If you like martingale, however, I think reverse martingale or paroli is more suitable if you want to bet on your good streak.",

Well i guess you can't actually stop anyone from believing what he or she wants to believe especially when they say its works for them.",

Not more, not less. There’s a 2 definition of luck. First the force being described by the OP and the other one was favoring chance. I will skip to the first description and move on to the 2nd description since its what matter here.The gambling we are talking here is a dice game so having a constant profit using calculated bets base on probability is impossible to maintain in the long run and that’s when the luck(favoring chance) needed to win. Favoring chance means you made a positive outcome to improbable scenario. Like hitting a win with huge multiplier and so on. On game that is purely relying on chances to winning. I do believe that luck really exist if you want to win more often. It just happened that most of the gambler didn’t know when to stop while luck is not always in our side since it’s pure random.",

If there was a way to know this, it will help a lot and be a good strategy to use as it will save you a lot of money and make gambling a dependable source of income. As you are lucky sometimes, you should know that it is to the disadvantage of the casinos and gambling places as they lose to you. On days where you lose, the casino or the gambling place are the lucky ones that day. Luck cannot be with you every moment; it has to be shared.",

What makes a player a good player, is the way he deals with losses and winnings, and the way he applies different strategies and techniques to tackle luck the most he can. Basically, in order to have a professional approach to gambling, you should always try to isolate luck the most you can and only allow yourself to gamble when there is enough statistical data to guide you to a good decision. Of course that some games are almost only based on luck, so these are the ones an experienced gambler should avoid. At least, this is how I see things. We can translate everything into an equation, and when you cannot turn a moment in the game into an equation, it's a red flag and a sign that you should drop off.",

I often use it when I play in-house roulette ( A type of roulette which only has 3 choices to bet at). This strategy can allow you to get out from a huge down due to continuous loss, sometimes even take some profit. But this is really risky as all of your \"investments\" and at least x2 betting could all go to waste if the luck is out of your hand at that moment. We know that we can lose sometimes even 20 rounds in a row. That's the risk of Martingale.",
