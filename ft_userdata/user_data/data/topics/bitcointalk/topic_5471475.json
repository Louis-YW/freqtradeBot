After all, we can check on any explorer that either he has those BTC or not. I found this address on his profile:1DzKYgC3r3cgCujJPmnA8kQWYkHHKZFNVkIf it belongs to him then the amount is around 100.5 btc which does not say he has around 7,000 btc. But all I am saying here is, you might be true (op) that he is just framing the story more and more to get some fame. If that USB stick really has that much BTC in it then why he is not accepting the offer from a company, is that the price they might be demanding in exchange? If that's the case, I would say, something is better then nothing. It will take some time to check the sending and receiving history of the above wallet address (if done manually) to know that either he is telling true or not. This story is not weird then this one:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471367.msg63042638#msg63042638 (overview is some guy, was able to buy btc at the lowest price and then tagged as hacker from mt gox)",

He's not asking for help from us, right. What is most disturbing about this story? The fact that Stefan Thomas is in no hurry to “remove” this 7,000 bitcoins from the USB stick, refuses services to restore access to his wallet, behaves as if it is not 7,000 BTC, but $100? I wouldn’t rush either if I were him, when there are only 2 attempts left to enter the password correctly. I would also refuse recovery services because those guys will want to get their commissions, probably percentages, from the contents of the wallet. Even 10% would be 700 BTC, which would be a lot of money. When the stakes are so high, there is no need to rush and everything must be done deliberately and carefully thought out. Stefan Thomas probably has alternative sources of money or savings, so he can afford to wait until he is sure that access to the flash drive will be 100% guaranteed. Actually, he does everything right.",

Or is the IronKey USB more secure than that?IronKey User GuideWith this guide, you can know how IronKey works better. Honestly I have never used it and the guide helps me to understand its operation.QuoteCore FeaturesSelf-Destruct SequenceIf the IronKey Cryptochip detects any physical tampering by a hacker, it will self-destruct. Similarly, after too many consecutive invalid password attempts your IronKey will self-destruct using flash-trash technologyQuoteWhen you plug your IronKey in, the “Unlock Your IronKey” window appears.If this screen does not appear, you can start it manually by double-clicking the IronKey Unlocker drive in “My Computer” and double-clicking the “IronKey.exe” file.Entering your password correctly will mount your secure volume with all your secure applications and files.Entering the wrong password too many times will permanently erase all of your data. After every three attempts, you must unplug and reinsert the IronKey.NOTE: Some operations require that your IronKey connect to the Internet before unlocking. If it cannot connect, click “Edit Proxy Settings” to configure how your IronKey connects to the Internet.",

The second one though, I need to see a proof of his lavish lifestyle just his net worth, because even if you're a rich person I am pretty sure that you're still going to worry about that money not being on your hands and there's already an offer from someone that can open it for you. I feel like the reason that he didn't accept it is probably because the price that was quoted on him was something that he's not willing to pay.Quote from: adaseb on October 24, 2023, 03:00:57 PMCan’t you just clone it and just keep trying over and over again with the 2 tries and eventually you would get in.

For loosing access to his own password needed to unlock the iron key USB drive2. For not creating a backup for the password used knowing the weight of the amount of bitcoin worth in it.We cannot blame his friends experts he consulted, if hey try their best and couldn't unlocked it or if they did successful but pretends not to have done so, the organization in charge, how do they know, did he reported there, was it his friends or they got a signal on several attempts, they can decide to lock the wallet, but how sure are we that the privacy of the contents in that USB is secured without the organization I.T experts spying, i think the best is for the guy to approach the company and rectify the whole issue if possible without having to tell them the worth of what was inside.",

I got it, the data in the USB will be removed but our assets are saved in the recovery phrase which is laid on the BTC blockchain. So how the BTC saved on that seed phrase will be removed or destroyed. Or I am taking things wrong here. Overall, that's so bad. Another interesting thing is, if he uses a stick to hold his btc amount an even accepted a extra security level of 10 attempts of wrong code.He still chose the same wallet, which can be opened by a company you have talked above. If that company can really open his wallet then why he don't wants it to be opened. I think he just want to avoid his urges or we can say wants to press the urges that will encourage him to make huge payments if he get hold onto those btc. Maybe the amount if so big for him that he thinks he cannot control his emotions and might waste them.But by avoiding the opening of it, he can preserve them for longer period of time.",

I'm sure I would've lost my coins too one way or the other and that would be with so much pain, seeing what a treasure Bitcoin is now. Just imagine someone having close to $240 million in Bitcoin but can't assess it. This is going to be worth more in coming days.

If he had those kind of doubts about getting some help or even have that fear of stolen coins once they have accessed then i couldnt really blame him but instead he would really be planning in going it solo.",
