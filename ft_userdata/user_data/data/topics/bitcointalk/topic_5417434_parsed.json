Try checking each of them out and do some backtesting to see which one is more effective for your trading strategy",

      "body": "As institutions have big capital, their main priorities are volume and they will find projects with high trading volume. That will help them to get in and get out without so much delays and issues of price impact by their big capital.Volume is important to consider a pump is an actual growth or just a pump and dump game. Volume is critical to consider where small investors shake their hands and capitulate. Testing volume is one of last test from institutions and whales to see whether they can start to manipulate the market easily. If they test and find that they are biggest controllers in the market, they will kick off their manipulating game.",

Trying to follow what they do will only land you into consistent loses because they are huge traders with inestimable capital and you can't just follow them. Do your trade learning and know the indicators that can very well be fine for what you are looking for. For divergent indicators, I hear MACD works for it but I don't use it. You can implore MA and RSI on long hours.",

There are many divergences now but who knows if this is the actual low.They have very long term vision and you are right, they invest in years like Microstrategy, a true institutional investor. With this investment style, they look more on fundamentals of Bitcoin and do dollar cost averaging like Microstrategy.They look at one of most important fundamentals of Bitcoin, its controlled supply. They know in next 3 halvings including a 2024 halving, Bitcoin will have only about 1% of total supply left till 2140 for miners to get from block rewards. If they have money, they will continue to DCA.Maybe they will use technical indicators to make news and manipulate the market.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply",
