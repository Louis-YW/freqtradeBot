I want to hear an explanation from all of you?...Look DCA as a strategy should be used only in assets which you know are the very best, on this market only bitcoin and ethereum qualify for a DCA strategy to be used, if you want to invest in Shiba Inu then do it but you should wait and do so once the bull market has already appeared as that is the moment when investors are putting their money in all kind of exotic investments, investing in Shiba right now probably means holding those coins for months or even longer and this is never a good idea when it comes to a meme coin as you never know when they can be replaced by yet another meme coin.",

I want to hear an explanation from all of you?...You don't say that, everyone who's buying the coin that they like will say that it has got a better future. But we don't know such about this meme coin. Yeah, the price has pumped a lot and people made a decent gain from it. And shiba is still top of the rank and that's why many don't stop from buying it.What we can say about its future is we don't know, utility wise, I don't see that and it's more just for a trading asset for which many think that it's going to have a higher price such as $1 which I doubt.",

I mean, if you see some sudden price spike, then consider selling it and decide later on when the price will go down if you want to buy again. the advantage here is, you already got some decent earnings no matter how will be the situation of this coin in the future and you can do your own research as well to further support them or stop when you already managed to get some wins from your investment.",

I want to hear an explanation from all of you?...Every coin has the potential that can give us a profit in the future. And about these meme coins, I could say that maybe in the future, their price value may increase when the price value of Bitcoin begins to increase when the bull run comes in I guess. However, recently, I saw a lot of content on the youtube that Shiba Inu will start to kick its price in the market, but I doubted it, due to as long as no huge burnings are happening to SHIB  it won't rise its price value, believe me, or not. Though, I can't deny I have some of these coins in my wallet.",

Yes whales love volatility and I think shib has really does have volume but the utility and hype of this coin is just based on being a meme so not surr what the future would hold for this. Maybe some thinks this will follow on big names like doge but for me pick another useful platform.",

You did a reckless act according to me.Regardless of whether they are in very good order on cmc doesn't change the fact that they are one of those meme coins which I don't think are very useful.Instead of DCA in something as obscure as this you better try to be in another coin that is obvious like bitcoin or maybe some alt like BNB or Ethereum instead of letting your money burn in shitcoin like this.",

Pretty crazy considering we had these big corrections and SHIB is still not 0.I don't trust Shiba at all. After it made the biggest wave in the crypto market. Although I was unlucky and the coin crashed on me. I don't trust Shiba for a long term project and that kind of coin is not what one should DCA on. You only DCA on highly trusted coins like bitcoin. Secondly, I trust and will recommend dodge to anyone than Shiba. Even at both are meme coins, dodge has a better chance of lasting longer than Shiba is the market.",

All the crypto games are not even on first pages of that top. The position of this top can easily be changed and influenced. With enough funding, even a total scam altcoin, with help of pump and dump, can get to a higher positions. Also, take a look on coingecko.com top. Shiba Inu is on 15th place, while it is on 13th on cmc. The position is relative. You might find different cryptocurrency price aggregator, and Shiba Inu will be on a different position there.",

I want to hear an explanation from all of you?...In my personal opinion, you should look for an other project to invest in. In the end Shiba Inu is just another stupid meme-coin that is not really serving any purpose. Shiba Inu was created 2 years ago or so when Elon Musk started to make tweets about Dogecoin. That is the only purpose of Shiba Inu. I mean it is a fact, that Shiba Inu made a lot of very early investors very reach, because it literally made them a x1000 or so on their initial investment, but since then it slowly but surely loses relevance. I just dislike Meme-coins because they are obviously just a try of the \"teams\" behind it to make some quick and easy money without any effort. I think that meme-coins are hurting the crypto market as a whole.",

But it turns out that it's true that in the past few weeks, Shiba Coin seems to be starting to show signs of a pretty good increase. and I again asked my friend. and he just told me to find out for myself and analyze it myself. he gave me the keyword \"Shibarium\". I haven't looked into it yet. maybe someone here knows about Shibarium? really that's one of the reasons the shiba coin is moving quite positively. and it seems that Shiba holders are increasing rapidly.",

The correct thing should be this meme token called shiba inu has been placed around 13th at cmc. it's caused by solana and polygon were going up surpassing shiba inu.
