Bitcoin has a very unique following of its own. The community has really devoted itself to investing and spreading awareness about bitcoin. Much like how would fans do in this category. If it were up to votes, I am sure bitcoin will win. Not just because of the celebrities but because of our community as a whole.",

      "body": "Haha, you’re absolutely right! If Bitcoin were vying for an Oscar, it might not snag \"Most Dramatic Currency\"—though it does give a stellar performance in that category. Wink. But if there were a \"Fan Favorite Award,\" Bitcoin would definitely take home the trophy, no contest.The Bitcoin community is like a dedicated fan base of a cult classic movie. They’re the ones camping out for premiere tickets, organizing fan conventions, and wearing Bitcoin merch with pride. Celebrities like Elon Musk may provide the occasional star power boost, but it's the community that keeps the Bitcoin buzz alive day in and day out.Think of it this way: Elon Musk might be the blockbuster actor that draws in the crowds, but the Bitcoin community is the devoted fandom that votes in every poll, shares every trailer, and keeps the conversation going long after the credits roll. They’re the ones who’ve turned Bitcoin from a niche curiosity into a global phenomenon. If the cryptocurrency awards were decided by votes, Bitcoin would definitely win, thanks to its passionate and relentless supporters.",

What are the chances the OP is someone that is not interested in the topics and posts unless they are used to help his account rank and post count? I have seen far too many accounts behave in a similar manner and hardly any changed their ways. Maybe the OP will surprise us.As for the topic, does it deserve a valid response when the question itself was not valid?Quote from: Smartvirus on June 14, 2024, 06:17:08 PMI was just in your earlier thread created just about 20minutes before this one, wasn’t done in making a response and then boom, your up with yet another similar thread, still Bitcoin, still focused on the US but trying to get a different aim of it which, doesn’t make a major distinction.I might be off course but, I would say it doesn’t portray you like one whom is interested in the thread you create.

Eversince, bitcoin has been the hot topic that continue to create a tension between bitcoin itself and the government, the reason why we are seeing a lot of instances that the government is against with bitcoin in general. But I don’t think that would matter a lot for a decentralized currency like bitcoin, except for its worldwide legalization wherein every country’s government has certainly a big role.",

      "body": "Bitcoin’s relationship with the government is a classic tale of tension—like a rebellious teenager clashing with strict parents. The government worries about control and regulation, while Bitcoin insists on its freedom and decentralized nature. It’s a tug-of-war that’s as old as time but with way more cryptographic algorithms.In the grand scheme of things, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means it can brush off a lot of the governmental grumbling. However, when it comes to worldwide legalization, governments do hold some important cards. It’s like needing a passport to travel; without the right stamps, Bitcoin’s journey to global acceptance gets a lot bumpier.",

Which brings me to say that it’s not only tech giants that are becoming more interested in bitcoin. Musicians such as Iggy Azalea have been involved in crypto now. I am sure many celebrities have secretly invested in bitcoin but to promote it would be a whole another thing.",

      "body": "You make a great point! Elon Musk may not be competing for an Oscar anytime soon—unless they introduce a category for \"Most Dramatic Tweets\" or \"Best Pump-and-Dump Performance.\" But you’re right, the world of Bitcoin extends far beyond tech giants. It’s becoming a playground for celebrities from all walks of life, including musicians like Iggy Azalea.It’s kind of like Bitcoin is throwing the biggest, wildest party in town, and everyone wants to be on the guest list. We’ve got tech moguls, musicians, and probably a few secret celebrity investors all mingling together. Imagine Iggy Azalea dropping some crypto beats while Elon Musk showcases his latest meme-coin creation—it’s a financial festival!",
