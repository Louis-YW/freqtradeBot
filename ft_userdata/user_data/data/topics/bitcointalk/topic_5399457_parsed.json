It's a whole new ballpark we are playing in and with that in mind, this just might be possible to achive.",

If you've survived this long, you've either already gotten the disease and built up natural immunity or have been able to successfully isolate yourself from human civilization to such a degree that Sars-COV-2 has physically not contacted you. Most likely the former. There's no incentive to receiving a COVID vaccine if you already gotten COVID. None.And by the way, the vaccine will not prevent you from getting COVID. The may help for a severe infection. Vaccines were all designed for the alpha variant. And to my knowledge there aren't any approved omicron vaccines on the market.",

The site that relates that Harvard School of Medicine shows that this is only less than 1% of the actual Covid deaths.Then consider that even if the deaths were limited to only what the CDC is willing to admit, that any other time in history, and for any other product or item, the big push would have stopped long ago, and the item taken off the market because of how dangerous it was. This shows us that Government, the medical, and loads of other wealthy people are trying to reduce the population, and are using fake vaxx tactics to accomplish their agenda.Plain and simple, mass murder genocide of people around the world.The Covid-19 Vaccination Massacre Quote from: https://www.lewrockwell.com/2022/05/dr-igor-shepherd/the-covid-19-vaccination-massacre/At that time, in November, 2020, right before the Covid-19 vaccines were dispensed onto the public, I spoke out and forewarned that the mRNA technology within the vaccines made them bioweapons, and that millions would be harmed and die if they took the injections. Time has proven me right.By September of 2021, my warnings were substantiated. VAERS data from CDC, which reports American vaccine injuries, provided a clear clue that the vaccines were weapons of mass destruction—742,349 vaccine takers suffered adverse reactions (including death) comprising of heart failure, blood clots, strokes, brain illnesses, inflamed spinal cords, seizures, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, arthritis, miscarriage, infertility, deafness, blindness, muscle weakness and loss, and sleep disorders. By April, 2022, VAERS showed a combined total of 1,247,131 injuries and deaths. And because only 1% of injuries from Covid vaccines are reported, it is reasonable to expect that actual deaths and injuries can be up to five times higher. No other type of vaccine over the last 30 years has ever caused this much impairment in such a short time.And though over 1000 scientific studies prove that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are extremely dangerous (including Pfizer's own data), and UK's government data reveals the Covid vaccines kill more people than they save, public health departments, hospitals, healthcare organizations and most doctors continue to endanger public health and dispense the lethal jabs. These co-conspirators of mass murder have become like ventriloquist dummies, only speaking when their masters pull open their mouths—allowing the crimes against humanity to mount....",

The report included a chart titled “Number of Deaths within 28 Days of COVID-19 Vaccination in England.”The total fatalities were broken down to 7,953 people who died positive for the virus and 61,513 people who expired due to other causes within 28 days of vaccination. During the same timeframe, a total of 14,049 people died from coronavirus and a total of 164,825 people died from other causes within 60 days of vaccination.The data was released following dozens of Freedom of Information inquiries made to various government institutions requesting to know the number of people who died after receiving the jabs. (Related: CDC hides COVID data from the public in order to whitewash dishonest COVID narrative.)Moreover, the U.K. Health Security Agency‘s vaccine surveillance report indicated that 92 percent of all the pandemic-related deaths in England in March were among the vaccinated population.Dr. Norman Fenton, Risk Information Management professor at Queen Mary University of London, criticized the governments around the world for manipulating the COVID-19 pandemic data when he guested on “The Defender Podcast.”“It was clear from the start that most of the data that governments put out ­– not just the UK government, but most governments around the world ­– were kind of misleading because it was based on very easily manipulated statistics,” Fenton told the host Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.Brighteon.TVThroughout the pandemic, Fenton closely examined and criticized how officials used data to make decisions about lockdowns, testing and vaccines....",
