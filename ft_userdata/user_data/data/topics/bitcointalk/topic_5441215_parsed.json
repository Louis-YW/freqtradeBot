Being a high risk alone is already enough to become skeptical on any thing especially on investment. Also statistically wise, Almost the majority of altcoin is useless or turn into scam and only few has real use case that can generate profit for project sustainability.It’s not bad to invest in altcoin if you knew what you are entering. I believe the reason behind why most people suggest to invest only on Bitcoin here is because this is Bitcointalk and people preferred Bitcoin due to its feature.",

Especially in this forum, a lot of people, or a majority of people, are more into BTC here rather than altcoins; that's why you have seen that fewer people want to invest in different types of projects.",

It's because regardless of the number of altcoins out there in the market, the really good/proper projects are in the absolute minority. Even in rare instances of altcoins doing well, they end up dying later on and not really progressing much. There are also a LOT of questions around it since there are a LOT of coins out there that come and go quickly. Naturally people new to the scene would probably ask around, though in the end most of the recommendations they get just end them up to investing in the top 100 altcoins or so.",

You can't blame people the majority of investors lose money on altcoins that they think are good and with potential they don't want to repeat the same mistake, so they validate their opinions about coins/tokens that they want to invest, I sometimes do it, ask my fellow investors if my analysis and feelings are correct.QuoteIs there any other reason for this other that the high risk and high volatility of altcoins compared to bitcoin?

Finding or analysing altcoins is like separating the wheat from the chaff. One also requires distinguishing between a project who is short-lived and another one that has the potency to grow. There isn't any special skill required to play around within the altcoin market, although skin in the game helps. In the basic senses, common sense plays a lot. For example, the current hype is AI. We know that there are many companies that achieve significant progress without the necessity or prerequisite need of a blockchain or token or coin, so, when there is a crypto that intersects with AI, we know that the project is very likely a shady one.",

You see that bitcoin rises by 5%, but some alternative currencies by 30%, so you are tempted to invest and buy more bitcoin for free.On the other hand, developers of altcoins print these coins in hopes of buying bitcoin or converting it into cash.Therefore, the feeling of greed is temporary, and you need people to tell you that you are right and that you will make quick investments.",

Newly launched altcoins should be observed for a period of at least two years to make the decision of investing. In most cases they will flop before this period.It is correct to be skeptical about these projects because their products are often non-existant and they lack marketing making capability. With sudden changes in management and silence about development, investors have all the right to be judgemental.",

As you have said, high risk, high rewards, and it's more of a gambling so people are willing to take that risk in some obscure projects. And others love that, the uncertainty, but for us who have been in the market already, seen one full cycle, it's enough to say that we don't like that kind of volatility and risk.But don't get me wrong, or at least those who live this strategy, that's your money and you can invest it to projects that you believed will give you x100 or higher if that is your target. But personally, I would rather stick to more reliable and solid projects.",

If yes, then the answer is yes, people who choose to invest in altcoins because mainly altcoins have a pretty good price increase potential (because usually the MC in altcoins is far from the Bitcoin MC itself).Quote from: Ojima-ojo on February 25, 2023, 01:15:38 PMAre they asking because they know there are special skills in altcoin analyses or some people are good at picking g g the right coin to invest in?

No special skills but are the same as the traders who can read the charts for every coin they choose. What's risky in altcoin is that they're highly volatile and yes, more volatile with bitcoin because the uncertainty there is higher because many of them are just being launched and don't have enough history to be considered.

It means, most of them are not trustworthy.This is the reason why most investors go back to top 5 coins or only to btc.
