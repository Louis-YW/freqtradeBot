      "body": "No one knows if Bitcoin will immediately increase after the halving or not but imho I think it won't experience a huge increase. Instead, it's likely to remain stable for about a year after the halving, after which we may see a new peak in the Bitcoin price. I've observed this pattern in Bitcoin's historical movements following the 2020 and 2018 halvings. Bitcoin typically takes its time to experience a huge price increases after each halving, so it's unlikely to have a major impact on the price on the actual halving date.",

And after the halving bitcoin price will go up so if anyone is ready to invest in bitcoin, this is the best time to do that so that after the halving and when it enter the bull period, then person will also enjoy on bull time. Though nobody knows the exact price of the bull price after the halving so we all are on the speculation. Many people in the forum still do not understand the concept of bitcoin halving and that is why I made small explanation in the first sentence and also The Cryptovator also made a little explanation on it. And those who have been in the bitcoin industry understand having great expectation from the next bull which will be All Time High.",

Expectation of lower supply and likely price increase may fuel positive feelings amongst investors and traders.Bitcoin halving will always have an impact on the increase in bitcoin price since the amount of freshly generated bitcoin mined by miners will be divided by half, resulting in an increase in bitcoin price. Some months before the halving period, as well as now, there is FOMO throughout the entire crypto ecosystem, with the mentality of purchasing now and selling at halving or after halving due to the probability of an increase in bitcoin price due to the reduction in miners' reward.",

But we don't know if it really happens as expected if there is too much FUDs (bad news) during the halving period. I only think the same scenario like previous halving can repeat if we have many positive news during the halving. Positive news should increase the demands among investors, then the hype will be easy to happen as expected. But if the bad issue like SEC accusation to crypto projects continues, I am a bit doubtful about what's happening after halving. The bullrun season may still happen, but it may not be as huge as expected.",

We've got proof already that it's happening every cycle that the block reward cutting in half really impacts the price of Bitcoin.That makes the cost of mining more expensive with lesser rewards which also makes the supply being produced to the circulation lesser.Everyone who had experienced halvings will approve and say that it really does increase the price every time when it's done.",

Bitcoin fell quite deeply from the last ATH price and this could be the best opportunity to buy before Halving occurs.As some members here said, the Halving is Hype and FOMO that will emphasize the market with many new investors and old investors starting to enter.

Previously it was like x100 gains or x20 gains, now it will probably be x5 or x3.

Actually both market crash and pump won’t happen in a single snap. There could be long candles but to continuously increase? Not possible. The market price of Bitcoin is expected to increase after the halving but the question to many is when will pumps take place? If we would look on the charts of previous halvings, it would seem that the increase takes place during the halving but if you would look further, a year after the halving is most of the time, days wherein huge price increase takes place. I’m not saying that this is absolute but this is just what we could infer from the previous charts. Given that there’s no assurance and no stability with things in this industry we should manage our expectations and actions as well to be safe from regrets.",

However, as of now, there is no assurance that it constitutes an established cycle or if it's merely a phenomenon that occurs during select halvings. As long as you maintain your belief that an All-Time High (ATH) will occur after the upcoming 2024 halving, you should also remain vigilant to the possibility that the bullish market could manifest at unexpected times.Even if you are absolutely certain of an impending bullish market, it's wise to employ your mathematical acumen to navigate the post-halving scenario next year. Avoid going all-in, even if it promises substantial gains, as the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin remains exceedingly high. Placing all your bets on a single asset, especially one that many are anticipating, can be extremely perilous.",

The thing that decreases is the rate of it. Meaning after the halving the rate at which new coins are added to the total supply is decreased by 50%. That can also mean less new coins being sold by the miners every day which means less sells pressure on the market. And we all know that less sell pressure means easier rise as there would be \"less resistance\".So it is not just \"positive feelings\" that leads to rise after the halving.",
