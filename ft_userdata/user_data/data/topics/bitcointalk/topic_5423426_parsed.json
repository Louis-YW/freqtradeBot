  "content": "QuoteTwitter’s new ruler Elon Musk makes so many pronouncements on the platform, it’s hard to keep track. This week alone, Musk polled Twitter users over whether he should provide “general amnesty” to suspended accounts and got into a public fight over whether the disgraced founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, owns a part of Twitter. On Friday, Musk was at it again, telling people that he may make an alternative phone to face off against Apple and Google.The tech billionaire’s comments were made, naturally, in response to a tweet directed at him by conservative podcaster and former OANN host Liz Wheeler. On Friday afternoon, Wheeler tweeted that Musk should make his own phone if Apple and Google decide to kick Twitter off their app stores. Twitter’s future in Apple and Google’s app stores has been a hot topic lately, given Musk’s commitment to “free speech”—as long as it doesn’t offend him—and lax content moderation.“If Apple & Google boot Twitter from their app stores, @elonmusk should produce his own smartphone. Half the country would happily ditch the biased, snooping iPhone & Android,” Wheeler said on Friday. “The man builds rockets to Mars, a silly little smartphone should be easy, right?”Three hours later, Musk told Wheeler that he would build his own phone if Twitter got banned from Apple and Google’s app stores, the official gateways to iPhone and Android devices across the globe. In what might have been an homage to Musk, who loves polling people on Twitter, Wheeler had started a poll of her own asking people if they would use a “tELONphone.” At of the time of publication, “Yes” was the leading response, with 56.2% of the 52,707 votes cast.“I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,” Musk tweeted.Both Apple and Google have policies that ban apps in its stores from containing hate or discriminatory speech, bullying, harassment, and sexually explicit content. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Apple and Google kicked Parler off their app stores for its role in helping rioters plan the event, although it was allowed back after making changes. Kanye West, who legally changed his name to Ye, is reportedly in talks to buy Parler.While Musk has declared his intention to build his own phone should Apple and Google cross him, it’s important to remember that this man says a lot of things that don’t end up happening. Remember the Tesla Semi, which is three years past deadline? Or the Cybertruck, which turned out not to be bulletproof in a live demonstration? Heck, the only reason he owns Twitter is because he couldn’t figure out a way to get out of the deal.https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-alternative-phone-apple-google-ban-twitter-1849822836tELONphone.I wonder how difficult smartphone markets would be to crack given the trend towards corporations like apple being known for exclusively using offshore labor.The time could be ripe for displacing apple as a leading smartphone manufacturer given that high fossil fuel prices will definitely hamper their chinese exports, tightening margins and opening the door to a USA manufacturing base. Semiconductor and chip supply chains could be the sole exception there. Given that the majority of production appears to be offshored outside the USA.There doesn't appear to have been much innovation or progress made with smartphones aside from moore's law over the last few decades. Is it possible that Elon Musk could find areas to improve on the basic design of smartphones which could give any tech initiative he launched in that area a significant advantage over existing android and iphones?",

With Apple getting closer to entering the car business it was inevitable that Elon would release a phone. Now he will be able to say he’s releasing a phone in response to Apple’s unfair practices and garner a following for their new product under the guise of a more free mobile platform. This latest chirp to Apple is nothing more than a brilliant marketing ploy. However, it doesn’t change that a phone is coming from Tesla.",

It's also (or mainly) the app ecosystem. Elon can make (that's a hypothetical; I don't think he can make shit) a great phone - as arguably some others have done, like Microsoft - but nobody will want it because it won't have their candy crush.",

This latest chirp to Apple is nothing more than a brilliant marketing ploy. However, it doesn’t change that a phone is coming from Tesla. Doesn't seem to me like he'd be successful. Tesla stock is way down, Twitter lost something like 2 billion dollars in advertisers that had existed last year who no longer exist this year. He's more than welcome to throw money away on a smart phone, but good luck to him on cracking the Android/Apple monopoly. I'd love for there to be alternatives because of the left's nonstop cancel campaign on any app they don't like, but Elon isn't acting discipline or focused here, he's acting on impulse (the same reason he bought twitter in the first place).",

If Elon Musk can improve on the design of smartphones currently , the Apple and Android products, he will definitely create a new market for himself and will not have to worry about people to buy, because people always love new things. Elon Musk is even at a position to do so by easily studying the basic existing designs currently and making developments from there.  If Elon Musk makes a smartphone, it will definitely compete with apple and Android smartphones,  they wouldn't want that because they know that he can actually get this done.",

      "body": "I don't believe Musk can pull off a phone/operative system which could compete against Google and Apple. Even if Elon's phone had very good hardware, people are already accustomed to Android and the Play Store, there have been already several attempts by other corporations to snatch some market from Google/Apple and none of them have managed to break the status quo.  Quote from: Fiatless on November 27, 2022, 09:56:33 AMElon Musk is a genius scientifically and he has contributed to the advancement of science. He has developed electric cars and made trips to space achievable. What are you talking about? Space travel has been a thing way before Tesla even existed so were electric vehicles.Perhaps, you should also give some credit to the engineers Elon hire to work at Tesla, Musk is not the only one behind the success of that company, you know.It reminds me when people used to worship Steve Jobs as if he was the only creator and person behind the Iphone .",

I think this is only a warning since his plate is currently full of Twitter stuff. Probably after Twitter's restructuring is done, he'll think about the new company.",

Would he also make his own operating system riddled with vulnerabilities because it needs to have twitter build in? What next? Own search engine and own internet? And hire even more specialists then he kicked from twitter? And he was complaining of losing money? Imagine when he figures out how much all this will be costing to him if and when the phone flops. All just because he wanted to brag that he can afford to buy twitter.Quote from: Fiatless on November 27, 2022, 09:56:33 AMElon Musk is a genius scientifically and he has contributed to the advancement of science.
