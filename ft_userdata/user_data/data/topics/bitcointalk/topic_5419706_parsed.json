      "body": "So someone have to connect their wallet to your website to earn? That's a red flag there, we have few mining platforms that pay miners in coins that aren't POW algorithm for example Unmineable but they never ask people to connect their wallets.Where is the gains coming from if I may ask? It's not as if you are helping miners to replace their hash power to none PoW coins. This is a suspicious service.",
