Quote from: velhoti on December 02, 2023, 06:28:21 PMthe airdrops become more and more difficult, demanding thousands of crypto transacted, in a lot of transactions during many months.It goes both ways. In start it was one way to identify and reward genuine wallets (Rather than Paraswap I would say Optimism and Arbitrum). But, eventually, farmers figured this supposed requirement and now they try to farm accordingly, so projects went even further and started excluding wallets which are newly created and have such repeated ingenuine transactions in their wallets. So farmers again went a little further, and they started purchasing old wallets (we have seen few threads like that on this forum). This is never ending game. QuoteCurrently there are thousands of influencers announcing airdrops even from projects that did not comment, projects announcing airdrops before have a product and a lot of noise.Some projects themselves have started using airdrop word as bait while most of airdrop speculation happens on X for engagement farming. Airdrops are hot and it works.

So with the trend of making free money in the crypto market, there have also been a lot of innovations. As competition increases, we will see harsher rules. But there will still be things that really bring large sums of money through airdrops to users, and I can sympathize with those who feel like those unpromising jobs make them feel more pressured. However, patience in this market always has a result that I think is worth it for those who believe in it. Right now, there are many L2 projects planning to airdrop to users, the problem is that not everyone has enough ability to adapt to it to take advantage of the final result for the project side to reward.",

Uniswap only followed the retrospective route because majority of their users spent a lot of money on gas fees and the airdrop was to compensate for that. Now, it's the norm and some projects have taken advantage of it.It's only going to get harder and harder. Gone are the days where you can get airdropped for simplying trying out on Testnet.",

They had to take some initiative to get rid of the airdrop farmers. I think all of the projects want to send the rewards to their community equally or based on their level of participation. But some people try to go around the system, so all the projects are trying different measures to overcome these challenges. Legit and loyal users are also affected because of this but if you want some free money you still need to do some contributions for that project. I think this requirements being hard justify this because you are only investing your time in here.",

It's not exactly odd that airdrops (or exchanges that do say airdrops) have to perform/add a lot more in terms of the amount airdropped and possibly whatever more they can add since they're catering to a LOT more of users compared to the past. Yes, this includes bots, but it's up to them really to determine how to filter said out still, the amount would be pretty sizeable. Considering all that, It's also understandable why good airdrops are rather hard to find nowadays since, well, the projects themselves usually aren't any good. They usually die off after a couple of weeks of trying to stay afloat, and even if there were good ones, they're ruined by the countless number of botters there are, possibly other influences as well but Idrk about those that inevitably lead the project to a ruin. This causes legitimate users who want to support the project to simply fall off. I mean what can a lone man do when a sea of whatever you'd call botters approach him. Nothing.",

If you research then you will knows that in one year many airdrop hunters get a very good amount just by following simple task.. Arkham gives people a very worthy airdrop and task was to just register(2 minutes work).. Arbitrum gives also worthy airdrop and task was to just perform some transaction. There are still some projects like Zksync, Linea, Venom, Zoro, Scroll which has potential to give airdrop in the future.. You can test and I hope you will get worthy airdrop.",

So they started to overcompensate by preparing and botting every potential airdrop. This was just painful to watch with Arbitrum for example. There are videos where people revealed their botting and got rich from it. That took my taste from the whole game. Wrong people were winning and this wouldn't make any sense as a reward system.And for some reason people thought that pre-announced airdrops would bring money, which they obviously never did. At least not for people who didn't bot the crap out of them.",
