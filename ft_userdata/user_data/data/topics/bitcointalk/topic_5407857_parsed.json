There is a legitimate concern for global species collapse. We depend on insects and nature for food. If that relationship were threatened with major collapse. There would be no alternatives. Nature has a monopoly over our food, water and air. There are many hollywood films claiming aliens or a zombie apocalypse are the biggest threats to civilization. A case could be made for mismanagement of land, ocean and resources being the biggest threat to our future.We're lucky that survival on the planet has become easier in ways. We have many opportunities and advantages over those who lived in previous eras. We tend to forget that those of past times recognized the need for balance in ecosystems. Like the train in snowpiercer, they would allow hunting during some times. And ban it during others. Depending on animal populations. Waging warfare was often done on a basis of wiping out the land and nature of the opposition. Where they would salt the earth to prevent them from growing crops. And kill their livestock to prevent them from having food to eat. People have become disconnected from their survival being reliant upon nature. And it has not been a good thing.",

      "body": "Overpopulation is simply a situation where the earth cannot produce what is needed to sustain its inhabitants at a given period of time. The doomers  and the boomers view of population are both correct. Due to greed and excessive quest for power and influence the world would keep experiencing wars and conflicts. Although the earth has enough resources to sustain its inhabitants, wars and conflict tend to destabilize the worlds population and make it seem like overpopulation is a problem. Hence,the doomers should know that overpopulation is not the reason why illegal immigrants are risking their lives to migrate to seek perceived greener pastures but the inability of world leaders to curb conflict and greed.The boomers are correct because birth rate in Europe, America and some part of Asia is dropping drastically. These underpopulated nations would need to depend on the so called overpopulated nations to balance their economic activities. I think the current growth of population in most underdeveloped nation would reduce drastically in future. As nations begin to embrace flexible stance towards abortion, with the spread of female education and freedom from some archaic cultural beliefs the population of the world would reduce to a large extent.",

Population growth is taking place in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle-East, where the people are illiterate and unskilled. On the other hand, maximum population decline is being noted in regions such as East Asia (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea.etc), where there is 100% literacy. In the long term, this brings down the levels of human innovation.",

He is a permanent troll and because of this, his words has no meaning. Even if this was his honest opinion, then you cannot really know it and that makes his thoughts worthless.My opinion is same with the doomers. Especially the Middle East and the Asia needs some population adjustments. Look at India and China. They multiply like... whatever.Bill Gates failed us",

This is something very difficult to do as it would mean restricting heavily on the freedom people have today of having as many kids as they want, and as we have seen at China it is not as if those policies have been good for the country either.",

As early as the end of the 18th century, Malthus stated that while the human population grows according to a geometric progression, the capacity to exploit the planet's resources grows at the rate of an arithmetic progression, much more slowly, and we were heading for disaster. Time has shown that he was wrong, since the capacity to produce food has made humanity go from a billion people in the past to eight thousand people living today, most of whom are overweight, instead of starving, which was more normal in the past. What happens is that resources are not infinite, and a planet with eight billion humans and growing does not seem very sustainable.Although I think that as all societies develop, this will reach a peak and will start to decrease, because in developed countries people have fewer children. Hopefully at some point this will happen worldwide and humans will put less pressure on the planet's resources.",

The companies won't be needing more workers in the factories in the near future. The service-based industries will have to fire many people and replace them with robots. This will create mass unemployment. Combining mass unemployment with overpopulation and mass migration is a recipe for disaster.Thomas Malthus was right about the dangers of overpopulation.

Hopefully at some point this will happen worldwide and humans will put less pressure on the planet's resources. I agree with this point of view, in my country for instance, people formerly used marry many wife's and have many children for the purpose of Labour which was important for survival then as more children meant more efficiency in the farmland, fetching water and firewood faster as well than a small family, that old thinking often has caused many people to have too many kids than they can take care of...but currently due to more development entering those rural communities, no need to keep a big family for labour and development has replaced fetching firewood with electricity and fetching water with boreholes... Development has also introduced complexities and affected the economic situation and made it more difficult for raising many children, as a result of this you advice yourself to give birth to a number of children that they can properly take care of.  As more places become developed it will affect the mindset of people as regards giving birth to many children, it will also make some places that were formerly uninhabitable to be inhabitable through technology and more persons will migrate to such areas thus balancing the population all round.",

We have much bigger issues than the number of people and whether over population spike is a problem. For example, apparently, it's still unclear to some countries that conquering land and waging a war for it is not okay. It's also unclear to many that if there's a giant long-term problem we know for certain is going to be a big deal, we can't just ignore it, remain skeptical and focus on things that happen over one's time in office (I'm talking about climate change). It's also, unfortunately, not obvious that profits can't be more important than reducing the human suffering, fighting war crimes, not allowing concentration camps and stuff like that.I also think it's unfair to say that the number of resources grow slower than the population (like the lady in the video) because the problem is NOT that there isn't enough resources to provide basic housing, food and medicine for everyone on the planet, it's just that the resources are distributed in an incredibly unfair way, when some have more than they can ever use in their lifetime, while others are dying from hunger.Similarly, stopping the anti-migration stuff and opening up borders more to encourage redistribution of the populations could help some countries solve their underpopulation, and others overpopulation issues.",

Big cities cover entire continents, disease and pollution, chaos and violence fight over sources of energy, water and food, and the human species only focuses on defending itself.  and fortunately the global population is not an end-time prophecy. The United Nations estimates that the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion in 2030, and increase further to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100 as reported by the world population project, meaning the world's growth rate slowing down, in that year ( 2100 ) I didn't watch the link, but I have read a lot of journals like this from time to time.",
