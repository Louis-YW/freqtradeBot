  "content": "In the course of my work on analyzing the results of traders, I have accumulated a list of telegram channels with signals that I would like to share here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19i8cno1kRo7pRvVUtWiSunRYdlyTjo9HL7mNrpZBMwk/edit#gid=0I will give my opinion on the value of this list - the value is not great, but the results of my work on channel analysis can give directions for making a profit. Just remember that everything needs to be double-checked.After checking the information, you need to do testing at a distance, for this we connect test accounts with a small, but real amount and look at the dynamics of 2-4 months. This is how one of these accounts with public monitoring looks like https://tradelink.pro/portfolio/618c6ef0-4536-4bf8-98d9-e096223cd460(Because this work is overseen by people in our small closed community, we run all tests on public accounts, as an example in the last link.)If you are looking at some channels or are planning to give money to management, send these proposals to this topic and we will analyze them.If you have an authorized and unused account with Binance Futures and are ready to provide API access to it for tests, please let me know!I hope for useful content in the discussion of this topic. If you have personal questions, you can also ask them in telegrams @managerjey",

Even anyone can be a lead trader and people can copy his trade which is better than trading signals that can easily lead to scam. With being a copy trader and lead trader, a reputable company that is recommended by the exchange you are using can be used, instead of falling being a victim of scam from trading signal providers. But not that I also believe in copy trading. I have a friend that told me he copied a lead trader that first make profit but later lost until my friend got no money to trade again. I believe in myself and to trade myself.",

You can lose all your capital if the lead trader is not making profit. It is just a normal trader and you copy when the trader's order triggers but you know as some say only 5% of traders profit, this tells you then that more traders lose than they profit.Quote from: Oshosondy on December 04, 2022, 09:56:21 AMI believe in myself and to trade myself.And that is the best.

To check such statistics from the telegram channel, I need about an hour and a half of time, a person who does not have experience in such work will spend about 3 hours. All of you have seen the signals in telegrams, almost everyone says that this is a fraud, and which of you did the analysis of statistics in a similar way in order to understand whether it suits your strategy or not?",

I learned chart, I started trading, failed before I learn indicators.Charts and indicators are not the same. What contain in the charts are open, high, low and close price at a particular period of time, it may also contain other information like number of transactions and volume etc. But indicators are primary ones like MA, EMA and BB, or secondary ones like RSI and other oscillating indicators. It is easy for traders to learn and know chart within little period of time, it may be not be hard to learn and know about indicators too, but harder than learning chart and it take longer time to learn than chart.",
