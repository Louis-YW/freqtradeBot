MiningBuddy has not been active since 2018.By accuracy, do you mean how the moderators are able to tell if the report is correct? When giving a report about a post, you have to be concise and provide a clear proof of the problem you want the moderators to check out. By doing this you may have a high chance of your report being¬† addressed by moderators.Quote from: Amphenomenon on June 08, 2023, 02:43:00 PMwho is the current Moderator in beginners and Help board since MiningBuddy has not been active since 2018.There was a topic before in 2019 about the issue of replacing minigbuddy as the moderator of B&H since he hasn't actually been active for a while now. Here's a quote from hilariousandco on this matterQuoteit does need a dedicated mod though, just like several other sections do. MiningBuddy may still be listed there but he hasn't been a mod for quite some time. Theymos just hasn't removed his name from there.There is no current moderator of The beginners and help board and I don't think that Theymos has the plans of adding any soon. We have some other boards without moderators and I think the global moderators are taking care of such boards. so buddy there's nothing to be worried about. If you have any report to make then feel free drop them, a moderator will surely look into it.",

How accuracy has been calculated? By just labeling your reports as good, bad, and unhandled but it all depends on the mod who handle your report. The Sum your good reports divide it by the number of your total reports then multiply by 100 and you will get your percentage of all reports as your accuracy.",

And in the same way, moderators can mark your reports as bad, so you need to accept this and think about why the report was accepted as bad.If you have already made more than 300 reports, then you will see statistics where you can see one or another rating for each report.However, remember the rule: \"Don't worry too much about your accuracy; one accurate report is worth many inaccurate reports.\" And keep helping keep the forum clean.",

That's not supposed to be any of your business since it is the sole responsibility of the moderators to handle that and channel to the appropriate and required path if needs be from their own end, the moderators, staffs and admin each have their own role and the aspect that you got concerned is only to see the accuracy of the reports you made, but i want to believe they always handle reports as appropriately needed, not only when you make report they notice somethings, they are also working to see some aspects being in place and act accordingly even when no one is reporting them.Quote from: Amphenomenon on June 08, 2023, 02:43:00 PMAlso, who is the current Moderator in beginners and Help board since MiningBuddy has not been active since 2018.Though some boards may be having upto two moderators knowing or unknowingly to us, theare are staffs as well, global moderators and other forum officials which i may not be aware of their positions, which means it may appears a board isn't moderated by us sometimes, but have you discover on the beginners and help board where a thread is being locked, moved, deleted? That alone is a clear answer that there's someone moderating it even as we don't know who is.",

I'm a Patroller since 2014. Staff is the general name written outside of our dedicated boards, which is Turkish local board and Digital Goods board for me. You can see Moderator tag in dedicated boards and Staff in all other boards. However Patroller is not indicated with a special tag.",
