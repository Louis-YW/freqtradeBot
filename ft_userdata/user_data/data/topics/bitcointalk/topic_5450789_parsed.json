If you always are in need of a loan, you are never able to pay back a loan.Also what is wrong is coming in to a forum and ten minutes later ask for a loan. Its nothing else then disrespect and stupidity. I DON´T have any family or friends either, i am all alone in my life. Do you see me searching for luck here? Do you see me crying and feel sorry for my self? No! I man up and do my best to solve my problems.I find solutions, i try to find out what I am good at and using that to earn money. Everyday I doing my best and trying to be better then the past.Now. Please never ever reply or think of me again, you are just waste of time.But with that said, i really wish you all the luck and hope you solving your problems in life someday, i dont want anyone to struggle in life or anything like that, i know how it is and its not fun at all. BUT I can promise you one thing - that a LOAN wont help you solving anything, it will just push your problems forwards.Wish you the best.Best regards CC!",
