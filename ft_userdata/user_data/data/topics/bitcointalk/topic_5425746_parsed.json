  "content": "Good afternoon! This morning, for the first time, I created an account on your site, made a deposit, made one bet on basketball. The bet won, I decided to withdraw part of the funds in the amount of $100. In the evening, I went back to the site and saw a window with verification. Immediately after that, I immediately uploaded the required documents and shook my head.After that, I decided to withdraw another part of the winnings, but this action was blocked (error information was displayed). Then I contacted the support service on the site, where they told me that my account was not the only one and after that they stopped answering me. However, I do not understand what it means that my account is not the only one. Perhaps I was confused with my own brother, who advised me your site. He and I have the same last name.",

You can post evidence here of conversations with the support team. Because it is difficult to say anything without evidence. This post of yours doesn't prove anything, unless you post with all the evidence. And if you have violated their TOC by creating multiple accounts, they will also respond to that.",

Since you already gave them personal information about you, i guess you should open a support ticket again and pm their support here with the linked shared above. Tell them about this, make a pic both of you and your brother with your phone logged in on casino account. Tell them you both using the site and sharing the same wifi connection.Well, i don't know if it will work, but there's no harm in trying especially for the $100 you owned.",

I'm not taking the casino's side in this case, but your accusation is just as baseless if you don't back it up with evidence. At least show us proof of the deposit, and a screenshot of your communication with customer support and their response.",

You can still show other evidence if you want, for example blockchain transactions of your deposits and withdrawals from the platform and a response from their customer support explaining the reasons why your account was blocked. I'm not saying that this will help in your case, however, it's important to make sure that you have evidence to back up your claim.",
