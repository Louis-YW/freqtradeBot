      "body": "This HYIP site is undoubtedly 100% a scam, also they put a fake certificate for their company as a registered company and they edited the certificate with photoshop because the original registered company with number 08053966 is CREEK INVESTMENTS LTD, they put this certificate to deceive investors as a registered company with an official headquarters, most of the HYIPs sites that offer investment plans and huge investment returns like this is undoubtedly a scam, so I advise everyone who sees such sites to stay away from them or to review all their details before depositing even a single dollar with them.[ 1 ] https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08053966",

These Hyip websites are an old scamming technique, but scammers keep up with the trend and present the old technique to crypto users in a new way. When the bear market starts. Then such Hyip websites appear. New crypto users should think that there is no real way to make such huge profits quickly.",

Even when I approached them, they maintained their defense of these con websites. They no longer care about honor in order to make money.     There will be no more poor people in the world if these HYIP offerings are true. However, like all HYIP offerings, it is only a fantasy. Because there is no real way to make a lot of money quickly. Bravo for exposing these fraudulent websites. Let us report them all.",

Let us report them all.  You will continue to receive offers from such Hyip websites through various Telegram DMs, if you are active in any large group on Telegram. Because they use all mediums including telegram. I get most of these investment program offers on Telegram. It is not that they promote these websites for the only sake of commission, many times the owners of the websites promote all this scam hyip and if they can convince you to invest once, they will run away with your money. So it's all a scam game",
