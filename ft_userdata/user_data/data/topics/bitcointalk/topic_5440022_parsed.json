There's still a lot of things he need to study before proceeding on hosting that event. He can't gather and understand at the same time the information he needs to teach to the people in his local community. Bitcoin is a broad topic, especially trading itself. You can't earn money that easy in trading because it is a long term process.",

New user guideIt's worthy to mention Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsJust like the title says, the OP is giving tips on how to advertise Bitcoin and I think he only use Binance there as a sample on how can people get involved in Bitcoin but I think that was fast if he will recommend trading without introducing what is Bitcoin first. There is an introduction there but it was wrongly written. As @mk4 said, Bitcoin is not a trading platform but one example of a trading platform is Binance.Bitcoin is only a digital currency or also called as cryptocurrency which is decentralized. He didn't put a link yet to invite anyone about their program because it will not start now but we still have to wait for 1 more month. I guess the OP can still learn more about Bitcoin and hopefully he will improve before the event starts.",
