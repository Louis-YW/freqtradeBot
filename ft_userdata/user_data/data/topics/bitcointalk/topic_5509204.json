Let’s go and vote for the crypto-pro candidate.Let’s remember who was in the bitcoin conference and who wasn’t.Let’s remember who bled for his supporters and who ran away from answering questions.Today is the day that crypto people teach a lesson to all those anti-freedom communist freaks.Vote for Trump and let bitcoin fly to the fucking moon!Why be fine when you can become better and finer and gooder?If Kama wins bitcoin won't disappear that's true and it is because nobody can stop bitcoin. Even Kam can't do that. So we don't have anything to worry about.However,Kammie wants to tax the elite in the US and some of those elites do own crypto related businesses. These people will go away to some other country and that will increase the unemployment in the US. That's net a negative for those who work in the crypto businesses in the United States. They will lose their jobs.Will bitcoin survive? Of course it will but lots of people will get harmed by Kommie's malignant actions.Then there is Donald J. Trump who promises cheaper electricity. That will enable more mining related businesses in the US. More bitcoins will get minted in the US and those bitcoin farms will employ more US citizens. Under Trump Bitcoin adoption in the US will skyrocket and that will directly affect the bitcoin prices.The exact opposite will happen under Kommiela Harris.Quote from: mindrust on September 13, 2024, 07:53:24 PMhttps://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1834311432982135015Donny is launching World Liberty Financial on Monday.\"We are leaving the outdated big banks behind.\" -DJTDayum, he will even have his own crypto company and people still say he is not pro-crypto. Damn fools these demonrats. Where is Kabala's crypto company?",

Whether Trump emerges or not bitcoin will be fine why because not only US are using bitcoin there are vast majority of country that are using bitcoin and if am not mistakenly they aren't holding about 30 percent total supply of bitcoin or more to affect the growth of bitcoin. Yes I know they are the mover but not anymore because bitcoin has grown so large and big with lots of branches that can never be put off or cut off so, even a Branch is being cut off doesn't mean that the entire system is being eliminated due to one single person or country. Partially it would affect the price but after some months then there will be stability in the market.",

Currently, I see Trump as the lesser of two evils, Harris is the worse evil and a no fan of Bitcoin, maybe for her personal interest. Bitcoin needs not much attacks at this point in time, so I'll support trump with the positive hope he'll implement what he's saying.It's not about how many Americans have Bitcoin or are holding on to it. Bitcoin is a long term project and what happens in the future means a lot to us Bitcoin enthusiasts. If the government favors Bitcoin, more people would adopt it and the value would increase. We would all be happy, so Trump returning to power would see Bitcoins and it's mining farms in the US not disturbed at least, while we anticipated the favorable conditions he promised.",

I agree, he was already a president, and nothing positive occurred for Bitcoin; why should it happen now? Why does it matter so much for Bitcoin who's going to be elected? Why the sudden change of heart from Trump when in 2018 he was completely against it, like @philipma1957 already mentioned? He was the one calling it a scam and a bubble, claiming that it's not money. Yet he has now incorporated it into his political approach. I don't think it matters who's elected; even if electricity prices become cheaper, it won't suddenly resort to a surge in mining farms.",

As you said, a lot of businessmen own cryptocurrency, and Kammie wants to tax the elite class more. They will find an alternative way for this, but they will never let their investors move to other countries, nor their citizens.On the other hand, if Trump wins, it will give a lot of support to cryptocurrencies because he openly supports cryptocurrency in America. He said that if he wins, he will want the rest of Bitcoin mining in America. Furthermore, he also collects his party funds in cryptocurrency, which clearly shows Trump supporting cryptocurrency. If he wins, the Bitcoin price will definitely move because a positive sign will be shown to the miners and those who own or support it.",

If Trump performs no good with crypto in his past terms, most likely he will still carry out those rules and policies as well since Trump remains Trump, he will do everything for his own personal gains.

But what is not normal anymore is to make use of bitcoin and its community at his biggest advantage and leave bitcoin like a trash when the results come out on his favor. Just my personal thought.",
