So Bitdefender - 6%, Malwarebytes - 6%, McAfee - 7%, ESET 11%, Avast 11%, Others or Windows Defender - 16%.",

There are around 3 major testing companies, which test all most popular antivirus software, and results are similar - so more or less tests are objective. The main problem, why antivirus defence is so important you can find in this forum post - My wallet has been hacked. What to do?",
