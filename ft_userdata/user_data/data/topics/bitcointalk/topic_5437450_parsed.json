Probably this warning are for those user that doesn’t have forum account and use the google to search for the casino review.I’m just curious on how come all your account already have a limit on the amount that you can bet? Are you involved on arbitrage betting or surebets on most of your bets in these casino because the casino that you mention are the most trusted here so you will suffer same fate on other casino due to the nature of your bets. Try your luck on using web3 casino such as betfury and owl.games because most of the centralized crypto casino is using same bookmaker for their odds and your chance of being detected as an alt account of user that is limited on other casino is very high. This might be the reason why you are limited on most of the top tier sportsbook.",

Or actually MegaPari send it as their reason for my limit. But as I showed it in MegaPari Thread. I didn't placed any arbitrage bets. I am betting on ice-hockey. For example German DEL and DEL2. In addition at lower leagues like AlpsHockey League and English EIHL. There I found most value and won my money. After some good bets you will get the limit. At one bookie it takes a little bit longer, at another one it goes faster, but Limit will come for sure.",

Why didn't you attach any proof or PM/Chat Logs or deposit and withdrawal history so that we can make sure of the truth of your words, for me, I have not played at IVI Casino before and for the first time I heard of it, but what I saw from the review sites made me take a bad impression about it, there are many honest and reliable casino sites that have fast response customer service around the clock, and they always pay. You can check the Gambling Board and choose the casino that you like, but before you deposit your money in any casino, read the terms and policies of the service and do your own research.BTW, We cannot rely on review sites mainly because they can be positive reviews purchased by the casino team, but they also make us discover some facts about the casino from the reviews of customers who have tried it.",

These are the reasons why one need to be careful with what ever investment or game they are putting their funds into, doing research on reviews too could help to separate the stones from the grain so as not to get into trouble. As I also checked, their presence is not registered here and there is every possibility that they might not be realistic and genuine. In case next time, there are lots of registered casinos here with their presence actively felt here responding to participants complaints and inquiries. I said this because if any one here has problem with the casinos, reputable members would intervene immediately to restore normalcy. Anyways, thanks for this information about this casino. Members would need to be careful about them in the future.",
