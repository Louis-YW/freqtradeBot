I hate it when people talk about 'crypto', putting bitcoin on equal footing with over 23,000 other shitty altcoins, most of which are only going to lose money for people who even think of putting money into them. They are even worse than cash, which is saying something. Let's learn the essential difference between bitcoin and the rest, and stop talking about 'crypto'. On the other hand, the OP is somewhat right that in theory they are assets, but realistically, as most of them are going to lose investors money, they are more like liabilities.",

These are really the things one must consider before carrying on with their investment so they are aware of the level of risk involved. I know about a few altcoins that have stuck around for several years, but investing in them is just a matter of waiting for the price to appreciate, but instead they keep dropping in price and there is not enough trading volume; some exchanges even end up delisting them from their exchange. Is really good to check those factors before choosing to invest in any altcoins, and by the way, I would even be the least person to advise a crypto newbie to invest in altcoins except Bitcoin, because unlike experienced crypto enthusiasts who some times are able to filter out some few altcoins that they can earn profit from before they dump, newbies are not easily able to filter out good coins to invest in and if they are unlucky, can buy when the price of the token is high and after some weeks, they dump, and may never have a good attraction in the crypto market.",

There are cases where people are doing well in the market is all about determination plus knowledge=cashWell, I kind of agree with this one. In fact, that volatility could be like two-sided blades, which could give you advantages but also slice you. Volatility is the one that attracts many people to jump into the crypto world since people could gain profits from the price discrepancy. I just want to add that, beside determination and knowledge, in order to be successful in trading, you also need good emotion control since it's important to have a clear head when you make a decision.Quote from: Greggry on April 08, 2023, 03:27:35 AM You've probably heard about $25 turning into $200?? It is more than possible. It could take a few weeks, days, months or years. Talking about volatility, it could even take just a minute or hours for the price to flip, but yeah, in general, it happens when we're in the bullish season, but it's true we should prepare for the possibility you've mentioned too when the market gets bearish.Quote from: Greggry on April 08, 2023, 03:27:35 AM   What matters is the right update, and the part you play, which is DYOR.(Doing Your Own Research),  DYOR will always be mentioned in the crypto world since you can't depend on other people's decisions to decide your fate. Your money is your responsibility, not theirs, and you can't be angry at other people's judgment when many people in the crypto world just want to hype their bags and drag you in. When theyre able to sell their bags for a good price, they'll leave you out. Be careful.Quote from: Greggry on April 08, 2023, 03:27:35 AM  *Cryptocurrencies are assets.* And assets are more guaranteed to hold value than cash, overtime. Well, I should say that cryptocurrencies are unique assets where you can't treat them all the same because there are cryptos that have a long-term basis, a short-term basis, or are not even valuable at all at some point. Yes, Bitcoin could be a long-term basis asset. Some alts could be too; other alts could be on a short-term basis or trashes too. So be careful about this.Quote from: Greggry on April 08, 2023, 03:27:35 AM Many people don't have patients though, learn to be patient while into crypto, observe the price, volumes and market, you're good to make it.

Cryptocurrencies can be decentralized, but most definitely aren't. Non-custodial and open-source =/= decentralized2. Something being decentralized doesn't make it immune to regulations. It's just that regulations are far easily bypassed because of crypto's non-custodial and pseudonymous nature.3. Something being \"an asset\" doesn't make it automatically volatile.",
