  "content": "If the real Satosho Nakamoto never published any article before in his real name then how can stylometry analysis can identify the Bitcoin White Paper's writer ?   All of his forum post and the Bitcoin White Paper was written in articulate language in a literary format. Some of it or part of it might be have some similarities with few other writers but it does not conclusively prove that Bitcoin White Paper were written by one of those writers. I think Satoshi was clever enough to hide his identity for some very valid reasons. What is your opinion ?",

      "body": "Stylometry analysis isn't accurate and at best it's not going to give you the right person or might lead you the wrong path. Take Franklin W. Dixon as an example, he was the author of the hardy boys series and to be honest, at first many were puzzled and they thought that it's just one person but as it was revealed, they were a group of writers sharing the pen name. My point is that even if we do an analysis on his writing style, we can never be sure until it's revealed who Satoshi is.",

Satoshi's writings only were related to Bitcoin. Outside Bitcoin Forum, he published in the P2P Foundation, Twitter and SorceForge. Finally he published the Bitcoin Whige Paper. Some informations are missing from from the Google search but there is meta data, that lead to Bitcoin. And Bitcoin@Bitcoin was the first publication. According to the Meta Data, Bitcoin Twitter account was created in 2007 but later the Account  creation date has been changed to 2009. There are many data related to Bitcoin were deleted in 2008  by someone who was working with Google but later joined the Bitcoin community.

How many technical \"discussions\" did they have in the forum?Correct, Satoshi deliberately published in  Bristish and American English in order to hide his true Identity. But it was not Harold Finney who is Satoshi. But Satoshi was the person who was using an account called HalFin in Twitter and was publishing under Hal Finney's photo to make Hal Fiiney curious about  Bitcoin. Finally Hal Finney was atracted to bitcoin. I",
