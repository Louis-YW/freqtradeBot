Usually it will take Bitcoin about 6 to 9 months after its halving day to break its past all time high and make a new all time high.I don't want to predict price but if your prediction must be based on history like previous bull markets.https://charts.bitbo.io/compare-bull-markets/",

I safely estimate based on the price history that 100k is the next target for the next bull run cycle after this bear season. I doubt that we are already starting since real bull market doesn’t move slow like this. We are already on the preparation stage for the big one.Price speculation for what’s coming is one of the popular topic when crypto price make a sudden move but people should stop thinking about target price and focus on Bitcoin adaption since price will continuosly pump when there’s still a hype and demand. That’s the best indicator if the price will continue to pump instead of guessing random number as target.",

Bitcoin vaulting to a staggering $100K in the 2024-2025 bull market isnt a flight of fancy; its a real prospect.Our ally, the Stock-to-Flow model, foresees a price leap due to Bitcoin's shrinking availability and swelling demand. The upcoming half-decade is decisive for Bitcoin as the quadrennial cycle, amplified by the 2024 halving event, could send prices ascending. This isnt financial guidance. Bitcoin's volatility means anything's possible, and elements like regulatory shifts and the overall economic mood can pull the strings any direction.",

Then in the next bull during 2017, it went to $20k… that’s a x20 increase. The last ATH on the other hand though was $60k… that’s a big number too but it is only a 3 times increase. So we can expect a way less impactful new ATH this time. And my guess it the maximum price for this ATH will be something around $80k and $110k…",

Even though we know that to reach that point the Bitcoin market will bleed first, but I believe that only those who remain patient and stay HOLD will be able to harvest profits. And I'm pretty confident on this one that it'll be able to pass its ATH.",

But one thing is certain, every time a bitcoin halving event occurs, the price of Bitcoin must increase. Regarding the price, no one can say for sure what the price of bitcoin will be.",

So there's a lot of speculations around and we really don't know what the price will be and what's the next all time high.The best thing to do though is to prepare your self, buy as much bitcoin as you can.",

We are still now in bear market and moving towards to a bull season. So After halving in 2024 Bitcoin will make new ATH which can be predicted surely. And if we see the halving history and it's pump then we can say Bitcoin will be more that 100k and it can be almost 150k . Also mass adoption will increase and many companies will be involved in Bitcoin. It's demand will be much more than our prediction. Wait for those golden days and grab your position before you regret.",

If you have been accumulating since 2022 you should be fine and do not forget to take profit either ways, remember that higher price expectations are why some people got burned, they also expected 100k Bitcoin and they failed to take profit.",

It could turn around to be the opposite of the assumption. So if when this happens don't be surprised. If you are HOLDING, just keep HOLDING till the next bull run.",

I've looked at some analysis and read some news about possible next cycles, most of them coming to a scenario where you think bitcoin will cross $100000, and so if we're completely convinced. Depending on what happens in the future, the narrative that everyone is skeptical about current prices will be broken after what bitcoin will shape over time.bitcoin is expected to follow historical price trends and hit a new ATH in the next halving, honestly some of the events around which I think will create momentum for bitcoin to skyrocket will be plenty .",

Now we have it at $30k and it only went to $31k ones if I'm not mistaken, and since then we have been seeing it at $30k for sometime now so I'd say it might get up to $60k, if possibly before the next 2-3 months, before 2024/25 if might get to something extraordinary can't really say.",

For my part, I firmly believe that we will have a super cycle because if everything goes as predicted, 2025 is also the perfect time for our economy to enter a phase of recovery and growth. Therefore, it will be very easy to trigger a super cycle for the market when investment demand increases. I predict bitcoin to hit $150k-180k in the next bull cycle.",

Anyway, no matter what prices we pick, someone could unknowingly predict it happens whilst the majority of us won't hit the accurate one.What's important is that you're accumulating at this stage or else you'll just keep with the thought that you should have done that earlier when the bull run arrives and the price is enormous.Start with a few mbtc and use to calculate that so that you'll be encouraged to stock more.",
