What could they possibly be needing someone's money for if they can give out such a reward, and what kind of business could they possibly be doing with the user's money that can give them that return? For the first time, I will have to start tagging spammers too….

Do not deal with the user.I agree and don't deal also with users that have been offering the same scheme and even as low as 1%-5% per day, that's unreal because the banks will not even have the balls to offer that to someone. And the typical offer they give is an annual rate so, these people think that members here are naive when it's about these interest rates and investments. It's not going to be the last one and there will be more of them for sure since we're close to the bull run.",

It is difficult to find someone who can believe such a scam, but negative trust can be useful.Well, there are always naive people or people who don't know about numbers that can fall into the trap. It is usually people with few resources who are blinded by a possible almost miraculous way out of their dire economic situation, so I was hesitating whether to create the flat after having left the first tag and I think it is right that the OP has created it to warn these potential victims.But most likely scenario is that the scammer will not appear again on the forum, at least with that account. He has not logged in the forum since I left him the first tag.",
