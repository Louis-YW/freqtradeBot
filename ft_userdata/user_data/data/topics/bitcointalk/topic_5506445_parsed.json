How would you rank or change this list?What can i say here, basing on current features and practical applications is that the use of Bitcoin can be reconfigured, definitely controversial if being the most common due to its popularity as a high-risk, high-reward asset and investing in Bitcoin to provide insights into value appreciation and arbitrage. Most people now recognize Bitcoin as a store of value, very much like \"digital gold\", where one holds it to preserve wealth from inflation. The next one is retail and services trade, where more and more merchants and websites selling goods started to adopt Bitcoin. Commercial contract payments, like regular fees and premiums, are less frequent in occurrence but still dominate. If there is a use case where Bitcoin shines, it would have to be in banking transfer of value and temporary storage of money. Asset tokenization is a new concept linking Bitcoin ownership to other assets and is possible but not widely adopted. In general, Bitcoin's speech in public discourse remains an inefficient tool for other use cases. This graph shows the current state of usage and prevalence of Bitcoin in the market.",

Right on this forum or other social networks...do you see how many threads talk about the use cases of bitcoin or do people mainly just discuss the price, volatility , and profitability of bitcoin? Or are you and your friend using bitcoin as an investment or do you just consider it a currency and don't care about its fluctuations? Of course , you can both use bitcoin as an investment and turn it into a store of wealth, currency...you can combine but your priority is still investment , right? Bitcoin's volatility is a great gift so there's nothing wrong with people taking advantage of it to make a profit .",

But there is absolutely no guarantee your wealth will be preserved with Bitcoin or any other investment instrument. When you say, \"investment XYZ will preserve my wealth\", you are speculating that is the case since, not being God, you cannot predict the future. No matter what, you are predicting the future: you are speculating on the future value of Bitcoin (or whatever investment). This is true for US dollars as well (if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice, etc.).QuoteThere is something fundamentally different about purchasing something to sell it for a higher price later on, as there is from purchasing something to sell it for an equal price later on.There really isn't. Any professional investor views them as exactly the same, because they are.For instance, perhaps many here believe that Bitcoin will preserve your wealth forever and ever--it will maintain its value or increase no matter what. Other people would point out that Bitcoin's value is extremely volatile and has dropped in value by 80% in the recent past, and may drop again and stay that way. Some of those people may be right, and some of them may be wrong. Only God knows who. But both are speculating.",

The topic is about the \"Utility Uses\" of Bitcoin, not about how you could try to make money with Bitcoin. Making a profit from Bitcoin is what perhaps 95% of Bitcoin users do with it today. This is not what Satoshi envisioned, but that's the reality of Bitcoin circa 2024.QuoteHelping unbanked people, is maybe not what you care about the most, but Satoshi wanted to build something allowing to transact without the need of using banks. No, he made Bitcoin for people who could not safely use a bank or other institution for fear of government prosecution or persecution. Surely most people who use Bitcoin--now, as well as in the beginning--already had some kind of bank account. They merely wanted to put... certain assets... out of the reach of their government, and/or wanted to be able to trade in such a way that could not be traced by their government. If you wanted to make a developing world solution, it would be rather strange--especially 15 years ago--to create something that requires the internet and a computing device in order to use.I'm not saying Bitcoin can't be used this way--it can, and is--but it wasn't made for that in mind anymore than it was made for what Bitcoin is mostly used for today e.g. an investment instrument. Anyhow, the original point I was making in my OP (such that we can reel the conversation back on track here  ), is that it's important not to look at what Bitcoin \"can\" do, but rather what can it do that nothing else can do. Bank cards etc. work well for much of the world's daily transactions, and Bitcoin was never intended to replace those transactions. Monero works correctly as a government-proof means of value transfer. Haypenny currencies are far faster and cheaper than credit cards. Bitcoin's only meme is \"Bitcoin\". Etc. etc.We're trying to answer, \"what can you use Bitcoin for\", and... I think we're answering that, right?",
