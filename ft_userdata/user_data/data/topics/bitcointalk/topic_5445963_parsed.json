      "body": "Well, that's a interesting thought experiment! Without Elon Musk's vocal support for Dogecoin, would meme coins even be a thing? Perhaps they would have remained a niche phenomenon for internet memes and not gained widespread popularity.And as for Shiba Inu, who knows? Maybe it would still have made it, or maybe it would have languished in obscurity. But I doubt it would ever reach the top 20. One thing's for sure, though: without the influence of Musk and his social media presence, the landscape of meme coins would certainly be very different.",

What would have happen to meme coins? Will there ever be any if Elon never existed? You can expect for a different scenario since meme tokens are living for the hype only and if there's no big investors, I doubt for them to survive on this market. Meme token are still here because many are trap on those token and waiting for another hype in the market, its possible to happen but I think it will be on the next bull run and not all meme token will get the same hype from the top meme token, so better to be careful on dealing with those tokens.",

Didn't shiba and baby doge and all of that ended up getting created AFTER he showed interest in doge? That means if he didn't tweeted and pumped it, then there wouldn't be any meme projects at all. The only reason they ever existed was to get some attention from those tweets, and they did that at the time and since Elon is not tweeting anymore, they are dying slowly, all of them will be dead eventually due to lack of attention.",

Pretty sure just worth like nothing just like other altcoins out there without any influencers promoting these type of coin. Dogecoin is still at the top as meme coin because one of the first meme altcoin out there, so if you are familiar with Doge memes back at that day, then pretty sure you will buy it. Without influencers, doge is still at the top but you can't say that to other coins out there.",

They will be nothing, hype is their only chance to be recognize in this market and though even without Elon they can still have the hype but probably it will be on a different level. If you are still trap on that meme token better to forget it for now because its not their moment right now and I think meme token is not worth it. If there's another hype, you might see a new meme token coming into this market, for sure most of them is just a fake project and will rugpull later on so be careful and analyze well when dealing with meme tokens.",

What would have happen to meme coins? Will there ever be any if Elon never existed? There's an essence to this question and I think that Dogecoin will remain but the majority of the meme coins will never be known. They've been into the hype and no doubt that thanks to Elon Musk for doing all the shilling and hyping everyone with his tweets that have made these meme coins trendy during the last bull run. It's the exact thing that John McAfee did when he got those projects paying him just for them to get tweeted by him. But in Elon's case, I don't think that most of them paid him because it's not really essential as he's got covered the majority of the meme coins, as in general even if he just talked about Doge or Shiba.",

What would have happen to meme coins? Will there ever be any if Elon never existed? ALL of them? There are like thousands new in a month or more that die immediately. Some of them survive because people trade anything so why not memes. Best thing about them is that they don't need tech to survive. Just hype and community. And they are not pretending like buyers were in it for the tech, so in that way they are more honest them most of the snake oil salesman who sell blockchain as a solution when you don't need a blockchain.",

But it doesn't worth a lot unlike the value of memecoins now. Since few people knew what kind of token is that due to they don't have an idea what is a meme before. As time fly many people recognize what a meme is and can relate on dogememe which they invest because of its popularity and hype. But it pumped a lot when Elon Musk mentioned it. It will still be a thing but it won't be popular like today. Some other memecoins I consider them as dead since the meme is not popular as the token. I remembered the token of squid game where a lot of people invest to it since its popular but in the next days it got rugpulled. Which I conclude that I rather invest on memes that are mentioned by famous traders and investors.",

While the influence of Elon played a part on hyping meme coins, at the same time I really feel that this was bound to happen anyway, there are investors out there which are always looking for the next big thing, and whether we were talking about NFTs, metaverse coins, P2E token or meme coins they will invest in them no matter what as long as they believe they can make money with those coins.So when we think about it not much changed, except that the hype was bigger than anticipated and the hype took over the market sooner than what it could have happened otherwise.",
