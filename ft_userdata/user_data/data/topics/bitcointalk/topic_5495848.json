  "content": "To cut this story short, it turned out that my trusted neigboir whom I have few times vouched for to be a bitcoin investor is a online scammer who collect Bitcoin from his victims, until he was bursted 2 days ago, it was around 5am in the morning when the raid happened in our compound, I couldn't say anything about this since there is no concrete information about what he did yet until later.I was so shocked because I don't look at him like this, I was still planning to go to a nearby secondary school with this neigbour of mine and teach students about bitcoin, I have already talked to their principal and he said he will give me a date when I can come. My neighbour have been scamming some foreigners for the past years as per the information I got from one of the hunt squad and he is storing the Bitcoin in a hardware wallet, funny thing is I was the one that gave him the idea to store Bitcoin in hardware wallet so keep it safer. Now I sat back and think about a few arguments we had in the past, remember when the forum stop supporting mixers? It was in that period, he was so supportive of mixers like it is a must but I kept saying that I have no reasons to use mixers, I could have been suspicious of him then but I trusted him. Many people are going to hate me for this but I don't blame the law for going after mixers and privacy featured wallets in crypto space, if you believe that you are clean it is only to yourself, the other users might not, you really can't tell who to trust or not.Many people are criminals in disguise and they are ruining bitcoin name by scamming people using Bitcoin as if it is a safe pass to scam people for free and get away with it, so no wonder that the government hates Mixers and privacy in this space, who is to be blame if not for our people who are criminals in disguise? Not all Bitcoin investors are real investors, some are just hiding and pretending to be Bitcoin real investors, even if they are close to you, it doesn't mean they are clean, many good people want privacy and mixers to prevail but I wonder how when bad people are taking advantage of these features to steal from others.",

You are very lucky not to have been arrested along side him. Because some people would want to drag others along when the fall in this kind of situation. You should be mindful of whom you keep as friend or tell about you being a Bitcoiner.Though we all know that mixers were initially created to improve privacy for bitcoiners but some people have decided to spoil the good use of mixers and give it  bad names. We can't blame the government for going after mixing services because if they are all left unregulated, things may go out of hand. A lot of criminals will turn mixers into their den of illicit activities. So it's all for the best.",

I am glad that you weren't pointed as one of his accomplices. People might think that you were in on this too since you were kind of close and you are both Bitcoin investors. You'd probably have to check whether you both had any transaction with each other and whether this can be used by officials to track anyone and have them checked and investigated. These are the very same people who tarnish the bitcoins image that's why many still refuse to acknowledge.",

You trusted the guy who was a scammer, you have been discussing Bitcoin and other stuff with him and he probably knew you were an investor and had cryptocurrencies. What if he was also a serious criminal who would do anything for money? He could rob you at gunpoint or even harm you only to get access to your funds because he knew you had them.So, it is much better that you keep these things private and don't let anyone know about these things even if it's someone very close to you because you can't trust anyone in this world these days as you said.",

Even close friends or relatives can’t be trusted easily so trusting a neighbor of yours easily is not ideal but i don’t blame you though. There are lots of criminals around now and it is difficult to tell when you see them that why it is important not to share personal information with just anyone. You are even lucky you didn’t disclose any useful information to him that he could have used against you. These kind of people have always given Bitcoin and cryptocurrency a bad name and they are the reason why many are still scared to adopt it and this is the reason why governments are reluctant to accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. They believe they criminals will hide behind use of cryptocurrency and with this government now have another reason to fight against the use of cryptocurrency, these set of people really tarnish the image of cryptocurrency because they are giving it a bad name. Criminal have always been around even before the existence of bitcoin and will still be around even if bitcoin doesn’t exist so even if cryptocurrency is banned criminals will still find other means to stay around so government only using this as an excuse to do away with cryptocurrency.",

In all conversation that involves about money and investment, learn not to trust easily, otherwise you will fall as a new victim as well. But sometimes, scammers tend to be smarter than us. They won’t argue with us so that we’ll eventually feel that we’re on the same side. But in reality, they’re just waiting for us to finally fall on their traps. So it pays to be more careful and cautious with our actions and decisions that involve about money and investments. And obviously trust no one, that’s the only way that we can protect our own funds from stealing.",

Following your logic, you too may turn out to be a potential criminal, just because you use bitcoin or a mixer. It seems to me that the criminal influence of bitcoin is greatly exaggerated, as is the opinion that mixers are necessarily used for criminal purposes.Governments hate privacy and mixers for completely different reasons. Governments want to maintain a monopoly on the issue and regulation of money, a monopoly on privacy (only they are allowed to allocate millions of money for unknown expenses and hide everything under the heading “secret”) and want to control any financial transactions between people (as well as safely collect taxes for each money movement).Quote from: Outhue on May 09, 2024, 08:21:24 AMNot all Bitcoin investors are real investors, some are just hiding and pretending to be Bitcoin real investors, even if they are close to you, it doesn't mean they are clean, many good people want privacy and mixers to prevail but I wonder how when bad people are taking advantage of these features to steal from others. The knife has claimed the lives of many people, but is this a reason to completely ban the sale of kitchen, tourist, craft and other knives? The use of mixers by some users for criminal purposes doesn't give rise to a total ban on mixers. This problem needs to be addressed in a way other than depriving most good users of their privacy tool.",

What the authorities will be looking at will be how the crime was being carried out and who were the people that shared the knowledge to the suspect. Somehow along the line, they will try to know if he acted alone or in connivance with others and the OP might be mentioned as those who helped him perfect his crime. I do not pray it get to that point but this should serve as a lesson to us that we should be careful who we share the knowledge of bitcoin with because some people always look for opportunity to corrupt what is real and genuine.",

It is definitely a tough topic for me too because I too can't convince myself if we really need to have full online privacy. We are able to create anonymous nicknames for our social media/forum accounts and that gives some privacy but when we commit a crime, the police can find out our real identity quite easily. That's a very basic privacy option and it works to some degree. People who demand the hardest privacy tool are usually the ones that do something the gov isn't going to like. I also never understand why would a normal guy want to mix his/her coins unless he has some tainted coins or he/she is a scammer/criminal.
