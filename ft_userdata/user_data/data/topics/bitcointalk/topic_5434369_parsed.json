Good or bad?Read more about AWS - Avalanche here and Solana - Google Cloud here.",

      "body": "When we are talking about projects like Avalanche and Solana, I think we must first consider that the diversity of the network which is part of the decentralized pillar are not truly favoured within those project. With that in mind, big cloud players jumping in should benefit them. In term of Solana, it seems that there is many developer resource being integrated into Google product, which is surely a good thing for the ecosystem itself.The recent issue that some cryptocurrencies get affected by is Hetzner banning cryptocurrency-related applications, so, when the big players jump in, the users could easily migrate into those alternate platforms.",

But i totally understand why they want to take everything they got from this hype. Most of these big players have all sorts of programs where they help innovators, small firms, of web3.0 developers etc. Partnerships with huge players are always good but they aren't happening on a level that hype indicates them happening. This is nice but nothing to get hyped about. It won't lead to anything more meaningful.",

But really, it's more interesting to see that these tech companies adopt bitcoin and it's more optimistic to see such news.Anyway, about Google Cloud and Solana that might change in the future because of those news with their network outages and since GCP is one of the most known cloud service, they can't rely on that service if it keeps on happening.",
