  "content": "I was recently browsing on another forum and found a topic wherein a user was asking on how to make a purchase online in India using crypto. I was unaware you can do something like this with your own cryptocurrency. I was only aware of a project, that allows any user to earn Bitcoin using their list on their platform to make a purchase with INR.Real ScenarioJust think about it, Why on earth would I use such a platform when I know it is just based on affiliate commission and it cannot be questioned as they have a certain period to release Bitcoin gained through your purchase? Rather than using such a platform, I would always prefer an alternative to use my crypto, especially my Bitcoin.Practicality When I heard that this platform Bitrefill provides an option to buy gift cards using their platform for major e-commerce sites in India. I went ahead and checked it and was gratified. To my surprise, they had gift coupons from every company that you ever dreamt of. I did scroll almost every company listed on the platform and I found out that they are selling coupons for petrol to diamonds. CommisionI understood that Betrifill is charging 1 percent per purchase and I think it is far less than what our government is charging as tax, GST & so on.ProblemLet me put it in a list. 1. The biggest issue is that Betrifill allows access to its platform using Metamask wallet or getting registered using email.2. You can buy coupons in whole numbers as in INR 100, 1000, & 2000 but when the bill is displayed it will always be an in odd number format.3. Sometimes the cost price would be more when you are using a coupon.4. There might be a major difference on the INR price when you compare it with an exchange.If you think there are more pros & not cons then do share.",

      "body": "As of now, Bitrefil seems the most sane ways to make use of our cryptos. I have completely stopped converting my cryptos to cash since that 30% tax was imposed. So as of now, I can't think of any negative point for Bitrefil. It's saving us from huge burdens. The commission is quite less and the price is quite ok. Especially when considering the taxes, I don't mind paying that extra amount because it's te most economical way of spending your cryptos right now in India.",

The only thing now left is to find a prepaid debit card that can be refilled using crypto and can be used in India. Mostly you will find gift cards from Amazon or Flipkart and some other renowned brands. These are very handy if you are planning to purchase certain things that are available on those websites. You can do mobile recharge as well. Go ahead and recharge for the entire year. Now I feel stupid for doing this day before yesterday when the bitcoin price was around 20k. Today the price has gone up and I could have spent less amount of bitcoin.",

I think these are online cards and do have not practical usage as you cannot withdraw funds from an ATM. It is better to use gift coupons rather than using unreliable online prepaid cards.

Nothing new for anyone of us who are active. Just chill and the next time twice before selling your Bitcoin.",

In order to boost the confidence of a first time buyer you should create a telegram channel for Indians consumers. Bitrefill has a channel, not that active yet, it helps as a consumer can ask questions related to after sale issue. I hope you get my point.",
