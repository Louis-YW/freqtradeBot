Good luckQuote from: https://nitter.it/raypaxful/status/1654221730099896323#mNo way bro. Not going back. It is a disaster waiting to happen. My cofounder destroyed the company and everyone has left. BewareQuote from: https://nitter.it/raypaxful/status/1654217359702327301#mI resigned as ceo and took out my funds. I will not be going back or trading there under any circumstances. No idea what will happen there.Tbf, even without these tweets, I wouldn't deposit any money to them. AFAIK, a portion of funds are still frozen and even if we say they paid all of these back, it wouldn't mean the company is in good health. I'd tread cautiously o7",

So it's more like a breakaway from Paxful after a possible dispute, and now the other parties are trying to fight back by opening the platform again.I would avoid using the platform completely.",

I'm honestly not good with dramas so I'll be staying away from both sides. It's not like noones is offering something new. Last I heard, they were having troubles with user load.",

      "body": "I guess it's better to just avoid Noones and Paxful altogether. I particularly am suspicious of Youssef. The guy seems manipulative and sneaky. Back when he announced that Paxful is shutting down, he wasn't honest and transparent. He only mentioned about \"key staff departures\" and the usual \"regulatory challenges\" before he moved on to a rather detailed promotion of Noones. It even came as a surprise that you can actually log on to Noones with your Paxful details, even your KYC. Your trades will also be reflected on the new platform.[1] With this new update, it seems Youssef's co-founder Artur Schaback's lawsuit against both Paxful and Youssef is gaining the upper hand. And now Youssef is badmouthing the very platform he used to protect. The guy's a dirty player. [1] https://twitter.com/greybtc/status/1643367997417947136?",

      "body": "It's simple, this is just a mind game in business, since Ray Youssef is no more a CEO in paxful, that why he ask other people to not use it again. If paxful comeback get their traffic back, he will not earn any profit anymore, why he need to support and convince people to use paxful?However, paxful is already a custodial P2P in the first place, which is a bad site if you want to protect your privacy. I'd say paxful is already a bad P2P before they were suspended their operation.",

I prefer exchanges that people have made up to certain number of trades and that have account registered for certain number of days before creating ads, rather than anyone that just open an account. Maybe this changed after I left. What made me more discouraged is when they made KYC mandatory. Quote from: virasog on May 05, 2023, 11:43:29 PMIt was not long ago when they ceased their operations.

P2P exchanges are decentralized, not centralized. Example of a decentralized exchange which is regarded as P2P is Bisq.I too will not advice anyone to use Paxful for now too, there are many platforms now that you can exchange to fiat.",

They are not actual P2P marketplaces but I know people prefer convenience, quick trade experience than their privacy that requires a little bit more time to complete their trades. On actual P2P marketplaces, trading volume will be lower and your trade order usually needs more time to find a trade partner and complete that trade with your P2P trade partner.QuoteP2P exchanges are decentralized, not centralized. Example of a decentralized exchange which is regarded as P2P is Bisq.Other alternatives for Bisq is AgoraDesk, RoboSats.

Personally, I wouldn't trust any platform that shut down its operations and restarted them after a period of time for whatever reason, even if it didn't scam its users in the process. The tweets sound like an internal dispute between two of the founding staff members of the company, which is making both look bad. Even though I wouldn't use such a service after going through all this trouble, it's easy to suppose that his tweets are a mere and desperate attempt to hurt the company in which he was involved. I'd also dare to suppose that he could have also been fired, and he's spitting out venom to cause issues.",

They've never planned it very well on how to announce their departure and then being handled to another management. That's just so confusing to the many and before such disclosure, they should have make these matters clear before putting it up on the public. This conflict isn't good for any business and them that have already announced their closure, then, it will make more scare to the people that would want to use them.Well, just like everyone is saying and it's a friendly advice that don't deposit any amount of them.",
