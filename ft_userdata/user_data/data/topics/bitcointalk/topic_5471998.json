Do we know the specific reason why this change occurred?In simple words to keep both bitcoin and bitcointalk independent of each other. Simply put after Satoshi three names took over different domains Sirius, Cobra and theymos.As of 2020 theymos have full control of bitcointalk.org and if I’m not wrong bitcoin.org is still in control of Cobra.Similar transition happened with bitcoin core project (wallet software) now the bitcoincoin core is hosted over https://bitcoincore.org/ and Bitcoin.org is suggesting many wallets and among those one is biticoincore.In short bitcointalk.org is for discussion and rich history around bitcoin. No need to link it to bitcoin.org anyway. Bitcoin.org is now more like an information site about “Bitcoin”.And Bitcoincore about open source project maintaining bitcoin client software.",

Later, the forum got its own domain name, but due to this history, bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org have traditionally been linked, and for quite some time Cøbra and I have together managed the domain names. However, Cøbra has never had much involvement in bitcointalk.org's operation, and I haven't involved myself in bitcoin.org for a couple of years, so the linkage between the two no longer really made made any sense. Therefore, we decided to separate the domains: I no longer have any access to the bitcoin.org domain name, and Cøbra no longer has any access to the bitcointalk.org domain name. The two sites should be viewed as totally separate, which in practice they have been for years.There will be no changes whatsoever on bitcointalk.org due to this, and I'd assume that the same will be true of bitcoin.org. The bitcoin.org open-source project has been advancing steadily, and I hope and expect that it will continue to do so thanks to the efforts of its contributors.Thanks to Cøbra for handling much of bitcointalk.org's domain-name-related work in the past.",

Bitcoin.org still exists, but the forum was moved from forum.bitcoin.org to bitcointalk.org. it does mean that Theymos also owns bitcoin.org correct?2011 still is the time when people are building wordpress sites and forums to monetize. i couldn't be sure but i think there was a time in the past when Theymos uses adsense in bitcointalk. which i guess is the reason for moving it from the subforum to a new domain.Roger Ver was finding issues about this so he created his own forum. but like it was said above, the forum started on sourceforge where Satoshi made his first post.",
