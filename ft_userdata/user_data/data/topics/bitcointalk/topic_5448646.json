  "content": "Recently I had a discussion with a friend interested in- but not convinced by- the principles of Bitcoin.You know how it goes \"blabla I don't really see the longterm value of Bitcoin\" - \"blabla, currently store of value, immutable, can scale with lightning to become widely used for payments, predictible outcomes, no centralized control, safe-heaven against institutional/gov. control bla\".Some back and forth.He then asked me this question, which I wasn't entirely sure how to asnwer. IF Bitcoin just stays a store-of-vaue/digital-gold type of thing, because it has many advantages in comparison to physical store-of-values but never is mainly used for payments: How can the network incentive to keep running lots and lots of expensive mining hardware with high-energy-consumption (lets forget about the possibility for other proof-of-work algos and free energy solutions like fusion power etc for this example) be maintained? If the network is only used every once in a while for a transfer of value from one entity to another?We are assuming block-reward is 0 now and the only reward is coming from network fees. (after last halving)To put it in other words: Wouldn't be that amount coming from fees be possibly too small to keep up a healthy hashrate and therefore weaken the network / breaking the current equilibrium of hashing-effort vs. block-reward-payout? Assuming Bitcoin transactions are very low in volume, because it's not used for payments, just as a store of value/digital-gold?Not entirely sure if this belongs in technical discussion, my apologies in advance if this is misplaced.",

(I think 2140the last BTC will be mind),...No need to wait that longand it won't be an unpredictable jump that suddenly happens overnight.Looking at the numbers the current fees are somewhere around 0.1-0.2ish BTC per block,checking the \"halving roadmap\" in this thread we see that in ~20years, the block-reward will be around that same range too.Currently the block-reward is the main-dish and the fees are just a bonus, from 2040-2044 on it's the other way around.And every miner knows (or should) this already and has enough time to either adapt or slowly leave the playing field to make room for others.Besides, I'm sadly not around anymore in 100+years, but I would be mining at a loss if that keeps the network going and I'm just a random nobody,why wouldn't some big player like an exchange, payment provider, or whatever bitcoin-business spend some of its profits on mining-activities if it keeps the cash-cow poop?If there's another income-stream dependent on the bitcoin-network to run smoothly, mining itself doesn't need to be profitable.Anyway, to predict what might or might not happen in the future is as hard as always.",

      "body": "OP, first off, why are you assuming transaction volume would be low??Blocks are already full and have been full for years even though it is barely ever used for payments right now. You seem to be saying \"what if transactions become less frequent\", but obviously that won't happen. Blocks will stay full as Bitcoin becomes more popular of course. And transaction fees will go up.Now hopefully there will be further improvements to make transactions a bit more efficient, or at least certain types of transactions more efficient, and maybe even ways to cram more data in, like the way Segwit did.Also it's not like this will suddenly happen one day. The whole last halving cycle before Bitcoin hits its supply limit the block rewards will only be 1 satoshi. The block reward will be negligible for decades before it finally stops. And starting from now it will take decades for that block reward to become negligible. If you think about the block rewards halving vs the increase in price, by around 2050 the halvings will likely have outpaced the price appreciation starting from now, so by around 2050 it's likely that miners will be receiving less money (in terms of USD) than they do today. So it'll take a bunch of years until the halvings even start to effect the mining industry, and it'll be like 90 years from that point until there are no more satoshis being rewarded, and all during this time the tx fees will have to gradually make up the difference. So it's not like one day mining will be fine and the next day there will be a huge issue. This means if this does cause a problem there will literally be decades to deal with it.Realize that the Bitcoin network already has global-level security and is the most secure network in human history. So it's not like we NEED the mining network to keep growing, we just need it to stay decentralized. Also realize that mining machines grow more efficient over time, so hash rate will continue to increase even without more energy (cost of mining) used. Also Bitcoin mining is still a very new industry and in the coming decades as it becomes accepted more and matures it will naturally go to the most efficient places (like running on unused power at renewable power stations) or running at purpose-built renewable power stations where they are generating energy at nearly zero cost after initial startup costs, rather than like paying on-grid prices like most miners do today.Also the most obvious point - mining difficulty can adjust down for any negative chance in hash power going into mining, so even if hash rate peaks at some point and goes down after that until settling at a tx-fee-only equilibrium, the system will adjust for that and it'll just mean the most efficient miners stay in business. Only thing that matters is it stays decentralized among those most efficient miners, which seems pretty likely since you can mine from anywhere in the world as long as you have access to cheap power.In summary:1. Blocks will obviously stay full so its not like there will be fewer transactions or less competition for getting transactions in blocks2. Potential for further improvements in the bitcoin protocol in the coming decades to allow more transactions to be crammed into blocks3. Transaction fees will go up as bitcoin use grows4. The effects of the mining reward becoming negligible will happen over decades, not all at once, so if there is a problem it can be dealt with over decades5. Mining machines will become more efficient to use less power and naturally miners will settle towards using only the cheapest electricity, bringing down the cost of mining per unit hash rate6. Hash rate doesn't need to go up forever, Bitcoin is already the most secure network in human history, we should certainly expect at some point in the next few decades hash rate will peak (my guess would be sometime in the mid-to-late 2040s) and then settle somewhere at a long term equilibrium, the halvings will eventually cause hash rate to peak and the difficulty adjustment will allow it to settle at equilibrium somewhere lower than that peak once the block rewards of new bitcoin are a negligible part of the miners income7. This is all perfectly fine, the only thing that matters is that mining stays decentralized once this equilibrium is hit when miners are making their income just from tx fees.",

We know at exactly every block number what the mining reward will be. There is no unpredictable jump.And as far as the 100% drop...yeah it's literally a drop from 1 satoshi to 0 satoshis around 2140. By the time that happens miners income will have been entirely dependent on transactions fees for many decades. It seems like you think that all of a sudden one day the mining reward will go from entirely supporting miners to being zero. That's not how this works. The halvings mean that mining rewards drop gradually over the course of many decades. Even if the price of a bitcoin is $100,000,000 on the day the mining reward stops, that means miners will be receiving $1 less per block after the final halving lol. The mining industry will find an equilibrium over many decades. There is no worry about one day a 51% attack will be easy because mining rewards suddenly disappeared, because mining rewards never suddenly disappear. Over decades tx fees will gradually come to support more and more of mining until they are supporting all of mining, and the hash power will settle at a place where mining is profitable with only tx fees, and the mining difficulty adjustment allows that to happen.",

      "body": "Bitcoin's security is directly related to its value, the more value it has, the more people can afford to mine it, and the number of satoshis mined is irrelevant, less block rewards = less supply which in theory should result in more value to be extracted by mining BTC since it's value has increased, in other words:100k BTC 30k BTC and a block reward of 3.125 BTC is better than 30k BTC and block reward of 6.25 BTC, in other words, if you want BTC to be as secured as it's today with only block fees that amount of fees needs to 6.25 BTC at 30k BTC, if the fees are only 0.25 BTCinstead, then the price of BTC has to be $750,000.So no block rewards and BTC worth $750,000 is exactly the same as 6.25 BTC block rewards and BTC worth $30,000.Something else to keep in mind is that if BTC keeps growing the same way, those who have value at stake will be willing to mine it at a loss just to protect their BTC.With that said it would be best if we make sure that blocks are always full or near full, we don't know how is that going to be achieved or how will people view and use Bitcoin in 70 years, the good thing about this is the fact that it will unfold slowly, so no urgent measures have to be taken, when the time comes, the next generation could be reading our comments and laugh at how we got everything wrong.",

The first halving the block reward dropped by 25 bitcoins whereas the upcoming halving the reward will only drop by 3.125 and when the reward reduced by 25 bitcoins, the hashrate only grew, there is no reason to argue that when the reward reduces less the hashrate would drop.In a couple of more halvings the before and after reward won't be that different.",

High fees lead to a shift of Bitcoin as store of value that gets transacted rarely. What we currently see, is something inbetween. And I believe it will remain that way, as it seems that we always reach an equilibrium between the fee market and how people use Bitcoin, similar to how we always reach an equilibrium of profitable mining.Quote from: Sha256explorer on April 13, 2023, 09:10:42 PMif in 2140 (and before)  the price of Bitcoin will be high and the fees will be high, will the Lightning network always be cheap at that point?The economics of LN fees are different from the economics of mining fees, enabling Lightning transactions to remain much cheaper than on-chain transactions.

      "body": "I think, bitcoin wasn't meant for very long-term usage with it's current form, that's why we have an ability to fork bitcoin. Personally, I think that from current situation, it will be a good deal if we increase bitcoin block size and we already have a fork of it called Bitcoin Cash but somehow people hate this coin on this forum, maybe it has something to do with Roger Ver, idk but I still think that block-size increase is a future-wise decision because definitely Bitcoin price will be very big and increases block size will give users possibility to spend transactions with low transaction fees but high number of them will generate good profit for miners, enough to continue their operation.But it's impossible to predict what will happen when the last block will be mined because of very unpredictable future. Just think about it, in 1860, probably no one would imagine any way of communication from place A to place B on long distance but In 1876 we invented first telephone. Would anyone imagine wireless communication from A country to B country? No, but in 1895 Marconi succeed in receiving Morse code on a radio wave that let to the development of the first handheld cellular phone that was invented in 1973. And today, in 2023, we have smartphones that not only give us possibility to contact from any place to any place, we can take a picture, record a video, voice, play video games, do complex tasks.The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. We have 117 years left, this is such a huge time and the world develops so faster, nothing is predictable to my mind.",
