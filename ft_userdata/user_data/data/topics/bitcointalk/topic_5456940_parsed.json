  "content": "There was a Great Economic Depression in the world and it started from 1929 and ended in 1939 which stayed about 10 years and that was the longest one ever. In that great economic depression the world ecoonomy was dis-stabilized in all areas of life and livelyhood. Banks were closed down for the long period of years, farms were destroyed, industries closed down. Live was unbearable. People died and human suffer to the core. And everythings  in life were affected no school and life became survival of the fittest. Now this technology age and must transactions are done online without going to the bank. Sometimes we buy things without going to the supermarket or to the market square you just order from online and you received your goods at your door post without stress. The present day ecoonomy is much more better comparing to that of 20s down. Things are make easy to use. Physical bank stress is also fading gradually to the hand of technology calls digital currency. And bitcoin is the Father and the King of this digitalization. So if ECONOMIC DEPRESSION happened again in the world, will it affect bitcoin with it fellow digital currencies? Because economy is the back bone of everything in the world. What affect economy affect all other things. And bitcoin is the father of digital currency. What is your say.",

Being rich aren't their dream anymore, they dream are only to survive.However I'm not really sure what's the affect you refer, if you mean economic depression will make Bitcoin become centralized, it's completely wrong.",

But if the time will come and there are still few people that know what Bitcoin is, there will be still no good effect at all if we have few participants, they will find some assets that they believe are more stable, like gold.On the other hand, I will still go for Bitcoin because I believe that Bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation and day-to-day use for payments besides investment.",

I doubted such will ever occur again and i believe such will never affect bitcoin network no matter how because bitcoin is not a dependent of the world economy system, it has created it's own network from within without depending on the centralized economy being controlled by the government which can be affected by inflation, recession and other natural pandemic occurrences while bitcoin has it own separate network different and independently from these, that's why you could only determines the market values through the bitcoin demands and supplies and not the other economical parameters and factors used in fiat system.",

Point of correction my friend, I guess what you meant is from 1929 to 1939 which is a ten-years difference, and not 2939, because we are just in 2023, and 2939 is approximately 916 years from today, which is a whole 9 centuries from today. So you better go re-edit that statement. However, base on my research about the topic of discussion, I was made to understand that there were 4 major factors which led to the Great Economic depression of 1929 - 1939, namely, 1) The stock market crash of 1929 shattered confidence in the American economy, resulting in sharp reductions in spending and investment. 2) Banking panics in the early 1930s caused many banks to fail, decreasing the pool of money available for loans. 3) The gold standard required foreign central banks to raise interest rates to counteract trade imbalances with the United States, depressing spending and investment in those countries. 4) The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930) imposed steep tariffs on many industrial and agricultural goods, inviting retaliatory measures that ultimately reduced output and caused global trade to contract.And if you are to look vividly well you will noticed that Bitcoin has absolutely nothing & no connection to do with Stock market, Banking, gold and Tariff act which were the major cause of that economic depression of 1929, which means if such ever happens again, it will literally still have no effect on Bitcoin.Link: https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression",

This is where I think it will affect Bitcoin if the economic depression hits the world.At a glance, people who have invested can be helped when economic difficulties occur. Of course, the investment I mean is an investment like Bitcoin because I feel very confident that investing in Bitcoin can be a positive solution as a pretty good hedge.Maybe we can call 1929 an incident that was quite severe based on the history that we read from various sources so that many experts always refer to the events of that year at every opportunity they talk about the problem of high inflation to economic depression.",

Plans of investing in Bitcoin will be far from the mind because their won't be enough money to that.World economic depression is a disaster to humankind, when people can afford to solve their daily demand it will surely be a good advantage to the Bitcoin market. Let's use areas where the rate of poverty is high and the economy is struggling as example it is impossible for in area like this to have good adoption of bitcoin, this is the same thing as if the world should go into economic depression.  No doubt it will surely affect the price of bitcoin.",

In todays era, if someone is in economic depression, someone else will benefit from it. It's a good question what would happen to Bitcoin, as people in crisis would sell it amongst other things just to survive. Bitcoin could have a market crash or maybe wealthy people would buy out everything and it would continue to be some kind of exclusive asset. Anything could happen really, from staying on the market to crashing to flames. Anyways, I don't think that we will see that kind of economic catastrophe.",

I think so but let's just use the pandemic and war of Ukraine and Russia with the depression and it did really hapened. We can see that Bitcoin plummeted from these scenarios and yet Bitcoin still remains strong as of now. It is expected that there will be some downs because of global crises that has came. However, we don't expect that it's like this that it's been stronger than ever. Summing it up, there's the affection that Bitcoin gets from world factors and that's cannot be gone but even with that, it is temporarily happening and then it recovers up again.",

This topic is kinda vast and complex to explain to you though but the internet are free of information if you want to know everything. On the other hand, if you want to know if Bitcoin could be affected by the great depression then IMO it depends if there's a crisis all over the world but if it's just a selected areas of the country then Bitcoin will still be fine. Although during bearish times it's not actually reliable if you just want to hodl your asset but if you use it as a means of payment/currency it does help since it was not bound to anyone that would affect their prices. The only worst part I see is if during the bear trend and great depression occur at the same time in your own country. I don't know if Venezuela is the best example to your question but IMO in kinda does.",

It’s been like this for centuries and I really doubt it’d be different today.Of course Bitcoin will be affected! An economical depression will make anything that isn’t 100% safe disappear from the people’s mouths for a while, including Bitcoin. Say whatever you want, it’s still digital and during hard times you won’t be thinking about electricity and mobile data plan bills. You’re gonna want to just survive and that’s it.
