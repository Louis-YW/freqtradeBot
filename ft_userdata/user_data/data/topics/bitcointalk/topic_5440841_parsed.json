Moderators move threads that do no belong in the section you've posted in, to keep things organised. There's no personal vendetta against you.  If you do need some more help figuring out how the forum works, just reply to the personal message I sent you, and I'm more than happy to help out. If you need to find a post that you've lost, just check here. I will likely remove some of the duplicate posts you've made about the same issues recently, but I'll give you time to see the personal message or this post first. Unless, another moderator removes it beforehand.  Seems like you've now figured it out.It does seem that some of your posts were removed, due to being duplicates, although the originals have all been kept. I imagine the same issue has happened here, where you've lost a thread, and then opened a new one.",

      "body": "I've removed the other duplicate, one with the least replies. I'll keep this thread about since it technically is complaining about me, and not directly about the thread being moved. For anyone that's confused, grumpygit had a thread that was moved, then posted in Bitcoin Discussion about it being deleted, so I moved that to the Meta section, but left a redirect since I suspected they just didn't understand how the forum works, that's probably when grumpygit saw I moved it, but maybe jumped to the conclusion that was a removal notice or something. Hence, the original posts contents . grumpygit did make another thread apologizing, so I do think it's just a case of not knowing how the forum works, as that was also in the wrong section . I've removed that, although of course apology accepted. Quote from: digaran on February 22, 2023, 02:18:10 PMThis is why staff shouldn't waste their time contacting newbies. Sometimes users need a little help working out the forums software. I mean, Simple Machines Forums is anything, but simple. Well, it's pretty simple if you're used to forum platforms, but not everyone is. I suspected that this user was losing his posts, and not understanding that they were getting moved. That's not a massive big deal, as long as it doesn't continue to happen, and we get a ton of threads . As for the way grumpygit delivered their frustrations, water off a ducks back. I sort of get when users feel they're being hard done by, and that's obviously going to make you feel like you're being personally attacked, and your freedom of speech being restricted. So, it's not a big deal. It's just a misunderstanding, that's really all it is.",

Fairly old user, but I guess after a long period of inactivity you could forget how to use the forum correctly. It does seem like they might have returned due to their issues with their wallet though, and that's a fairly stressful situation so it was probably due to the frustration from that also. Hopefully no more problems going forward.

However, I sort of suspected the circumstances, and at the end of the day it was just pure frustration. I've definitely been called worse .",

I think some folks if not all have either had their post moved from the actual board posted to the right board it should be posted. So i think no need to get all insultive with your words. This correction i feel its all part of the learning process . If nothing just take it as a guide to help you understand the ethics of the forum better as some links have already been given to you for proper guildlines on the correct boards to drop your post.

That's some quality in a person as much as handling a public space. I'll say, if we hope to be respected, we must first respect ourselves, give that respect to others and it would surely find its way back to us.One thing I would like to bring to your notice @OP is the fact that, everyone here is expendable and you might be gone without anyone even noticing.
