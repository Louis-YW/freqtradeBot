  "content": "“Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” - Elon MuskPeople have stopped breeding. Here's a list of 10 largely populated nation and their fertility rate in brackets. Fertility rate is the average number of children a couple breeds. A fertility rate below 2.1 indicates a declining trend.1. India has entered the phase for decrease (2.06).2. China's population is already decreasing (1.28).3. US population is increasing just because of immigration (1.6). 4. Indonesian being muslim majority would keep breeding for a while but the rate has decreased significantly over time (2.19). 5. Pakistan another muslim nation is still a good exporter of immigrants but the fertility rate is decreasing rapidly (3.56).6. Nigeria with over 50% muslim population is growing (5.31).7. Brazil's on verge of population decline (1.65).8. Bangladesh, even a muslim nation's population going stagnant (2.0). 9. Russian's were getting fewer even without war (1.5).10. Mexico won't grow for too long. (1.9)Only 3 of them are above the replacement rate and all of them muslim majority. Unlike claims from some, the fertility rate on muslim nations too are on decline.The population decrease is already affecting eastern Europe and East Asia. Aging population means lower economic growth and decreased quality of life. The largest threat to mankind is the lack of modern values and extremism in growing population group. Humankind could go in backward direction if they are not properly integrated.",

They can consider being married but the majority of them just wanna work forever and don't want to cope with the high expenses of owning a child. The cost is one reason why many don't even want to have their own child. That's why you'll see reports from these two countries in Asia that have a decline in population and consider this as a huge problem that their respective countries have to deal with in the future. Well, if we're going to sum up everything, it's about the hardship of growing and taking care of one but mostly, all about the cost.",

      "body": "Population means existence without population our earth would be like Mars or Jupiter, so population stands everything we know is because of population we understand it But at the current rate of population decline there are states whose population rate is below 0% and this poses a major challenge for the dire future.If this continues, there will come a time when the major task of the people will be to increase the population. For example, China abandoned the one-child policy in favor of a two-child policy Japan is taking many innovative measures to increase the population in their country Because they want to increase their population, there are many provinces in Japan where there is almost no population, and in those areas, Japan has arranged puppets or other things to make people In fact they are not human beings they are puppets they are taking different forms to take people from different countries to their country like they have good friendship with Bangladesh the people of this country are there The Japanese government is providing good facilities and facilities, whose one goal is to increase the population. The same is the case in America. The population growth rate is very low. Of course, these reasons are our own.Artificial birth control methods, food adulteration, modernization, everything can be considered because of population size They think that if they want to improve their career, there is no need for children or dreams. If they take these things, they will waste time and their career will increase and their beauty and other problems will appear. They are one of the obstacles to population growth Currently, the population growth rate in Muslim countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, etc. is about 50%.The population growth rate of these regions in Europe and America is relatively low, but Asia Africa, especially South Asia, has a fairly high population growth rate.We should now make the whole world aware of the rate of population growth because it should increase because we are doing so much for the people, if there are no people then they will be of no use to us.I think that the idea of ​​increasing the economy by reducing the population is wrong in my opinion because the more the population in the country, the more the productive capacity and the labor of the country, then when the labor is more, the production will be more It is a normal process to improveI think it is a good decision to take this issue of low population as a big challenge in the present world otherwise we may have to face big problems in the near future.There are many people in the society who think that having more children is more expensive or a burden. In fact, it is not right. Allah said that you have children. It is my responsibility to take care of them, and it is my responsibility to provide for them should think.If we want to see human progress, success, expansion, etc., if we don't want to wipe out human civilization, we have to increase the population, it can be faced as a big challenge which can later fail.The word globalization we use must be centered on the population because without the population these steps will be of no use to us so through various big plans Population growth like other countries in Japan or China Such steps should be taken because they understand the danger ahead. China is one of the most populous countries in the world, yet they have come out on their own because of their manpower Nothing can be achieved without Population can be compared to a tree like if a tree is strong its branches or other things will not break down just as if the population is high then it will not topple the country.Therefore, this aspect should be considered by organizing a special convention in the United Nations and various steps should be taken looking at the world population report because the rate at which the population is decreasing has a big impact on the world To be considered as a challenge so that going forward it should be addressed now. Population may be a problem in many countries but 90% of the world's countries are underpopulated which is a big problem now.",

Much bigger issue is crazy increase of population. Just less than 2 years ago world population reached 8 billions and it continue to increase.

This will intimately affect the economy there is no doubt about that since that has already been reflected in the number of unemployed youths and those are the working age,  who are now left to either cater for themselves or left at the mercy of the private sector who is now modern slavery with many of them paying below the minimum wage at salaries.",

I may be wrong, but I don't think there's any country that has not been able to develop further because of low population. Like I said, I might be wrong. I feel like we're at that stage where we can't be truly underpopulated. One thing people mistake for underpopulation is an uneven distribution of people in the towns and cities of countries. In most countries today people flood to the urban areas. People want to live and work in the relatively more developed cities. This makes the rural areas and less developed places to be less populated. There are countries where over 20 million people are crowded in a small region while there are vast places occupied by only 300,000 people. This is no fault of the residents who relocate, it's because they're in search of a better life. There are better opportunities in the bigger cities. On a personal note, I'll take under-population over over-population. I disagree that population collapse is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming. There is a higher risk of flooding these days. Farmer take out loans for their farms and the farms get destroyed by floods. What's worse is that there is a high probability that this will happen every year. Some places don't see rain much often before, now they even see less amount of rain. So many irregularities in the weather. If we can be able to make life better, and train people in different areas that they want to get trained in then we won't have an issue of under-population at this stage. Why would people give birth if they think or know they can't provide for their kids? I don't believe the labor force has reduced, but if it truly has, did it reduce due to low population or due to low-skilled workers?",

If this continues, in a few decades, the human population will most likely decrease, and the workforce will also decrease. For this reason, problems like this must be resolved quickly.And in my opinion, there are actually many reasons for the population decline that is occurring in several countries. One of the most common is the implementation of a family planning system. Well, nowadays this factor is widely used by several countries, one of which is my country. In fact, if this rule is implemented for a long time, the result will definitely have an impact on reducing the population or birth rate.The second factor, currently women's roles are almost the same as men's. In this modern era, many women do not want to be inferior to men, one of which is in the field of work or career. Well, the cause of this women's revolution, ultimately caused many women to marry at a slightly older age. So logically it can be seen that at a fairly old age, fertility and readiness to take care of children will definitely not be as good as at a young age. Given this, most couples who marry at a fairly old age are likely to only be able to take care of one child, and may also decide not to have children.The third factor is financial. In Japan, even though it is a developed country, quite a few young people there decide not to get married. There are many reasons why young people in Japan decide this, but the most basic one is financial.QuoteSocial norms in Japan require men to take care of their wives and families financially, which many feel they are unable to do.Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.liputan6.com/amp/4634900/terkuak-ini-7-alasan-senomor-orang-jepang-besar-meoleh-untuk-melajangSo with this problem, it is certain that the population and birth rate in Japan will definitely decrease.But for now, it seems like all countries are not having big problems because of this population decline. But if this problem continues, and is not resolved, the consequences will definitely be felt decades from now.",
