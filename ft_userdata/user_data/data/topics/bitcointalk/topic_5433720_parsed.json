  "content": "Some religions believe there is life after death. Others believe in reincarnation, having the hope that you would come back to the world after death. Do you also think that you would be happy if your ex-husband or wife comes back? The increase in the rate of divorce is making me think that people are no longer happy in marriage. In my religion (Christianity), we believe in life after death but there would be no marriage in heaven or hell. My question now is that for those that are or were married, would you love to marry your husband or wife in the afterlife? Do you think you would be happy and comfortable with your spouse if you come back to the world after death? Would be happy to remarry your ex-spouse?",

Now the divorce rate is getting higher and higher. There are always people complaining about their lives, but Marriage is inherently mediocre and requires two people to work together.",

My wife anticipates every move I make and can tell where I will be when she calls. She also knows what clothes will look best on me and makes me feel at ease even when things are tough. I occasionally ponder what individuals are talking about when they lament about their unhappy marriages because I don't share their sentiments. In response to your question, I will marry my wife repeatedly if the circumstances allows it.",

It is a blessing to still be very comfortable with your spouse after years of staying together.

To others, they only realize the mistakes they have made choosing their spouse when they start living together as a couple.",

Â  Â  Â  If you have a good partner, then why not?What's a good partner? It's rare for a partner to satisfy all your needs, which is why I find this question to be very difficult to answer.I'm happy with my wife and I wouldn't divorce her now, but if I could go back in time with all my current knowledge and be 20 years younger, basically my current brain in my 20 year younger body, I might choose a completely different life. Not because I wouldn't want to be with her but I probably wouldn't want to be with any woman for at least 10 years. I wouldn't settle, wouldn't live in the house that I'm living now, I'd try something else.",

Are you worthy enough to be in God's work, whether in the second life, we will do activities like in the world. no one can answer it with certainty because we are in fact still alive not knowing what happens after death.Regarding reincarnation, how do we know that we are this second reborn human being. and how do we, to know the partner we have previously married. but one thing is for sure, we will never know anything after death picks us up. where we are, reincarnation, or in the second life later, judgment day, everything is a secret of the universe. what we know so far is based on the holy books, the fact is that no one has been able to prove it.",
