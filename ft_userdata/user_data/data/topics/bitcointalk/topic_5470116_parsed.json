Take the case of conversion of generators to LPG powered system, electric powered vehicles that is popular in Bornu state and even the cashless policy that succeeded mostly in the northern part of the country where people least expected. What is holding Bitcoin from booming more than it is Nigeria is government disenchantment. Many people are still scared that their accounts and businesses will be attacked by government if they do business in Bitcoin. The moment government gives a go ahead to Bitcoin, you will see it spread like fire in Nigeria. It will become a new trend and you know Nigeria like trends. I am optimistic that the future of Bitcoin in Nigeria is bright, the awareness is there... just the government political will and approval is remaining.",

If Bitcoin is finally legalized as legal tender, for sure there will be people who will accept it and there will also be others who will prefer fiats to Bitcoin, and you can't force them, as it it their business and they have the right to decide what medium of payment they feel suitable for them.QuoteAnd those business women will tell you straight to your face that they need fiat, some will tell you say them no go school. Those who prefer fiat, fiat should be given, while those who prefer to buy/sell with BTC, so should BTC be given to them, it's shouldn't be a force, since its everybody's right to choose a choice of payment. Moreover, if Bitcoin finally gets legalized, so will the knowledge about it spread rapidly also, and as such it's not a matter anyone should worry about for now, as I'm sure it will always be accompanied by favorable policies.Quotemost traders for naija don decide say anything associated with phone and transfer na scam. Even some pos point no dey accept transfer, talkless of bitcoin.You just can't blame these people for believing everything to be a scam, as the environment they found themselves thought them the hard way",

According to analysis of Nigeria illiteracy at least illetracy rate is now 31 percent at 2022 link ==> https://businessday.ng/news/article/nigerias-illiteracy-rate-is-now-31-says-fg/Quote from: Miles2006 on October 12, 2023, 07:18:22 PMI even remember last time wey our former president change the old currency and when I took the new naira note to the market, most traders rejected the money that the money looks fake and they will not accept the new naira note.[/li][/list]During the time of new Naira note adoption, I discovered that Nigerian marketers are very intelligent, and whatever they do, they do on porpose. And that made me come into conclusion that if Bitcoin is given a chance there will be mass adoption by the market people. One of the factor that affect marketers not to accept any new medium of exchange is scam. Market men and women are always tagged \"local market women and uneducated\" and people take advantage of there ignorance. Buy always defrauding them, which now made them skeptical about payment issue.Before anything spread across the country, market men and women will always be affected negatively. When the new Naira note was trending, scammers duplicated the new note and started making use of it in the market. before many people knew they were scammed of the hard earn money. In Mobile transfer many were given fake alert and so on. So this made many of them decide no to accept any online transactions.When there was naira scarcity, dey adopted online transactions,  making use of POS machines. almost all of them in the market. so I started asking myself, is this not local market woman & man that are accepting online payment? So I concluded that when there is no other alternative, people must learn to adapt to a new way of life. So I concluded that illitracy was not there problem but fear of scam. Even if it's illitracy, the chances might be %70 %30.So with this little knowledge of mine, I Believe if Bitcoin is legalized, there will be mass adoption in the market sector.",

      "body": "Most marketers will accept bitcoin once it is legalize in Nigeria. However there will be some challenges, I still believe that the market women that sells most of the food stuffs we in our local markets will not accept bitcoin because of their literacy level. I see bitcoin being accepted in big establishments and a more organized sector than the street retailing shops. A pure water seller in the street of port Harcout will not accept bitcoin because they don't have smart phones and they most of them don't know what bitcoin is all about. Once it is legalized, those people that will accept bitcoin will make it open for the public to know they accept bitcoin. For example when you go to filling station to get fuel, you will see something like ''we accept bitcoin or pay with bitcoin''. Then gradually it will spread with time.",

Government been friendly to Bitcoin adoption go make alot of companies begin open for the country and just as we get plenty microfinance banks dem na so we go get those wey dey associated with Bitcoin payment. This companies can be payment processors that make payments in Bitcoin easier, dem fit get their pos machine and share am to market women to dey use accept payment and the cards been shared with the same marketing technique wey Opay dey use. Nigerian dey very innovative so make you no worry about adoption as we go work out way to make am a household accepted payment method by all including market women.Quotebitcoin payment has no refunds, when the coin has been mistakenly transfer to another address then it is gone.How dis one carry concern market women, shey all dey will be doing is accepting the payment and it can be converted directly to their bank account from the payment processors. One thing you need to understand na say if Nigeria accept Bitcoin, just as centralized exchange dey lead the exchange business na so centralized payment processors go lead this side too. Na only few OGs go dey still use the decentralized way of transacting for Bitcoin. Payment processing companies go come out wey you fit pay with Bitcoin but then exchange am immediately to Naira for their platforms so this women dem fit dey withdraw go their banks. This kind thing already they happen with other countries as Bitcoin can be received and converted to US dollars like ASAP.",

The good thing I like about Nigerians is that we are easy to accept new innovations. It more of we accepting new trends than just innovations, but since you can categorize these innovations as trends, it further correlate them. The marketers will really buy into the Bitcoin technology if it is legalized as a legal tender and inasmuch as they don't experience perpetual failure in it, they could adopt it as their means of transaction.Quote from: Spaceman1000$ on October 12, 2023, 10:52:07 PMPeople way go dey interested in bitcoin, no be POS people oh, or road sided traders.

A lot of misunderstanding and misconceptions flying out there about the Cryptocurrency which has naturally reduced their believe system on it. The decentralized system is a simple but unpopular system of transactions which people will definitely love to adopt but need to get use to how it works.",

Already for Nigeria now there are people who accepts Bitcoin as means of payment, so the legalization of Bitcoin will only be more advantageous to them. Definitely it's a gradual process, people will gradually accept it, Nigerians are very dynamic especially when it has to do with business transactions, provided they will see the money in their account, it's a matter of time and they will adopt to any available means of payment.Some may initial want to reject but if it turns out they are loosing customers because of their refusal to accept that means of payment they will definitely start to learn the dynamic of thet method of payment and probably adopt it. It will also cream opportunities for others as their will be introduction of conversion platforms and they will possibly bring the education on how to accept that form of payment to everyone. The idea of it been a scam to some people will reduce when they see others accepting and it's working for them, they will just device a means against scammers to protect the market women and all other users. Conclusively, if Bitcoin is legalized it will only take a few time and it will be acceptable by almost everyone Once they know how well to receive money from the platform.",

To be sincere, how will say that out of the 100% that are in business today, only 70% that attend school didn't attend school, or do we think they can owning Bitcoin without having knowledge about it? Furthermore, Bitcoin has to do with smart phones for traders in the market, and some businesspeople lack experience with smart phones, they don't how to operate the smart phones, especially women's; they will openly admit that they prefer Fiat currency.",

Na all this king supermarket them, big businesses for city like hotels and bars nai maybe go dey accept btc.",

      "body": "Marketers will definitely accept Bitcoin if legalised.  It might take time, but they will have no choice than to accept it.  The only challenge will be illiteracy. We are all Nigerians and we know majority of Nigerians like free or cheap things. No Nigerian will hear about doing transactions with Bitcoin and still ignore it. Especially with all the benefits Bitcoin has?Similar thing happened during the cashless policy, many market women and business men were forced to accept transfers as a means of payment or use pos to do transactions. At that point,  that was their only option if they must make sales. If not, there were  many competitors out there who would accept any means of payment provided they make sales.  If you can't beat them, you join them. Same will apply to Bitcoin.  Just like almost every shop in Nigeria have a POS device, so shall it be if bitcoin comes to stay. It will only take time for it to gain dominance. All the people will need is to be educated on how it works.",

      "body": "OP, you should be specific with the kind of marketers that you are referring to, because if it is this petty traders that the total goods in their shop is around 5k-15k, I don't think that it will be wise for them to accept bitcoin because of the stress that they will pass through using it to refill their goods. This is because most of them buy their stuffs from the bush and also from illetrate like them that only believes in fiat. So such marketers will still be collecting fiat, even though bitcoin is legalized. Imagine that you want to buy Maggi or pepper or something of 500 naira and you want to use bitcoin, it is very funny.On the other hand if you are talking about big traders that has goods from 30k up, which are not petty traders, they will accept bitcoin with time,when they see that bitcoin is gaining ground in the country and people are saying all sorts of benefits in using bitcoin. Especially those marketers that deal on foreign goods, they will gladly embrace bitcoin because it has save them the stress of using a third party for payment and they can send bitcoin at their own convenience. So it all depends on the kind of marketers that we are talking about.",
