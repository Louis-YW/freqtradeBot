I just tested it on my computer, and .com came as the top result while .is I didn't find it in the top 5 pages of Google results.perfectmoney.com is right for sure you can use it safely. nothing strange if a stronger service uses more domains in order to prevent phishing and impersonation. Check Chipmixer and their problem with fake websites impersonating them.",
