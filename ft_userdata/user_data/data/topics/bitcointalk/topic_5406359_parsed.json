And after you buy Bitcoin, don't keep it on Coinbase but instead send it to your own non-custodial wallet like Electrum or if you can afford it, get hardware wallet which is even safer way to store your crypto.Regarding Discord and Telegram groups, be very careful when joining those as they are plagued with scammers and shillers.",

Because one, most of the altcoins have become shittier in the long run, and some of them are always on the brink of collapse when the market crashes leaving bitcoin the safest coin to invest especially for newbies alike.I can go on but I think you get my point.With regards to communities, this forum alone is enough.",

You're looking for groups that will suggest what to buy and I don't think they'll be discussing other coins there.I remember joining channels created by some crypto 'expert/guru' back in 2017 and members discussed a lot of stuffs that's happening in the market. I left the chat after they started shilling and debating about certain coins/tokens. It's what has become of most crypto groups today and it's unproductive to stay there.",

(most efficient mining is lot cheaper than current price and going to get a HECK OF ALOT cheaper.. be warned)if you are buying.. a price going down is not bad.. call it discount the lower it is the less you pay the more you get.however dont get too obsessed with trying to wait for the ultimate bottom. especially if prices are already in the good green region alreadyif you can work out that a coin has alot of wiggle room left where a recent LOW or mining cost is alot less then current price, meaning the price s in the orange zone. then yea wait it out you might get lucky.and yea if its in the red zone like if a coin is in a current high/new ATH dont buy..but if its in the green relax and be ok to buy in. knowing odds are in your favour, you just have to have patience",

When the market is dipping, that's a good time to buy, and you don't necessarily have to sell once it goes up, or a least, do not liquidate your entire stash.

My suggestion will be also that if you are gonna invest in this situation of cryptocurrencies market then bitcoin is the best solution for you. You can invest in it without any worries it will  gives you the best security. And I also advised you that refrain from investing in alt-coin in this situation. At present it is very risky to invest in alt-coins. But investing in top alt-coins like BNB, Ethereum will not be bad. But in my opinion Bitcoin will be the best for investment.",

Remember the bear market now. but if must buy, go for bitcoin and I preferably you used your personal money to buy it so that even you lose it will not affect you much.
