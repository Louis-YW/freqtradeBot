Solana flew under the radar for years, then rallied in this year.Does Solana price could reach an average of $60 in 2023        I don't really agree with your statement that Solana flew under the radar for years before it popped off. If you do a little research then you will see, that Solana was only tradeable for a few monts before it started to see a sharp increase in price and also in trading volume. Now it is among the top 10 crypto projects in terms of market cap which is quite a big achievement.Regarding your question if 60$ per SOL are possible in 2023 then i would definitely say \"yes\" that is definitely possible. At the moment SOL is trading at around 32$ and it's ATH from like 10 months ago was at 260$ so i don't see a reason why SOL should not reach 60$ if the crypto market recovers.",

But with what it has been through so far, all speculation needs to consider what we will gain and lose when investing in them. Each person will look at them differently. However, from my observations since seeing its appearance, I have always seen the dev's preference to develop the product and push it on different trends, some signals about the trends. The newly created direction will probably always be grasped and promoted by them in the general ecosystem of SOL, and basically, if you are ready to go, then choose for yourself a holding position with more advantages so the sole can go longer with it.",

So there are a lot of money needed to be like $60 in 2023. And we are definitely in the bear market still next year. My guestimate is that we are not going to get to that price next year, so it's better to expect the unexpected.And if you are a investor, maybe the best approach is to continue to accumulate as much as you can in the bear market. It's last all time high is $260.00. So chances are it can grow bigger than then in 2024-2025 bull run.",

For a 2-3 year investment, a $30 purchase price is good. It is better to buy cheaper from 20 to 25 dollars, but not the fact that such a price will be.The bull market may start after the Bitcoin halwig, and there is no hope for 2023, but this is just my opinion and not financial advice.I recommend buying different coins, Cosmos, Polkadot, Near, etc.",

I left it off before and didn't really care about it. Overall, the market is not very active right now and we can totally go through a long hibernation of the market before things start. real head, obvious development But it wouldn't be too difficult if it was inflated in some way and the value reached even higher levels, looking at the ATH of SOL I agree with many people that it will still bring opportunities. Trust is essential for capitalizing on the opportunity.",

New peak can only happen on a bull market though, so if there’s a bull trend in 2023 then most probably SOL will rise as well since it is considered as one of the best coin today. Just continue to monitor SOL, they have upcoming updates that can bring big changes to their platform, it’s good to get updated always, and hold with your target price as well since we can’t really know what will happen in the future.",

We're not even sure by 2023 we are in a bullish season making us see and expect that Solana will have another ATH. It was better not to expect that high. The current price of Solana is just $31, not that far possible to reach but yes, that only hypes will come. I may just say that reaching $60 in 2023 is impossible, I'd just consider the market condition. Maybe of their a sort of recovery next year, $40 is way possible.",

Solana flew under the radar for years, then rallied in this year.Does Solana price could reach an average of $60 in 2023        This question is similar to other questions where everybody asking about certain coins increases. Well, during the bearish era, the market is more unpredictable. However, in 2023, we still don't know the trend of the market, whether it is still in the bearish era or started in the bullish era. However, if we see the cycle of the trend, 2023 maybe still on bearish or still n this kind of situation. So, we are not sure enough whether Solana is able to reach $60 or not in 2023. If the market trend is getting better, this does not rule out the possibility that SOL can reach the $60 target because after all SOL is one of the top coins that does have pretty good fundamentals. Moreover, the current price of SOL is around $31. So do not rule it out. But again, no one can say for sure.And even if the price hasn't reached $31, it's best to just hold on to the coin, especially if you're still losing money in it.",
