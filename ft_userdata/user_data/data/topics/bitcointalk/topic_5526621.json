  "content": "Recent discussions have highlighted the challenges of handling crypto assets on CEXs after an account holder's death. While legal frameworks may evolve to address inheritance of crypto assets, this analysis focuses on proactive measures regarding personal crypto holdings. Given its enduring value potential, BTC is singled out as the primary asset for long-term investment.Michael Saylor's plan to secure his BTC after death, while intriguing, raises questions about practical implementation. The core idea is to ensure his BTC remains inaccessible, preserving its value as a testament to his contributions to BTC future. 2 viable approaches to achieve this are: self-destruct mechanism & concealment. One potential strategy to ensure that a specific amount of BTC remains permanently out of circulation is to \"burn\" it by sending it to an inaccessible account. This effectively removes those coins from the circulating supply, potentially increasing the value of the remaining BTC.Unlike Michael Saylor, I'm not a billionaire with a grand vision for BTC. I'm a normal worker, earning and saving in USDT. My strategy is simple: DCA into BTC with consistent USDT allocations. Profits are primarily used for essential family expenses, making it challenging to weather prolonged crypto winters. Even in a hypothetical scenario where I accumulate 1 BTC after 50 years of disciplined investing and its value appreciates to 10M USD, the sheer magnitude of that wealth would present significant financial and lifestyle management challenges.The decision of what to do with my BTC holdings is complex. While I initially considered passing them down to my children, I've come to realize that if they are truly capable, they won't need my wealth. Conversely, if they aren't capable, they might not be responsible stewards of such a significant asset.Given these considerations, I'm exploring alternative options. Philanthropy is an attractive path, allowing me to support causes I believe in. Alternatively, utilizing my BTC to fund extensive travel and experiences could be a fulfilling way to enjoy the fruits of my labor.I considered depositing 1 BTC or 10M USD into a bank's permanent savings account, assuming such a service will exist in 50 years. The interest generated could potentially provide for my grandchildren's basic needs, reflecting my deep love for them. Should they not require the funds, I envision them generously donating the interest to charitable causes supporting underprivileged students or patients.My long-term crypto investment strategy involves accumulating 1 BTC over the next 50 years, divided into 12 accumulation cycles. This translates to acquiring 0.083 BTC per cycle. While currently possessing only a fraction of this target, I remain optimistic about the crypto market's potential for sustained growth and recurring uptrend. These market cycles present valuable opportunities to generate profits and accelerate my BTC accumulation.I would like to know your opinion on this:Do you think crypto will become a part of personal finance in the future?What will you do with your crypto assets when you’re old?Besides BTC, which token do you believe in for the next 50 years? Michael Saylor’s plan to burn his Bitcoin after death – Following Satoshi’s steps?",

Like I know, people invest for future purposes and when the needs raises they would definitely pull off their investments to sustain their Life and something more helpful to them. Personally, if I have sufficiently enough at old age then I wouldn't mind willing it over to my children and of course Many of us who investing today are doing it for the sole purpose of future usage and willing it to my children is the best thing to do knowing they have come of age to be able to handle the amount of Bitcoin that would be in my procession.",

If you use your wealth to help them grow up strong, then your aim is achieved and you'll be safe by saying that they become capable, they don't need your wealth anymore.

If you deposit your Bitcoins to bank's account, they do not belong to you anymore. Also, you can't be sure that the company where you deposit your account, will exist in the next 50 years, so I wouldn't risk this. It's better to timelock your Bitcoins in your software wallet and make them available for withdrawal after 50 years.Quote from: Vincom on January 16, 2025, 10:06:12 AMBesides BTC, which token do you believe in for the next 50 years?I'd say that Ethereum is doing well and will probably do so in the future.
