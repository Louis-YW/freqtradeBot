      "body": "QuoteWill the cars be more efficient and at a good price compared to current prices, or is it a policy that may take decades?Obviously they will be far cheaper than the current market price. If they have planned legal action on the gas based cars then those companies will simply switch to manufacture the cars which are electric based. Thus it will flood the whole market with EV’s having good supply of them and lowering the prices eventually. There will be competition between the companies to manufacture the classic yet affordable cars which will be by far at good prices. However, the main question is whether EU’s vision will be followed by all the planet? I highly doubt because vehicle market is one of the biggest one and the oil/gasoline market is even bigger than that. Governments receive big load of taxations from the gasoline sell and car sells as well. Road taxes, service industry, car wash, water under control, authorities with testing labs and what not. They will get paid form every sector that concentrates on vehicle business. With EV there are already half of the stuff that will go off the market including trillion dollar oil business. EV will increase the demand of electricity and in turn it will increase the production by all means or increase the electricity costs everywhere. For this reason it’s thinkable whether this Change is really possible within next decade ??",

But still, many countries won't be able to adopt that quickly based on the situation that they've got for these EVs. IMO, hybrid would be the thing in the next decade and implementing and supplying fully EVs will really resort to another shortage and manufacturing problem.",

Probably.Overall? No. The batteries are expensive and their production is harmful for the environment. I don't think that most countries will even have proper battery disposal facilities by 2035.Even the charging of EV is a difficult problem, because it can drain the grid under safety levels. EV can have a proper future only after we (humans) invent much better ways of storing electricity for both EV, charging stations, regions (!!).Quote from: hugeblack on February 17, 2023, 11:13:56 AMSo, will this goal be achieved by the year 2035?

Perhaps some countries will succeed in achieving this goal, but these will still be exceptions in a world where oil will continue to rule much longer than 2035.I also think that the big oil producers will not just accept that their black gold becomes less valuable with the potential to become completely worthless in the future. In addition, the production of electric cars is quite expensive, and for those who do not know, the basic model of our great hero Mr. Mars costs (at least in my country) over 50 000 EUR (at least it was like that a few months ago). If you're wondering why it costs so much, it's probably because the owner has to pay all those poor people who work all day in the cobalt mines for $2 a day.",

The world with the EU in it has been far too reliant on petrol and diesel fuel vehicles for too long. From comments I’ve read on various places, I think there are still people that prefer petrol fueled cars and don’t like the idea of having electric vehicles for whatever reasons. From the article, I understood that the production of petrol and diesel used vehicles would stop by 2035. Also the law would be in phases. Perhaps that could be exploited by oil giants to stall the full implementation of the law. But surely, people would still be buying and using petrol fueled cars far beyond the year 2035.",

The sea contains it. Fine. But it still has to be produced, in short, extracted. And how do you accomplish this? Obviously your batteries could do the extracting; but if I'm not mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric equipment would be greater than the quantity you'd extract. It would come about, then, that in the process of producing your sodium, you'd use up more than you'd make!\"\"Accordingly, professor, I don't extract it with batteries; quite simply, I utilize the heat of coal from the earth.\"So you see, nothing has changed, even if you have an electric car as long as you don't power it with green electricity but with gas and coal you're back in the 19th century.Quote from: Lucius on February 17, 2023, 03:43:49 PMI also think that the big oil producers will not just accept that their black gold becomes less valuable with the potential to become completely worthless in the future. Some of them will just move to other ventures, as Aramco is already doing it, Shell has 90 000 charging stations already and plans 500 000, the world has learned how dangerous is to rely on energy imports and everyone wants it produced locally, and the ones that thought they could blackmail the world with it are in for one hell of a surprise.If somehow the EU manages to finally silence the hardcore eco groups, those that oppose everything, and go ahead with PSH systems to balance the grid, it can drive the prices of operating a EV car so much it won't matter to the initial difference in cost anymore. Plus, there is always the hydrogen fuel cell car, one that   Musk doesn't like!",

One thing that I hope the politicians and policy makers are taking into consideration is how much pollution is produced from things like the rare metals that batteries contain and that should definitely be factored into the pollution & ecological calculations. If in switching from oil to precious materials we end up releasing poison in a different form, it's a shallow way to act. In the long run electric vehicles should be much better for air quality in many ways, but maybe the next step is re-inventing the wheel - rubber leaves a big mess of it's own.",

The biggest challenge for a continent like Africa in moving away from fossil fuel cars is electricity. Electricity has always been an issue which does comes cheap.

The grid would not be able to handle that volume.If would take many more decades for the infrastructure to be build and for EV/battery technology to be perfected to actually be more efficient than traditional vehicles.
