Bitcoin may decrease and reach $17000, or it may not. But that should not be a problem if you have good strategies of investment.I think bitcoin may not decrease back to $15000 again, but bitcoin may decrease to $17000. That is a guess, I may not be right. But I am right that we should not fear but see it as unrealized loss that will turn to profit in long term.If bitcoin price decreases, just buy more and be happy that you buy at low price again.",

But if it does, it may go towards as low as $10k per BTC. Noting is certain. We may also see a bull run sooner than expected. The bull run will begin in 2024 as predicted. No one can say it for sure 100%. We have a long way to go still. One or two fall may occur. Remember, bear market is not a bad thing. It's an opportunity. So be sure to be ready to buy and fill your bags when the time is right. If not, try DCA.",

You are not going to get one answer from all community members. You will get tens/hundreds of different answers. Also how will we know how is right, are you just stating an absolute result that eventually bitcoin will or won't hit $17,000 again, or are you talking about a specific time frame?Either way, your thread is valueless. You should not be asking the community what to expect and you should expect volatility, because that is Bitcoin.",

We're into the important week as more things are to be announced and the same can have positive as well as negative impact over the market of Bitcoin.

Right now I'm just thinking and hoping about an improvement in Bitcoin and the correction you are seeing right now is a simple thing that has always been in the market. So please hope logically because now Bitcoin is starting to approach $22000 again with a very normal increase.",

It could go sideways when everybody is bullish. It could fall just when people are expecting that the market is already bullish. What exactly do you mean Bitcoin is dumping? The price remains above $21,000. Just a month ago, it was just at around $17,000. But what now if it falls back to $17,000?

That is why you are seeing btc acting weaker than the spx too, after the last week close. But if the US30 and spx keeps rising today after cpi data, btc will eventually find support somewhere here and start going up again. Quote from: yhiaali3 on February 14, 2023, 02:33:38 AMThe main reason seems to be due to pressure on Binance stablecoin BUSD by the SEC I don't consider this bad for bitcoin. Instead, such type of news are bullish for btc since any unusual effect on stablecoins will force ppl to get out of it and buy cryptos such as BTC for their own safety.",

Agreed   Bitcoin needs a correction when the price is Up you will always see a downturn or pullback it is necessary and retest to continue the run and it happen also when the price is down vice versa. So if you still have money DCA maybe is the best when it comes to correction like this #DYOR #DWYORI will share my chart since this was a speculation board This is Daily TimeFrame bitcoin retest at 200 EMA and should bounce back from there (at least that I hope   ) The Stochastic RSI also in oversold meaning there is chance to back to retest resistance area on $25K",

I will never understand how SEC think. So far Bitcoin is holding up to this news. Most will convert to Tether and move on. The problem is that BUSD is issued by Paxos in Ethereum blockchain.Recently, Binance decided to issue  BUSD in BNB and TRON blockchain without any Peg to actually BUSD from Paxos (creating money out of nowhere). They said that here in their website:Quotehttps://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/how-we-back-binancepeg-busd-and-explaining-historical-discrepancies-7761334533351669941Recent news reports have shone a light on Binance-Peg BUSD (“PBUSD”) and how it doesn’t always appear to have been completely backed by BUSD issued by Paxos. PBUSD is minted on several blockchain networks including BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, and TRONThen, you can read the same in SECs report:QuoteDFS has ordered Paxos to cease minting Paxos-issued BUSD as a result of several unresolved issues related to Paxos’ oversight of its relationship with Binance in regard to Paxos-issued BUSD. In response, on February 13, 2023, Paxos notified customers of its intent to end its relationship with Binance for BUSD.The Department is monitoring Paxos closely to verify that the company can facilitate redemptions in an orderly fashion subject to enhanced, risk-based, compliance protocols.It is important to note that the Department authorized Paxos to issue BUSD on the Ethereum blockchain. The Department has not authorized Binance-Peg BUSD on any blockchain, and Binance-Peg BUSD is not issued by Paxos. There is currently no restriction on the listing or exchange in New York of existing Paxos-issued BUSD by DFS-licensed entities. https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/alerts/Paxos_and_Binance",

I think USDT is considered a \"security\" if they were as business as Binance, the difference is that USDT is not a company based out of USA, but binance.us is, and they are owned by Binance, and they control the whole of BUSD, not the same thing.Obviously still terrible that they could make it like that, and I think they are basically saying \"if we can't control you, we will punish you\" and nothing more, and CZ knows this and will move towards more VPN side and not really care about what they say, because freedom to do whatever you want instead of doing what government wants will be a better profit maker for them. This is why they do not look worried about this at all.",

Moreover what if also Bitcoins falls back to 17k usd? You will panic sell now? Dude Bitcoins are limited in number and rarest coins. So hold as many as possible as you can. In the future when the demand will be high, sell these in sky rocket price. And at last don’t take too much worries about these mini pumps and dumps. These are only done by the big whales to manipulate the market and making the most profits from it.",
