  "content": "Hello,I came across this thread by @edgycorner https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401642.0 where he was complaining he got negative feedback for supporting a flag. The story ended him being removing his support for the flag and the negative feedback was removed.As an example, I myself fell a victim to a scam of one of gambling websites promoted by this forum (fortunejack.com), and got negative feedback for speaking up. I then created a flag and saw there were few people supporting it, so I created a giveaway of 10 mBTC to either support/oppose the flag (right here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399713.0), and got yet another negative feedback for that too! Is this how this feedback is supposed to work? Just asking.Easy guys, I know some angry casino promoters (some scams, some not scams, more or less) will come here throw in their messages right and left and start meriting each other on their messages, but I'm just asking a question right.",

      "body": "Your case and his case are completely different, do you demanding DT members to remove their negative trust in your account? No, they're correct. Negative feedback are used to user who high likely want to scam anyone or can't be trusted. The thing is Fortunejack already explained the case and why they seized your money, because you're breaking their rules [1] but you didn't accept that and start act like a victim, while you're not the victim. Any users before using any services should read their TOS and if you failed to do that, you're wrong and Fortunejack is the victim since you're attacking due to your anger.Another more, you're offering money to support your flag, that's abusing the forum system [2][1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5368279.msg58318691#msg58318691[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399713.0",

You do not have to offer money for support, just be transparent about what you are saying, if worthy enough to attend too, people will support you if there is a clear evidence.",

I am sure that you know that the flag was because of the money offered in that so-called giveaway, not because of speaking up.Then is the problem with that giveaway of yours: I've seen it, I've interpreted it like you see everything like gambling, even the trust somebody deserves (and this is pretty much wrong).From the feedback you've got, I see it was interpreted also that with your prizes you may have tried to get people support your flag (to get good money, not cursed one, lol). And this is (much) worse.There is a saying (maybe not in English, but I'll translate) \"If two different people tell you that you're drunk, you better go to sleep\".I understand that you may be frustrated, but it's not the entire forum bought up by casinos, no. You should start looking again to the presented facts and the conclusions and see that something is wrong with what you're doing or how you do that.",

Pay to people just to react to his flag, opposers got paid in cursed coin, lol. At least, you have to give him the credit for trying to make a scene. But I think trying to influence people just for them to go to cast their vote or react to a flag in this case, can this still be counted as shifting votes to his side? Since it makes people feel in debt to him, more likely to side with him on the matter? Or maybe just a vicious way for him to get back by making the negative feedback/flag system looks like a joke.He does make me want to know the matter between him and Fortunejack. How it could escalate to the point he did things like this.",

I have always kept blind eyes at your posts or allegations because majority of the users here, especially DT1 members do not agree with you.But I am obliged to ask the following questions;1. You created a flag and offered an incentive for whoever opposes or supports the flag. I don't think this is wrong. I have seen companies pay for review. This is because many people might read your flag and feel uninterested or unconcerned because they are not directly affected. The incentive will be to encourage participation on a neutral ground. I am responding accordingly to your statement QuoteDon't be sensitive, in some way, if I might say it like this, I don't care even if 100% oppose it. So go ahead and make a ruling, I just want closure with this forum.As a gesture of good will and to demonstrate that I really care, and not trolling, for all participants who either oppose or support the flag, I will be giving away 10mBTC (~300$ as of today) on the 1st of June to 10 members who either supported or opposed the flag. You have the same probability of winning whether you opposed or supported.You should only be tagged if you refuse to pay anyone that opposed your flag. Then it will be a clear indication if trust buying.
