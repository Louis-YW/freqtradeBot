On its own, it can't create or amend laws, craft policies, and implement them. Can AI buy Bitcoin? Of course, yeah, but provided it's instructed to. Otherwise, AI won't do anything. It doesn't have freewill. It doesn't act on its own volition. It functions according to the instruction of humans. AI is at human beings' disposal. If you set that it will buy Bitcoin if the price touches $95,000, then it will do it provided your wallet has a balance to perform such action. Otherwise, it will fail. Surely, however, AI won't just spend your money buying Bitcoin because it thinks saving in it is better than saving in fiat.",

Idk at the rate technology is progressing in 20 or 30 years time who knows where this path leads lol",

Do they let \"AI\" decide everything they do, or do they use it like trading bots that they've used for years? I'm skeptical that a big company ditch everything and rely on \"AI\" to make profits. Just take a look at how the YouTube algorithm is fucked up nowadays because they keep using a \"black box\" without human input and flag educational content as harmful. After all, the content is sensitive. It feels like they're trying not to lose sponsor instead of moderating their platform. I doubt a trading or investment company would do the same. CMIIW.",

What happens if AI sees BTC as better than fiat?Sorry to say this but this is rather a foolish or childish question to ask, Ai as we know are completely dependent on humans, and also will they continue to be dependent on humans for as long as they continue to exist as Ai, what this means is that they can not make or take any decision on their own without human interference or interaction, they cannot trade or invest in any asset without taking instructions and setups from human.So in essence, Ai will only buy bitcoin when it's been instructed and programmed by a humans to do so, Ai can only predict the market based on how it is trained, but can't make any formal trading or investing.",

The real question is \"When will AI start doing this?\". I'm sure that AI trading bots will become a thing in the next months or years. The current AI models are not self-aware right now, but super-AI will become self-aware in the near future.Bitcoin is not a safe asset. Bitcoin is a risky and volatile asset, which can bring higher profits to speculative investors. The AI trading bots could invest in BTC and add it to aggressive and dynamic investment portfolios.I don't think that AI is going to compare BTC to fiat. Bitcoin is a deflationary financial asset, while fiat currencies are inflationary by design.",

AI can learn and store information these days though that does not mean it's flawless. People often misconceive that AI is some super intelligence that is able to do everything perfectly, however it's not a super intelligence, it's an artificial one. That aside, automation has been around for a long time, AI has been working and developing at a exponential rate in the last two years, AI agents and operators that can learn and perform things like trading on their own is not as crazy of a phenomena as it sounds. Though again, whether it does a good job or not, or if you want to trust AI with your capital, are two different stories.If you can't believe it, go and see it. Just search \"Ai agents that can trade\". There are projects that have these functions working live. I listed two in my post and there are many others.
