Why do you say that?  I was thinking of funding a couple the other day, so this is kind of funny.  I don't see how it could hurt the value.",

Well that's interesting.  Ngl it kind of makes me want to fund it now with a low denom of like 001 lol.  I'm sure it's safe to use as a wallet.  I find it hard to believe no one has ever funded one.",

Knowing a bit about the code used to create those (they were later than these actually, but probably still the same process afaik, I know the privkeys were always destroyed in the vanitygen process part of the code (in memory and on disk)  .. I'd feel plenty safe loading one myself, but just never saw another user sell one that was loaded ... Maybe someone else does recall a loaded one, IDK... But yeah, they are awesome artworks/wallets either way.",
