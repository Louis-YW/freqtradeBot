I have been on social media many years before I joined this forum, but this forum helped me more than anything, I still remember many scam I wanted to fall for that lack of money did not let me fall for at that time. This forum educated me, I want to help newbies on this forum, I made research and I learn and know more while I also know more from what established posters are posting. In short, this forum is far better than those social media if it is about knowing about how to protect oneself from scam and hack and some other things. I better be on this forum that staying on most social media.",

You have now received some of the best advice from anyone here or in this forum. Obviously the advice they give is very helpful and useful for you as a newbie here. But there are other things that are also very important for you to apply within yourself now. It is consistent and focused when studying and don't get bored easily or feel frustrated when you haven't gotten any results from your own efforts or after you have learned a lot of things here. Because there are many newbies who start to surrender to their own conditions when they haven't gotten anything in this forum.
