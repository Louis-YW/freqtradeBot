  "content": "I hope you all are having a wonderful weekend!So I recently came across a post where people are engaged in a lengthy debate over whether CEX (Centralized Exchange) or DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is better. So I decided to wrote down this. Frankly, I believe it's a matter we shouldn't dwell on too much because both have their advantages and disadvantages.For CEX:Security is reliable if you choose the right exchange.Transaction fees are reasonable.It's user-friendly for trading.You're less susceptible to phishing scams, especially when using a secure wallet.Various earning opportunities are available.Let's consider two exchanges I'm familiar with as examples:For Binance: Despite suffering a massive $570 million hack, Binance remains one of the largest exchanges and not just that, they still keep their standards high. You can find more details in this link: https://www.investopedia.com/binance-got-hacked-6748215Now, Bitget: While Bitget hasn't experienced a direct exchange hack, although there was an incident that occurred with their wallet due to a link shared in a group that led to users' accounts being compromised, I won't really call this hack per se but a lesson to everyone. We all need to be careful of links sent suspiciously in any group you're in because you don't know what you will be clicking that will lead to total wipe pf your assets both in crypto and off crypto You can also read about it here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/ambcrypto.com/bitget-becomes-the-latest-victim-to-a-defi-exploit-as-bitkeep-loses-more-than/amp/I use Bitget more often because I've delved into their security standards and believe they're doing well. However, I still use Binance, as it was the first CEX I encountered on my crypto journey.Now, let's talk about DEX:I won't say DEX is bad; it has its merits. Everything is decentralized, as the name suggests. I've used Uniswap and continue to do so. However, it's essential to note that DEX can also undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, as evidenced by this tweet about Uniswap: https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1713291249560535051?t=lyzx4IAlZNiG9Llt4g-Tqg&s=19Furthermore, DEX can be vulnerable to hacking. Consider Mixin, for example.What I'm trying to convey is that these debates about CEX vs. DEX should consider that both can coexist and work well if we find the right balance.Even if I said ok, I want to go offline to be safer. The truth is, Im not sure I can be 100% safe offline either. I was researching offline wallets on Amazon and watching YouTube reviews for recommendations. At some point, I got discouraged because even some offline wallets can be hacked. But that won't stop me from using an offline wallet. Is just picking the best that I know that would be best for me. Just as picking the best exchanges among cex and Dex. As I've said before, our security largely rests in our own hands. Before an exchange collapses, there are usually rumors. When those rumors start, it's essential to withdraw your funds promptly. Take FTX as an example; Sam Bankman Fried's actions had a significant impact on the exchange. If you've been following his legal case, you'll see that he meticulously planned it out with no remorse, unlike other exchanges that experienced hacks and returned stronger with enhanced security.",

Same goes to the other. In fact, the latter exchange operates in most regions where Binance don't and they're really doing well with all they know. We all know how the FTX problem started. Some people brought it to the notice of many on twitter before the crash. So we can't compare Binance with FTXIf you say Dex gives you the key. That's true, but how much control can dex do for any incoming hack? Could it be traced? If so, why then is Uniswap trying to get KYCed",

That said, right now I'm really trying to do as much as I can on-chain and trying to minimize having balance in a CEX as much as possible. For basics like swaps and margin spot trades, I often go on-chain. The user experience is good, and there's plenty of liquidity. Most times, I don't have any problems doing spot trading this way.But there's one big thing missing: orderbook trading. I don't think any blockchain has gotten it just right for an on-chain orderbook. I'm not even sure if it's possible to make a system where everything—from placing orders to matching and settling—is done on-chain. Even on fast chains like Solana, things can get tricky when there's a lot going on. For example, trying to buy during a big price move can be tough if you're not using a bot. I hope there's a way to fix this in the future. I'm curious to see how a dedicated chain, built specifically for orderbook trading, would fare. The upcoming DYDX v4 with its own chain might give us a good indication. If that doesn't pan out, it seems we might lean more towards methods like GMX's AMM/pool or the hybrid on-chain/off-chain approach that DYDX currently employs.",

As of now, both CEX and DEX are doing good business so this is just a matter of choice and convenience.

Then what I often do is make sure like assessing low fees and not charging KYC fees.The ongoing dispute about CEX and DEX usually arises from insiders themselves to ensure users have a choice.

That alone should provide enough proof that people prefer that but if that's not enough then we could look at the hacked stuff, sure centralized places got hacked before there is no doubt about that but they are owned by people so you either get your money or they go to jail, so there is a response to it, whereas if it is a decentralized place with a malfunctioning code, they are going to get hacked too and there is nothing to be done.

The difference would be how the exchanges tackle said attack so as to avoid losing their users. CEX probably has a lot more choices and actions available since they have more users, leading to more initial profit which lets them have ample funds to tackle said problem. Well in the end said problem isn't really a problem if you stop using hot wallets from exchanges.In the end, it boils down to your preference as others have said. I like to simplify it with CEX being comfortable and easy to use without having to understand much, while DEX allows you to secure your tokens personally but is harder to begin with due to having to learn and understand a bunch of other stuff(if you're new).",

Although you could still access them through other means it set a bad precedent. Now we are hearing about KYC only liquidity pools which is an even worse idea.
