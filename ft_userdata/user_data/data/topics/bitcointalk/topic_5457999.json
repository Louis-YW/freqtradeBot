  "content": "It has been reiterated several times on this forum and other crypto related platforms that stolen bitcoin cannot be recovered once it’s stolen or sent to the wrong address until the recipient sends it back themselves when contacted. Beginners should be aware that if you got scammed from Bitcoin is long lost since it’s untraceable. Bitcoin is nothing but a digital currency and the keys are the safety of it and if you lose those keys you can’t get them back. But if you got scammed from your Bitcoin you would be ask to contact your main provider of your wallet where they’re kept and got hacked from. If you’re lucky you’ll get them back, otherwise they’re lost forever.According to information coming from Adapt System Tech, an agency portrayed to be able to recover compromised wallets, wallet issues etc. They require you to provide personal information for the recovery process. They require you to provide money if you’re interested in recovering your Bitcoin back. They make it look like you’re dealing with a real agencies and not some frauds. Don’t be in haste to give them their demands, this is a red flag website that looks so real in their organization and how well they built their website. Newbies should be wary and not to fall in such hands.Link to the website below:Code:https://adaptsystem.tech/",

That alone is already a sign that the platform is a scam. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, so it is highly unlikely that the funds can be recovered unless the recipient willingly returns the bitcoin to the sending address, which is unlikely to happen. Awareness is crucial, and with proper knowledge, it becomes easier to identify scam websites or platforms.If they were truly legitimate, they might not require upfront payment. Instead, they could charge a certain percentage as a fee based on the amount they are able to recover. That would be a win-win situation for the clients.",

I pity for those desperate ones who have no idea on what to do when they are in such situations. They fall easily and become the victims of this nefarious act perpetrated  by these scammers.On a normal, everyone should know that  wallets are a private property and anyone opening a wallet should be able to hold his/her private keys and not give it out to a third party otherwise they stand a chance if being scammed of their resources.On no account should anybody be fooled by any s called website claiming to be able to recover lost wallets and asking you to pay for their services. Do not deal with them as they are scammers. Only you have access to your wallet as you alone have the private keys to It. Do not disclose your keys to anybody.Stay safe and protect your assets!",

      "body": "Just like what mirakal said, the pseudo-anonymous nature of bitcoin makes it very hard for any confirmed transaction to be reversed. The only way is when the hacker is smart enough and leave a trace, like transferring the funds to centralized exchanges. At this stage if the amount is somewhat too big and the authorities connive with this exchange then they would be able to expose the identity of the hacker. But this would cause a lot of money and even this is not guaranteed. So all this site are just scam. OP i would advise you put those kind of links in code format like this so that they are not clickable  and so that it is not regarded as someone spreading malware links on the forum (which are mostly what this kind of sites are]. Here is an example Code: https://adaptsystem.tech/",

That is true because bitcoin is decentralized. People should avoid scammers and hackers and only send bitcoin to the correct addresses. If bitcoin is sent to a wrong address, that will likely be the end and the person will not be able to get the coin back.

If they believe those recovery service sites and they send them money, they are only scammed again and nothing will be done. The only people that can be helpful are the chain analytics companies like Chainanlysis which are well known. But you will pay them large amount of money, which means that it is good if the person lost huge amount of money.",

They provide different features like the following ones and i am quite amazed and confused about how they will bring the lost money from exchanges and ICOs. This really hits me, other than any personal information, i just checked that they are asking for email, fraud company name and amount, etc. How can their results be so accurate in there stats while the risk in this work is like high for getting failure as result. The thing is this website is just a small phishing site from the big pile.Quote from: Adams0001 on June 29, 2023, 12:38:02 PMthis is a red flag website that looks so real in their organization and how well they built their website.

The point is that logo was not a professional one. Second, i found text misplacement in their about section, i did not go anywhere else after pointing out the text mistake so maybe there would be other mistakes too. .I understand your concerns about newbies safety from these websites but I think most of the newbies who lost there money do realize that if they are using decentralized platform then there is no back way for that money and if the platform is centralized then there are slight chances for money I come back just like in FTX exchange scam. But still, I did not get the idea of bringing this website in front of our eyes? Is there any specific reason.",

It has been said many times that cryptocurrency cannot be recovered when stolen on this forum, but many other people who are not on this forum, do not know this and they will continue to be victims.

Perhaps if I had joined this forum when I started my crypto journey, I wouldn't have made the numerous mistakes I made. Back in 2021, I invested in an ICO that turn out to be a scam but someone made a post that he could help any willing investor get back his funds. He called himself a crypto syndicate and part of their job was to help people that are scammed get back their money as a way of sanitizing the crypto space and instilling confidence in people. Well, as the saying goes \" He that is down need fear no fall\"; so I sent my details and he went into work. To my greatest surprise, he recovered my funds and those of few others that reached out to him. I wouldn't want to believe that he was part of the team as many would already be suspecting; I really want to believe that there are still a lot of decent guys in the crypto space who will go do there best to portray crypto in a good image.",
