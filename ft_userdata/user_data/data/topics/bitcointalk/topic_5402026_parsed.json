That's what you can notice on all websites using Jambler (IICRC). It's come from the default \"template\" provided (IIRC too) It is not necessarily a red flag, here we can say that it is a lack of creativity to differentiate from others.The site is new but people have to start somewhere otherwise nothing will happen.

I really don't get this: the mixing industry is very profitable and charging 5% is very expensive compared to the competition. That should be more than enough to start a honest business, and yet, most of the new mixers make it so obvious they're not honest and look like they'll exit scam the moment the opportunity presents itself.",
