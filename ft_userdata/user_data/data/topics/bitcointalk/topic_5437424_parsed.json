Every people will trying to get 1 satoshi since it's already expensive enough, we might trade for Millisatoshi or Nanosatoshi in that's year.But at 2044 the block reward are only 0.1 BTC which I think majority of people already own such amount and I think 20 years to go everyone are still alive. There's will a big change and the price would be extremely expensive.",

Just note, the next halving will be at a block height of 840,000 (for sure). Indeed, there are no exact dates, everything that is spread on the internet is just estimates by calculating the average blocks generated. Given the varying time it takes to mine 1 block, even as network congestion increases it will result in 2 to 3 times longer than the normal time.",

The average block time depends on the ratio of total hash power to difficulty. As the total hash power decreases, the average block time increases and as the total hash power increases, the average block time decreases. Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty is adjusted to maintain the average block time of 10 minutes.",

As for those you call \"non-believers\", it's completely stupid to think about what they think, and as far as I'm concerned, they can all live in their beliefs for the rest of their lives, that's definitely their right.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 31, 2023, 01:26:14 PM..some hit a BTC block on a pool weeks ago with roughly 12TB of mining hash rate, this block consists of 6.25 BTC, I believe this persons is now rich if they can just hold till the next bull season. It's crazy how some people are so lucky in this world lol. It is not the first time in the recent past that someone has found a block with solo mining, but depending on where such a person lives, it may or may not be a fortune.",
