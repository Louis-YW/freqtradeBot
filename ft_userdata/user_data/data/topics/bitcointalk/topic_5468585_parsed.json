Are you a licensed exchange and where are you from? Because I rarely see a platform that allows less than 100K USDT without knowing the user details, not even the name and personal data, without attaching documents.According to ---> https://easybit.com/en/terms A list of banned countries was mentioned, so how will you deal with them in lv1 and does this mean that using a VPN is prohibited?Quote from: robelneo on September 29, 2023, 11:05:19 PMChecking the internet for any scam report so far there is none The good thing is that all the links they added are correct, so I think I will trust them for up to $200.",

What you mean is bought existing domain name, usually via auction since the domain is registered many years ago.Yes, that's what I mean coming from an auction or in the marketplace, and this is not cheap, a.com can be bought from $7 to $12 if you register it but this is a 24-year-old domain so it's a high-valued domain.Come to think of it, will you have an idea what the site is all about by just the word Easybit, no not all it used to be an Italian site Webmaster purchases old domain for faster indexing and to avoid Google sandboxing for new sites QuoteIn many cases, it makes sense to buy an aged domain as it can help you grow your site faster than starting from a brand-new domain.However, an aged domain is not guaranteed to rank highly in Google when you relaunch the site. QuoteThere is the potential to avoid the ”sandbox” period that Google and other search engines force new sites to go through.https://emilyandblair.com/steps/aged-domain-vs-new-domain/I will not say it's a good move for the current domain owner it still depends on how he does SEO it's an equal playing field for new and old domains now.",
