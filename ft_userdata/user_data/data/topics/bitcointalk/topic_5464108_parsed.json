Now, I can't help but wonder what's behind this decision. Is he eyeing a flashy new car or some real estate perhaps? Or maybe, just maybe, he's got some heartwarming plans, like supporting charitable initiatives in Ukraine or Hawaii.

It's not that unusual that people need fiat money for investing and spending, especially in current economic athmosphere.It's been said that Buterin has been depositing and selling his ETH for quite a time now.

He has been donating a lot so this could be another attempt at charity.

But whatever it is, I am pretty sure He will get benefited from it.And I think one of the reason of why He do it is that Vitalik probably planing to stake that amount while holding it, especially He could be preparing for the bull run season coming as well in 2024, that is very much possible for sure.",
