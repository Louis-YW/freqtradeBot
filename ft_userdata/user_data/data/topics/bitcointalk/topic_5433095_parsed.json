  "content": "My previous post \"Use your money wisely. Invest or deposit ?\" is a very hot topic which receives over 3000 views and more than 240 replies. I read all of your replies and summarize to one common advice: invest in Bitcoin rather than deposit in banks. To be frank, I totally agree and believe this is a great option (of course not put all eggs in one basket). The question is that most people say that 3% of deposit interest rate is nothing compared to inflation rate so deposit would be the last option if they had that amount of money. Well, in real life, I think 3% is quite good enough for deposit only if your other passive income combined is more than your expenses. Please let me explain. Your passive income is $1000 per month, and your salary is $1500/month. Passive income comes from the rental of the house your parents gave you or left you. Salary is from your regular and stable job. Your monthly expenses come to $1000 to $1500. The annual interest from the $100,000 is $3000, which means $250 per month. The rental income plus the interst sums to $1250/month and this money can cover your monthly expenses. In this situation, why don't you deposit that amount of money and feel no worries about your finances ? See, your passive income here can pretty much offset the inflation but that 3% is actually a compound interest rate which brings you more money every year. Plus, your salary of $1500/month, can also be saved in your bank account to earn more money. You know my point here ? I am trying to implement this deposit thing in real situation and find a possibility to benefit from.",

After you deduct your expenses, however much fiat you are left with you should invest in something that can be considered a store of value while trying to diversify as much as you can.In my opinion it doesn't matter how much your income is and how much interest rate your bank gives you, you still need to invest your fiat into something better.Bitcoin, gold and real estate are the best choices in my experience. Things like stocks depend a lot on the economy and could crash hard while the risk of the same scenario is lower in those 3 markets I mentioned (it is not zero though).",

You can get 5% that way.Sure you will keep at pace with inflation but keep in mind that inflation most likely peaked and might even deflate if we hit a recession.

But you'll also come into many realization that depositing or having your money parked in a savings account, you won't be satisfied with the result of it even if it's a compounding interest.

Despite being 13 years old, bitcoin is still a super risky speculative asset, no one can predict what will happen to bitcoin in the future. All of our predictions are optimistic because we are investing in BTC, but that doesn't mean they will come true. I wonder, people who invest in bitcoin for $69k, how are they fighting inflation?

The problem is that you have no guarantee that interest alone can offset inflation, right now with annual inflation of 10% you would need 3 years of interest and zero inflation for the next two years, so, it doesn't really work that easily! Besides, if keeping money in your bank would always generate enough income to offset inflation by now nobody would have a problem with money, no need to wait 1000 years like in Futurama!Quote from: Marcellin9 on January 06, 2023, 03:25:37 AMYou are right about 3% interest rate from deposit is nothing compared to some nations with insanely 30% infation rate but in my country, the inflation rate is only round 5% so it's still acceptable. And with 5% being bigger than 3%, you're not having a steady passive income, you're losing money as inflation bites on your capital!",
