  "content": "Following the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Russians seem to be gaming momentum as Severodonetsk, a key Eastern city of Ukraine is seen to be split in half. This is coming after the same Russians set a blockade on the Ukrainian Black Sea, preventing free passage of corn and wheat. It would mean no stopping for Putin as he goes all out by brandishing big artillery bombardments as plans are in motion to lay claim to Donbas.As is expected of every war, there are casualties on both fronts and President Zelensky records that there are at least 50 to 100 soldiers dying daily. He has come to a conclusion that a tactical retreat is needed to help recuperate for the next batch of supplies expected from the West. https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61629260",
