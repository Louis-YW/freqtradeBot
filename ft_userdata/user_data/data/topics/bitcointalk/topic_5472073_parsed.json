So it seems we have two options so far - polygon wallet and MetMask wallet using which we can connect and start playing immediately. Now that is the beauty of decentralized casino. I am not sure from which country you have got the license to run the casino because that can affect the business in the future if revenue and total transaction are rising continuously. They gonna knock the door for sure. From what I see, you have launched a few games right now. There is a section that shows a countdown timer with \"coming soon\" games and slots. Most of the support is from Discord and Telegram, well seems quick and easy. As expected KYC is not there, I hope it remains the same no matter what consider you stay as \"decentralized\" economy all the time.Â  Good luck guys.",

Indeed, we encourage the use of Metamask with a dedicated wallet, but with Wallet Connect, players can also use other wallets. We are registered in Costa Rica. There are already some slots and dice games available, but indeed, other games are announced very soon, as shown by the countdown on our site.We are committed to staying in a decentralized economy because we are very attached to it. This is part of our fundamental values, and we will continue to operate respecting these principles to offer the best possible experience to our players while respecting their autonomy and privacy.

I donâ€™t fully agree with your statements around the VIP system. A lot of casinos have a similar house edge as you and they do offer one so not having one is a disadvantage.

But I really understand your point of having low house edge is much better compared to rakeback since the effect is instant per bet.Itâ€™s just gambler want something bonus that can be seen since most of the casino which in competition to you offer a very lucrative rewards aside from offering low house edge games on their house game.",
