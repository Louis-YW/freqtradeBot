  "content": "To my Continental South American Bitcoiners!I’ve done deals and goodwill all around the world concerning Bitcoin collectibles.  Curiously, I wondered how many continents this involved.  Surprisingly, excluding Antarctica (have some ideas, more about this later), the only one remaining is South America, but this will no longer be the case after this raffle.  Winner will receive items as pictured- One, 1oz Silver, 24kt Gold Plated \"Bitcoin\" Binary Round and One, Alpen Coin Custom Funded coin, #C009 (This series is prefixed with C and all were factory funded with 0.0001BTC)- https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/19AXTTn86TYyofMpNUthwK8Uibsurn7Hux  Free USPS international priority mail shipping or private shipping, depending on which is applicable.  Continental South American addresses only for raffle entry.  Also, must be a Copper Member, Jr. Member, or higher member for entry.  Please no alts that will result in multiple entries.  In return, I ask that you consider +Meriting the OP if you believe these types of raffles benefit the community and/or if you would like to show your appreciation.Pics:  How this will work:Pick a table and a slot.  I will select a block and last character will select the table.  If last character doesn't result in a table selection, then block(s) will be selected until so.  Once table has been determined, I will select another block and the last character will determine the winner.  Buena Suerte/Boa Sorte!Table 6:0 -  bitmover1 -  tg882 -  3 -  dgcarlosleon  4 -  famososMuertos5 -  6 -  TryNinja7 -  Artemis38 -  JakobFugger9 -  bavicryptoa -  b -  rdluffy  c -  sabotag3xd -  alegotardoe -  darxiaomif -  willi9974 Table 8:0 -  sabotag3x   1 -  JakobFugger2 -  TryNinja3 -  rdluffy4 -  Artemis35 -  bavicrypto6 -  willi99747 -  darxiaomi8 -  tg889 -  dgcarlosleon a -  b -  c -  bitmoverd -  famososMuertose -  alegotardof -",
