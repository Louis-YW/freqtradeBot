Only thing I can only pay via any giftcards amazon or paypal.You don't need a trusted seller to accept PayPal, you would need to be a trusted buyer for someone to be willing to accept your PayPal.  Good luck with that.  Not to mention, only a complete neophyte or a potential scammer would still be using PayPal to buy crypto in this day and age.  You've been around long enough that I don't think you're a complete neophyte, so why are you still using PayPal when there are far more practical and trustworthy payment providers?",
