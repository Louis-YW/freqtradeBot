I don't know if it is because I recently watched several videos of streamers gambling or it's just a coincidence, I've watched streamers gambling videos in the past but I have never gotten this many gambling ads.",

The YouTubers, especially the comedians are getting money from the gambling sites and also using their promo code to advertise to get more money, they see it as a lucrative means to make money as the gambling sites are playing well many of them.Many kids and teenagers are exposed to gambling this way.",

But I do get this a lot of time on Facebook videos but most of those are not the algo type but more of sponsored videos that they put it at the end of their videos.If you're using Google Chrome which is another counterpart company of YouTube then that's it, the algo ticks on your browsing and watching activity.",

Just to add, even random YouTube content creators advertise their own local casino and integrate it at the end of their videos. I remember I was watching this creator on YouTube where he regularly posts prank videos which are funny as hell. But at the end of his every video, he was advertising this online gambling casino in which I believe is that he is a part of the admins on such website. It really destroys the whole image on how he created himself as this \"funny guy\" then suddenly he is now sharing ads of gambling platforms.The funny thing is, after seeing his advertisements, the YouTube video ends with an ad which advertises another online gambling mobile application. It is just ridiculous at this point to see everything related to gambling.",

In recent days this has got decreased as our state have banned gambling platforms. Most of the times ads pop based on what we are watching and based on the area in which we've made more searches. Once we start reporting as inappropriate or repetitive, we can avoid getting those video ads.",

But I have been using gambling sites for a while now and the number of gambling ads shown to me was never as high as it is now. Do you receive ads from casinos you know or are those casinos unknown to you in some cases? I don't know many of the casinos that I receive ads from. It is also surprising because I thought that at some point Youtube decided to cut down or even shut down completely any gambling related ads or am I wrong?",

I don't think I've ever had them on my phone though. Granted that I've never really accessed casinos in my phone. Afaik though ads should be a representative of the stuff you watch in YouTube itself, I mostly watch gacha videos way back when I wasn't using adblocker, so most of my ads were about those. If you regularly use adblocker though and would sometimes not use them e.g. on a different pc, then afaik it should be general ads catered to your country.",
