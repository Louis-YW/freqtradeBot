No.  You simply need to read about market cap.  For shib to get to $1 each it would end up putting the market cap in the trillions at the cost of all the money in the world.  Simply put it IS VERY impossible for shib to get to $1. Don't equate doge and shib together they have very different supply numbers which controls the price ceiling.",

It will take tons of money to move Shiba to $1.00.Look at the current price, = $.0.00001205, so that will be like the whole of crypto right now to put in to $1.00.So the question is where to get that money right now and is the investors willing even in the bull run? or will divest their investment to let's say BTC and other altcoin? And there is also the high risk involved, maybe before we can reach $1.00 there will be a massive sell-off.",

You will be seeing shiba inu will able to worth $1. It's a bad project to invest right now. What you have been writing above was totally non sense prediction. Did you expect shiba to go to the $1? lol why don't you pump it with your money to make it happen?   Even people with common sense can think about that easily. think about that use your sense.",

It is a meme coin, not to be taken very seriously. I do not hodl any of them, but I do hodl some Doge. I will be honest when I say I only stacked some of them because of Elon Musk.

What a ridiculous question, and please stop that mindset like \"nothing is impossible\" because there are certain things which is really impossible, and one of those are Shiba Inu reaching $1. You should really try to understand and make enough research before you put your money into something. Well, good thing that you're here asking for this question, but you still need more research. Now, if you're thinking of putting your money to Shiba, hoping for it's value to get $1. Well, I'm sorry to say this, but you'll definitely going to be disappointed.",

Heck, probably going back to its past ATH may even be a hard feat to achieve. They'd have to do something about the current state of the coin first if anything before we can even see any significant growth once more. As for investing on it, I wouldn't really recommend it, just go for better and more solid altcoins in the market if you're new like ETH, if you're experienced I reckon you can try looking for some small coins that could pump but that's on you to find them.",

That is an impossible thing to happen, even if the price of Shiba Inu is at $0.000775, it will make Shiba Inu token the first place on Coinmarketcap, we know that no coin/token has ever beaten Bitcoin in terms of marketcap.Quote from: Pandji02 on January 30, 2023, 05:06:35 AMYeah, everything is possible, but the possibility is really low.

If thats to happen then it could surpass bitcoin on its place as number 1 since moving shib to $1 is probably need a lot of money and imagining it could be at $1 is likely impossible. Marketcap wise, you could check whether its value on the real score of the project.But lets be real, a meme coin isnt gonna leave behind those useful projects or top coins that are way more than useful than a coin having a shiba dog feature.",

The fact that Shiba cannot reach $1 with the current supply is certain. As for the question, is it good to invest in it? I can tell you that Shiba has never been good, what shiba has achieved during the 2021 bull season is just hype and whether it will continue to be hyped or not. No one knows, it depends on whether the shark will continue to pick it or choose another useless token. Investing in shiba or meme is no different from gambling, so no one can give you the answer, if you want to gamble for high profit, then you can try.",

That's why when they are about to burn some supplies they announce it because it's expected for the price of their coins to rise and investors will gonna buy it hoping to sell their holdings soon than other coins they invested.",

In crypto currency trading or investment; it is wrong to weigh in your emotions while trying to research or while trying to invest, because with your emotions at play it will be difficult to accept red flags about any investment. Similarly, there are several reasons to hold Shiba Inu, and there are several entries to buy Shiba inu, what works for you ?",

If you know the calculation you will know the answer to your question dude. Maybe that will happen, but it won't be for a long time at this time. Because don't you know that when a Shiba Inu becomes 1$, its market cap will appear even higher than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top altcoins? In short, that's impossible right now, it's too good to be true.Because before that happens, they need to burn billions of Shiba Inu first to reach 1$ each, but that's not what they can do in one fell swoop, instead they can only do little by little burning.",

The possibility of Shiba getting to 1$ is quite difficult, it would mean that the coin market cap would have to triple its current value while every other coin would remain constant and that be rather difficult to accomplish. Shiba inu will make a substantial move in the next bull run, but that does not mean that the value would increase to 1$. If we can get a X10 or 20, that would be enough for me.",
