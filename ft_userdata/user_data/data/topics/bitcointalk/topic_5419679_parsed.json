  "content": "No idea if you were following the news this past week but a report on Coindesk about a leaked FTX / Alameda balance sheet showing solvecy risks. Basically something how most assets held by FTX are in FTT which is their native token and its considered highly illiquid.There was a sell off this weekend and the sell-off got worst when Binance CEO tweeted that they are liquidating all their FTT holdings. Then some FTX staff tried to provide some confidence by tweeting that they have tons of other assets and are willing to buy all the Binance's holding of FTT at a fixed price of $22.Now there is massive panic and seems there is a bank run on all the assets held at FTX. If you look at their wallets, you can see people are withdrawing everything. Their USDC wallet keeps getting depleted and they need to keep topping it up.Don't like the way this is going. Crypto exchange wars are not going to be good for crypto. Just like those hashrate wars back in 2018 when the $6K support broke when BSV was against BCH.",

Though the difference is high, Binance wants to keep the market under their control. Maybe for that reason such an issue is being arose by Binance. This shows that the competence among the Exchanges is at the peak. Maybe similar incidents will bring to limelight more fake volume and other tactics followed by the Exchanges to keep their markets stable amidst different Market situation.",

This is giving me November 2018 vibes with Craig Wright and Roger Ver conflict which caused that nasty crash of $6K. That day was Nov 14th. Basically almost 4 years ago today.",

I feel like this will definitely influence Bitcoin badly. Pretty sure decrease in price was sort of caused by this indirectly. They should make up their minds.",

Their hot wallet is almost 50% empty however they moved alot of funds around to refill their other wallets for USDC, USDT, so I am guessing that maybe >75% of all their client assets have been withdrawn.Wondering if they will recover from this. This was the top #2 or #3 exchange in terms of volume and I predict it will be closer to #10 spot after this. I think people don't want another Celcius issue.",

He’s learned his lesson with the Alina debacle and is seeing cracks in FTX that make him not want to have half a billion dollars invested in FTT. Totally reasonable and in no may malicious in my opinion to not want this liability. If you dig deeper there are lots of other explanations, but I think the simplest explanation is that this was a no brainer move to shore up your Binance’s balance sheet and remove potential sources of future problems.",

      "body": "From what I understand. Apparently they use FTT as collateral on many different exchanges and Defi. The reason they don't sell FTT but use as collateral is so they don't pay capital gains tax on the tokens. So they borrow it from FTX, use a collateral to market make and such. Hence it seems that they might have $5B in liabilities for Alameda but $5B in assets for FTX, so it cancels each other out. Another issue is that it seems that FTT is owned 98% by Alameda pretty much. Many only own 25 FTT just to get the free maker fees on FTX but majority is owned by them.So far they are still processing withdraws. Maybe $50M per hour or so.",

FTX/Almeda inflated their balance sheet with their own tokens, going to be interesting weeks.Yes this is the reason. Nobody in the crypto space was happy about what SBF did.However CZ looks like he is looking for blood. Instead of just taking the $22 offer for the FTT, he promised to TWAP it over a 6 month period. However if you look at the FTTBNB chart, there is massive amount of dumping since in the last few hours. Seems like he wants to break the peg and cause pain.There is speculation already that they are selling their holdings of SOL just to keep the $22 peg safe. Right now there is even a 10 cent premium between Binance and FTX for FTT-Token.Looks like it might get ugly. Reminds me of CSW vs Ver from 4 years ago. And poof the $6000 bitcoin support broke.",

Rather than becoming better than the other, it seems they are already trying to kill the other. Of course I'm only referring to their businesses. But the bigger problem here is that rather than one turning out the winner and the other loser, what will possibly happen is that the market will be affected and we will all losers.",
