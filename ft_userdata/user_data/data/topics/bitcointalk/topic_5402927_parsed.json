  "content": "QuoteTop Democrat Seeks Probe on Use of Crypto in Retirement Accounts - House Democrat asks watchdog for data on crypto in 401(k)s- Lawmakers divided on how to regulate cryptocurrenciesHouse Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is asking a federal watchdog to scrutinize the emerging practice of retirement-savings programs offering cryptocurrency investments.Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a letter to the Government Accountability Office that he’s worried about the lack of regulation for crypto investments, which could in turn harm retirees’ savings pools if they put money in such assets.Referrence: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-15/top-democrat-seeks-probe-on-adding-crypto-to-retirement-accounts?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2According to my analysis,  Means chairman Richard Neal was a Democrat politician in a Federal showed concern for retiring employees though I'm not sure if I understand this correctly however, you are free to correct me just in case I am wrong. Retirees need to be careful to put their savings on cryptocurrency investors due to the lack of government regulation. And I think his request to the GAO to provide data to cryptocurrency employers so that it can be regulated where they are obliged to pay taxes to the government.I also like to ask everyone of you here, where if you are in favor that all cryptocurrencymust be regulated under byt the government?my opinion - If ever all cryptocurrency will become regulated, that means all crypto employers can able to contibute in the economy. if that happens the economy of the country could also increase, although it will in control by the government. Do you also think that all retirees savings are prohibited to invest in the cryptocurrency?my opinion - Not all retirees are open minded into cryptocurrency, there are some of them have an idea about this industry of business. so if I am one of the retiree and have an idea about in cryptocurrency, I maybe put some of the percentage of my retiree savingswhere even I know there is risk, but it still fine due to I am willing to loss it if ever I encounter bad things happens in the market. Which is more safe Regulated Cryptocurrency or not Regulated?my opinion - whether cryptocurrency is regulated or not they have both advantages and disadvantages.Though its another topic, and I don't want to elaborate that.",

The government however is not in control of it so there is the bipartisan collaboration in the name of Senators Lummis and Gillibrand both from different party passing this new bill. I think it will be regulated still despite the government not able to control Bitcoin and few others but most altcoins can be easy for them to regulate.Defi is probably going to be regulated too. As for retirees not able to invest in crypto, that would be sad and scary because its what Davos meeting was about also. \"You will own nothing and be happy.\"",

It's true that more and more cryptocurrencies, exchanges etc keep getting regulated in different ways as time passes, but there will always be a decent portion of the crypto market which will stay unregulated.Personally, I don't like regulations since the whole point of BTC and other popular cryptocurrencies is to conduct financial transactions anonymously away from the prying eyes of the government.Anyone who says that the crypto market is completely regulated now needs to improve his/her brainpower.",

It's both win-win situation for crypto enthusiast and government.Oh yeah. Any government wants to get taxes on it, but what they hate the most is that it allows people to get out of their financial control.A win-win situation is not possible here due to the fact that cryptocurrencys were created in order to be independent of the financial system of governments. By linking crypto with the government, we get the same traditional banking system, but already more rigid for users due to blockchain.
