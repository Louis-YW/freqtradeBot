That is not bitcoin v2 or anything you called it, it would just be an altcoin.Quote from: ajaxtempest on May 15, 2022, 05:56:01 AMWhat stops a computer programmer to copy the entire bitcoin code and change only the limit from 21million to 20 million.If bitcoin supply should be changed, it has to be proposed and majority of bitcoin community (I mean the miners) would have to support this before it can happen. Bitcoin should remain 21 million. Bitcoin has limited supply and it is deflationary, no need of altering the supply like centralized coins like ethereum and binance coin.Quote from: ajaxtempest on May 15, 2022, 05:56:01 AMYes there have been forks like bitcoin cash or bitcoin sv but they dont start from 0You mentioned already, that they are forks. Bitcoin cash is a hardfork of bitcoin while bitcoin sv is a hardfork of bitcoin cash. They are also all altcoins. You can start your own altcoin project that will have total supply of 21 million but it would also be an altcoin, not bitcoin.Quote from: ajaxtempest on May 15, 2022, 05:56:01 AMSatoshi himself stated that bitcoin is only one of the first, there might be superior versions of a cryptocurrency.I do not know about that and that is probably incorrect, but bitcoin remain the superior as of now.",

But it wouldn't kill the real BTC though, those miners who had built their ASIC farms today wouldn't mind and they will just go on mining BTC while this BTC v2 not adopted.Quote from: ajaxtempest on May 15, 2022, 06:15:36 AMQuote from: Baofeng on May 15, 2022, 06:07:04 AMIt's because it doesn't really make sense to have a Bitcoin ver 2.0 and start from scratch.

During the years we had also forks like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision and I don't remember what else, did they take bitcoin's place? No.Anyway you're completely free to start your own bitcoin.",

In short, bitcoin will loose share of value since rest of them including the ones who are already involved in the current bitcoin will start mining or chasing other version so that they will want to be first to try it out. In the process bitcoin will loose the value. There will be high supply but less demand to the original or parent bitcoin and thus whole concept of using bitcoin at will won't be useful.

There is nothing new to solve that needs urgent addressing. If the bitcoin community needed to change something urgent, and it was a breaking change, then a hard fork would merely be made, and the old version would cease to be in use just like that - so long as a majority is reached bu that's not the topic here.Drastic solutions are only required for drastic problems, and in the current state of affairs, you will find little that needs to be solved in cryptocurrencies already.[examples: smart contracts (ethereum), anonymity (monero), scalability of tx speed (tron), etc...]",

You don't gain the clout and the following of Bitcoin just because you use the same name or have similar parameters on different networks.
