      "body": "For that amount, I would probably go with instant exchanges[1] instead of CEXes. Not sure what the withdrawal fees are exactly, but unless you have an account already on one of them, it's probably not worth going through the registration and (possibly) verification processes.I just tried a few: Changelly (couldn't because there is a minimum amount), ChangeNow, Simplswap, FixedFloat, and exch.cx[1]exch seems to give the best rates: ~0.0489 XMR compared to ~0.041-0.044 that the other ones give.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5218464.40[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=577207.60",

      "body": "You can use exch. Exch is accepting Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. If you want to convert to minero with the cheapest fee, use the exchange. This is exch website: https://exch.cx/To calculate the fee, you can input the amount that you want to exchange to minero to to see the fee before you press on exchange to exchange the coin. If you can not not go with 1% fee, you can change it from flat fee to dynamic fee of about 0.5% fee. 0.5 to 1% of $7 is not high at all as fee.",

What is the cheapest way to do and best site for this ?If you have not made the transaction or for anyone who sees this post in the future, you will find a list of all the links here https://www.bestchange.com/bitcoin-to-monero.html where you can search for comments regarding the platforms, and choose the best one according to price, trust, or available balance.What is excellent about this list is that it is renewed and monitored every period, so it is better than personal reviews that may vary after several months.",
