  "content": "Hello,It's my first post here, nice to see so active forum.I have been researching multiple days, with no luck, so I have decided to ask here.I want to create a service that supports bitcoin and few other coins with ability to assign wallet addresses to each new registered user in order to receive funds, but all funds receive would reside on some kind of 'main' wallet?Is that doable? I have seen HD wallets, and multi-sig wallets, but I'm not sure if I send certain amount of crypto to child wallet if it will be forwarded to main wallet.I hope you understand what I want to achieve, and probably someone has done something similar already here.Thanks a lot!",

      "body": "A HD wallet would be fine... Derive as many addresses as you want from the master public key, and when you import the master private key (or the seed phrase) into a wallet like electrum, you'll be able to spend all unspent outputs funding all addresses derived from the master public key.For an online service, you should probably create a seed phrase on an offline machine using (for example) electrum, then look at the master PUBLIC key and move this public key to your online machine for derivation of addresses, it'll be much safer since your seed phrase and your master private key never touched an online machine. Offcourse, if you do this, you'll have to batch withdrawals and run them manually a couple times a day. You'll need to sign the batch withdrawal transaction on your offline machine aswell, but you'll sleep much better knowing no private key of yours is available on any online machine.By the way, the way you describe your problem makes it sound more complex than it actually is... There's no need to talk about child wallets, main wallets, forewarding... You just create a seed phrase (and in the background a master private key), put the master public key on your webserver for address derivation of new users and that's it. Only the person with the seed phrase or the master private key can spend those funds. The unspent outputs are safe while funding the addresses belonging to your users. No need to foreward or create other wallets.",

You detect the payment when the user makes a deposit.3. You update your user's balance in the database. 4. Send (or batch) multiple users deposits to a hot wallet.5. Use that hot wallet to later process withdrawals.6. Update your balance records when the withdrawal is successful.",

      "body": "You seem to be forgetting that a wallet can consist of many addresses.So you can assign for each user different deposit addresses (they won't have private keys), but you are still the master of the whole wallet. And you'll move the funds away of the various addresses when you need that, it's not important to empty them at sight.Hence a HD wallet can do the job. Maybe you look into something like BTCPay; maybe it already does what you want to implement.As already said, be careful on what/how big funds you keep in a hot wallet.",

I think it would make all of this more complicated then it needs to be.Basically I will be interacting with blockchain on deposit and withdrawals, all coin movements inside platform would be internal.",

Don't fall into that trap. Every decent service has at least a few devs around for maintenance work.",
