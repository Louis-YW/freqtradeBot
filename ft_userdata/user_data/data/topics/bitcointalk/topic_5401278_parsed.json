Fuloos token by FuloosIOThe questions here are:Can this be right?Can this be a good project that will pay?What are their objectives for running such Campaigns?Possible answers:Can this be right? No, newbies including me are new members that just join the forum. They know little about how the forum works. They are learners. Learners running Campaigns for learners and experts. Funny enough, most of the newbie BOUNTY MANAGERS don't even have any post apart from the campaign they posted e.g  AniFinance and Multiple Finance.Can this be a good project that will pay? No, most of this Campaigns are run because of their selfish interest.What are their objectives for running such Campaigns? Most are run to build their social media followers. They name the bounty project after their social media name and claim all hunters must join to be accepted in the campaign. To mention few:1. Ani.Finance by AniFinance2. Dhahab Sports token by DhahabSportsNOTE: Not all bounties worth doing. Always analyse all bounty and do your own research on them before joining to avoid waste of time and resources.",

If you want to promote a company here, it should be a company running a signature campaign at least, it can be concluded that people who join bounties are spammers that could not do what is necessary to join a signature campaign, like being a productive member, etc.",

Dev or Team may change the token smart contract address to a new one prior to the end of the bounty campaign. And effort to change the escrowed token to new ones may be abortive. This render the escrowed token useless.",

I have seen a newbie who is the owner of the project and now they even run their own exchange site which so bring me to a place where they give free crypto that total to 4 eth. I am thankful for the bounty I joined a few years ago. My point is even a newbie can become a campaign manager if the project owner can't afford to hire a reputable campaign manager due to fund problem or didn't know about the reputable campaign manager and just pick one of the project's staff to become the campaign manager.",

Op, not all newbies are newbies. Some are old members who decided to create new accounts to promote their scammy project. So, don't get it twisted. Then the overall conclusion is, no matter who manages a bounty, do your own research before you join.",

It happens because managers are only moderators of the campaign, they might not know the original and interior motive of the project creators.It is the responsibility of the campaign manager to do their due diligence on the company that’s hiring, most CM have a team that work with them and part of their job is to research the company before taking the job. The reputation of the campaign manager is at stake should the campaign is discovered to be a scam. I have come across a few occasions where the company’s team stopped responding to CM messages and he had to pay the promoters from his own purse.",

Some purchase copper memberships to be allowed to post images. Bounties overall aren't worth it. Especially those paying in unlisted and brand-new tokens that will get dumped even before bounty hunters get them into their wallets. And once they do, they will kill them off for good. Even if they pay, what kind of future does the asset you receive have? Most of them don't have any. People think that a scam project is only the one that doesn't pay its campaign participants. That's not true. It's also a scam to pay in a token that will never ever be listed anywhere and can't be sold or will never amount to anything. Regarding the objective of such campaigns. It's to collect your Bitcoin and other valuable digital assets and sail off into the sunset while you are left standing there holding a big bag of nothing.",

Always analyse all bounty and do your own research on them before joining to avoid waste of time and resources.These examples you cited do not necessarily mean newbie bounty managers. As far as I can see, some of the projects have decided to run their campaigns on their own. This means that the bounty manager is a member of their team, or even the developer himself. Obviously they have some knowledge of how bounty campaigns work and it is possible to use an alt account to run a campaign and promote a project. Whether these are good campaigns or not is hard to say. Just know, a respectable campaign manager does not automatically mean a good campaign. There are a number of campaigns that have turned out to be a scam run by a well-known bounty manager.",

You can also not verify which project will pay or which will cheat, but know that the number of projects that cheat are more than the ones that pay, so you can weigh your chances on that premise.Best advice is to leave bounties alone, 9/10 of them are bad and do not pay, so your chances of getting a good one that will pay is 1/10, leave the bounty section, you will enjoy it when you post in other sections of the forum and learn new things about bitcoin.",

A project can draft a good Whitepaper and still not meet the expectations of their investors. I think for the forum signature campaign, the campaign managers have enough experience to know if the project is legitimate or not. And if they turn to scam their investors later in the future while the campaign is still going on, it is the responsibility of the campaign manager to alert the community and be the first to raise a scam accusation against the company.",

Some project owners doesn't consider to hand over their projects campaign for reputable managers to manage here in the forum. It could be as a result of the pay they will give to the managers. Maybe they thought that why pay if they can do it themselves. And most times the reputable managers reject the campaigns if they aren't looking genuine, then they will have no choice than to come manage same by themselves. But this brings about unethical behaviour of the participants because the unexperienced managers may not know how to catch cheaters or prevent spamming.",
