  "content": "Today I had to delete my Telegram handle from my profile page here since some scammers seem to target bitcointalk users that have their TG handle out in the open.Some clown contacted me with a story if I am buying and selling btc. I played along and wrote I would consider it but only in person and for cash ( that's how I only deal anyway ).He came with some story he is Turkish but living and working in Italy and working for some oil rig bullshxx and so on.He is \"getting paid\" in crypto and wants to sell it. I already knew it's bs but kept playing along and asked him to prove he actually has funds ( show an address that holds btc ). After asking 3 times he finally sent me a screenshot of a wallet with 0.0013btc.   He asked if I can buy 5 btc though, hahaha.The wallet in the screenshot was named \"mr.suevie\" , which is actually also the name of a user in this forum.   I googled suevie and found its a common name in Africa. Still, coincidence? Anyway, unfortunately after 30sec he unsent the picture.He also wrote stuff like: \"Any business I'm doing with you I will send you first before you send me anything.\" No risk for me, yeah right.I sent him a grabify link and he was stupid enough to click it twice, first with his real IP, and second time with a blocker.And guess where he came from:As I am sure people are aware to not trust the randoms, it's just annoying that you can't even have your telegram name here without getting contacted by these clowns.I wonder how the scam would work. If it's just a money mule scam, or some fake notification the money was received and I could send the funds in return.  Don't waste your time with these people. Just block them immediately. PS: His \"telegram name\" is Orlando Mark. Can't see the handle though.",

      "body": "Your point is valid as such scammers are everywhere and they somehow find ways to scam the users from all around the globe. You are well educated in technical terms and that's why you somehow protected defend yourself from the scam, but some people fall into trap of such scammers and lose the money. Thos scammers do their job very professionally and their main targets are the innocent users who aren't well aware of such scams.I few months ago someone tried to scam one of my cousin with same tactics, the scammer found him on Facebook and sent him private messages. My cousin was not good at tech and he fell into the scam, he fell very badly into the trap of the scammer and told his brother to give him $500 dollars no matter how but give him that amount so that he can receive the parcel worth $1000's of dollars. His brother told me about it and I asked my cousin that whom he's going to pay the money then he showed me the conversations with the scammer. I told him that the one who's asking for money is a scammer and he won't deliver you the parcel that's worth $1000's of dollars. After a lot of effort he finally agreed when he inquired his best friend whom he trusted the most about the thing and his friend also told him that he's being scammed.Such scammers are everywhere these days and they find different ways to contact users and steal their money. I appreciate your effort that you made to find out his IP, you just saved yourself from the scam. And, now you shared your story here so others should also can get awareness in this regard. Anyone who's smart enough will not fall into the traps of those scammers.",

Just some days ago shasan contacted me on telegram about something urgent and he found my handle here. But it seems it’s not a good idea to have it on my profile , for obvious reason. Anyway, I know it’s a waste of time to speak with these people. I just had a little time and wanted to know what the scam is about. Too bad he didn’t go into details, I laughed too early.",

Yes, it's been made publicly known by bounty spreadsheet and all, and changing to new handler would fix that... temporarily, as your new handler would sooner or later also be made public. Wouldn't it be easier to click the ignore and report button?When I am in the mood, I toyed with those scammers, but mostly I just hit the report button.",

You understood it wrong though. I didn't delete my telegram. I just deleted it from my profile page here in the bitcointalk forum  . Had it under \"Other contact info\" .Also, I definitely ignored and also reported the clown at the end. There was nothing else to say to this little guy.",

If someone is willing to communicate with you on Telegram, they will PM you on the forum and tell you their Telegram ID. That way you know who you are talking to. Keep your contact details for yourself to avoid situations like the one you just experienced. Even if someone contacts you on Telegram and says, I am X from Bitcointalk, wouldn't you confirm you are talking to the real person? Would you not ask to have the person PM you over the forum as proof they are legit? You might as well save yourself some time and do it the right way from the start.",
