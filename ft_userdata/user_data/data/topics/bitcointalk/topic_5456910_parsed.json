Neither of these public PR would release these articles if it wasn't for real, they would all run into big problems by Amazon or lawsuit if they publish such news without consentBro Really!Who are they wrote those Articles? SEC will not come and arrest for the volume of 200k or 1 million. Many such projects come and go with many Public PRs. So many Pepe versions came with doxx and gone.Really! If Amazon is releasing token, it is not a joke Bro. There would be a Press Release, news all over Bloomberg and Silicon Valley.Ok at least show your chat with Amazon.",
