      "body": "When one feels uncomfortable for not having a good grade in school, it means the person is open to learning more, trying to figure out the reasons for the failure, and at the same time looking for ways to perform better in the next exam. The same thing is applicable to labor; if one gets a low pay on his job, he will definitely want to know the reason for that in order to avoid such a thing happening next time. The same is applicable to being sacked; I know most times the fault might not actually be from the person but come from the employer; they might have one or two reasons to reduce and sack someone. Quote from: Broly46 on July 03, 2023, 12:01:00 PMtell me anything i need to do to make a lot of money. doesn't matter what, i would do anything to get all the money, even if it mean unlawful and unethical!This statement to me is bad. In a situation like this, you might likely get yourself involved in things that might endanger the very family and kids that you want to do those things for and earn money for in order for them to feed and live comfortably. You just have to change that mindset of being ready to do anything just to make money before the evil teachings of some unlawful and inhuman acts take control over you.",

Never put money first in all things in life because it will only make you more pressure in life and you will forget how to be happy of what you have right now. Focused on happiness instead rather than thinking about the money, not all happiness can be bought by money.",

If you want to do something you must work hard. Based on your words it is understood that you want to get rich in a short time. But you are not alone you must take care that your family responsibility is still on you. I would say to fix your mind and then you will be able to take right decision. Many times many people take wrong decision in haste hope you are like that. Don't You can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc on various crypto platforms so that you can sell them at a good price in the future.

      "body": "What I can advise is that, instead of stressing about those things on your own, open up your problems or worries to your wife. Your wife is your support, and she would probably understand your situation. You can't solve things by running away or hiding from it. You need to face it and find a solution to it. I understand that it can be too stressful, especially if you grew up in an environment where you get scared of failing. But you have your own family now, and you as a husband need to be strong mentally. You don't have to put yourself in the situation where you will do wrong things for money. How would your family feel if they find out about it? You can still start over again. Apply and find another job (but not something unethical or unlawful), maybe it would give you a bigger opportunity and higher salary than your previous job. Be positive and everything will be fine.",

You are too afraid of quantitative values but override how the process. Your mentality has not really formed to be responsible for yourself and even always feel the burden of other people is becoming more in control of your mind. If you are able to be confident in your abilities, and don't complain about what you have produced, the family will accept it as it is.What you feel is just excessive fear, lack of self-confidence, always comparing life with the lives of higher people and the result is as if you are blaming yourself. Get rid of that habit, always think optimistically, and don't expect uncertain results. Do what you have to and produce what you can produce.",

That's why it's still good to do good so you can reap good results.",

The real thing that is stressful is when we are enslaved by money where income is less than expenses. In fact, money will always be lacking as long as we don't have a sense of gratitude, where happiness is not always worth money. how many assets do we have in our bodies, would we exchange one eye for one billion, try to count, so basically money is not a measure of happiness, even though in a materialistic world we always need money, but if we can use the gift of reason, money will come.If it's hard to make money, don't make money. because when you have a hard time making money it means you have lost the competition with people who are also looking for money but they are given 'better' opportunities than you. Don't look for money but seek sustenance from God, because God's sustenance has no limit. What you need to do now, don't feel pressured by your wife, and don't force yourself because that will frustrate and stress you out. Keep trying and stay confident, I'm sure your wife will understand your situation and she will even support and encourage you to keep trying so you don't give up easily.",

Don't love money at the expense of people. Cursed money not worth it, my friend . It's going to make you lose alot, miserable, depressed, foolish, etc. Simply get yourself the Word of GOD( Matthew, Proverbs, etc) and read... Believe in it and do what it says and you will prosper. The secret to prosperity is to sow good seed or do good work in any good business you can find, preferably business you are passionate/talented in...it doesn't matter if it's owed by others. Use the business to solve problems for others... Then, ask the CREATOR to reward you through the business or through any other means, believe HE will answer your prayers and you will be rewarded. The more you sow (or the more good work you do) the more you reap. You don't need to be employed by anyone to benefit from this. Just look for any good business and begin to contribute. Blessings.",

But that doesn't mean we can do anything including things that break the law, that's a form of despair that you are showing here. Now logically, who would believe a desperate person? I think there is no.Surely you will say talking will be easier than experiencing it directly, but we have to look from the positive side. We never know the people who give you input may have experienced the same thing or even more terrible than that.Maybe now we only think about money, because that's what we really need. But can we be sure if we have a lot of money it will give peace? no guarantees about any of that.

A lot of money doesn't guarantee a happy family. So after making the lot of money, then what?If I should tell you something you need to do to make a lot of money. I'll say learn to be contented first cause without contentment there's no amount of money you will make that will seem a lot enough to you. Going unlawful could only send you to serve time in jail ruining your life and those  of your kids. What more fear can there be to that?",
