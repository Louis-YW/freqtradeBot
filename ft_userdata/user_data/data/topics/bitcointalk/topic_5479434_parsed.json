I can see some altcoins that fell more than 20 times in the bear market. If someone fomo at the time and buy and be losing 20 time more of the money invested, it will not be easy. Altcoins are very risky.Sometimes, you will invest, the coin will first drop in price and annoying. Even bitcoin may first fall, not increasing for awhile before bulls will start buying.Quote from: Gormicsta on December 27, 2023, 10:22:16 AMOne of the most common misconceptions regarding cryptocurrencies, in my opinion, is that they are anonymous.

People that are using IP address directly will also think of that but which is wrong. There are some things you have to do before you can be anonymous while making transactions.",

All by ourselves. For example, the story of promoting crime  Yep, if there was no Bitcoin, crime would still exist and people just like to exaggerate the problem to say that it is risky for many people. I once raised the issue that $ is also a much bigger tool that criminals use. And the core issue is that people use it for their own purposes. Every tool can bring different aspects to serve us.I also have many friends who are exposed to bitcoin, but sharing the same knowledge with it to express is really rare. With this forum, I learn more than external things (personal opinion). Actually, I used to think a lot about bringing accurate information about Bitcoin for people around me to understand, but after many processes, I realized that I should let them find out for themselves the way they are learning everything in life. There is no need to impose anything, we can know whether it is good/bad for anyone.",

      "body": "I'd say that a thing requiring clarification is when people use 'cryptocurrency' and 'Bitcoin' interchangeably, and then apply what goes for Bitcoin to cryptos in general. And then this confusion leads to misconceptions about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, but, as we know, there are plenty of others. Bitcoin is a relatively safe investment, it attracts serious investors, it is very decentralized etc. But that doesn't hold for cryptos in general. Some are more or less popular, volatile, or centralized than others. So assuming that cryptos are a relatively safe investment in general or that they're all decentralized are big misconceptions because Bitcoin isn't like the rest of cryptos.",

I haven't talk to the lady as I don't know here. It was just a friend of my wife who she teaches some side hustle and perhaps it's very slow to her that's why she goes into crypto thinking that he can earn money very quick.

While there are people who are under the misconception that you can lose everything in cryptocurrency, but I think both are right in their place because if you go with the best strategy, and choice you can make a lot of money in crypto. On the other hand, your wrong choice and bad strategy can waste all your money.So the misunderstandings on both sides should be removed. We can earn good profit from crypto currency, but loss should also be kept in mind.We may lose everything, but our good decisions can turn it into profit. Thus, different people may have different opinions and misunderstandings, there is no one thing that is common to all people.",

That's why criptocurrency is our more used as an investment rather than a currency system. I have seen people in 2017 rushing towards cryptocurrency to get rich quick. Some of my friends have even used their credit cards to buy cryptocurrency. So I believe this is the biggest misconception here in the crypto market. It is a great investment and there is no doubt about it. But it cannot make you rich overnight. In order to make money from cryptocurrency you need a stable source of income where you can average out your buying price. Pretty similar to any other investments.",
