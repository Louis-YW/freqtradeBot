In next 20 or 30 years, the 10% to 30% of my reserved bitcoin possibly will have more value than what I sell earlier.While looking at the current value of the BTCs spent by Laszlo for pizzas, we have to realize that it's essential that he has triggered the exchange of Bitcoin through that purchase. Without that historical purchase, it wouldn't create the curiosity of many to think that something can be traded or purchased with Bitcoin. I know we're looking at the thousands of Bitcoins spent and the tremendous value of it right now, but without his great contribution to that exchange, there could be someone else who has done that but we don't know, it's just going to remain another what if. And the valuable lesson we can learn from this history is about the power of holding. When 10k Bitcoins can purchase pizzas before, the lesser amount of Bitcoin now or so can purchase more than what we can expect in the future. Real estate, luxury cars, everything that truly are life-changing.",

If I could ask him just one question, it'd be: \"why did you leave Bitcoin?\". He was so passionate at first, but then something seemed like it underwhelmed him about Bitcoin.",

It's good that he's still around and has no problem appearing in front of the cameras.Laszlo Hanyecz was not just a programmer, I guess he was part of Satoshi's team. He was the first to mine Bitcoin with GPUs when he converted his gaming computer to a mining machine. He was also one of the first developers who ran Bitcoin on MacOS instead of the popular Windows. Becoming the first to use Bitcoin for commercial transactions adds more feathers to his cap. The Bitcoin legend said he didn't regret his action, that's remarkable.

You can do many things silently and privately, disappear from the community.Pizzas for bitcoin?Did Laszlo Hanyecz exchange 40000 BTC for 8 pizzas, not 10000 BTC for 2 pizzas?It is a topic on Bitcoin pizza with some information that he did not trade only 10,000 BTC for pizzas but more than that.The man behind Bitcoin pizza day is more than a meme: He's a mining pioneer.",

I don't care it may be worth 1000x more tomorrow or in 10 years.If you HODL long enough you won't have any time left to enjoy it, so forget about this \"billion dollar pizza\" and enjoy what Laszlo has enjoyed years ago.Don't wait for the revolution, Be the revolution.",
