The token’s market capitalization has also slumped below $500 billion.While BTC’s latest round of losses were triggered by overheated U.S. inflation data, a mix of other negative indicators caused sharp selling over the weekend.Rising inflation is now expected to spur a bigger-than-expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve this week, creating more headwinds for BTC.Trouble in the DeFi space also worsened crypto sentiment as major player Celsius suspended withdrawals due to a severe liquidity crunch.Source :https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-eyes-crash-below-25k-as-these-3-factors-weigh/",
