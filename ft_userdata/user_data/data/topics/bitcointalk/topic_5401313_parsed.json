They literally want U.S. plebs out of savings, and laid off from their jobs. If they accelerate the economy by injecting liquidity it would risk Hyperinflation.This is literally the kind of manipulation that motivated Satoshi to build Bitcoin.QuoteIn any case, we are facing a state of uncertainty and therefore a lot of markets will be very turbulent during the next few months, and some random variables such as closings in China, food and energy situation will complicate a lot of calculations.Therefore, you cannot say that the scenario you mentioned will come true.It will come true.

The Fed will do whatever it could to \"balance\" the economy. If they're doing a good job, or not, is another debate altogether. Currently, the Fed needs to increase interest rates and QT, the U.S. Federal Government needs to increase taxes to draw money out of the system, control demand, and lower inflation. The Fed will not stop until a big company, or a big bank, or the money market \"breaks\".",

They are a government supported company, that would have gone bankrupt long ago, if the government wasn't financially supporting their pretentious and failing business. Does anyone really believe that electric cars and big li-ion batteries are the future?Anyway, this QT thing seems a little bit exaggerated to me. The Federal Reserve cannot risk creating another big depression by extracting too much money out of the circulation. The process of QT will most likely be slower and less stressful for the economy and the financial sector.The central bankers might be corrupted, but they aren't that stupid.",

Because they are said to be poor they have a Fractional Reserve Banking system. You should know that banks lend money, from printing presses that are not owned by the bank itself.Hasn't bank lending been going on for a long time now? the biggest crime but is recognized as an act that is considered normal. Then the central bank raises interest rates and the victim pays taxes, doesn't the bank steal from the taxpayers?I've heard the saying from John Adam: If power can be controlled or concentrated in a few hands, then we will see political power flowing in a system that deviates from the norm of people's interests only to produce a financial system only for the interests of oligarchs and anarchists.",

That is what the problem is with today's prices, people are moving their money out, and moving it into interests and all that, which is fine by me, but the money is there, it's not fully gone.You have to realize that almost 50% of all the money printed in the USA history ever was printed in the last 2-3 years. If you see that, you realize that no matter where that money is, no matter how much of it is withdrawn from the markets, it is still \"there\", which makes it less valuable to me and to everyone else that will ever need it.
