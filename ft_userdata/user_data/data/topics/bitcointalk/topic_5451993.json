Can the AI tell if $PEPE was going to make 3000x gains in a week? Nope.Literally, no one can predict any market, you can speculate on the basis of previous moves when the indicators reached a particular point.This says it all, artificial intelligence technology is very impressive but it won’t be one I would trust with my trades. Artificial intelligence bot are programmed and one thing that wasn’t added to that program is accurately predicting how the Crypto-currency trading market would go in the future.Don’t seek for the easiest ways to make money it’s just going to get you lose money. Crypto-currency trading is a field that need you to actually learn how it works and understand trades yourself know your indicators, and very importantly when to stop loss and take profits.",

AI makes predictions based on the program data it’s built on or rather some past predictions made by people but cannot think an away out if a new case arrives like human will do. In bitcoin trading or cryptocurrency at large the market is affect with so many factors that differs day by day and only with common sense can this things reasoned out. Just like the congestion of mempool by BRC20 tokens, can AI be able to add this into his decision making process and see how it can affect trading? No. This lack of Robustness is why it is such a big gamble to trust AI on trading tips",

The computing power that's being produced by ASIC miners is what it exactly needs. As for trading, having forecasts and analysis, they'll just base on the numbers that they can gather through the web and that's what they'll just say. So, maybe in the future we'll see a more advance AI discussing things that we'll accurately have in terms of trading but when it does happens, do you think that exchanges will still be there if everyone will just rely on AI for their accurate winning trades? I don't think that it will ever be allowed by these exchanges or if they do, there will be some counter measures and standards set by them or else, they'll go bankrupt.",
