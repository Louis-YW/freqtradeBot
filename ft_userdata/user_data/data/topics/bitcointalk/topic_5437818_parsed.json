Android and IOS has a unique security system which doesn’t allowed virus to enter its core. Correct me if I’m wrong but the reported virus affecting an android or ios device is very rare unless you root your phone that unlock all features of the phone break it’s main security.But in general. A clipboard malware will not gonna affect mobile device if you didn’t change the default setup of you device such is installing from unknown source and so on.",

As far as you use system built-in keyboard, you are safe from clipboard malware. Playstore verified by Play protect Apps are also save and their is very low security risk. I am using smartphone for many years and have not faced such problem.I searched in google about this and article found which is created in 2019 that one App \"\"Clipper\"\" was used for this purpose but no information that it steal any fundReference Laptop is very high risky for online payment systems. We should be careful about when we enter any phrase or putting address. We usually did not install windows from official website which is first reason open the door for malware attack. I have also faced this so many time and now I stopped transaction through laptop. I uses Kiwi or Mises browser whenever I need website to connect Metamask or install chrome extensions and work fine for me so far.",

The latter is the one really related to the topic here, since the app was capable of monitoring the clipboard for bitcoin and ethereum addresses, and swapping them for those controlled by the attacker.If this is widespread and still feasible (i.e. no way to patch it) is something I don’t really know, though if there is no way to patch it, likely it's still a thing.",

Let's be honest that you never know when you've made the mistake of accidentally clicking on a malicious link or automatically downloading it from a group chat or your friends. This is really dangerous even if you have kept your clipboard safe from malware.Use 2 phones if you don't have the hardware wallet, but you may need to keep one of them offline while still needing to backup the wallet for the wallet. This is just about user experience from me, but I really believe this clipboard is not safe if you are not careful.",

Good question ask since this could make other be informed about possibilities of all things related to clip board malware. but as far as we know security in android phones are so high so maybe its just a rare case for individual users to get affected with this. But still you need to be more careful on what you are copying and always verify for many times if the address you are putting where you want to receive your balances. Better to always have precautious consciousness to avoid this unnecessary mistake.",

I am not a techie, but I say if it is not something that is possible now, it doesn't mean that it cannot be possible in the closest future. More sophisticated Malwares can be made, maybe they are already in development now and will be capable of having same effect it has on computers on mobile phones. It can happen because some of these malwares that we see now, at one time we never believed that they will be existing.",

They encrypt private keys/seeds and only decrypt them once the user opens the wallet after typing a pin code generally, and they never display them if the user hasn't required it. While copy-pasted adresses are commonly used when you want to send funds to an online platform. It's recommended to always check the end of the address pasted, as it is harder to forge a similar end than a similar beginning, because of the checksum, btw.QuoteAlso, rather than clipboard hijackers one should watch out for QR code malware, scammers have understood that for some users it's a pain in the ass to copy-paste addresses so they release a lot of those apps that \"help\" you with these on playstore.https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/bitcoin-thieves-use-malicious-qr-code-readers-to-steal-45000-this-month/It's surprising, because usually wallets are able to generate the QR-codes of receiving addresses.
