  "content": "Hi guys!Just wanted to share with you my latest podcast interview, which is about a new uncensorable P2P marketplace protocol which is called Civ Kit. It's currently being built by CommerceBlock CEO Nicholas Gregory (best known for MercuryWallet and his work on Statechains) and Ray Youssef (formerly of Paxful, a popular P2P exchange).Hope you're going to like this one, the concept is certainly fascinating.
