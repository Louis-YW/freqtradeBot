Do we have to pay an initial booking fee to book the house?And the pictures in Instagram looks awesome. Just waiting for the answers of the above question OP.Hi!!Thanks for passing by!Let's go for parts.The house has 3 bedrooms, one of them is quite big, so there is 2 queen size beds and one sofa bed. The other two bedrooms has 1 king size bed each. And there is another sofa bed in another room.In total you can allocate 10 persons max comfortably in the house.The rate per night is between 0.005 and 0.008 depends on the season you reserve the BTCitcoin House  . That is the rate for all the house. The food is not included, but we have a list of restaurants in the city which receive Bitcoin as payment. In case of you want it, we can provide the food service in the house for an extra cost.If you want to reserve, just contact us through Twitter or Instagram, and to lock the date you have to transfer half of the reservation and at your arrival you transfer the rest of it.Oaxaca is a very touristy place, so at the BTCitcoin House we can organize tours to archaeological sites and sites of interest tailored to your needs and paying with BTC.The whole idea around the Bitcoin House is about those who visit us in Oaxaca, being able to pay for their services in BTC without the need to convert your USD, EUR, Etc, to Mexican Pesos (MXN). And we are promoting among restaurateurs and tourism service providers the acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payment. So in some future, maybe, Oaxaca will become a kind of Bitcoin Citadel.",
