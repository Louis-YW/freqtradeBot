  "content": "It appears that the predictions and speculations of some of the members of bitcointalk about Ordinals have become another big storyline or has it presently become our reality?This will certainly open a strong argument to adopt simple altcoins without smart contracts and Ordinals type capabilities.The Bitcoin quadrant of Crypto Twitter was abuzz with concern on Sunday, as some users saw high transaction fees and a congested backlog of transactions as an attack on Bitcoin.There are currently over 469,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed in Bitcoin’s mempool as of this writing, according to mempool.space. Before transactions are added to Bitcoin’s blockchain, transactions are sent to the network’s mempool, where they wait to be selected by a Bitcoin miner and inserted into Bitcoin’s next block.The two metrics suggested that Bitcoin’s network was especially clogged, but some thought it was the product of nefarious behavior, aimed at cutting off those that couldn’t handle the uptick in transaction fees.Still, others attributed the uptick in transaction fees and Bitcoin’s sizable backlog to Ordinals, a protocol used for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin. Called inscriptions, the total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets cruised past 4.3 million on Sunday, according to a Dune dashboard. Just last week, inscriptions totaled 2.5 million, based on Decrypt coverage.Source https://decrypt.co/139259/bitcoin-ddos-ordinals-inscriptions-attackSource where everyone can see the volume of ordinals marketplaces.https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces",

According to @Wublockchain on Twitter, the BSV community have been developing Ordinals software, platforms and have been using them. The development team behind the wallet for BRC20 called Unisat was also the same development team that created BSV's smart contract solution. The development team behind Ordswap was the same development team that created a decentralized trading platform on BSV. Twetch developers created Ordinals wallet.I reckon if verified true, this is certainly an attack on bitcoin.The BSV community has extensive participation in Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC 20. Behind Unisat, the core wallet of BRC20, is the Chinese development team of the previous BSV community, which has developed Sensible Contract, a smart contract solution on BSV. By @TechFlowPostThe team behind Ordswap, the first BRC20 trading platform, has developed RelayX, the first decentralized trading platform on the BSV network. Behind the wallet Ordinals Wallet is Twetch, a social application built on BSV. The founder of the Mempool mining pool is also a core member of the BSV communitySource https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1655793726474838016",

People who are readily to pay those expensive transaction fees deserve what they do but it affects other people who are not ready to accept very expensive transaction fee.

You also say that someone is paying for this. I agree, it is us the users including all services and the gambling site that pays you for your campaign.This good for the miners storyline manipulation is being used at our expense. We are being tricked that this attack, assuming that this is verified true, is alright.In any case, this is being shared in social media.Action should have been taken months ago. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since day 1. It's a mistake that the existing filters weren't extended to Taproot transactions. We can address that, or try a more narrow approach like OP_RETURN (ie, what \"Ordisrespector\" does). Since this is a bugfix, it doesn't really even need to wait for a major release.(We already have pruning. It's not an alternative to spam filtering.)LukeSource https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg12637.html",

I believe solutions should be made not only to stop this escalating attack but also to increase Bitcoin blockchain capacity to cope with bigger demand, bigger transactions per block, bigger size.It is better to see bigger demand on Bitcoin network and it shows us the recognition of community on the quality and security of Bitcoin blockchain and network. Many altcoins have bigger block sizes, faster transaction times but who care about them for their transactions. If they can, they will choose Bitcoin network.",
