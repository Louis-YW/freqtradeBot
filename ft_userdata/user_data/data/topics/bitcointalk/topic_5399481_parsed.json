Choose a platform to sell your NFT first,  Opensea would be my recommendation, then identify how to register your NFT to their marketplace. I'd suggest marketing it to famous NFT groups or Photography enthusiasts to actually sell, it'd be rather helpful in letting people know about your photos being an NFT. You can try buying it yourself so as to \"increase\" demand about it, there isn't any rules for the selling of NFT's anyway.",

Whoa! I didn't know that! That's a good strategy that I never heard. Make it look valuable because someone is buying and selling it back and create your own demand. Slick! It could work. Just to add for OP, you may also want to check the photographs being sold first to have a good idea of how it goes. You may try unique but there must be a more appealing photo and you need to try and look at the market on which are in demand. Good luck.",

Nowadays marketplaces are heavily littered with this kind of content, a lot of newbies are trying to tokenize their creativity and put it up for sale, but statistically 85% of such tokens are garbage and nobody needs them. The thing is that NFT has value if it is some recognizable project, but even such tokens have fallen in value lately. You can of course mint NFTs and put them on sale, but in the end you will find that you only spent money and earned nothing. First create a name and reputation for yourself as a photographer, and then try to tokenize your work, not the other way around.",
