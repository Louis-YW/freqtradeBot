  "content": "Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that is considered by many as a good and simple strategy, and widely in use by investors. It entails investing a given amount of money in a particular security for a given period of time regardless of price. Why most investors consider this strategy is a thing of curiosity. You may want to know, it helps you develop self discipline (esp as a newbie) while considering the market and your tolerance to risk. Emotion can play a substantial trick in disadvantaging investment decisions. DCA can counter this impact.Another good thing is that it lessens the impact of volatility as the total investment sum is spread over multiple purchases of the security.  This strategy can be very effective if employed during bearish market. Lastly, the strategy can be applied in any crypto investment, bonds, stocks or any commodities. It's a fine choice! However, you can always stick to what is best for you as an individual.",

Through this DCA way of investing you can manage your risk and possible minimal losses. This could be a good strategy if you are new in the market field.",

      "body": "Yup it's always good strategy. For those who do not excatly understand the DCA and how it works then I am quoting some good points down here for the reference:QuoteDollar-cost averaging is the practice of systematically investing equal amounts of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of a security.Dollar-cost averaging can reduce the overall impact of price volatility and lower the average cost per share.By buying regularly in up and down markets, investors buy more shares at lower prices and fewer shares at higher prices.Dollar-cost averaging aims to prevent a poorly timed lump sum investment at a potentially higher price.Beginning and long-time investors can both benefit from dollar-cost averaging. Check out hereSo in short one can workout the DCA strategy in the volatile market such as the crypto. For example, if John wants to keep hold of his assets in the Bitcoin and do not want to trade it or get carried away in the world of chaos and ups and downs then he could plan for DCA strategy. In this John simply makes a planner and sets his end goal such as how much money he wants to put in the Bitcoin?Let us say John plans to buy two times in a month on 5th and 25th of every month. However John will always do this irrespective of the price of bitcoin on those dates. Now let us price of bitcoin on 5th was 1000 bucks and on the 25th it was around 1200 bucks. This way he will repeat the cycle every month and might do it over 2 years. Due to volatility it is possible that bitcoin may go all the way from 1000 bucks (Starting cost when John started) to let's say 35,000 bucks by two year ended. However for John the cost would be average of every month later averaged with two years average. The final result would be such that he will be in positive investment as compared to those who bought at 35,000 k or who bought at 1000 k but kept selling and buying all the time. :-)Definitely helpful strategy in the volatile world of bitcoin or other coins if you are proper planner and consistent with it.",

      "body": "This is the best strategy to work with long-term accumulation and there are too many reasons to do DCA, It reduces risk on investment, it is more efficient in terms of the average price achievement for the total holdings in the sideways-moving market. It boosts the profit more than the regular spot entries. Everyone can use it according to the plan there is no minimum valuation. Long term investment should be focused with the DCA is per my experience all in is gambling.",

I always plan in a bear market because I take advantage of a good situation for this opportunity, regarding financial management it must be considered because I always spend money on investing in this DCA strategy every time. weekly with an allocation of $50/$100 depending on how I can make other money but I always try in this practice to always be effective in long-term Bitcoin accumulation, this is quite simple but it takes patience and also good money management.",

This strategy is indeed very effective to continue to collect assets for a certain period of time on a regular basis and it will be better when there is a bearish occurrence because there will be more assets owned but at a cheaper price.In the DCA Average strategy, purchases will be known by making a portfolio of how many assets have been purchased.

This will also test how strong the resilience of your capital is. investment for long-term goals with a DCA strategy will also be maximized if it is balanced with the amount of reserve money and management that is carried out as I mentioned earlier. Risk reduction that provides liquidity and flexibility to the portfolio will be more secure when the market is crashing. and keep in mind also that psychology will also play an important role, so never leave the initial strategy and change course. do it consistently and wait for the profits to arrive it will be good for the future.",
