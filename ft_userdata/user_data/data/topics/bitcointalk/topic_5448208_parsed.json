  "content": "Q is a new EVM compatible blockchain with innovative features never seen before in crypto. Consensus is managed by Root Nodes that enforce a legally binding constitution on validators, arbitrate edge cases and slash validators not abiding by the constitution. A DAO and a series of DeFi DApps are built directly into the protocol and can be accessed from https://HQ.Q.org. Gas fees expended when using built in DApps are redistributed to Q token holders. The protocol has integrated staking and gnosis vault plus built in DApps including synthetic assets, lending/borrowing, and a DEX. Q also has an integrated zkSNARKs identity system called Q ID, which is suitable for enterprise and government use cases (voting, government ID, compliance). On a technical level, Q is EVM compatible, has 5 second blocks, and is currently configured to support 101 validators. Additionally, Q is fully regulated in Europe and deemed as not being a security.What really sets Q apart from other blockchains is the fact that it's integrated DAO, QID, regulatory compliance, and legally binding constitution work together to provide users with the safest place to participate in DAO governance and DeFi. QID means that developers and users can be doxxed, which will prevent exit scams and hacks. Being regulatory compliant in coordination with the use of QID means that DeFi on Q will flourish while regulators shut down other DeFi platforms. The built in DAO and constitution mean that incidents like the recent Arbitrum theft of nearly 1 billion USD from the DAO by its founders could not occur on Q Blockchain as DAO participants could sue Arbitrum founders and root nodes could enforce the DAO's proposals.Q has not been listed on an exchange yet, so beware of impersonators.You can learn more about the project and the community at this link https://linktr.ee/qblockchain There are active bounty and airdrop campaigns on the Q Crew3 page at this link https://crew3.xyz/c/qblockchain/questboard",
