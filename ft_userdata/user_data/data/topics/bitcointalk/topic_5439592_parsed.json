      "body": "Yes, this earthquake was extremely violent for the Turkish and Syrian people.   If you take the context, with the Turkish inflation at 186% and with their unsympathetic dictator who shut down social networks just to avoid them asking the question \"Where did the taxes collected (30 billion) for the Earthquake Funding went\", they are really in trouble... Once again, corruption is doing ravages and devestation on the society, so if nature gets involved, it can only become hell for this people...   Fortunately there are some NGOs that are not corrupt, another topic is about that on the forum.I don't know if you have seen but donations in cryptos and BTC are numerous, don't hesitate if you want and can, 10 usd there already helps a lot.Let's wish them the best for the future, may they get up and rebuild freely! Our Turkish friends must keep hope, better days are ahead",
