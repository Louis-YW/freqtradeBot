  "content": "So there is this Nigerian friend of mine who is having a tough time securing admission to the UK. He planned to secure a second degree in the UK and he's been putting work gathering documents, one of the requirements happened to be IELTS which he sat for earlier this year. But to his carelessness and inexperience, he wrote the wrong test, when he was supposed to write the IELTS UKVI academic rather he wrote the standardized IELTS academic.Having sent the result to two different universities, he got rejected and was asked to provide the IELTS UKVI instead.The question goes thus, do we have any schools in the UK that accepts the standardized IELTS academic for admission? OF COURSE, he can rewrite another one for UKVI but that requires another funds and time.All ideas are welcome, thank you.",
