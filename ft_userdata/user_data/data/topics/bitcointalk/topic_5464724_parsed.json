  "content": "Historical background:With the end of the \"gold standard\" where there was a fixed price for gold and every currency linked to the value of gold, the gold standard was abandoned in 1971, causing a free fall in the value of the dollar and an insane rise in inflation rates, the deal that arose in 1973 between the United States and Saudi Arabia Things returned to normal, and what is known as the petrodollar appeared to us, which includes pricing, trading and recycling of oil and the money generated from it in US dollars only.I am not trying here to say that the system that created the petrodollar system may come to an end, but some changes have already begun to occur, as the Central Bank of India unveiled a new framework for settling global trade in rupees.QuoteFirst, the two giants agreed to settle trade in their local currencies — in an effort to cut transaction costs and eliminate dollar conversions. They also agreed to set up a real-time payment link to simplify cross-border money transfers.The agreements will enable “seamless cross-border transactions and payments, and foster greater economic cooperation,” the Reserve Bank of India explained in a recent statement.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-being-dethroned-india-just-201500390.html?guccounter=1Can we say that trading using local currencies has become an attractive trend, especially with countries beginning to diversify their reserves, or is everything that is happening an attempt to put political pressure on the United States?",

Why? Simple, let's go back in time a bit:March 8, 2023India's oil deals with Russia dent decades-old dollar dominancehttps://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/indias-oil-deals-with-russia-dent-decades-old-dollar-dominance-2023-03-08/then a bit later:May 4, 2023India, Russia suspend negotiations to settle trade in rupeeshttps://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/india-russia-suspend-negotiations-settle-trade-rupees-sources-2023-05-04/So, what happened?Easily, the same thing that will happen in this case, or any other case, is the one that gets paid in rupee or ruble or other shitcoin will realize that is no way of buying anything else for that toilet paper except for the case it imports more stuff from that country, so unless you make a deal in which you buy 1 billion worth of oil and pay back one billion worth of products then nobody will take your toilet paper.But if you trade 1 billion of merchandise for 1 billion of merchandise, then what's the point of using any currency when this is basic barter?It's pretty simple, everyone tries to screw the other while claiming it's a fight against the world order or any other kind of bullshit!Let me ask you, would you like to be paid in Bonobo coins rather than Bitcoin? Of course not, that's why every single deal in which you exchange Cottonelle to Scott toilet paper will end juts like the one above!And btw, just the thought of the UAE dumping the dollar is hilarious!You do know that the UAE dirham is pegged at a fixed value to......the $, right?",

It's all about how good the relationships have been, this will continue if the bonds are becoming weak everyday.However, this would have been more better if they are the one that sold the barrel and it was deal on Rupees, it will means the country currency will appreciate and other companies that are working in India will have no choice but to do the same, they will source for rupees and indirectly gives more value in the country. Though, that's if the citizens are not over dependent on USD to import goods in the country.",

Indian rupees and dirhams may be used for citizens’ transfers. The same money may be used to buy meat from Brazil or products from China.

The implementation of this policy now is proof that both nations are serious about the policy. This is a good step because India and the UAE are major trade partners. In 2022-2023 their trade transaction was worth about $84.5 billion and they are still committed to expanding their investment. The choice of using their local currency has economic benefits because it is cheaper and more convenient. The hurdles of converting their local currency to the dollar have been eradicated by this move. The problem now is how many nations will be willing to accept the rupee from the Arab Emirates (UAE) for International trade. The dollar makes payment systems in international trade easy and stable. Both nations still have to engage in trade with other nations that accept only dollar payments which means that the rupee or Durham will still have to be converted to the dollar because the global market is highly dollarized and it will be very difficult to bypass the dollar in international trade. For now, this move is not a threat to the dominance of the dollar but if other nations follow the same local currency payment system and another currency begins to gain international adoption the dollar might start losing its global influence gradually. For now, the dollar is still powerful and safe.",

It is possible for the dollar to lose further relevance and volume outside USA, that is true; but in order to reach just point, it would take more than 1 million barrels of oil. It would require a complete change on how business take place in countries like China, India, Iran, Brazil and some industrialized republics. Just the fact the Federal Reserve offers relatively high interest rates for their bond holders is good enough for institutions and entire countries not to completely ditch their USA bills for other local banknotes.",

It's all about how good the relationships have been, this will continue if the bonds are becoming weak everyday.I quite understand your plight but I wouldn't want to go deep into the de-dollarization as many would want, it will not happen, at least not in the next century. Also, the US dollar and other external currencies are not affecting any nation that is doing well, especially when they export well, they would rather earn more Forex and still be able to feed themselves and locally spend their currency without issues depending on foreign currency. De-dollarization is overemphasized. The world still needs a central currency that is trusted for reserve and such must be that even the strangest and remotest country in the world will still be able to recognize and exchange it for their local currency. Believe me, the USD didn't achieve its feat overnight, it takes economic relevance, politics, philanthropism, leadership and commitment to achieve it. How many of those countries pushing for the so-called de-dollarization have these?What I see is jealousy, they want to be in the US's position overnight, which is never gonna happen because they don't have all it takes. Indians' case is minimal and you can see that in my light tone from the initial post, but certainly not the selfish China and overbearing Russia.The two currencies that could push for this influence that people are not even talking about are the Euro and the Great British Pounds, and even the Swiss Franc. But because people in the Bloc and the UK understood the situation and economics better, they didn't even bother. But rather continue to find their ground of influence in the world and work more on their internal economy instead of enmity.",

Now this agreement has lost relevance. It is not necessary to completely abandon the US dollar in international settlements, it is enough if a significant part of the oil trade switches to mutual settlements in national currencies. The dollar itself, of course, is not going anywhere.",

For decades, the US has been exporting its inflation to developing countries, and now if developing countries learn to trade among themselves in their national currencies, the huge released surplus dollar money supply will have to go back to the US and this is not good news for the US. Actually, this process is already underway and it did not begin today.I can also say that the difficulties with external borrowing for the US will also increase. Already today you can borrow the US government at 5.5% per year (which is comparable to the interest on bonds of many developing countries of the \"third world\"), and servicing your debt costs the US government a trillion dollars a year. Soon the habit of living beyond one's means will cost Americans too much.Quote from: stompix on August 27, 2023, 01:51:51 PMYeah right, what was the world using before 1970?

The are most likely trafficking Russian oil in disguise, because the UAE doesn't produce that much oil compared to it's neighbors. In reality the UAE is probably the middleman, and is trying to send a statement that India is a stronger country without the implication of saying that Russia is being forced to accept a less useful currency in return for their oil. The world is changing, however this is not even a blip in the huge volumes that are being transacted every day and frankly nobody is that keen on accepting the Indian rupee unless it's the only choice they have. This is a marketing ploy that some simpler minds accept without understanding.",

If you can't buy oil with the USD, then why would anybody hold it anymore? The USD is slowly losing its biggest use case which is buying oil. When the USD dies, hopefully bitcoin will take over and maybe then BRICS countries will start using bitcoin. That would be a great win for everybody.",

And what India did is a very good step to take and if they can sustain it forever because leaving dollar for rupees is just like a war against America and America will look for another way to fight back either economic way or technology way. So India should also be prepared to face the drama of theatre that is coming on their way. America will not sit down and watch them.I heard such news in another African Country recently.  A country that the military  just over through their civilian government and took over the government has stopped importation from other countries and I also heard it from another country that is ruling by a military government in Africa that also stopped importation of goods. And if African countries can do this and use their money to buy things in the international market and drop the dollar then, local currencies will have value in their countries. Petrodollar system is the one that is killing the Africans economy.",

Now that Saudi and Iran are at peace, they don't need security anymore. And they have a new ally as well in the form of China. This is all China's initiative of course it is the \"Adversary\" that we knew. But seemingly countries that have been sanctioned by the US are uniting.  As long as India doesn't use Yuan, I guess the US will not see it as a very offending issue. They are friends as far as Mody knows. he needs the US if war breaks in the India-China borders.",

I just hope if this new trend won't affect the price of oil at the international market, especially for countries that heavily depends on oil for their revenue.",
