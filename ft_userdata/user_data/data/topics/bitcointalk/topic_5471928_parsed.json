And then make bets when you see that some good playes are going to miss the match. Another option is just to look at previous matches between the two and include home field or not.An option, even tho not reccomended, would be to just follow someone elses picks.",

      "body": "You don't have the knowledge and also don't want to bet based on the odds still want to bet on it then just choose the team by flipping a coin or something like that.There is no other way in my opinion unless you have having necessary knowledge about the game that you are going to bet. If you don't have the knowledge of a sport then my suggestion will be don't bet on it and just choose the casino game so that you will at least get the game experience as well as the results totally depends on your luck.",

In sports betting, you don't actually need to do some hard and deep research but to be able to form a self-analysis, you really need to interact with that league regularly. But if you are really lazy doing that, you can choose the last one I mentioned to give you some reference.",

I am following some people who analyze NBA or any game that I want to bet, some of them will give insight and prediction before the game start , you can also just search your team in soc media platform many people share their thoughts, it might be or not be but it will be very helpful to know which side is better and which side will won the game.",

      "body": "I'd follow my gut in that case. You say you're a casual fan, so you must have some teams that you like, one at the very least. Bet on it when you feel like they're going to play against weaker teams and bet low.This strategy won't let you win a lot of money but you'll slowly get in the game, start watching matches, learn how this team of yours does. After watching a game you'll know not only how the team you like did but also get some information about their opponents and their game. When the opponents play another game you'll know if you want to bet on them or the other team.One advice from me: do it right or not at all.",

I guess if you don't want to make research about the team and the games that they are going to play, then it's better to follow our NBA betting thread here. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5091185.0There are a lot of members here who share their bet before the game itself, so it's a free tip and with that, you can follow those tips if you like. However, I will say that it's better to familiarize yourself with the team. For sure as a once NBA fan, who knows, maybe your love for it will go back just like the rest of us here.",

Even if you have a limited knowledge about betting or even with the sports as long as you do your basic research then you can place a bet, but if you want to increase your chance of winning then take it seriously while enjoying the game, and I’m sure you’ll love watching NBA and betting as well.",

      "body": "So like this, without you doing research and analysis, you can bet according to your instincts. if you are a fan, at least you have an idea about the sport NBA. Moreover, if you don't just like one team. You can participate according to your wishes and mood when you want to bet. Just don't expect too much if you will get satisfactory results. especially, if you have quite a large betting list. If you are lucky, without researching and analyzing it could happen. Unfortunately, your probability of winning is smaller than someone who knows more about sports.For me, sport is not just about chance. It is important to know that odds are the final reference for the results of research and analysis that we have carried out previously. or, it could be vice versa. Well, it all depends on how you involve certain variables in the gambling session. Let me tell you a little, I like the NBA, but prefer football. In football, there are coaches, players, systems, patterns and everything related to them. Not infrequently, I check the two teams that will compete as a whole. Also, it's important to get every new piece of information I can gather. why do I do this, the aim is none other than to minimize losses and hope to win the bet. although in reality, the final result always involves luck. but let's try to imagine, without us knowing every ins and outs of the sport that we just like, even if it is a favorite, you can imagine for yourself the results if you refer to what is described.",

I do agree on some points or comments that you shouldnt really be doing this casually yet you wont really be that be able to enjoy yourself if you arent really that interested at all. There's so much information which you would really be needing to know first before you could really be able to handle yourself with this sport but since OP mentioned that he is making some interest with NBA then taking up small steps would doand be active to see specially on the games and of course he should really be that eyeing on a certain team on which he do likes. If he would really be liking to focus on that team then its his choice but we know that it is possible to have multiple teams for you to bet on, as long you do know on what their history and performances. Everything would matter on how good you are on finding some information and updates + some mix of intuition when making up some bets.",

It is easier that way to follow up the matches and the statistics of your favorite teams.If you are not willing to do your own research and your own analysis, perhaps because you do not have much time to do so, I would recommend you to try to find channels in YouTube which summarize matches of the NBA in a few minutes, so you do not have to spend your time watching the matches from beginning to end.It would be matter of you taking some minutes of your spare time to watch those videos for a couple of months, so you get a clearer idea on how teams are performing in this season before putting your money on the table.

Whether you do research or not, you can simply cast your bets on your favorite teams. You can do that for fun if you want to but it's better if you'll allot time first before you make a bet just for your assurance that you know what you've been doing. But if can accept losses and you can bear that, that's okay as long as you don't do that on a streak and you learn a lesson every time you lose.
