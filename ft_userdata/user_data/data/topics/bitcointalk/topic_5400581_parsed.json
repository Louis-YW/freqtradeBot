  "content": "In the name of God--------------Terms:- Escrow accepted- Maximum $200 for each order (with escrow). For more need to negotiate...- Shipping is on you-------------Rates (Commission):X = Total price (include item price + domestic shipping + international shipping)With Escrow:         X from $0 to $50 : $1 + %10         X from $51 to $200 : $1 + %6     for example:         $70 total price, Commission will be $8         $110 total price, Commission will be $7.6Without Escrow:         X from $0 upward : %3 (only item price is accounted, no commission on international shipping price)-------------Rate for International shipping:   Actually varies based on country and post service, Here is some example for EMS shipping:   Package with weight of 2kg to to >> China: $53, Italy: $53, Canada: $65, Japan: $65, ask for other locations-------------Important Note: Before each order and payment, I should ask the post office in order to be sure your package is deliverable.Sometimes it is illegal to post some items to specific countries. For example Australia bans all incoming beans, and so on.-------------I do live in Iran. As in 80s decade in many western countries, the digital marketing platforms are just getting more and more popular here in Iran. You can buy goods even from most far villages in the country and receive goods within few days. recently new platforms started to work which are a combination of \"Social Media Network\" and \"Retail Store\" - similar to ebay or etsy or even Chinese taobao- where converted to giant retail stores!Iran have some famous Souvenirs (local goods) which are among bests in the world: Stone HandcraftsFiroozeh Kubi, etc... Metal HandcraftsEnamelwork (Minakari), engravings (Ghalamzani), Rings PaitingsPersian Miniarute (مینیاتور), Rings Caret And Rugs Persian Carpet , Kilim, Ziloo, Wall hanging mini carpet etc. Food related (healthy food)Saffron, Pistachio, herbs, etc links for more reading on internet:https://www.mcth.ir/english/Handicrafts/Selected-Handicrafts-http://persianfoodtours.com/persian-food-souvenir/There are several retail stores working on Iranian local goods mainly:http://basalam.comhttp://digikala.comhttp://keshmoon.com (quality saffron)These are top retail websites in Iran, you can browse them with Chrome and use translate feature to translate to your languagePayment[/glow]Bitcoin escrow accepted. After you escrow bitcoin, i'll buy goods (from different sites different sellers) and pack them into one package and send to your address all around the world!I do get a 20% commission - minimum $10, so you do pay for goods itself, domestic shipping (~$1 per shipping) from seller warehouse to our warehouse in Iran, international post shipping ($20-$50 per kg for express shipping) and finally some custom clearance which you (probably) should pay to your local post officer.Examples[/glow]for example you need these items:5 grams of grade A saffron~1810000 IRR = $7 !500gr grade A Persian green Cumin~710e3 IRR = $3100gr grade A Persian black Cumin~410e3 IRR = $1.51kg grade A Persian Barberries~1.663 IRR = $3Total$14.5The goods price is $14.5 until here, Goods are from 4 different sellers, so $1/package or less is usually for domestic shipping. So $4 for domestic shippingTotal Weight equals to : 5gr+500gr+100gr+1kg = 1605gr. the international post do round it up so will charge for 2kg, for example if you want it in Germany, we must ship the 2kg package from Iran to Germany, currently there two different channels:1- Economic post: $45 for 2kg package from Iran to Germany (2-3 week)2- Express post: $65 for 2kg package from Iran to Germany (1-2 week)for example you need economic post, so the total amount you should pay is:$14.5 (goods price) + $10 (my commission) + $4 (domestic shipping) + $45 (international shipping) = $71If you want to buy same items from Amazon for example you should pay:5gr saffron$251kg high quality barberries$24450gr green cumin$18.5300gr caraway$10Total$77The difference between amazon goods and Iran local goods is: Amazon.com's packaging are betterIranian local goods quality are better than amazon'sSo if you concern for quality more than packaging, then you can buy from basalam for lower price and higher goods quality.",

      "body": "Quote from: patricklix on July 25, 2022, 07:45:05 PMI don't know if it's expensive or not, since I'm not particularly interested in Middle Eastern products, but I really like the design of persian rugs modern because they can add atmosphere to a room without standing out from the rest of the furniture. If I had the chance, I would even consider getting one, but unfortunately, I don't at the moment. Hi,Sorry for late reply...Well, I can tell you there are more than dozen types of Persian rugs, at least locally. Which color/template are you interested? you can use google to find a sample rug which you like is color and template, then send it here. If you send the link of one, then I can give you hyperlink of several items for you to see and price for each one. I have access to big local markets, endless options are available...Also which size are you interested? usual sizes are this (i found from internet)Thanks",

      "body": "I think Persian rugs are classified into two major groups: Hand-made rugs and Machine-made rugs. for more info see this:https://www.google.com/search?q=hand+made+vs+machine+made+rugsMachine made ones are much cheaper than handmade ones. for example look at these:#1: This rug is machine-made:https://www.digikala.com/product/dkp-1825917/rug/Grade: A+ A B C DSize: 200 x 290 cm (6.5 by 9.5 foot)Price (in Iran) : ~$100#2: This rug us hand-made:https://basalam.com/gerehcarpetir/product/4102203?from=searchGrade: A+ A B C DSize: 200 x 290 cm (6.5 by 9.5 foot)Price (in Iran) : ~$450As you can see hand-made one is at least 4x more expensive. But the build quality of hand-made rugs are not comparable with machine-made ones. Hand-mades are way better... Even with lower grade. I think Persian hand-made rugs are much more wee known than machine-made ones.Have a look of above links with google chrome, google chrome will translate it to your language. there are also user reviews on those pages...",
