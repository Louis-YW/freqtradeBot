  "content": "Twitter, one of the largest social media platforms has sparked rumours about it's plans to offer buying and selling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on it's platform. If this eventually happens, it could have significant impacts on the future of cryptocurrency and social media.Right now, twitter has about 237.8 million users worldwide, this move towards crypto would bring about awareness and education about cryptocurrency to a wider audience. Which could lead to increased acceptance of crypto currency as a legitimate form of payment and investment.Asides from awareness and promotion, by allowing users to buy and sell crypto currency Twitter could potentially open up new revenue streams for itself. This move could also increase the overall liquidity to the crypto market.Despite have advantages, there are also downside to consider. For example, the volatility of the crypto market could pose alot of risks and losses to potential investors who are not familiar with how the market works.Furthermore this could lead to an exponential increase in the regulatory inspection of the Blockchain industry especially in relation to KYC( know your customer) regulations, which could increase costs and operation challenges for companies operating in the cryptocurrency space.Twitter's rumored move towards cryptocurrencies could have consequences for both the crypto industry and social media platforms. While the advantages of increased adoption of cryptocurrencies and new revenue streams are important, the risks associated with volatility and regulatory scrutiny cannot be ignored. Overall, it is too early to say what the future holds for Twitter and cryptocurrencies, but it is clear that this is a space worth keeping an eye on.For more information you can use the links belowhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/investing/twitter-partners-with-etoro-to-offer-research-investment-trading-facility/%23:~:text%3DTwitter%2520is%2520partnering%2520with%2520online,investments%252C%2520exchange%252Dtraded%2520funds.&ved=2ahUKEwiwgILF8qv-AhWYjaQKHW2rArEQFnoECBYQBQ&usg=AOvVaw16bN4_vs9lW2b-9iolznDphttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/13/etoro-to-offer-crypto-trading-directly-to-twitter-users/%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwi5o56w8qv-AhWJqaQKHR6NAAMQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw15dBTsN7pUnnJdWID3aJMv",

The expanded feature will enable users to view market charts and engage in buying and selling activities directly from eToro within the Twitter app.Currently, users can already access real-time trading data from TradingView on index funds such as the S&P 500 and select company shares like Tesla. However, concerns have been raised about Elon Musk's impact on the cryptocurrency market, with his careless tweets nearly triggering a bull run. Although many are skeptical about Musk's influence in the crypto market, they still view him as a valuable player in the space, considering his status as the second richest man in the world. It's unclear what his plans are regarding Twitter's recent move to partner with eToro.source;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/13/twitter-to-let-users-access-stocks-crypto-via-etoro-in-finance-push.html",

I hope Twitter or any social media will not enable trading directly all because the social media owner is looking for more money and not considering his users. It should be social media, not a place for trading like brokers and exchanges.",

I know it's business, and every organization is out there to make money. It's price positive with Dogecoin, so it will be for Bitcoin if it actually happens. But Elon Musk can just stand up one day and revoke the trade. which might at the same time have a temporary negative impact on the price of bitcoin.",

If any challenge comes up in the future and they need to track a user, they may be forced to share the user's location or mobile number, which the person uses to link to their Twitter account.",

Each new week there is something new involving this guy on the news: it can be a joke, a crazy plan or any other bizarre thing that will bring him views, popularity and profit.Anyway, Twitter becoming an exchange platform would only work if he were able to offer competitive rates with rival exchanges. People wouldn't use it just because it's Twitter or because it belongs to Elon Musk. With so many exchanges nowadays, I think it's a risky business to venture into.",

Centralized exchange do record your IP address, you're not allowed to use VPN.This mean even you're not submit your KYC, the centralized exchange already know some of your information and they will record it.I don't think private information in centralized exchange is secure due to hack and data breach, privacy is one of few important thing in decentralization.QuotePeople that store their coins on exchanges is doing that because of ignorance. It is stupidity to people that know how stupid it is to store coins on exchanges.I'm not talking about the security of centralized exchange, but I tell the fact. If all people are store their coins on their non custodial wallet, the hacker who hack the exchange will not able to steal huge amount money because people move their coins on their own wallet, right?QuoteBitcoin do not need Twitter, the adoption will continue because people have many other social places they can be exposed to bitcoin.

True Bitcoin do not need twitter, but if twitter adopted Bitcoin, there's always an effect regardless it's small or big.Twitter or Elon Musk not really help a lot since they only accept Bitcoin, that's all.

In fact, recently twitter just change their logo to $Doge as an example on how crypto is already popular on twitter. If twitter will plan to do this then they will launch separate platform for their exchange that separates it on their social media. All I say is twitter people know the existence of crypto and those that still don't invest on Bitcoin have there personal reason and not just because they are out of reach on Bitcoin trading.",

Maximum times such centralized platforms provide personal information to law enforcement agencies which is not at all fair, just from the fear of disturbance in the operational activity in a particular region leaking the user's personal data is unjust. Also, centralized platforms on the backend maximum of the time try to make some greedy deals as FTX recently, MTGOX in the past, and direct market manipulation using reserves. Decentralization can not be adopted directly but with time we can achieve the true form of decentralization. On the second end Storing assets on the exchanges is like",
