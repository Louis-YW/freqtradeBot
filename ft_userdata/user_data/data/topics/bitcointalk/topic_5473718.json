No.There are more small and medium miners that point their gear wherever they want to.If one pool gets too big, or in their opinion gets too big miners will point elsewhere.It has happened in the past and will happen again.Yes you have a lot of places with their own gear but compared to the people with 1 or 2 or 50 miners who will point elsewhere if they feel the network is loosing it's decentralization it's not a worry.-Dave",

Therefore, it is obvious that governments will do all what they can to diminish the influence of Bitcoin in the global financial system. I am also afraid that participation of big institutions in Bitcoin via ETFs could jeopardize its decentralization, potentially concentrating the ownership of Bitcoin in few hands.

He already knew what all could be possible.So no, Bitcoin will never lose decentralization.Exactly. There's no two ways about the fact that Bitcoin can never be centralized. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is like a foundation of a building which when built, you cannot change it unless you have to pull down the structure from the root. That is what makes Bitcoin unique and what it is today. The moment someone out their comes out with a concept like Bitcoin in the name of a centralized system, we already know it is not Bitcoin because it's simply and basically lacking the concept behind which it is known for.Another aspect that have been hammered on when discussing the future of Bitcoin is whether it will last forever or not. The most suiting response to that question is that although nothing on the face of the earth that will last forever but because Bitcoin has been built in an open sourced manner, it will definitely stand the test of time. In another words, it will last long in time.",

But isn't it a thing to be afraid of? What if more mining pools or firms start doing these practices? I just noticed the news is more than two years old already. I researched about it a little more and came to know that later next month, marathon says they won't censor transactions anymore [1].Why would a mining pool start practicing this thing, which will eventually destroy the decentralization of Bitcoin? Does OFAC force them to follow any rules to operate their business? [1] Marathon says its mining pool will stop censoring transactions following bitcoin community outcry",

Here are some reasons why:Increased Accessibility: An ETF makes it easier for a broader range of investors, including institutional investors and retail investors, to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This increased accessibility can lead to a more diverse ownership base.Reduced Concentration of Ownership: Currently, a significant portion of Bitcoin ownership is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of holders. The introduction of a Bitcoin ETF could attract a larger number of investors, distributing ownership more widely and mitigating the concentration risk.Institutional Participation: Institutional investors, which often have large pools of capital, may find it more convenient and compliant to invest in Bitcoin through regulated financial instruments like ETFs. Their participation can contribute to a more balanced and decentralized ownership structure.Regulatory Recognition: The approval of a Bitcoin ETF by regulatory authorities can signal a level of acceptance and legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class. This regulatory recognition may encourage a broader range of investors to participate, further decentralizing ownership.Market Liquidity: An ETF can enhance market liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell Bitcoin exposure. Increased liquidity often attracts a more diverse set of participants, contributing to a decentralized market structure.While a Bitcoin ETF can contribute to decentralization, it's important to note that decentralization is a multifaceted concept, and factors such as mining distribution, network nodes, and community governance also play crucial roles in determining the overall decentralization of the Bitcoin network.",
