You have to love your coins so that you will be motivated to trade if not I don't think you will do well if you are not motivated by your coins.Therefore the two advise you have might be contrary to someone progress.",

For me, the first advice is do your own diligence when doing research before you decide to invest in crypto, not just in crypto but this applies to all investments as well. Second, invest at your own risk. You cannot just invest if you can‚Äôt take the losses. Always invest on the amount you can manage to lose so you won‚Äôt be regretting when your investment fails in the end.",

Do you feel the same about the money in your wallet or bank account? Love, greed, envy and ignorance are only obstacles when it comes to any risky investment.My one and only advice is: don't invest in something you don't understand, because the chances of you experiencing a financial fiasco are much higher than success.",

If you got attached to Celcius, one more piece of advice you can share is risk of high APY.Projects that promise to give high APY especially too high APY than average APY of the industry is high risky. They will run something like Ponzi with abnormal high APY to attract investors. If you join early, you are fine and can enjoy good yield but a later you join, more risk you will get and afford to lose your money.CZ‚Äôs FAQ 8 - On LUNA/UST and Taking the Right RisksQuoteThe other fundamental flaw was the over-aggressive incentives. Specifically, Anchor‚Äôs 20% fixed APY to push for (in-organic) growth. Let‚Äôs strip away all the fluffy stuff and look at fundamentals. You can use incentives to attract users to your ecosystem. But eventually, you need to generate ‚Äúincome‚Äù to sustain it, i.e., more revenue than the expenses. Otherwise, you will run out of money and crash. High APYs Don‚Äôt Necessarily Mean Healthy ProjectsIt‚Äôs now obvious that the whole thing was built on a self-perpetuating, shallow concept. While Terra did have an ecosystem with some use cases, the speed of growth of the ecosystem did not match the speed of the incentives used to attract new users. The growth was ‚Äúhollow‚Äù. Eventually, the bubble burst, and here we are. Key lesson: don‚Äôt just chase high APY. Look at fundamentals.",

You should know the risks involved and how to manage those risks. Otherwise, you will lose your investment and eventually lose all your funds. Second, Do not go all-in investing. It‚Äôs safer to diversify your portfolio but make sure you put your money on high potential crypto coins rather than trusting on new released projects that have no guarantees if they can sustain their value in the long term.",

I know many have done one or two things wrong in the crypto space, so what's yours? Mind sharing? About this statement, you always seem to hold altcoins which of course will have a big impact when you love them too much and don't sell them when the price is very high.But it will be different if you hold and already love bitcoin, bitcoin has never disappointed anyone including me. Because if you continue to hold bitcoin from a bitcoin price below $ 10k and you continue to hold it until now, then you will have many advantages.A fatal mistake when choosing an altcoin as a favorite coin and when the price starts to get high does not sell it. Altcoins will be greatly affected by bitcoin, rather than having to hold altcoins that are still affected by other coins, it is better to hold Bitcoin and that is definitely more recommended.And you need to remember, that crypto investment has a high risk, you are really aware and confident when you get into crypto. Even as big as Celsius, you can go bankrupt, especially if we are only small investors trying to do it to fight the market.",

Because it means the platform has to pay out high interest rates to its users. Imagine if you had to pay high interest rates to a bank or some loan shark to pay off a debt. What do you think will happen?You'll go bankrupt really quick, one way or another. And that's exactly what happened to these platforms.

So I'll advise that newbies stay away from such shitty business and learn how to do their own research about a certain project. Not your key not your coins: This advice is mostly due to the FTX fiascos, actually it turned out that most crypto enthusiast who have never thought about removing their Bitcoin/crypto from exchanges learned a lot from the incident and now majority of users now store their coin in a non-custodial wallet. Also those just entering into the ecosystem should try as much as possible to adopt the NOT YOUR KEY NOT YOUR COIN ideology, it's really going to save them from trouble in the long run.",

Don't fall too much in love with altcoins even though they have become big but in the end it is hopeless and actually makes investors lose because you believe too much in these altcoins, we have to stay away from altcoins more because this will not give anything unless you move faster taking profits, so I just eliminated the altcoins in my portfolio and more on bitcoin being the main one for the coin as a long term not to be disillusioned for me.Regarding the problem of mistakes in the past, it is clear that I have felt how big a loss is due to expecting too much with an altcoin pump of 100x or even more, but now I realize that it was all a trap for me, then I thought and introspected myself over the mistakes several times in the past and more in bitcoin which makes the real investment not in altcoins.",
