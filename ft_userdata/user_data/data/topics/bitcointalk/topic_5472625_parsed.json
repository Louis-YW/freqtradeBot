  "content": "Hey everyone,I have been betting sports for almost 20 years. I currently have what I believe to be an issue with two bets I made on the same match with stake.com. (Fifa match)I truly believe that stake.com and their odds provider sports radar have completely scammed me for almost $10,000 but I would like opinions of other players before I look to take this further.Please give me your honest opinion. I am not here to just hear what I want, I truly want to know what you would think in this situation and how it should be handled.Please keep in mind that I have bet thousands of e sports matches and I have never seen this happen before. I would also like to mention that stake.com‚Äôa customer support 100% dislikes me so they refuse to even assist in any form.Match was scheduled to start at 2:00am my time which means my bets were placed BEFORE the match.Here are the two bets placed at 1:57am and 1:59am respectively. Both FIRST HALF bets.https://ibb.co/VgsPBmBhttps://ibb.co/ncRFNfPIf you are on stake.com, here are the BET IDS.sport:110090760sport:110090969Here is proof of the score and live stream.Proof of score and live stream - as you can see, the first half was played, without issue and completed with a score of 2-1 for Alicia.https://ibb.co/BcBbVSqhttps://ibb.co/pQW5k5Fhttps://ibb.co/FBNs1hfHere is the OFFICIAL match video from the tournament.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4c0i8zyFBHkIf you watch the video, you will see that the girls randomly quit the game around the 70th minute when the score is 2-2Here are the sports rules for stake.com for fifa and e sportshttps://ibb.co/p1xvH57https://ibb.co/0JXqqXxhttps://ibb.co/FVSfwY9https://ibb.co/L6VXJngIn my opinion, if this was a real soccer match, the first half bets would have been settled regardless if the game finished or not.I think stake.com has slipped up here and this needs to get infront of the eyes of an experienced sports guy from stake.com.",

(Fifa match)edit:I didn't Understand those options you picked... atleast one of them, (Alicia), But I know too well that the option on overs with \"Asian\" doesn't seem to be predicted like the normal \"over home/away goals\" \"either half\" etc... Are you sure your prediction wasn't based on the Asian \"overs\" cus Obviously, Arsenal Played a 2-1 victory for the full time and that's clearly over 2.5 goals ... Although you staked for halftime which the result was 2:0 I can't conclude since I don't really know what option (Alicia) is... Is it even an option?? I dunno.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

But however, I think the Stake casino representative here on this forum should have a better answer to why your game was void after it was successfully submitted.I'm guessing it's due to the paused/postponed esports rule because the match wasn't completed, and it was interrupted or stopped around 70' based on the YouTube VOD that OP linked.I also think OP should've won that because, in other sportsbooks, they'll settle those total bets while the game is still live. Maybe their postponed rule has a higher priority over everything else and it's why his ticket got pushed in the end.",

Once the first half is played and completed without issue, the bets should be paid instantly. What happens after that point in the match has not relevance to my bet. See, this is the thing, with the new fifa games, bets aren‚Äôt settled until the game is completed because it‚Äôs completely automated.However, the problem here is, I‚Äôm not able to get someone from stake with common sense to actually investigate my bets and see that I won. They continue to refuse to watch the video when I clearly won.I don‚Äôt complain when I lose but I shouldn‚Äôt have to chase my winnings when I do win. This is a response I got from their ‚Äúcomplaints team‚Äùhttps://ibb.co/WDSYSZnThey also just avoid watching the video completely. They have also stated that their terms of service indicate they can do so but I don‚Äôt see that anywhere.",
