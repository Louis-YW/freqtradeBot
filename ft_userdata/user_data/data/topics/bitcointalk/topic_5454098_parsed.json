Here is a fact for people like you.If you accept this fact early on, then you will have a more successful journey in the crypto space.You can't just have someone message you with an idea that can change your life, why don't they take advantage of it and get rich first?They want to use you and it's let for you to use your head. I don't see rich people willingly going around telling people how to get rich either, they won't. Let's stop fooling ourselves, everyone is running after something.Be smart because this crypto space is like a wild west, you are on your own, and the only way to find your way is believing in yourself and the knowledge you are acquiring on this forum. Nothing comes without a price, work your way up, if everyone has the poor antidote everyone will be rich, including all your neighbors and friends. It's not easy to get rich and that's why people are taking advantage of people. Work your way UP.",

If someone approaches you out of nowhere and tries to make you believe that they can make you rich, it's the opposite way around. You'll be the one that shall add to their riches because they'll fool you with whatever instruction that they're going to give you on what and where you should invest on this market.",

      "body": "I totally agree with that. Nothing worthwhile comes easily. If you don't put in hard work and come up with your own original ideas, success will be hard to get. It's true that you might get paid for working under someone or simply copying and pasting things you find elsewhere but you'll find yourself wasting alot of time for just a few bucks. Meanwhile, the website owner or the person who brought you into this business will be making thousands of dollars. That's just the difference.So as OP said, everyone should work their way up. Instead of wasting time on useless websites trying to earn pennies it's better to invest your time in learning things that will help you reach higher positions in the future.",

I thought the OP was among the mischievous lot who try to squeeze out money from unsuspecting/ignorant individuals using numerous means. I was curious to read and perhaps laugh at whatever method you would recommend on how someone could get rich overnight. You just cannot get rich overnight, unless you happen to come across a gazillion dollars that has no owner lol. Why would you believe someone you barely know claiming to know of a so called investment or business that would triple your capital in a short while. I think this all boils down to doing ones research and not having to readily believe whatever anyone tells you without having some doubt about its validity. You can’t get anywhere in this life without hard work and being consistent in your endeavors.",

So true. I came here because of the title, but instead of being interested in the offer written in the title, I came here to clarify the contents of the title. There is no specific formula that can guarantee someone to get rich quickly after going through the points taught step by step. Something of value will never be obtained easily, to become rich must go through a long process.It's the same with crypto assets, you have to go through a process that takes quite a long time to become a reliable investor, but there is no guarantee that you will always be successful in investing. Everyone wants to be rich, but wealth will not come to everyone, so until now there are still poor people around us.",

Well OP, nah. I didn't really click the link because of the title, but I was curious to see how would others react to this since I knew already in the first place that this is just a clickbait otherwise this thread could have been trashed already in less than 12 hours. These kinds of \"kindness scam\" are also common in FB if you would ask me. I was browsing a lot of crypto news lately there and saw a lot of dummy accounts claiming that they can help you earn $40/day which is kinda high here in my country since I live in a third-world country. Truth is nobody will ever tell you how to get rich let alone even earning money easily. You just got to get our asses out there and grind the fuck out of there.In crypto, it's a whole lotta worse considering how many investments could be made in here and you never know which one will take your money away or which one will give that juicy 2x to you.",

Rich people don't share all the recipes for getting rich but only provide an outline and let us develop it according to our abilities and expertise. And we can't depend on them to get rich instead, we need to work hard and remember everything takes time. So it's better to enjoy the process and don't think about when this will be achieved because, by the time you achieve it, you won't notice it. Everything will happen slowly, and you will become rich later. But isn't health a priceless wealth?",

This was not my reason for clicking on this post. I did that because I was surprised that we have such people around here. I was anticipating joining other members to give the OP the needed advice. I have never been moved by get-rich-quick enterprise and it has helped me to stay safe from scammers. Nobody will give you wealth just like that because everybody needs more money. Days are gone when people were given Bitcoin freely with little or no effort. Any investment that promises to make you rich fast without effort is likely a scam. Hard work, determination, and sacrifice are key virtues that will lead to durable riches. If the scheme promises to give you a high profit, just be careful and do your own research.",

If your hustle is right and clean it will be hard to sit someone down and offload all you know into their heads unless their are your children. Those who works for real must have thought about how much they suffered trying to make money, they will surely want someone else to pass through the hard journey too.",

In a sense the ebook is the trick, nothing to learn in there. Intelligent people would ask why they are selling the cow, the seller already cooked up a delicious response for questions like that writing the book.
