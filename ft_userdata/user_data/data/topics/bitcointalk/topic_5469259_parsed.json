  "content": "I'm still a beginner here, because I just came to the forum about a few months ago. I like discussing on the meta and reputation boards because there the members discuss well and don't just fulfill posting quotasAs far as I know, trust systems and merit systems are built for a specific purpose:# The trust system was created to protect members from fraudulent activities and keep their money safe from fraudsters# The merit system was created to minimize account farmers and spammersBoth of these things are subjective and free for the DT (trust system) to mark +/=/- and the merit source (merit system) to send the merit to whoever they like. I don't know if they abuse their power there are consequences for them or not. But they are members with special powers who work like forum police and make the forum better even though sometimes there are members who complain because they feel discriminated against due to wrongful accusations.I don't want to talk about DT, because I've been dealing with one of the DT members and I've given up  Regarding the source of merit, I have never had a problem sending your merit to anyone, as it is your right, but this person seems especially niceSo the question is?A lot has been said about this, so I won't add any more questions. If you want to write feedback, please do so, if not, that's okay. This is just what I wanted to write",

That's simply not true, especially in flagrant cases of abuse of the system. Another thing is cases where for a personal matter that has little to do with trading risk, two DTs end up red tagging each other, and things like that, where the community simply waits for them to resolve the differences between them and end up deleting the tags. But if someone flagrantly misuses the trust system they end up massively distrusted, so out of DT.",

It would have been good if theymos is selecting new merit sources, but he is not taking anyone since many years ago. Anyone that is worth it and applying for merit source are not taken, which are all reputed members on this forum.Quote from: Cantsay on October 05, 2023, 07:54:59 AMYou can also earn those 49 merits from him if you really want to, all you have to do is to learn how to speak and write “German Duetsch” and that way you can join his discharge and also earn the 49 merits you so much desired that made you create an entire disguised as trust related thread, and if you can’t learn it then you might as well mind your business and continue doing what you’ve been doing. He does not need to, if he continue to post good, he will continue to earn merit and rank up. One thing about merit system that people should know is that it is perfect against low quality posts and spams, but no totally perfect because of exactly this complain, favoritism.",

Don't take my word for it:Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIf they complain about amounts, tell them to complain to me.And here's this:Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIt's best if sources try to exhaust their source allocations, even if it means giving posts higher amounts than is typical. If you have 150 source merit and you only see 3 merit-worthy posts in a month, then I'd rather you over-give each of them 50 merit than let the merit expire. That way there are more people capable of sending merit, and the \"merit economy\" is less top-down.It looks like qwk is not very active and empties his sMerit source once a month now. I'd say it's a case of \"not great, not terrible\".",
