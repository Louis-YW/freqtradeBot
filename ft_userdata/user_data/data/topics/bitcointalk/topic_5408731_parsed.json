I am curious why someone will pay for hunting scams. Though it will inspire some people for hunting scams either they pay or keep themselves. But it would be a nice database if the public can verify scammers from their database.",

At time of writing this post, the reports from top 5 hunters ranging from 300 to 619 reports.Quote from: The Cryptovator on August 05, 2022, 05:04:23 PMBut it would be a nice database if the public can verify scammers from their database. I agree, the report could prevent some people got scammed if the report database is publicly available. If there's privacy concern, the reporter could be allowed to blur/censor non-relevant parts of the proof.",

HAPI is easy to integrate and it operates agnostically on all blockchain solutions.https://hapi-one.gitbook.io/hapi-protocol/They've got money since they've also issued a token, probably 4.5 million so 1k a month is breadcrumbs for them and this might be some sort of publicity stunt to get more funds while showing some results in analytics by linking fresh marked addresses.Of course, there is an ulterior motive and they are not looking for the scammers or how to prevent scams, but, ...whatever",

They are some sort of blockchain analytics platform, so the scam reporters on scamfari are actually doing a very big job for them for just $1,000.I am sure they get paid by exchanges and other platforms that what to trace transactions, especially from hacks like this case",

Quote from: JeromeTash on August 07, 2022, 05:40:10 AMNFT period got nothing on ICO period when it came to scams that were being reported here.Key word is \"here\". The only reason why less scams are reported here than before its because less scammy projects are making announcement threads here. Scamfari report system looks very easy to abuse with fake reports (you create another Telegram account and then just make bs conversation using new wallet that you created just for that purpose and if i learned something so far is that if something can be abused for personal gain, it most certainly will.",
