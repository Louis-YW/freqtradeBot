It is usually suggested to follow the trade mark of these top whales, as this is the only way to earn an excessive amount of money with cryptocurrencies?So far Elon Musk has not been a very effective example if you look at what it has done, Twitter is a good example. I don't think he's a financial management genius.Apart from that, do you think the whales would be better off revealing their real strategy to everyone? Couldn't sending false buy and sell signals be part of their own strategy? In that case, the small investors will be the ones who will be harmed and who will allow the whales to make their money, right?Personally, I think that being influenced by any outside source is too risky, I prefer my DCA strategy and continue mining. It works well for me. Whenever I wanted to follow trends, or to daily trade, it ended pretty badly for me. IMO te best way to earn good amount of money, is to DCA between the bull runs, and to wait patiently",

Following there trading tips only lure one into their trap of investing in a pump and dump coin. If you analyze the past once they hype the coin and many investors follow suit in buying due to the fear of missing out, in days you see most of these coins dumped. It is this called whales that actually withdrew their funds after getting people into it. So to me it is not a great idea to only follow trading tips from the whales. Bitcoin doesn’t have whales because it is very hard to see a whale taking off his coin or making a decision that could shake up bitcoin like whales decides the Alticoins fate.",

FOMO causes prices to continue to rise and because Elons Musk's followers are so many, this will have an effect on prices, there will be flash pumps and flash dumps. Those who lost capital because of Elon's tweets seem to be unprepared for all the risks. Don't follow it if you don't get a bigger risk. it's only for people who can afford to lose, but the profit will also be greater if it succeeds",

I think same strategies are being used for crypto pump and dump to make gains from others' investments. It is high time , people become wise and stop being a gambler and victims of so called whales. Every whales actions is to further increase their own wealth. I think most whales have already invested before announcing, exiting the market when others are coming in base on the information reaching them. This is why whales will continue to be whales and the greedy small investors will continue to be their ladder to next level.",

However there are people who feed from the crumps of the whale, they are mainly the group managers like telegram who get a number of information that you don't have but also manipulate their members against the market because they have to make their own margin profit.

Whales win most of the time because they are the strong hands of the market and they trade against the sentiments and we as investors fail just because of our fast and rushy nature. That doesn't mean we don't make profits we make profits most of the time while whales don't bear loss but they wait for opportunities the profit we make is nothing according to their point of view reason we rush and use to be greedy most of the times which lead us making the tip of profit only.",
