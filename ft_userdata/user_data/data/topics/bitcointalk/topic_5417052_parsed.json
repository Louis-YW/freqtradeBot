If you compare each day on 2010 and each day on 2022, all of them are gain and there's no day where Bitcoin price on 2022 lower than 2010.",

Bitcoin is far better in performance now than gold in terms of asset and profitability, maybe you can try give a look here  Annual and monthly profitability of bitcoin  with article published by Ratimov on this particular aspect, i want you to see bitcoin as multi-facet assets that has more potentiality than gold, bitcoin serves a currency, an asset for investment, unit for store of value and a profitable investment over time than centralized gold. Quote from: Solosanz on October 14, 2022, 07:38:12 AMActually it's pointless to compare the early year of Bitcoin with the current yearthere will always be a need to make reference in order to understand how it all started and have focus to where it's going, it could also encourage beginners new in the system understand better that bitcoin is not a shitcoin",

I don't believe that it is not important to look at Bitcoin price from the beginning and how far it has come and where it could still be. These are some of the proves you need to show how solid the project has turned out to be when compared to others that came way after it which must have also perished.",

I also think like you, do not believe that those who had the opportunity to buy bitcoin at the beginning of the year like 2012 can hold out until now. They could have sold it when it hit $100 or maybe $1000 because bitcoin is as uncertain as it is now and no one could have predicted it would become such a big thing as it is today. As satoshi also said: after 20 years it may be nothing or it will also have a huge trading volume. Bitcoin is unpredictable.",

We've come to a realization that we can never underestimate Bitcoin nor predict that this is just a temporary uplift and it turns down like the old days. But what we have experienced is continuous development and price upgrades bringing more people to recognize this project.

They are now wealthy elite-class people in the world just because they had confidence because of the nature, and features of bitcoin. It's not that easy to forecast the future, at least forecasting what will happen after a decade. I would never say anymore that pioneers were lucky enough to get it faster. It's actually the forecasting capability of the group of people. Check out the below post, the guy was talking such that he was so sure Bitcoin will reach $10k someday. It hit long ago, right after a little more than his prediction of 6 years.Quote from: Anonymous on June 05, 2011, 03:50:32 AMhttp://astrohacker.com/ahc/bitcoin-is-the-economic-singularity/After reading this, the scale of black market and digital economies and the effect Bitcoin will have on them I am pretty certain we are going to be very wealthy men -- even with a sum as small as 10 Bitcoins. It's just so hard to believe. We are only in the beginning storms with these significant rallies from 10 to 20 dollars. I will not be surprised to see prices from hundreds to thousands in the coming months. The world just isn't going to be the same and we have been blessed as the pioneers.What are you going to do with your Bitcoin wealth once your coins hit upwards of $10,000 a pop?Quote from: ethereumhunter on October 14, 2022, 04:00:43 PMI feel like it was a typo rather than saying @OP was drunk and wrote the wrong number lol Lol.
