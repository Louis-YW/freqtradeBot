  "content": "Proof Of Treasure - A new play-to-earn location-finding gameOver the last year we've built a new location finding game where you can win crypto treasure (Proof Of Treasure Coin / POTT) by guessing the location of the game image:       www.proofoftreasure.comTo win, you need to be the first to guess the location of the image and correctly submit the co-ordinates. We allow a little leeway, but your guess needs to be within 50m of the correct location! There is only one winner per game. Our coin - Proof Of Treasure Coin (POTT) - runs on the Chia Blockchain. Here is why we're excited about our game and coin: First and foremost - the game is super fun!   . You compete against everyone else at the same time to be the first to find the location, which makes it frustrating when you get agonisingly close, but also super addictive and rewarding when you win!   Our coin runs on the Chia Blockchain. This is a fairly new blockchain where the tech is really exciting - it's the brainchild of Bittorrent founder Bram Cohen, and combines the security and distribution advantages of Proof of Work, with the environmental credentials of Proof of Stake. Our coin runs as a token on this blockchain.There's a fair few tokens on this blockchain, but ours is fairly unique in that we've designed a smart contract which runs inside the coin, allowing for a limited issuance schedule. The schedule can be viewed on our site here https://www.proofoftreasure.com/proof-of-treasure-coin-statistics, and for the more technically inclined you can view our gitlab here https://gitlab.com/proofoftreasure/POTT. The smart-contract is written in Chialisp, and if you want to fully understand the technicalities of how this works head over to https://chialisp.com/ for some excellent tutorials.There is an excellent community of developers creating on the chia network. This allows for easy storage of our coins on wallets like Ozone Ozone and Goby. It also meant we are already available on two exchanges Dexie and Hashgreen, which make use of P2P trading in the form of offer files which are available on the chia network.Happy Hunting!   Dan & George (Co-founders)",
