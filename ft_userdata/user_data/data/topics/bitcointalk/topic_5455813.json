Now I should make a banal congratulation to BestChange?  You know, I am pleased to be among the so-called loyal fans of the BestChange for the simple reason that the employees of this platform have shown a high level of professionalism for many years and this exchanger aggregator has been reliable for 16 years. The figure is very impressive and deserving of respect.To be honest, I will gladly accept a memorable NFT gift. Not for the sake of speculation, in order to sell it more expensive in the future (which is exactly what happens in the industry with the NFT), but as a memento in order to tell grandchildren about it in the future.  Thanks to the BestChange for organizing this event.Do I understand correctly that ETH addresses with a zero balance are enough to receive memorable NFTs?Quote from: Best_Change on June 09, 2023, 05:18:51 AM~snipIf you are the forum member, send the address though the PMs on the forum.

Since they will send the nft to the users. Also depend if they will list it on opensea or any nft platform. But I think its better to hold it since a memorable nft. However the buy and sell of this nft is inevitable, there are some who really will list it on platforms.  I might sell it if its worth a lot like 1btc each ( who knows)",
