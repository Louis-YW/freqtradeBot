If such Altcoins are too centralized, it’s not a decentralized cryptocurrency and such centralized Altcoins need to be SEC-registered to meet all requirements for security reasons, like if a big hack occurs at Terra Luna. In opposite, decentralized cryptocurrencies can’t be hacked in a centralized way because of decentralization. Here’s a list, which centralized coins are affected: QuoteSEC Allege the Following Coins Are Securities in Coinbase LawsuitSOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXOhttps://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1666055678610292737Bitcoin, Ethereum and Avalanche are NOT affected.

Avalanche has implemented a modern technology, called repeated subsampling, where all nodes can be scaled massively, making Avalanche network very decentralized. Every coder can set up a node, so it is very decentralized. Like Ethereum, Avalanche is already decentralized enough to be not considered to register for SEC documents. In opposite, many centralized Altcoins are due to get registered, which can take a long time for such a procedure, where many coins will lose market positions. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Avalanche are not required to do so. It is huge bullish news for Ethereum and Avalanche.",

Obviously, many of them are insufficiently decentralized and could be considered as securities by SEC due to whatever reason. However, SEC has not listed them in the lawsuit.Does that mean that SEC will not consider them as securities in its future lawsuits?I don't see much difference between Ethereum and \"affected altcoins\". I don't think that SEC see this difference either. Could you suggest a theory why SEC shouldn't treat Ethereum and Avalanche as securities? If you believe that SEC finds them \"sufficiently decentralized\", then, please, share with us the definition of decentralisation used by SEC.",

That just divides the whole crypto community more and makes me think devs just wanted money. What avalanche tries to build could have done on top of eth.

I don't think SEC is measuring decentralisation by counting full nodes. There is no doubt, full node count is important for the decentralisation. However, it's not a proof of decentralisation and there is no transparent way to count full nodes and prove their independence. Majority full node could be controlled by one entity. Full node owners might collude and so on. It very easy to forge full node count if you can afford the support of the expensive infrastructure. I doubt anyone can suggest a transparent legal procedure to assess altcoin decentralisation by counting full nodes unless SEC will obligate full node owners to register themselves and comply with all current and future regulations.",

It is run by few nodes, not very decentralized. Solana already had some errors, where it could only be solved by developers making intervention. Very centralized. Cardano is a very centralized coin as well because it relies on Charles Hoskinson's popularity. You should get more education before making such a comment.",
