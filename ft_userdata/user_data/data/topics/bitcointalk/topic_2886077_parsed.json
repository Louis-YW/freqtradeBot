A vector has been discovered last month with the Google Chrome application. Nobody has been affected currently (or at least it has not been found on the web). People using the hardware just need to validate the integrity of the address. (Checking if the address is correct, like you are always supposed to do, no matter the support used).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2878882.msg29653349#msg29653349",

Since no one can steal your bitcoins in hardware wallets without private keys so how it can happen.I hope OP will explain the real case behind ledger wallet attack.It's a receive attack, means that a malware try to change the receiving address of your wallet when it shows on the screen (and changes it to a hacker's address), in order to copy and paste the hacked address when you want to receive bitcoins into your wallet. When you use the chrome bitcoin application, you can click on a small button on the screen which shows the receiving address on the Ledger Nano S device itself, so if you check the two addresses you won't lose any bitcoin. So it's not a malware that completly wipes your hardware wallet but just hijacks the bitcoins you want to receive into the wallet.",

What about Ledger Blue? As far as I understand, it uses same app, but Ledger claims it's the most secure device. What about Trezor or KeepKey? Is there any similar malware targeted on hacking Trezor or KeepKey?",

Is there any similar malware targeted on hacking Trezor or KeepKey?I have no information about the Ledger Blue. If it's using the same app in Chrome, it's possible that the malware is able to change the receiving address of the Blue as well. Anyway, it helps if you double check the address on the device's screen as well, in the Chrome app. If you're using it with MEW, I've no info about the possibility of chechking the address on the device if you're connected to MEW.",

Anything verified on the nano s screen can be considered as truly being generated by your nano s (and therefore being secure).",
