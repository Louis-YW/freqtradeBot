In the past, halvings led to higher prices, but now there are no clear results. I'm puzzled about the reasons behind this. Please help me analyze.Let's watch the previous halving of 2019 for reference to predict current halving results.Litecoin halved in August 25, 2019. Six months exact before the halving in February 5, 2019, the price of Litecoin was $34.Three months before halving in May 5, 2019, the price was $78.1 month ago it was $120.On the day of halving, it was $95.One months later $67.And a few months after that, it reached as low as $33.What we see from this is the price increases and is highest a couple of months before the halving and go through significant price loss after halving.And that is exactly what we saw in 2023.But what also is true is after two years of halving, it maintained a higher low resistance for rest of it's history.",

The hype effect was already priced in prior to the actual LTC halving as you can also see with the data provided by tsaroz.You'll probably have to wait for BTC to lead the charge before a significant increase in LTC's price happens.",

      "body": "Halving itself is not a 100% catalyst for a price increase. The market is organized in such a way that one and the same event can affect the coin both up and down. It all depends on what period of the market this news appears. Now in the market there is a lull, the period of summer vacations, liquidity and volatility are at minimums, and the trend is bearish rather than bullish. Due to this we have low demand for altcoins, now it is unlikely that anything will grow, as there is not much money in the crypto market.",

Did you think litecoin has same power as bitcoin that can pushing its price to double or triple after halving? Litecoin doesn't have hype anymore. This is not a good payment gateway right now. Litecoin has lost trust from so many people after charlie lie has been sold his coin in the past. Litecoin halving never did impact to the price. The price of altecoin peg to the bitcoin's movement. I think that you should understand it. Quote from: ananyabushra on August 08, 2023, 12:31:44 PMIn the past, halvings led to higher prices, but now there are no clear results.

Please help me analyze.Because this is not Bitcoin, and we are still on the bear market so you can't expect a big pump from LTC.Just like in the past halving, there's no big movement during the halving but after Months of years of halving that is the time you'll see the effect of having a lower supply and a higher demand for LTC. If you're holding LTC have more patience until the next bull run and try to comeback on this thread and you can tell if its worth waiting or not.",

Please help me analyze.Litecoin is not bitcoin, other members have shown to you that the halving of litecoin did in fact behave as in the past, with the majority of the price increase happening before the halving and then after the halving the price goes down, bitcoin is different because the demand for it is massive, so even if there was a price increase before the halving over the next months the demand for it keeps increasing causing an increase in price that can last months or even years.",

Most altcoins especially top market cap altcoins are just following Bitcoin, they just correlate with Bitcoin.The biggest halving that most people are waiting is the Bitcoin block halving. So what happened in Litecoin is somehow just advertisement because we all know that Bitcoin still having hard time these days maintain the momentum.",

Please help me analyze.Litecoin has lost the trust of most cryptocurrency community investors but most of them usually seize the opportunity of it halving for some quick profit which is one of the many reasons why there's some dump in the price of LTC after it halving.Another thing that contributed to the LTC dump, is the current market momentum which affect the surge in the price of BTC which is the major player in this current market.",

People were just expecting it to pump right after so they bought into it early and they got out of it earlier because it looked like it stalled and lots of bag holders at the moment. This happen a lot with many crypto coins and tokens, hence you need to cut your losses quick.",

In fact it dropped a little bit but do you think that if bitcoin had that the price wouldn't move? If litecoin had its halving during a bull period, it would have been a good reason to go up some more, if price went from 30k to 40k in a month, then halving happened, then it would have taken it to 45k as well or at least 43k.It would be something that will be helpful, but all by itself it is not something major. This doesn't have any attention to make it work, and that is why it should be considered not a big deal and should be considered as unimportant for the market.",

Please help me analyze.When halving comes we then think about it giving a positive impact and possible price increase but Litecoin is different from Bitcoin which is certainly it gains much impact and increases demand which causes a price rally. If we never see a price increase of Litecoin after halving, therefore, there is only one reason that it causes it and that is because people had no interest in this project. On the other hand, we have to stop overthinking that halving would give a price surge, not anymore. Even in Bitcoin, we can't assure that it will be going to happen next year. However, we are too positive because of the huge support coming from the community which is a big factor.",
