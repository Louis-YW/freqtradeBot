  "content": "My fellow folks they way things and such activities happening in this country today, what do you think changing our leaders will make it better and right ? To my own opinion and perception they problem of this country is within us, if we continue to change leadership, it will never end until we change our own selves.This can be refer to the word of the almighty, where he said.\"We choose a leader among you, someone with the same character as you are\". So when the masses decide to make the change within themselves then a change will be selected for us.A human being can make rain drops, a human being can create a change but Only The almighty can relieve a society from its calamity, and this can only be done If the society decided to change there ways... take for example this CBN policy is a good one by the government and CBN but the implementation process lack merit by alot of bankers and bank managers.Because money were kept for politicians and even d one available in the banking system they are trying to do business with it.Today,the people aspiring for office today in Nigeria, they are the same people over and over again... So we don't expect a different approach if the circle or let me say the table remains the same..How will the society get it right:By bringing the unknown, there are many people out there that are blessed with our progress, but they are being drive the opportunity due to financial crises, some have try their best and are in a party we can say as party without structure.. those people that we don't know or we believe they can't win, are the change i believe the society need. But is the dweller's of the society ready to make this change?Untill we change this our believe of jumping from this one to that one, and seat down to decide for ourselves, that's when we will get it right, and have a leader that will bring that change.",

And as such, they should merge together.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439741.0Change starts with us; even if we have change within us without good leaders, the change won't reflect more, so we need both good leaders and us to change in order to make this country better. We can choose our preferred leader by voting this time, and I believe if we vote right, we will eventually see change in the coming years.",

And I will also say \"No\" because of by mistake we happens to vote a leader who has totally nothing to offer (I.e only dance during campaigns without saying anything tangible) then this country will go from bad to worst. And unfortunately, tomorrow is the day for us to vote that leader that will change the narrative of our nation Nigeria, and you know who that person is.",

Recently, Nigeria has suffered too many economic down growth and this has brought about inflation in the country. The current government of Nigeria, has failed to carry out it's duties to improve the economy of the country. So a change of government will be the right thing to do so the country can improve economically. As at yesterday, Nigerians went out to vote for their next leaders and we all pray that the right one is voted for because it will do a great change for it's people.",

I recall how buhari promised us change and everyone relied on him but he failed us, this was not the change we all expected but we pray this time Should be a better change and I believe we are getting closer and closer to the kind of change we are praying for. We need to keep changing leaders till a better person finally arrives lets no loose hope.",

Let's now equate citizens and leaders. If you allow your citizens to suffer, where their opinion does not really matter to you, what do you expect them to do? (as a citizen) a country where you are being denied your vote and being detected as to whom to vote for, where you have your money in the bank but cannot collect it, where you have to stay under long lines and under the sun just to get your own country's identity card.Where are these problems coming from?It's not easy to control human beings, but good leaders have got to set examples that citizens can follow, make things easy for citizens, and hear out their opinions too. Go on TikTok and search for election updates, and you will see some violent videos. Tell me, how can you be scared of going out to vote because of these violent incidents? In a video I saw, a lady almost got blinded just to vote. Is it also the fault of the citizens that the current president is unable to ensure a peaceful election in all states? How many soldiers does the country have? Can't they appoint squads of soldiers to guide all the voting units? Good leaders can also determine good citizens. just my opinion.watch this: https://imgur.com/a/Muo8oxW",

You got a very solid point. One thing they do have in common is their industriousness. With way results are pouring in, what we pray for is peace, because only in peaceful moments or times can growth and doors of opportunities open. Nigeria will definitely be better also considering the fact that it is not military trained person or president that would lead. No more micromanaging at least.",

Not just changing leader but changing a leader who has the country at heart, a leader who is not self centered, someone who is not tribalistic or so religious. Though it will be so difficult to figure out a leader with these qualities but we can achieve this by looking back at the impact they have created in their various states because charity begins at home. In my conclusion, changing of leader will help make a better Nigeria.",

These statements are in agreement with what some of the other users have said.For example, in the just-concluded presidential elections, we could see that we have Nigerians who still love their slave masters and would go to any length to sell, betray, and even kill their own just for personal gains and greed. After watching all of these scenarios, I came to the unmistakable conclusion that our problem is a people problem, not a leadership problem. And because leaders are also people, you need people whose mindsets have been reformed, or transformed to be able to hold leadership positions. This is the point on which I stand.",

Surely, if the power were in the hands of leaders with good ambitions, Nigeria would improve. Because it is only leaders that have power to decide how the country will be run, many of the countries we observe that are doing better are it is as a result leaders. Therefore, whether in communities or nations, changing a leadership is always play a very important rules. And for my own view, I believe that Nigerians need a change of leaders in order to have better hope, as we don't think that the formal leaders we currently have can give us any new hope, so we need to change and see what will happen,that is how we keep trying till we get the good once.",
