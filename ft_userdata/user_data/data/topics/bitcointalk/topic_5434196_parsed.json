  "content": "I've been thinking about Russia and how relentless they've been after invading Ukraine and a promise of a world war they've been preparing for over a decade. I was watching a local news of recent when I came across a news saying that Russia is running out of weapon and ammunition and that Russia is already begging North Korea for ammunition which caught my attention because I was wondering the possibility of great Russia running to North Korea which is known as one of the poorest country on the surface of the earth for ammunition and I think this is because of the bans imposed on Russia by the west.What do you think of this news And what do you think would make Russia go begging from North Korea.Please pardon me if this isn't the right right board for this topic and it should be moved to the right board if not yeah or help let me know so I can move it there.The topic is open for discussion.",

Siberia (part of Russia) has enough resources to support a far larger Russian population, and to make war materials or anything else for Russia.The thing that converts raw materials into products are people with knowledge of how to do it. This is the only thing stopping Russia... not enough people to do it.",

Ammo can be easily made but microchips are difficult to mass produce and most nations have relegated their manufactures to Taiwan (more Taiwan than any other), China, South Korea and Japan.",

It can be said that it was Western intelligence that harmed Ukraine. No one knows how many weapons Russia has, it's all lies by the Western media.",

We know some countries hold different beliefs as regards the crisis in Ukraine and not all agree that Russia is wrong even though they may publicly act in that manner. Russia can make enticing deals to these countries in exchange for ammunitions or ammunition related supplies that can be used by them to produce more ammunitions. The truth we will know just with time.",

You are underestimating their forces and will pay a heavy price if you continue to underestimate your opponent.The fact that Russia withdraws troops or is recaptured by Ukraine does not mean that they are weak, in war sometimes they take 1 step back but 3 steps forward. The plan was always changed to suit the war situation.",

There was also a report of how out of frustration of not getting badly needed warplanes Putin publicly scolded his deputy prime minister Denis Manturov for being too slow. We shouldn't also lose sight that there is also a propaganda war going on that sometimes these news or reports are overblown or even distorted.Most countries are not willing to supply arms to Russia due to fear of sanctions because even Iran is denying that it is not supplying war tools to Russia because of fear of sanctions. I think just like Ukraine, Russia needs external support because its local production would not be able to match the kind of war it is currently fighting.",

But there had better be some big, successful push by Ukraine to offset the Russian taking of Soledar, or we might be able to start concluding that Russia has already won, and all that is left is the mopping up.Putin Hails \"Positive\" Momentum In Ukraine, \"Stable\" Economy In Surprisingly Upbeat Remarkshttps://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/putin-hails-positive-momentum-ukraine-stable-economy-unexpected-upbeat-assessmentHe said in fresh weekend comments to Rossiya 1 state television when asked about the successful Soledar operation that \"The dynamic is positive.\" He described that \"Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff.\" Putin followed with, \"And I hope that our fighters will please us even more with the results of their combat.\"He also made comments on the state of the economy while confirming that Russia will turn for trade to Asian powers, China and India in particular. \"The situation in the economy is stable,\" Putin said. \"Much better than not only what our opponents predicted but also what we forecast.\" For this he cited low unemployment, saying: \"Unemployment is at a historic low. Inflation is lower than expected and has, importantly, a downward trend.\"Despite his county finding itself more isolated than ever before in its modern history, and despite unprecedented Western-led sanctions, Putin showed no signs of backing down from objectives previously set in Ukraine, as Reuters summarizes of the new remarks...\"Putin now casts the war in Ukraine as an existential battle with an aggressive and arrogant West, and has said that Russia will use all available means to protect itself and its people against any aggressor.\"...",
