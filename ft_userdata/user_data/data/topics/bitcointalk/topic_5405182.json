It's just impossible to go to $50k right now, if a dead cat bounce would happen, it would be no higher than $30k.I guess this is based on your perception of a bear market. For sure if 2019 wasn't a bear market, then I agree. But if 2019 was a bear market, as price made a lower high before dropping by 75% in price before finally making a higher low to confirm the end of the bear market, then clearly this statement isn't true. Just like back then many (if not most), including myself, were convinced that $6K to $8K would act as strong resistance for many more months, or at least there'd be a correction, because it had acted as such strong support, but in fact the opposite was true. Price broke through these levels with ease as there was too much short interest in the market and the liquidators had their way. Then by $10K the trend was considered bullish again, even though dropped dropped to $4K shortly after, which was no doubt considered bearish continuation.Simply saying it's impossible is completely unrealistic. Just like saying it's impossible for Bitcoin to go to $0 (it can, even if it's unlikely). If you consider the bull market to of ended in May 2021, when momentum shifted bearish, then it's more than possible that price can return to $50K within the coming months, if indeed $17.5K ends up being the low, even if it remains unlikely at the moment - or unrealistic.
