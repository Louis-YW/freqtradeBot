  "content": "What's up guys,So I stumbled upon a project that was very different than any other crypto project I had ever seen.  You guys probably know that a lot of projects have issues with prices going up because their total max supply is just too high, yet when they say they do 1-2% burns, it just gets transferred to the dead wallet, keeping the total max supply the same.  This project called \"PYROMATIC - PYRO\" is a true burn.  What it does is every time someone buys or sells, 6% will be taxed deducting the total max supply.  That's 12% total.  There's no marketing wallet so it's community driven and from the looks of it, it does have a lot of potentials to grow.  I have a video that you can see if you are interested. 3min Video.  Again you don't have to invest in it, but look at what it's doing each and every day.They have two different supplies, one is total max supply and they also have a uniswap supply.  Once the total supply runs out, it will start to burn from the uniswap supply.  As the supply decreases, this coin has the potential to even surpass Bitcoin and Xmon (that one hit almost 100K per coin).  Again, not financial advice, but please look into it. It started with a 1 million supply on July 21, 2022 (sadly I missed it) and now it's at 634K. If it keeps burning at this rate every day, it's just a matter of time before it explodes.Etherscan Link: Refresh it each day and you can track it yourself.Code:[url]https://etherscan.io/token/0x89568569da9c83cb35e59f92f5df2f6ca829eeee#balances[/url]Here is the video, timelapse of what it's doing:Code:[url]https://youtu.be/SAUMTzkUkec[/url]Anyways, enjoy.",
