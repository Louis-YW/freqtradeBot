  "content": "Wallet version 4.0.9, OS Windows 10 Pro (yes, I know), clean install, laptop is used only for coins.Never had a problem with it, never triggered any error until because of the fluctuating fees I tried to copy the hash after making a transaction to see where it sits in the mempool, did it a few more tests after the first issue, no matter how long I wait if I click anywhere in the transaction window other than close  the whole wallet freezes and becomes unresponsive.I assume there is no other fix than update to  4.4 ?!?",

Does the behavior of your wallet change if you change to another Electrum server?If your Win10 box isn't an air-gapped setup, you still might consider to update your Electrum as I don't see a benefit to stay on that old version of yours. Before you update your Electrum, make sure to have backups of your wallet files in case you want to revert back to your old Electrum version. Newer Electrum versions update the wallet files to their version and to my knowledge and personal experience to can't open a newer wallet file version with an older Electrum software version.",

So update??Check if you can discover the cause,However, I'd not recommend to submit it as issue to GitHub since it's for an old version.Enable debugging in \"Tools->Preferences->Write logs to file\", restart Electrum.After reopening, reproduce the issue and then find the logs in: <your_electrum_data_directory>/logs folder.The default Electrum data directory in Windows10 is in %appdata%/Electrum (paste it on your \"Windows Explorer\" or \"run\" window)Open the log file with a text editor and check if there's any error related to the issue.Don't forget to disable logging later or Electrum will produce a log file in every session.",

      "body": "Your Electrum is connected to an Electrum server which provides address history transactions and notifications of new transactions of all addresses in your wallet. If your addresses have a large transaction history or if you have used a lot of addresses in your wallet then there's quite some communication needed to get an update of your current wallet balance.If you happen to be connected to a slow or throttling Electrum server and that server doesn't like the requests of your Electrum very much or can't process them in a timely manner, then you experience delays and possibly also the freezes you have. Throttling may occur when the connected Electrum server penalizes a lot of requests from your side.When the freezes happen, do you see a green or blue (proxied) light in the right bottom corner or two arrow forming a circle?When your Electrum has a blue light then you go through a proxy, possibly through Tor if that's configured. Tor can sometimes be quite slow which might then explain your freezes.Problems can (but most not) show up when your addresses have a transaction history that goes into the thousands. If that's not the case for your wallet then something else is fishy. But it's hard to debug without logs or details that you might not want to disclose in public.I'd first try other Electrum Servers and see if some simply perform better. Click on the green or blue light, the network dialog opens. When you right click a server you have the option to connect to this specific server.I can't recommend one as I use my own fast Electrum server for performance and privacy reasons.",

If that's not the case for your wallet then something else is fishy. That log that ends with \"receiving history\" also made me think the same.I don't have thousands but I have +500, I don't know if the number of outputs and inputs matters but there is a ton of them, not simple tx, and this was probably, like 99.9% why it crashed. I played with an old virtual machine with an old electrum wallet I had, same version and it worked flawlessly but I had under 10tx per adress.There is an advice about not reusing addresses that I should have taken seriously but it's so hard when running a business to keep changing your little cold storage.Despite me being really later, thanks for the the comprehensive answer, 6 years and this forum is still better at getting replies that others like stack or reddit.Quote from: Cricktor on May 31, 2023, 08:28:12 PMI can't recommend one as I use my own fast Electrum server for performance and privacy reasons.Noted!",
