It's obvious, if you give your personal info and it by chance it was leaked to the public or to the bad actors then they can used it. There are cases in some altcoin projects that the personal info of some bounty hunters and their customers and investors have been breached and it went down to the black market and the hackers sold it there.I guess it's the responsibility of the casino itself to really protect our data. Not sure if casinos are required to be like GDPR compliant.https://gdpr.eu/",

      "body": "It looks like it is a norm for a casino to require KYC when they are following regulation.  I believe it is wrong for a Casino to require KYC if they are not licensed since they are not subjected to the user privacy law and they can use the collected data of their userbase however they wanted.  Casino without a license is operating illegally so we are not sure a bout the security of our data.  On the other side, licensed casino are required by the regulators to do KYC for AML and I believe they are covered with privacy law which make them subject to penalty or punishment if they failed to protect their user database.  In case of hack, that is not intended but probably some cases will arise from it and at most users are compensated.If you are not comfortable with KYC then better avoid platform that requires KYC, after all no one is pushing you to subscribe for their services and undergo KYC.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 14, 2023, 08:23:14 AMIs this a wrongful approach to online casinos that requires KYC?

Giving out your false information might cause you a trouble in the future, better not to put too much money on that so your account still be safe from any investigation. If you are not ok with the KYC better not to gamble on that site at all and just go to other option since there are still site that are KYC free. KYC is slowly becoming a thing now, most of the site already requires a general information and that can allow you to gamble already there might be a limitation but at least you can start gambling by just giving out your full name.",

It should be either you give right information or don't play in that casino as the outcome will definitely the same, they will confiscate your money. If you are not comfortable giving your personal information then you shouldn't play in the first place because at some point they will actually ask that one as per their terms and conditions. But what have you done is giving wrong information which if they couldn't verify then they have the rights to close your account and confiscate it.There's nothing you can do anymore, even if you tell them the truth the one that you submitted will be their main basis if the account is yours or not.",

You just have two options, either to comply or to find another casino that doesn't enforce KYC until they have to. Most casinos today will have you required to comply with it.But as long as you're not the big type of gambler and you've got a consistent yet low cash flow on your account then they're most unlikely to require you with KYC. As much as they don't want to get onto kyc for their customers, they also have no option but to do it to follow the regulatory rules that's been placed on them.",

It's a catch-22 situation. Companies that are headquartered in places like Europe often have a legal requirement to gather such documentation from their customers in an effort to combat illegal activities, which can be good for customers because if anyone gets ripped off you have a stable justice system that can benefit the customer if things went badly wrong. However it can also be abused by bad actors who pretend to be legitimate companies in order to harvest this sort of document data which can be used by criminals to do things like take loans or credit cards out in someone elses name. Even good and bad companies can also have their systems hacked if not setup correctly, which can release these highly sensitive documents too.",

It is a risk anyone should consider before joining in such entity.The casinos usually have a great technical and cybersecurity team behind them but we have seen giants of technology being breached so anything can happen even to such businesses.There is no better solution as of yet but you should be aware that once a hacker breaches a casino all the confidential data may become publicly available for anyone to see,usually by putting it on sale in a dark web market.After you think about the scenarios do as you think then,join or not join.",

Nope. You are pointing your asset in danger once you deposit your money on the casino with a fake identity because sooner or later they will ask you to do KYC since it’s inevitable. Your funds will be frozen forever since there’s no way you can verify fake credentials that you submit. Casino with license always has the tendency to ask you a KYC so it’s better to provide real details or stay away if you really want to protect your identity.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 14, 2023, 08:23:14 AMIs this a wrongful approach to online casinos that requires KYC?

It’s obviously wrong approach because you are breaking the ToS by providing fake credentials. It’s absurd to fake and the only person that faking there credentials are those scammers and money launderer that using the casino illegally. There’s no other way to bypass KYC rather than abstaining on playing.",

Nothing can go wrong for you if you provide wrong information. At worst your account will get locked and that’s if they do serious KYC.Lots of things can go wrong if you do full KYC and give true information however. Lots of exchanges got hacked before and their customers’ info has been leaked. Often these passport scans, selfies get sold in the dark web. You don’t want that crap to happen to you believe me.",

It is a risky approach because it might allow for easy deposit and bet but when it is time to withdraw your deposit it might get complicated. The best approach is to stick to non-KYC casinos that way you can gamble anonymously with your data withheld from the public.",

You'd better not do that as this is not the best solution to that problem. You may not be caught easily but can happen in the future when they ask you again to do KYC.
