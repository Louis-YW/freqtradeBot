With 382,945% annual percent interest, $1000 is $3829450 and that's not even having counting in the compound interest you have, and with that we would probably have such a big number i would have to google the amount of zeroes to have a name for it.Also please don't use USD in big bold letters in this when you don't clearly mean $ but the token, is very misleading and most likely highly illegal.",

This is sad, it means that many people will suffer losses, I saw their bounty campaign being handled by Irfan's bounty manager, it will damage his reputation because of this, I know Irfan is one of the trusted bounty managers here",

The only hope for hunters to see irfan was only taking the new campaign that wanna try to escrow the bounty reward. As far as i know this one already escrowed by him but since the price was dropping so hard and then you will get at east a penny for your 1 month full of work. that's very bad for some people who have been working so hard to promoting this scam project. The developers have gone. The price is always going to the bottom.",
