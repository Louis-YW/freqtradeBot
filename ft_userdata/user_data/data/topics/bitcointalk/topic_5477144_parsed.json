  "content": "This is dangerous, but I just like it sometimes, because it is short and fun. I am talking about penalties in football. I am not talking about American football, but talking about what is known as soccer to them. We call it football in the world.The odd of penalties that I have noticed ranges between 1.2 to 1.35 odds. The odd is not that big but it is still what I can use to have fun. I do not know how I can track all leagues that are playing penalty to just have fun sometimes. The only time I know about penalties is when I am checking the in-play, you may know some clubs that are about to play penalties.I want to gamble more on penalties these days to know how fun it can be, but I need a way I can know all clubs that are about to play penalties. Something like an indicator, so that I will not miss any about-to-be-played penalty. Is their any site I can use to know this. A site that can indicate that a penalty is about to be played in a match and in a way it will be very obvious and know it. Or in a way it can send notification to my phone that penalty is about to be played.I am not only referring to after 90 minutes penalties, but all penalties of any kind.",

      "body": "It'll be hard to get such an app that does that, but watching penalty shootouts is interesting. However, I was expecting you wanted to gamble or stake games on different games hoping that they'll play penalties. If it's what you need, you can watch penalty shootouts after 90 minutes, then predict from results or record, teams that usually tend to play penalty. Teams with the most rough defenders, easily get penalty shootouts. However, your topic sounds more like how to know if a team will play a penalty, from the way the game goes, then you'll predict. In such a situation, we can predict penalty if an attacker is moving too fast into the 18-yard box, but the defenders always slide to intercept the ball. There'll be a high chance of a penalty shootout in the game. Reading further, the context of the thread changed, where you only wish to watch live penalties in every soccer game around the globe. Switching from one game to another doesn't seem enjoyable to me. Thinking of a better way to achieve that, is by staying active on social media platforms where football games are analyzed. Yet someday, in all games played that very day, there wouldn't be any penalty shoot-out, . It's better to watch a documentary of penalty shootouts on YouTube channels, as what you want can be very stressful. But, it's quite a nice initiative to develop an App that solves such a problem, if none exists.",

I won all because I do not just go for it, since many years that I have been gambling, just 5 times is low and likely the reason. If it is frequent, it can be what can start losses.

I think the fun that can be in sport bet is the in-play. If you are going through the in-play, some gambling sites will show that a match as been paused due to foul, and then continue if it has been resolved. This can be a means to check some fouls and see if it will lead to penalty. But this is difficult to do always than to get notification.",

I wonder, is this feature not implemented because of the short time frame for each penalty shot? it doesn't take long to execute the penalty and most likely the gambler doesn't have enough time for the bet to be accepted (we must also remember that it takes some time before the bet is accepted).",

Moreover, this a game whose outcome is most times not premeditated talk more of a penalty.Also, the aspect where you said if you could get an alert to your phone on a penalty to be played is something someone should seek to understand what you intend to do on that. I know you want to bet on that but at the point where penalty shootout want to be played, can you still bet on it? will it still be available for stake? Or will the sportbook open it up for a bet just wetin the minutes it happened in the 18 yard box during normal play or after 90 minutes of play. Even if bookies open odds for it to be staked, what time do we have to stake on it.",
