      "body": "So you need anything more than a shell or terminal over tor? If not then I'd suggest you start by searching for that (it must be something that's quite common as tor lets you get a static address whereas IP and url don't).Searching quickly I found this: https://medium.com/@tzhenghao/how-to-ssh-over-tor-onion-service-c6d06194147If it's too short (or just covers the client or the server setup), there looks like there's a lot more.",

Same thing applies, sufficient security during authentication and for connection specific permissions. It is possible to use any devices so long as they are able to use SSH.This cannot be stressed enough. You are opening up your BTC to the internet once you do this. Making a trivial mistake in you config file later can cause you to loose your coins if it allows others to connect.Not saying that you should not do it, just be very aware that it would now be out there for people trying to get access.Testing something 6 months from now, and you change the user / pass to something simple to make life easier and don't change it back not a big deal if it's not publicly accessible. Here, it's a big deal.That kind of stuff.-Dave",

I'm not aware of any application that currently allows the user to do so because there isn't really a lot of use case for it currently. Using SSH to just establish a direct connection to the server would be better.",
