Thank you.The point of this is to call him a liar. If you want to label Putin a liar, you are right, no arguments on my part, but also know that he is a politician and one similar attribute they all have is that they do not tell the plain truth. They can give half truth or twist the truth, but it is in very few cases that the plain truth is really spilled.",
