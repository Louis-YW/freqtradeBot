If I had since my day one in crypto bought 100% bitcoin and holded I might had more money now.Maybe other people have more luck than me    but I belive altcoins with small marketcap is mostly gambling.Now, I hold about 85% bitcoin and 15% ethereum",

We cant say for sure that tokens cant come back ot even surpass their ATH. The basis for this is depend too on the project itself and the adoption to cryptocommunity.

The only project that always surpass it's old ATH every bull market, we have few others too like Ethereum and BNB but BTC is just the first on my list. This is the answer to various questions regarding \"what crypto to invest\".Because we know very well how the characteristics of altcoins in general, namely: hype - ATH - Dump - are left by the community. It's rare for altcoins to survive and advance beyond ATH before, if any, it's very few.That's why I agree with you, Bitcoin is a top priority for investing in the crypto industry, especially since this is a bearish market, where it is very suitable to invest in Bitcoin (whether with DCA or not). Followed by ETH and BNB, these two altcoins are indeed the most trusted and especially supported by a fairly strong team and developers, as well as a solid community. Indeed, on the other hand, there are some altcoins that might be hidden gems, but rather than not being so convincing, it is better to avoid them especially if our prospects are long-term.",

Taking their chances that they might pump and it did happen but most investors took a chance of it and started to dump that's why most of them didn't last or pump afterwards.There are worthy altcoins out there if they knew where to find it that has history of potential to grow just like how ETH grow. But for newbies it's always safer to just invest in Bitcoin rather on altcoins.",

There are many factors affecting it, some of which are:* Age: newer altcoins are easier to pump compared to older ones* Number of previous pumps: an altcoin that was pumped many times will have a much harder time being pumped again* Previous pump sizes: an altcoin that had a massive pump (like the ones in 2017) will never have any major pump ever again (eg. ETH)* Hype: we all know that pumps work based on hyping up the gamblers participating in the pump and dump altcoin market, so any coin that can advertise the coin better and hype it up can get better pumps.* Market size: it is always easier to have a huge pump in a small altcoin compared to a bigger one. For example it is easier to do a 100x pump of an altcoin worth 10 satoshi compared to another altcoin worth 0.01BTC.",

I think XRB at that time gave a more satisfying reward than other faucets with a simpler task than other faucets that had to skip several ads to get it and it was less fun. to be honest, at that time I focused on earning not for holding, so I only focused on XRB because it gave rewards faster than BTC faucets.",

You might not really see them having their own bull runs if their volume got drained already and the devs working on it abandon those token so we need to be careful on thinking that low cap tokens can give us wealth since its really dangerous to acquire them since for sure there are other holders who get trap which didn't sell because that token doesn't have volume will dump all they have if they see someone buying it for another round.So stick on top alts which got huge volume since they are most likely will get huge demand once bitcoin bull run will also happen.",
