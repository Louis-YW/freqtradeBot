This life we d live so no be competition, there's time for peso to succeed in life, and there seems to be no short cut to success and there is no hurry in search for success cos everything have there own season(failure and success) in life. The difficulties wey peso d face for life, no go be forever. They are meant to build us to a better version of ourselves. So that when our situation change, we go learn how to manage and control it without misusing the wealth. Not giving up in life remind me years back when I was broke. I had different hustle that wasn't paying me that much. I was let down, and insulted by friends during that period, but the thing be sae I no allow their negative vibes get to me emotionally to do what am not supposed to do. I keep on pushing and believing that someday my story go change. Which it changed. I thank God for that. One thing wey I want make me understand about this life be sae, everything get their own season to ripe. You might be doing something that is not fetching you money today, but in years to come it will. Na about been consistent in your hustle and don't intend to give up whatever legit work you are doing. God promise us sae em go bless us with the works of hands. Whether na small one or big one, em go bless us. But the thing don give up, have faith and be patient. Someday day Oluwa go butter your bread at the right time. Take note: No one ever makes it to the top so easily with a given-up spirit.",

The juju thing has always been the case with the black race, especially those in Africa who've soaked themselves in those obnoxious beliefs and cultural practices where every fast success is attributed to some mystic power.QuoteBut do you know that there are friends and relatives whose dreams and prayers in life is for you to fail.Yes, there are people like that who will wish others evil. However, those people can't be called friends. They're pretenders. Friendship isn't defined as exchanging handshakes and banters with others. We shouldn't tag people as friends simply because we've exchanged something with them. Friendship goes beyond that.",

Forget about those people wey dey oppress you as everyone will not live forever as one day their own cup go full den pave way for you to shine so no matter wetin you dey pass through look forward to a better future and keep pushing forward do not be discouraged everyone has a set time when you time reach no force go fit hinder or stop your glory.",
