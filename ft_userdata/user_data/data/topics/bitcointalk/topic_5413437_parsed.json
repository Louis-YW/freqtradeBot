Find a minute to answer it we will be grateful.  We do NOT collect any data even your email. Here is the link to the survey : https://forms.gle/zCZ2z2iVBMEZtvjQ8",

      "body": "We all need crypto investors, but they became a rarity  I filled out your survey, it seems you are making one more portfolio application. after all, you are only interested in the preferable appearance and whether we like to share data from the portfolio. Better post here your first version, so investors will be able to see in which direction you are going and possibly make suggestions for improvement.although I am of the opinion that there are already enough portfolio options, maybe only if you make a good implementation for NFT assets.",

      "body": "A working version or a demo version of this app you are developing would attract a bigger group of users to run this survey.Unfortunately, it is rare to see actual crypto investors unlike the angel investors seen in the mainstream investments, because crypto is a niche sector and people prefer being discreet about their investments and not share much about their portfolios.Major big investors here dont even visit these forums, but focus on their work.But I am sure some self-boasting kids will wish to do the same and you will get a decent number of users.",
