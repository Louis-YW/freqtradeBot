  "content": "Before I go any further I would like to clarify that no one can predict the market and I am going to shed some light to the modus operandi of those signal mafia as they add you to their group which is created to attract customers where you will find screenshots about how their signals has helped members to earn a lot of profit and even you can earn huge amount provided you join their premium channel: Here are some basic questions we need to ask ourselves: 1. If they can help you earn so much profit they would already be ultra rich and wouldn't be spamming your inbox to join their paid group2. Why don't they share the daily report or weekly to check their accuracy percentage3. Why don't they make it free even on trail basis so that users can get a first hand experience and joinMy observations after being a part of a paid and few free group who provide limited signal for free users and more for premium: 1. Let's say they make `6 predictions/signal a day and even if 5 signal fails they will still share screenshots about that one signal which was succesful and it's a simple maths lets say you have $100 and you divide that investment between 4 bets which the channel/group has to offer and you go for long/short based on the update by splitting $25 each and end up losing everything in 3 signals and gaining 200% (inflated number just to explain) from 1 signal they will take that screenshot and start marketing and use it as bait but you will only have $75 though you won 200% in one coin but lost in other three and maximum number os users will lose everything. 2. Why don't they make a report though it can be manipulated, still sharing a daily report or weekly report to define the profit and loss which members have incurred will help other to decide whether it's worth joining or not. But if they start sharing it, trust me no one will join looking at absolute numbers. 3. If they make it free trail then users will understand it's a trap and will not join the channel/group4. They will have 4 stage for take profit and if it hits 1st target and liquidates while you are waiting for 4th target to be achieved still they advertise that you have got a profit of 1st target and vice versaConclusion:Rather go for technical analysis nad learn to read indicators and back test the date you will be in a better position to trade rather than joining paid groups.",

      "body": "Crypto singals are a type of copy trading, but due to the lack of any regulatory legislation, such methods are used for fraud. In the stock market, there is a company that has advisors, which takes your money as liquidity and invests it for you to make profits by obtaining recommendations from these advisors. Here, the advisors make a profit, the company makes a profit. He wins and you make a profit.In cryptocurrencies, due to the difficulty of predicting in the short term and most of the trading does not take place in altcoin, even if these groups are free, they can use the liquidity to pump some scam tokens without your permission, the chances of you being scammed or losing your money are almost certain.The only non-scam case is when others like to share their recommendations and tell you that DYOR.",

Free signal groups created with thousands of members will attract many people, they actually don't want to provide free signals, but rather promote their premium signal groups which in turn ordinary users will start to be interested in joining.This happened to me a few years ago, when I was new to crypto and didn't fully understand trading. Initially, I joined a free group and made some profits. With that success, I went to the premium group, and guess what I got.Yup the premium signal did not provide a good income, even when it was in a bear market so it made the premium signal vacuum in a few months. Such groups are better to stay away from, because it will just be an organized trap that will drain the money of anyone who believes in such groups. They also add members automatically when telegram users do not limit who can add them.Like this Signal Premium group, I was added automatically in 2021 and they are just a bunch of scammers.",

Then, in fairness, they are experts in hyping the community here in the crypto business industry. Because they still have a lot of people.Because if there weren't so many people being cheated, those groups of signals wouldn't exist by now, right? So my advice is: don't join those groups of signal channels. Believe me, they will eat or just eat your money for sure. Be careful and think carefully before spending money on such things.",

I do agree that most of this group now is mostly scam but there’s still legit out there that give solid call.

Always come in mind  that this market is really that unpredictable and there's no way that you could really be able to have that kind of edge because you do know on where its going? Totally impossible!Surprisingly there are really just still those people whom do really easily believe that there would be those kind of advantage if you are inside of a paid group. Sooner or later then you would really be that able to tellthat it wasnt worth. So far basing up into my own experience and ideas in mind that its never been that considerable on making such act on trying out to join up for the sake of advantage.Its up to you somehow whether you are willing on paying up on the said fee or not.",
