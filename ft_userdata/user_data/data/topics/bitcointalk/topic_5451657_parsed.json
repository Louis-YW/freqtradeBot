The extension is good but there is no different from using other in-built text editors like notepad, wordpad etc. They are doing almost the same function. If the feature you are recommending is the first hand feature in the forum then it would have been a very nice welcoming recommendation. The forum text editor is good just that tool bars are not enough. Let all the tool bars for editing text should be added to the forum text editor then everything will be working fine. I also checked the links the op dropped the apps are nice to use but that will another extra work when typing copying. There are lot of extension, even Chrome, Firefox etc has it. We are not using it because it is not directly use in the forum. We need something that will be directly use in the forum without extension.",

I think those who love autosave text will surely use this tools on their system since they have been expecting Theymos to implement something like this., My question is how secure is this extension?  Because the easiest way to get phished is through extension to have remote control over your browser this includes monitoring the kind of site we visit and also extracting our password.",

OP, it is nice you have discovered this.  We could test run it to see how good it works on the pages but my fear here is this, how sure are you that this extension would not be exposing our details to hackers. How strong and good is this extension is to be operational. And if I may ask, OP, are you amongst their team? Because what I see you doing is an indirect advertisement for this extension  project.",

Are you part of the developer of the extension?Most users today are still more comfortable using the Text editor when and of course with the same autosave. Some people are quite careful with the use of browser extensions, because there are many incidents of hacking through browser extensions that contain malware and so on. So if your suggestion of an auto-save bitcointalk text editor extension doesn't generate many users it's quite normal.",

There are a lot of cases of dangerous extensions, I mean it saves most of the text you write on the Browsers, but potentially could include sensitive information like passwords...It seems to be a Chinese developer, Im looking forward to it and wanted to use it but just want to get some feedback because there are only a few thousand who used the extension.",

I'm highly skeptical trying extensions because I never can tell what might give my security out. It's not going to be a stress for me to manually save my composition while at it. I rather accommodate that (if it's thought to be any inconvenience) than bridge my security. Yes, I admit that it's stressful when one gets unfinished posts wiped off because they aren't saved automatically. It happened several times to me in the past but better safe than sorry.",

And thanks for sharing the extension. But many members on this forum prefer to think about security and they are highly sticking to the rule of fewer extensions means less malware. As most of the extension must need the permission of each keystroke so that they could save your data on it, and i hope you got my point like when you hit keystroke for entering a password for any web-based wallet or entering any other important password each keystroke will be saved and thus that extension could scam you.So, for now, it would be great if someone from the forum could make one, as a member made image hosting platform (talkimg).",
