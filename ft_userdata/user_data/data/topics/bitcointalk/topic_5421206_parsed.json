It's possible that a solo miner has found a block with a very low hash power, but we can't know how much hash rate is owned by any of individual miners.",

Otherwise, if you're asking how many hashes it took the least to solve a block, then that's unknown. In the end, it only takes one hash to solve a block.",

Just curious, have you added more compacs since then? Are you getting any of the new R909 pod miners?Do you have any of them mining on kanopool as well to diversify or just put them all on ckpool for a higher hash rate?",
