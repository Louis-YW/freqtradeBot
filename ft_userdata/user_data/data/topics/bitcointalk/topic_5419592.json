Nobody knows about it but I see that Elon Musk has a plan for Dogecoin and the acquisition of Twitter could possibly have participated in it. Well, if that be going to happen then many investors will become happy with that, and I am also happy with them. As they are trusting this coin, they deserve to gain returns but until now, it was just speculation and only Elon Musk knows his plan for Dogecoin. Let us see what will happen a few years from now and we don't have to miss his announcement/post on social media for this a way he give hints to the community.",

The latest pump of doge coin happened due to the elon musk. This billionaire is always pushing the price of doge coin. So many doge coin fans were seeing him as a father of meme coin. Â  Any tweet came from him about meme coin could give a huge impact to the price of doge coin. The new rumour about doge coin will be accepted by twitter as a payment system. Quote from: krishnaverma on November 06, 2022, 09:55:11 AMSo is it possible that he will use the ownership title of Twitter to push the prices of Dogecoin also ?It's possible and why not? since he has acquired twitter and his has all of control over twitter.

Bitcoin needs to get a steady run to make sure if doge coin pump will be even longer. You're too late to join in the party, why don't you buy doge coin when the price was around 5 cents?",

Just my thought...He is the best businessman in the world and he owns 5 companies at the same time, he wouldn't be stupid enough to spend 44 billion to buy twitter just for dogecoin or crypto. He definitely had a plan for his entire business before buying twitter. People seem to be wrong to think that he is a crypto lover what he is doing is for profit and not for the market or the future of doge.In my opinion, doge is really lucky to be picked by him but will also die if he switches to frolicking with another coin, maybe it will but for now doge will still benefit a lot from him.",

I think we should not expect to much from Elon Musk in terms of really pushing the adoption of Dogecoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole. I think that he likes the idea of cryptos and is also supporting it but it does not really have a very high priority for him i would guess. He is doing so many things at the same time that he can not really spend a lot of time and energy to push cryptos. I also think that the first big effect of his tweets about Dogecoin have already worn off. So even if he makes a positive tweet about Dogecoin now it is nothing new anymore and it will not really have a big effect on the price anymore.",

Besides these two concepts, I don't see why dogecoin would gain more value solely based on twitter being acquired by Elon Musk. Companies are traded all the time and cryptocurrencies don't get hyped because of that. But if you believe doge can be introduced to twitter's environment soon, make sure to hold some coins.",

He was twitting about Dogecoin long before he bought Twitter and I do not see why he will want to stop now. On the announcement that he had bought it, price of Dogecoin went up and gave holders a new faith in the coin. It is a good investment to buy that coin now as I do not see it dumping.

I think he has yet to apply doge to his company payments, which is a really wise move. Cryptocurrency is very volatile and if he applies it to his company sometimes it will be detrimental to the company, it is not an act of showing affection or proving to someone, with that action he got himself into trouble.",

I don't think one should bet on a crypto because one person is causing hype and promoting it, what a very risky thing to do, this can be akin to manipulation, and it doesn't end well. When a coin can be manipulated by one or a few persons, then mind you that the same coin can likewise crash due to the actions and influence of that person or a few people too, it goes both ways and anything can happen. Having said that, if you believe there is a new hype coming that would pump Dogecoin then you can invest, but for the short term, because hype never lasts long, especially when it is driven by one man, if you want to spend a good amount of money on a coin and reap the benefits in the long run you should look at coins that have an actual utility and aren't basically driven by solely hype/manipulation.",
