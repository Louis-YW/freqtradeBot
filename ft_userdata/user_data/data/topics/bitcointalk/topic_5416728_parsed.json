If it is true, then do we know its address? And another question is, how Teather emit new USDT whereas the contract can't be changed?Don’t make it too complex, Tether(USDT) is a centralized token. Token is not being mine but through minting. The developer has the power to mint, freeze or burn any token because it was designed that way since it was backed by fiat as collateral which means it’s supply will varies depends on the value of USD in there treasury. USDT doesn’t work like Bitcoin, Ethereum or other token that is decentralized. Tether devs can print billions of USDT out of thin air that’s why it always subject for being a scammy stablecoin.",

So at the moment, how sure we are that they are now staying true to the amount of their assets?This is why even if USDT is one of the most common used stablecoin, you should not hold it long term,because not only that they can freeze your account, but they are also vulnerable to possible losses.But always check the contract address from the links provided above, some scammers can lure people to fake ones.",

But here's what they have for the blockchains that has USDT on it.Quote from: https://tether.to/en/[....]Tether tokens exist as digital tokens built on several leading blockchains, including Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash’s Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, Polygon, Tezos, Tron, Solana and Statemine. These transport protocols consist of open source software that interface with blockchains to allow for the issuance and redemption of Tether tokens. [....]Tether on the Ethereum blockchain, as an ERC20 token, is a newer transport layer, which now makes Tether tokens available in Ethereum smart contracts or decentralized applications on Ethereum. As a standard ERC20 token it can also be sent to any Ethereum address.Quote from: a298b112 on October 11, 2022, 03:27:55 PMEven on Bitcoin network? It doesn't have smart contracts as far as I know To understand it easily, being on bitcoin's network and issued through Omni Layer, which is just another network just like the others (ERC20, TRC20, etc.)Quote from: https://cryptoapis.io/blog/89-what-is-omni-layer-and-how-does-it-work-trading.The Omni Layer acts as a bridge between altcoins, smart contracts and smart properties and the Bitcoin blockchain.",

Audited in terms of their back up funds? Yes, this is the big question on Tether for many years and if I'm not mistaken the New York Atty General has initiated this investigations and then Tether doesn't want to cooperate at that time. It steam from the rumors that they don't have the funds to back up 1:1 the US dollar and that's why many question Tether to the point of calling them a scam. But so far, since then they have proven that they are a solid coin and now the biggest stable coin in the market.",

That special privilege is given to the owner of the smart contract, so it does not mean the smart contract explicitly can't be changed.If you look around regarding the term of minting or burning, that is the part where how the USDT get \"emitted\".",
