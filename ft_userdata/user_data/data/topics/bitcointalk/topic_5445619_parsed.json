He already co-owns your wallet with you.Quotei dont know why but can i still secure it? i hope you guys can help meFrom above, you must abandon that wallet and must create a new wallet to use.However, before doing this (creating a new wallet), you must wipe your computer operating system, buy and install a good Antivirus or Internet security software and must change your behavior on Internet.If you don't do above steps and just create a new wallet on an infected computer, hacker will steal your cryptocurrency again.",

Thanks youand for hacker i hope you have some beautiful children that die from cancerWhat you can do is let it go and I'm sorry to have to say that, unless you are also a person who has the skills to hack but since you asked about it, my guess is that you don't have that kind of skill. Expecting bad things to happen to the person who stole your coins makes you as bad as the hacker.You must be careful with your assets, never store large funds in an exchange or wallet where you do not have access to the Private Key and also store your PK in a safe place, try not to store it in online storage such as Google Drive and others.",

I lost a lot of coins/tokens before with phishing using Slack as I was then so innocent at that time not yet aware of how the mechanism of phishing is working to victimize people. Now, on your wallet, I think there is no reason why you would want it back as it is already compromised and there is nothing really you can do to secure it. Just make another wallet as this can easily be done these days and we already have tons of options what wallet to pursue.",

There are no sane and safe reasons you should reuse the same compromised key. Not to mention, all the tokens are stolen!So what do you actually mean to secure it? what is the reason you want to do that? If you don't even know why, I suggest you should create a new wallet and make sure the device you use to generate the wallet is also not compromised, that is the better option.",

I'd advise having a laptop you'd only ever use for transactions and whatnot so as to avoid instances like this, where even if you do get hacked, it'd only affect your regularly used system which you don't let your wallet access. You can try maybe asking for exchanges to blacklist said wallet so related coins to it wouldn't or can't get sold (idk if they'd accept it or not though). The only person who can probably help you ever really is the person who hacked your wallet themselves.",

Thanks youIf hacker has the ability to access your wallet and that means hacker owned your privatekey. That means hacker can do the same thing as you do. That's it. There's no way to secure your wallet. The best way for you to create a new wallet again. That will help you to avoid hacker. Just let it go. Your wallet will never be back again. I do know if you are feeling so sad caused by hacker was drained all of your money but we can do nothing to save your walletQuote from: satria157 on March 20, 2023, 02:07:56 AMand for hacker i hope you have some beautiful children that die from cancerWhy don't you just write it in the comments if your address is in the blockchain explorer? You can hope the hacker will see that once he will be accessing your wallet again. Are you often using your wallet to participate in airdrop?",

All tokens that leave on your wallet and went to different that you don’t possess is consider already as loss. The only way to recover is to track where your funds go and hope that the hacker will use centralized exchange to send your tokens so that you can track the scammer identity.Quote from: satria157 on March 20, 2023, 02:07:56 AMfor hacker i hope you have some beautiful children that die from cancerYou should not curse children because the hacker did this to you and not his child. His child has nothing to do with his father sin. Also you are partly in mistake here for not securing your funds properly.",

Look how many emails we all get a day about \"Your Metamask is compromised\" and many people click the link and get their crypto stolen. Or people who get fake emails from Coinbase saying that their account needs to be verified, they click the phishing link and get everything stolen.

Thanks youand for hacker i hope you have some beautiful children that die from cancerNot anymore, if hackers got access to your private keys or the wallet itself through a smart contract or a website, they get access to all your tokens. There is no way to get them back. Thousands of crypto users are exposed to such attacks every year. Not all people are immediately concerned about their crypto security, having a hardware wallet or a transit wallet to connect to various sites. For some reason, they start to think about it only after they have lost their funds. It is unlikely that someone will help you get back stolen tokens, but they can help you not to lose tokens in the future.",

Thanks youand for hacker i hope you have some beautiful children that die from cancerSorry, you've lost it forever. Transactions in cryptocurrency wallets are irreversible and that's why if somebody hacks it, it's gone and you can't retrieve it anymore unless the hacker sends you back the wallet or the FBI arrests the hackers and finds the hacked funds in their wallets so they can release it back to their victims. Can you remember the activities that you've done prior to the hacking of your wallet? Because if you can remember what you've done, you can trace back that it's the reason for your being hacked. Did you enter some airdrops or wallet giveaways that have asked you to enter your private keys and seeds? Because if you do then you've been a victim of phishing forms that have been hidden in the form of airdrops and this is a common style of those hackers. So, think of where you've fallen and from there maybe you can have an idea that they're the cons.",
