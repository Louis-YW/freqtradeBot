Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxes.asp#:~:text=Taxes%20are%20mandatory%20contributions%20levied,as%20Social%20Security%20and%20Medicare.Taxes are mandatory contributions levied on individuals or corporations by a government entityThis is different from the money paid as fee in wire transfer and some other means of fiat payment.Fiat and bitcoin are completely different. Fiat has no fixed supply, it is centralized, not censorship resistant and it is an inflationary asset which is just the opposite of bitcoin which has limited supply, it is decentralized, censorship resistant and it is a deflationary asset in long term if compared with fiat.",

Here... start with the white paper - https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfThe so-called enforced tax you are talking about is the mining/transaction fee. People who confirm blocks invest in a lot of resources to do so (investing in mining hardware, paying electricity bills, maintenance costs). The Mining rewards and transactions fees are an incentive to keep them running their mining hardware, otherwise the network would collapse or become less decentralized if there were not enough minersEducate yourself before you make such opinions.",

Anyone could make it or succeed without being beaten by nepo babies, people who have privileges, or whatever the fuck's going on that gives some people unfair advantages and opportunities against other people. Bitcoin is chosen by millions of people because at the very least, in this industry we have the chance to succeed and earn money that we otherwise wouldn't have gotten if we remained your 9-5 sleeper agents. So fuck off with the \"bitcoiners are stupid hurr durr it's just fiat with taxes\" hell yeah it is. But at the very least when bitcoin pumps we reap the profits. When bitcoin opens opportunities for people to flourish in their careers they do. Has that happened to fiat?",

Do you see any decentralized national currencies? Is there any currency that gives us freedom? Bitcoin really brings a lot of benefits to us, but it is difficult to understand many people still stupidly reject it and still love fiat. Through fiat, the government is controlling you, you are losing free, and you want to be someone else's puppet, you don't want to be free? If you don't like bitcoin, then ignore it, don't post to let people know your stupidity.",

So, tax is the 1st step for legalization, if a country implements for the assest, in the next time the people would believe that asset is legit.",

That itself is enough for you to consider Bitcoin as a different currency. Does fiat have one? Comparing network fee and enforced tax is also wrong. From the word itself, a network fee is a fee for those who process your transactions in the network. You can't have it for free; it's a task that takes a lot of energy and computation. Whether a nation legalizes it or not, a network fee is always required. Whether a tax is required on top of it or not, it's not anymore on Bitcoin. It's on the government that legalizes it.",

When your nation legalizes it like canada you will pay network fee and tax on top, such wow.Be frank, did you try to google 'Why does bitcoin fees exist\"? I bet you haven't even done any research to answer your question angrily opened thread here. Bitcoin uses the Proof Of Work consensus mechanism to generate bitcoins. On average, one block is generated every ten minutes and this one block is capable to include 3500 transactions (more or less). If there was no transaction fee, one would be able to create millions of transactions with 0 fee and clog the mempool. In order to prevent that, transaction fees were implemented in Bitcoin ecosystem. Also, what's the fair way to prioritize transactions? The higher fee you pay, the quickly your transaction will get processed. And with the help of Lighting Network and some other changes, things will settle down in near future and fees will remain low.",

First of all, calling Bitcoin fiat is like calling the internet a fad; they're both game-changers, but not in the way you're thinking! Fiat currency is backed by the government, and guess what? Governments can print as much of it as they like. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a cap. There will only be 21 million Bitcoins, ever. It's scarcity at its finest.And taxes? Taxes are a societal construct to support infrastructure, welfare, etc. Network fees? Those are part of the blockchain protocol to incentivize miners to keep the system going. They're not the same, buddy. And when it comes to extra taxes for legalization? That’s like saying I shouldn't use my credit card because of transaction fees. Come on, get real.",

Yes, right. Bitcoin has nothing to do with things being controlled by the government.Apart from not understanding the OP in terms of the difference in bitcoin fees and taxes, Governments can benefit from transactions in bitcoin and other crypto assets traded by exchanges that are located and operate in certain country licensing areas. The exchange belongs to a private company and of course there is an obligation for the company to pay taxes with the terms and conditions that have been decided.Of course a legal exchange that can operate even if the country defines crypto as a commodity asset like in my country.Because investors or traders in countries that do not legalize crypto as a legal means of payment must convert it into fiat.This may be of use to the OP and I won't continue this discussion unless there is something interesting to discuss.",
