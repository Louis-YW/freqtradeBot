  "content": "People think Bitcoin could be a way to protect their money if the economy gets uncertain, especially if there's inflation or the value of money goes down. This is because there's only a limited amount of Bitcoin and it's not controlled by any one government or group. But it's also important to remember that Bitcoin can be risky, just like any investment. It's smart to do your own research and talk to experts before you invest any money.",

It's always advisable to conduct thorough research and consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.Bitcoin is really a potential asset in face of some economic forces; some people just do not realize it. The consistent printing of cash cannot be enforced with the Bitcoin technology because of its specific total supply. Due to the excessive printing of cash, its purchasing power keeps depreciating, and these can even get worse over time, and by then most people will consider Bitcoin a safe haven.Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and it even gives people the opportunity to buy when the price is low and they can also sell when the price goes up, that's if they want, so there's no financial expert that can accurately predict the Bitcoin price movement and volatility. Bitcoin cannot be compared to the devaluation of printed money, because in the past year you could buy enough things in the market, but as the day goes by, inflation keeps increasing, and it's even bad in some countries.",

It's always advisable to conduct thorough research and consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.With the current economic situation around the world, it's less risky to invest in bitcoin. Holding fiat possesses a greater trait. All investors know what they want before they want to invest in Bitcoin, and they have also seen greater potential in the currency before they make that decision. The continued printing of local currency has made it unsafe for investors to hold fiat because they depreciate in value, which reduces their purchasing power. Even if Bitcoin prices drop, it does not necessarily mean that their value has dropped or depreciated. It's left to investors to analyze what they actually want.  Left to me alone, it's unwise to compare Bitcoin to that of any local currency.",

Quote from: Sidra101 on April 08, 2023, 05:34:20 PMSome investors view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, particularly inflation or currency devaluation. Saving Bitcoins is much better than saving dollars. If inflation occurs, the value of the currency will decrease, and the investment value will increase. So Bitcoin investment is to prevent bad conditions from happening, especially regarding the economy. Maybe people think if inflation occurs everyone will sell Bitcoin so that the price of Bitcoin will decrease. That's the wrong way, investors will actually hold Bitcoin if inflation occurs. Maybe you can compare Bitcoin price movements during the pandemic. Precisely the price of Bitcoin is increasing when economic conditions are getting more difficult. Don't be afraid of price fluctuations. Price fluctuations are an opportunity to make a profit, both for those who buy and those who sell them.",

The governments and banks that print so many notes of a currency are the main negative actors who devalue a currency. Corrupt officials are also responsible for the devaluation of a currency due to their greedy nature.Yes, Bitcoin is decentralized and its total supply is limited to 21 million Bitcoin only. I think that's a great thing about it. I believe that makes Bitcoin a gem in this digital world.It's true that Bitcoin is volatile but those who understand the art of Hodling don't have to worry about the volatility. As long as they Hodl their Bitcoin, they are safe from any known risks. I don't believe that it's needed to ask others advice before investing in Bitcoin, it's far better to invest on your own.  You can also learn about Bitcoin from online resources before investing in it. This forum is also one of those useful resources.",

The analysis that you convey is far more logical in understanding something that has happened and is easily translated in cases that often occur in Bitcoin. In principle, it is not Bitcoin who committed fraud, but people use Bitcoin as a medium to commit fraud indirectly. So it is not feasible to say in general that Bitcoin committed fraud, while a platform that provides services is also another media that is not directly related to Bitcoin.People cannot sort out to each other so they try to equalize as a whole, even though Bitcoin will never have a price or never become the best asset for investment if there is no relationship between supply and demand in its journey. Connecting as a whole with bitcoin is clearly something wrong and the relationship must also be separated to be tracked one by one.",

The traditional fiat system has always been at odds with Bitcoin and this conflict is likely to persist indefinitely. The reason for this is that Bitcoin is a truly decentralized cryptocurrency that cannot be controlled by centralized economists. This poses the greatest challenge to Bitcoin. Another issue is that people often view Bitcoin solely as an investment asset, when it should be regarded primarily as a currency for borderless transactions. Therefore, we need to treat Bitcoin as a proper currency and then consider investing in it.",

You practically nailed the whole point there, the truth of the matter is that bad actors have been the major challenges in the Bitcoin economy and this is why it will be hard for us to have a clean sheet because of the many frauds committed by the so called Bitcoin services providers who have not been straight or supporting to the existing Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is secured trusted and highly secured,  but third-party Bitcoin services providers such as fake and scam investment platforms and other money laundering platforms have been the bad actors we are talking about here. But when we talk about an edge above inflation,  then we should truly hold Bitcoin against the traditional currencies who are slaves to inflation and money printing scam from  the central bank.",
