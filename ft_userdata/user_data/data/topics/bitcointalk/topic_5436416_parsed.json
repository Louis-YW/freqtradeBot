These alts have been used for farming and staking so I guess its better to use them for long term earning through dividends or token rewards from staking and farming especially now that we are still on bear market season.",

It's the one that controls the market and is being followed by majority of the coins. So, if you've 70%-80% of Ethereum, I think you should put more to bitcoin unless you're focusing with ETH.",

This is about how we invest and choose coins based on the research we do. But you need to know that when it is about investment, you only need to invest with the money you can afford.",

My interest in altcoins reduced in a few months when I first started because of their lack of transparency and easy bankruptcy in a bear market that hit newly launched altcoins hard.Hence I currently invest in bitcoin as much as possible. To me every other altcoin ends up being a liability and a source of loss.Quote from: SmokerApeth on January 23, 2023, 10:44:06 AMDo you think the current rise in Bitcoin and other altcoin is real? I think it's a fake. Why dont you explain why you think it is \"fake\"? The data on aggregator sites is pooled from different exchanges and they would not all be lying about their stats for many days. They cant just fake that data and allow every site to put that up without making some news headlines in CoinTelegraph or so on.",

Bitcoin and some altcoins might continue to grow bigger on my portfolio since I am not done purchasing them regularly. I buy Bitcoin monthly and then have my sights on Syscoin, Hedera, and some more BNBs.It would be easier to track especially on the ROI per coin if you just purchase coins with fixed amounts like $1,000, $100, or $200 rather than based it on percentage.",

I would prefer to pick altcoins instead of those native coins. My reason is those coins were not giving huge returns in short time. I have bought aptos at $3 and yeah I make more than 4x in less than a month. That proves that if altcoin is even worthy compared with native coins.

If there's a way to participate with some Bounty, I'll grab that opportunity and take profit from it, I also practice reinvesting where I don't spend my profit because I believe it can be more worth it if I reinvest it.",

In my opinion, the portfolio is better to assemble among a variety of projects, with an optimal distribution, so that there is diversification in case of various unforeseen situations. Creating a portfolio that will consist of 2-3 projects is, in my opinion, too inefficient.",
