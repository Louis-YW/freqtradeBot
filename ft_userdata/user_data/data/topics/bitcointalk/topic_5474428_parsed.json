As for the website might be a reputable site been bought. I would say many people might have fall victim and many will still fall victim if the site isn’t brought down. If people could easily give away their keys to scammers to help them reverse transactions, then submitting seed phrase to help them accelerate transactions with Lower fees paid at this period will just be same thing.",

There's going to be a surge in these scams that are like this because like a scum that they are they will always be present. When everyone finally learns to avoid stuff that are too good to be true, maybe we will see these people that don't have a lot of good things to do with their time finally give up scamming people but that part where everyone where they avoid stuff is going to be a hard task and almost an impossible dream. Good catch OP, hope that you have the energy and will to catch more of this because there's more coming with the ever increasing bitcoin transaction fees.",
