  "content": "Hey this is my first post on this forum!To be honest, I'm generally new to the defi, crypto, web3, and this forum (!) so I'm still learning a lot but I think I understand some of the basics. I've read the rules and guidelines before making this post but please correct me if I made any mistakes. It seems that the community here is very knowledgeable so I'm grateful to be here and to absorb  I did a search for \"MetaMask\" on here and found that MetaMask published a tweet about Bitcoin support about 4-5 months ago, but when I did a google search to find any updates, I got nil. From reading the forums, I got the sense that MetaMask is kind of useful as a prepaid credit card for interfacing with dapps but not as a long-term storage for large amounts of crypto as it has some security concerns being a chrome extension and all.Technically, I get that Bitcoin isn't an ERC20 token so it's not compatible with MetaMask which is Ethereum-based, but there's the option of wrapped BTC right? So does it even make sense to add Bitcoin support for MetaMask? Seems like a low priority.",

Seems like a low priority.Welcome aboard!Wrapped bitcoin is just another ERC20 token with a fancy name; it's not bitcoin.As you said, Metamask works with things on Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin has it's own blockchain, different from ETH. So Metamask cannot just add Bitcoin like it adds tokens.",

A quick google search revealed that there are significantly more merchants now but BitGo remains the only custodian.It's kind of interesting that there is still only one custodian, isn't it?",

If you buy WBTC, there is no guarantee that the value of WBTC will be equal to the value of bitcoin in the future. I do not know if this is possible or not, and I do not want to look into it, but what happens if the owner of the WBTC smart contract decides to rug pull?",

You can't add Bitcoin to Metamask, you can't interact at all with Bitcoin as MetaMask is not a Bitcoin client.ERC20 is a token standard anyone can create at the click of a button with certain apps, you can even name it BitcoinSuper if you want. WBTC is just one of several types of tokens \"representing\" Bitcoin and tracking its price.Also, not a single exchange I can recall now uses \"Bitcoin Core\". It's Bitcoin.

      "body": "I think from a security standpoint it's safer to have the two wallets as separate and different (if your browser gets malware, your other wallet would be safe). Things like hardware wallets are a good way to bridge the gap if you only want one nmemonic and passphrase but want to keep a good level of security too.I think metamask would be better off focusing on improving their gui and adding extra and better functions before they added bitcoins or other coins. I feel it might even be confusing to use metamask to interact with other blockchains like harmony one/phantom/bsc for newbies already too, if bitcoin was added in a similarly confusing way to those then I think you'd see a lot more mistakes and loss of funds before any widespread benefit came from it.",

For exactly the same reason Metamask will never add Bitcoin into its software. They have no financial incentive to include something decentralized like the Bitcoin blockchain. ConsenSys Software Inc. owns Metamask as well as a company Infura that provides API to Ethereum full nodes. Given that it is infeasible for common people to have their own full nodes running, ConsenSys makes money selling access to this centralized bullshit while also making money staking these useless coins. In the case of Bitcoin, however, you don't make money just by running a full node, and you can't sell anything because a full node can be spun up even on small devices like Raspberry Pi, which means if you need one, you can have one without subscription to API. Unlike Bitcoin, its full nodes aren't scarce, whereas, in Ethereum, the coin itself is abundant, but its nodes are very rare.",
