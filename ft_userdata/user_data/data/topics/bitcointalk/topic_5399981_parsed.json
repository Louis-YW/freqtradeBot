  "content": "Now, NFTs are the next fundraising frontier. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they offer something beyond a direct monetary donation. NFTs have allowed charities, celebrities, and individuals to auction off their digital creations, with all the proceeds going to a charity of their choice. Beeple, the artist who still holds the record for the most expensive NFT ever sold, auctioned another NFT for charity. The artwork sold for $6 million. The proceeds went to the Open Earth Foundation. The entire show the artwork was part of was in aid of the foundation.It’s been great to see an outpouring of support from CryptoCossacks who  are donating all of their NFT proceeds to  ukranian charities. There are many celebrities among them, their NFTs collection has very rare items, and you can get one of them!https://sifted.eu/articles/going-into-war-armed-with-nfts/",

Also I have recently found one good NFT project \"reptile chronicles\", most ot the people in this project from Ukraine. I think they are making a really good p2e game, which will succeed and profitable. And I want to support this guys, they are making such a good content in really hard time",

Well, as long as it helps other people and the money came from a rich guy who doesn't have anything good to do with all his riches then it's okay. Better. But, if it's NFT directly being donated to charities then I will disagree with it. Don't give those people a hard time finding a buyer. Just give the damn money.",

By the way they are know as \"cryptocossacks\" and they are selling the NFTs and giving the money to support ukraniania developers, women, girls and other good courses to help those who are suffering.",
