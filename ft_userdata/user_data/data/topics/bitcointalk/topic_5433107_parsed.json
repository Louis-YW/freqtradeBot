I hope that you will release an application for phones on Google Play and App Store in the future. I hope that you will add a bar to search for any currency through the Qchart site. I also see that crypto new ATH and ATL data is not accurate and there are currencies whose price is $0. I hope you put their prices and percentages accurately. Also, if you put the lighting and darkening feature on the site, it will be better for readers. Just a few suggestions, thank you",

When I change the time interval to a week, day, hour, \"TOP Gainers/lisers\" do not work but \"Hot\" works fine. - I wish to add more sources of data? I don't know what you are relying on now. Are you relying on CoinMarketCap API? - I wish to add some charts, with the same elegance. - Adding \"monitor coins\" where the person can create his own list and monitor it. - Add some news to help predict.",

The interface is also very easy for users to see and to be honest I will probably use this tool to be able to see the movement of coins in the next 24 hours.
