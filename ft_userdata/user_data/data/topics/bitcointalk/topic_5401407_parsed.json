  "content": "Today I read the good news from an article on the site cryptopotato.com. entitled \"American Fast Food Chain Chipotle Embraces Crypto Payments in the US\".From this article, of course, this is positive news for the world of cryptocurrencies and including bitcoin in it. because a popular restaurant chain – Chipotle Mexican Grill – collaborated with Flexa to allow clients to pay their bills in cryptocurrency. This offer is available at nearly 3,000 company locations in the United States.It doesn't stop there, it turns out that other good news written in the article is that a luxury hotel in Dubai - The Manor Hotel by JA - is also planning to allow payments in digital assets.and Chipotle Mexican Grill is a fairly large restaurant with many branches which is about 2,979 in the US.By partnering Chipotle Mexican Grill with flexa, it is possible for customers to pay with around 100 types of digital assets such as Bitcoin and other altcoins such as doge and many others.So this is a very good thing especially for Americans and generally it is also good for those of us who are in the cryptocurrency field.maybe all of my friends here can add restaurants in other countries that already accept bitcoin and other crypto digital assets as payment.I hope this article brings a positive atmosphere to all crypto users to think more positively.Sourch : https://cryptopotato.com/american-fast-food-chain-chipotle-embraces-crypto-payments-in-the-us/",

      "body": "Already there is a thread for the same discussion. Among the list of food chains accepting bitcoin, now Chipotle have got added. Around 3000 locations around US, part of Chipotle accepting bitcoin through flexa is a positive news. Atleast a single member on every location making purchase with bitcoin will count to a big number. Another thing is the visibility to flexa, people are much used to bitpay and now everyone will get to know about flexa which is doing similar service as bitpay.Chipotle now accepts crypto payments (only in US stores for now)",

      "body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill is indeed a large fast food franchise chain which can bring in quite a nice value raising source for Bitcoin and crypto. Although if they provided some tiny incentives for paying with Bitcoin then I'm sure that value would triple at the very least.Can't say that I ever heard of Chipotle Mexican Grill outside of the united states so internationally I doubt  this news will have a much larger effect.",
