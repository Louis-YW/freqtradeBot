Don't get me wrong, it's probably a cool and rare collectible, just not my thing.If you plan on any raffle near spot for silver, you'll quite likely see my there. This is one of those oddball things, IF it grades well it's worth a lot more: https://www.apmex.com/product/105155/2017-south-africa-1-oz-silver-krugerrand-premium-buBut I am not motivated to grade it.On the regular market it's worth about the $80 I put it up for. They do at times sell for less, and at times for more. I figured for $5 a spot people may want to get in.This was more of a \"I pulled the Christmas wrapping paper out of the closet and found this\" and since I have not done a raffle in a while figured why not. I really don't know what non collectible silver I have around anymore. Dumped a lot of it summer 2020 @ $27.50 and never got back in. Probably should one of these days.-Dave",
