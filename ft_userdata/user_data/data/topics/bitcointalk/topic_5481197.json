If we focus on what others are saying about us, we are not going to get anything done, we need to realize that this is not what we should be doing and we need to realize that we are at a point of turn in bitcoins history that if we could get this ETF actually approved, like it should be, then we are going to have something magnificent.Price already took over to 47k levels and I think that should be the most important part, ignore who said what about bitcoin, we shouldn't be bitter about peoples opinions, let them all have their own opinion, as long as I keep making profit from bitcoin, I do not have any trouble with them saying anything at all.",

The majority of bankers and politicians are against cryptocurrencies in general, and Bitcoin is not an exception either. Jamie Dimon isn't the first banker to state such an opinion; who is that guy anyway? Why should anyone bother? He's not the first, and he won't be the last either. How I see things is that they at least finally understood that they cannot stop the advancement of Bitcoin; thus, they're trying to have a share of that cake as well.Personally, I expected a larger hype due to the ETF approval, which I find a little odd. Although it's still a positive event, if we suppose that it hadn't been approved, Bitcoin would still survive and would continue to progress.",

The latter having won a court case of sorts over them and it will be unwise to think that because Gary Gensler approved those applications, it means he's now Bitcoin friendly  We're all aware of how much the SEC will do anything to have prolonged these ETFs but I guess the fact that many eyes are on them sort of changed the plan.For Dimon's case, it's not news of how apathetic he is to Bitcoin and as long as people are entitled to giving their opinions, they should do it as it won't change the fact that Bitcoin is a moving train that can't be stopped and if for anything I guess that's the reason for his chronic displeasure.Sometimes I wonder why they feel the financial institutions are less prone to money laundering or fraudulent activities and prefer to paint Bitcoin to be the bad guy. Is it that the financial institutions are more secure and have a tight security?",

Jamie Dimon is an agent of FUD and anybody who believes these fake predictions will regret their actions later. It is a free world, however, where people are free to express their views about anything. So Jamie Dimon is free to say what he thinks about Bitcoin, but his views turned out to be wrong.

Could it be that the series of false approvals affected the confidence of potential investors? Nevertheless, these ETF firms just started trading today, hopefully, more money will be attracted to the market. But the price has remained stable which is a pointer that the market might be heading towards less volatility.",

Similar statements for Bitcoin, he made have been made before and that is precisely why Bitcoin remains strong. The idea of decentralization is a concern for someone holding the top position in a centralized infrastructure. As a community, we have encountered objections from people similar to him before. It's important not to dwell on these criticisms, as we know that Bitcoin will continue to grow and will one day become a legal tender worldwide. There's no need to complain to or engage with individuals who doubt Bitcoin's potential. I feel you would agree with my highlighted statement.",

Peirce's statementQuoteFifth, we have alienated a generation of product innovators within our space. Our unreasonable approach to these applications has signaled that regulatory prejudice against new products and services can lead us to sidestep the law and unreasonably delay product launches. The industry has logged hundreds of meetings, has filed submissions, withdrawals and amendments, and ultimately had to resort to a costly legal battle to get us to today.Hester Peirce used very strong words to express her opinion on this issue, role of SEC. and what they did before this approval batch includes many shame faults. I consider her letter is like a direct strong slap against Gary Gensler.Gary Gensler spread lies again even he voted Yes.Statement on the Approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded ProductsQuoteThough we’re merit neutral, I’d note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that’s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.
