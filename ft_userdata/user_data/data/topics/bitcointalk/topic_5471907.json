  "content": "Welcome everyone,First of all, I work as a mediator in the BountyPortals Buy/ Sell Group on Telegram. I act as a middleman between the seller and the buyer, and I have already successfully completed many transactions totaling approximately $4,000 in a short period.I have repeatedly and firmly announced in the group that I am not responsible for anyone who conducts deals outside the group without using our escrow service. However, someone named Darkfighter on Telegram violated this rule and did not comply with my escrow service. He successfully gained the trust of one member he scammed, and his name is (Bob Gogh) Telgram:@Bobavalanche21.How did I discover that Darkfighter was the scammer who stole from Bob despite using alt accounts on Telegram and the forum?First, Bob is an investor in the Ethernity.CLOUD project on Telegram. Someone invited him to the escrow group I manage, and he posted an offer to purchase ETNY coins. The scammer, Darkfighter, completed some small transactions with Bob to gain his trust without using my mediation service. Afterward, the scammer proposed that he could handle transactions on Bob's behalf, but Bob would be the one to pay in the end. The scammer used multiple Telegram accounts for these transactions, including @gsxrfiabs, which further increased Bob's trust in Darkfighter. However, after I informed him, Bob was unaware of why this person used multiple accounts.In the end, Darkfighter suggested that Bob make a deal with a new Telegram account and claimed that he could buy ETNY coins from this account without using the escrow service. Bob asked him if the owner of this account was trustworthy and not a scammer, to which Darkfighter assured him that he was very trustworthy and a member of Bitcointalk. Based on Darkfighter's word, Bob sent $300 USDT to @PhychoN, and after receiving the money, the scammer did not send Bob the agreed-upon 10K ETNY coins. [TXid]Now, how did I know that @Darkfighter12 is @gsxrfiabs and the owner of the alt telegram account @PhychoN, which carried out this scam:[1]- @gsxrfiabs, who conducted the trades on behalf of Bob, used the account @gsxrfiabs, which is linked to @Darkfighter12 on Telegram. You can see the evidence here: [link]. @gsxrfiabs later claimed that the @Darkfighter12 telegram account was his alt, But he later denied this.[2]- Dark claimed that @PhychoN was a very trustworthy person and that he had not conducted any transactions with him before. Even when asked about their conversations, Dark claimed that he had deleted the chat history. PhychoN was a member of bitcointalk and had created his account less than a month ago, holding the Newbie rank. Notably, PhychoN had no knowledge of the Ethernity.CLOUD project and was not a member of its official Telegram group, and Dark concluded that PhychoN was very trustworthy for Bob to make a deal with him because he saw his discussions in the Fleamintecosystem project group on Telegram and that all members of this group are seemed good LOL. After @PhychoN defrauded Bob, Dark said, using this alt on telegram @gsxrfiabs, that he did not know the scammer, even though his conversation proved that he knew him well.[3]- After I contacted @gsxrfiabs, the alternate account of Darkfighter, and exposed his actions, he left all the escrow groups I managed and removed our chat history. He also deleted the usernames of the PhychoN account and @gsxrfiabs. He edited the join application posts on his forum account, removing Telegram usernames and wallet addresses, providing clear evidence that he was the scammer PhychoN using these alternate accounts. (But before this, he played a cunning game to prove that he had no relation to the PhychoN account and that he did not know it, so he posted in the Fleamintecosystem group, with the admins banning this member because he is a scammer.)[4]- Darkfighter's account on the forum was tagged by @Nutildah with neutral trust, stating that the account was associated with a large farm of alt accounts. You can check out his wallet addresses and Telegram accounts to see that this scammer is highly cheater. It was Bob's mistake to trust him with his money.Now, I will put all the evidence (screenshots and Recorded videos) through the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t7wY6YHQ6IIKH0of9LR9GG3MNERcrHcM?usp=sharingI have banned him from the groups I manage on Telegram. And tagged him on the forum with negative trust so that he would not defraud other members using his alt accounts. He then used his alt accounts and sent negative trusts to my account to mislead and deceive forum members.I call upon all the scam detectives on the forum and our experienced members to investigate this case, review the evidence which contains screenshots and recorded videos, and thank you all.Darkfighter account on the forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3404862PhychoN account on the forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3579199Some of his alt accounts he used against me:1- mohiulbd - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=9948632- Love Men - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=34450413- Mezu end - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3269374The following quotes from the alt accounts of this scammer whose deceptive methods were exposed by @Shishir99 on this TOPIC |  ARCHIEVEDQuote from: Shishir99 on October 27, 2023, 09:39:21 AMQuote from: Darkfighter on October 27, 2023, 09:16:03 AM--Quote from: mohiulbd on October 27, 2023, 09:21:34 AMyes i see in your address there is no transaction in 15 days how can he give u red?

I'm sorry for what happened to Bob Gogh 300$ is a big amount and an needs an effort to be earned especially in some regions, it's so unfortunate how people can manipulate others and how Devilish their intentions can be. Thanks to Albon, the truth has come out and everyone should learn the lesson of not trusting someone no matter who they are. If that person doesn’t have more to lose by scamming you, it's better to avoid him.Why trusting a trusted escrow? It's simply because that person would lose more than they would gain from trying to scam you. It doesn't get simpler than that. If a known escrow has a proved case against him he will lose so much (trust = clients = profit)All the evidences are provided here by albon, and the scammer in this situation has been well exposed, what caused him distress and fear so he even stupidly revealed his other alt accounts. The story is over, and everything is clear. Any further posts from this scammer would be spam, and he should be banned for it.",

It was Bob's mistake to trust him with his money.Now, I will put all the evidence (screenshots and Recorded videos) through the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t7wY6YHQ6IIKH0of9LR9GG3MNERcrHcM?usp=sharingI have banned him from the groups I manage on Telegram. And tagged him on the forum with negative trust so that he would not defraud other members using his alt accounts. He then used his alt accounts and sent negative trusts to my account to mislead and deceive forum members.I call upon all the scam detectives on the forum and our experienced members to investigate this case, review the evidence which contains screenshots and recorded videos, and thank you all.Darkfighter account on the forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3404862PhychoN account on the forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3579199Some of his alt accounts he used against me:1- mohiulbd - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=9948632- Love Men - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=34450413- Mezu end - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3269374The following quotes from the alt accounts of this scammer whose deceptive methods were exposed by @Shishir99 on this TOPIC |  ARCHIEVEDQuote from: Shishir99 on October 27, 2023, 09:39:21 AMQuote from: Darkfighter on October 27, 2023, 09:16:03 AM--Quote from: mohiulbd on October 27, 2023, 09:21:34 AMyes i see in your address there is no transaction in 15 days how can he give u red?

At least I assume that's the purpose of your post. What's the purpose of your post? What are you trying to point out here? That you haven't use tg handler \"gsxrfiabs\" for a month and thus the scammer here just snatched a disposed username and you're the victim here because they happen to choose your username [most likely by looking at the usernames at bounty posts] out of others, right on time when you no longer use it so they can claim it as theirs? If they're one month too soon, they won't be able to use that username because you're still wearing it. What's the chance of such coincidence? One billionth?Which one is more likely and sound more plausible? That one billionth chance scenario or that you still have that username up to when albon confronted you and then you disposed it and edited posts that could be a smoking gun that tie you to the scamming act?",

These accounts are undoubtedly linked to a single user, there's no doubt about that I don’t understand why this guy still defending himself and making it more obvious for us beside exposing more alt accounts of himself . Also what made me wonder is how this user found the time and energy to create and manage this farm of accounts, all with the hope of deceiving and participating in multiple bounties instead of focusing with to upgrade one account.I believe that if this person had focused the same amount of time and the years he spent into a single account, he could have built a respectable account capable of generating more income from signature campaigns and even getting a crypto remote job more than all of these accounts combined. Well, unfortunately not everyone have the same mindset and thinking, I suppose.I'm also curious about how many other users creating several alt accounts to cheat in bounties or scam others.",
