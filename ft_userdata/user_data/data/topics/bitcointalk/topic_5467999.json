  "content": "Bitcoin is a dream to hold for every crypto hodler. This may look difficult for a poor or an average man with low income especially in an economic situation where most people find it difficult to feed themselves very well on regular basis. What is the way out here? Before telling you the way out, I will like to ask you the following questions:🗝️🗝️ Do you offer a service?🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Do you have something you are good at?🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Do you sell a product?🗝️🗝️If your answer to either of the above question is YES, then you can easily accumulate Bitcoin with ease. Remember, alot of people are out there that are ready to pay for that your service or buy that your products with part of the Bitcoin they hold. All what they need is little encourage from you. Although this may involve some sacrifice from you. How can you encourage such people to pay for your service or buy your product with Bitcoin:👉👉 By giving a discount on service render or purchase made with BTC.Comparing with Fiat payment, little discount may be giving to any product or service render that will be paid with BTC. Just 1% discount can make some customers change their mind from Fiat payment to BTC.👉👉 Accepting to pay part or all of the transaction charges especially if products purchased comes with good profit.BTC transaction charges most times may scare customers away from paying with BTC. If service rendered or goods purchased come with good profit, one may decide to pay the transaction charges in other to encourage his/her customers to make payment in BTC. 👉👉 Giving incentives to customers for service render or products purchased with BTC especially if good profit are made from the service render or products purchased.Little incentives like BTC customized biro, books, handband etc can do alot to attract customers. Remember this customized items can attract them to pay in BTC at the same time help to publicize BTC more in your community. CONCLUSIONBTC is a coin worth holding for the future. Creating a means to accumulate it is more than sacrificing for the betterment of ones future. Although the above sacrifice may not look easy now but will definitely pay in multiple folds in future.",

Just 1% discount can make some customers change their mind from Fiat payment to BTC.Why? Not necessary. If someone is capable of giving discounts, they can go for it, but it is not needed because we do not need to force bitcoin adoption in a way to let people make less profit or no profit, bitcoin is attracting the people even without anything like discounts. Not everyone can be able to give discounts.Quote from: odunybiz on September 25, 2023, 06:35:23 AM Accepting to pay part or all of the transaction charges especially if products purchased comes with good profit.BTC transaction charges most times may scare customers away from paying with BTC.

Remember that bitcoin still increase in marketcap even when people do not know about it like this time.",

Using Bitcoin as a means of payment, shouldn't be far different from using other payment method. It is just an alternative means that should be added to your payment system. If a customer decides to use it, then it's up to them. I don't see any reason why you should do many discount.Just as @ _act_ has said, they aren't necessary it will only run you at a loss.",

As per your point, if I have a specialty or a skill then that's more than enough for me to start accumulating Bitcoin, I won't mind getting paid in Fiat/Paper money, I will just have to use the money to purchase Bitcoin, Viola! I am now a Bitcoin holder. To all readers out there, you don't have to work for someone and except them to pay you in Bitcoin before you start holding some Bitcoin, if you have no job, go out and learn a skill then start using some percentage of the money you make to accumulate Bitcoin.I am a fashion designer and I use to accept Bitcoin as payment, but not all my customers like paying me with Bitcoin, only very few numbers of people do, like four to five of them, and they are also investors, they prefer to hold and there are times they said I will have to get paid in Fiat for now, still I don't let this stop me from my DCA ( Dollar Cost Averaging ) every week, I can get paid in Fiat, no problem, but I will just visit Binance exchange and swap my Fiat to Bitcoin.",

And more so, it's just those that have already known much about btc would be willing to pay in bitcoin.How long do you intend giving this discount? Because if you have to employ this measure and stop within a short time it will seem like it was a deceptive plot to indirectly force people to use bitcoin and there's a likelihood they may go back to fiat immediately the discount ends because that's what brought them in and not the knowledge of benefits about bitcoin prior to the discount service.Your idea is not bad at but not  necessary at this stage of bitcoin except for those that are ready to go through the trouble.",

The discount could last for prolly a few months after you start accepting Bitcoin, after which it should be discontinued.Quote from: SFR10 on September 25, 2023, 03:03:44 PMThat's weird!

I used to advice business people, especially the small-scale business people that it is not a matter of compulsion for them to drag their customers to begin to buy their products with Bitcoin. You should introduce the payment method that is very easy for customers to use than to bring a system that is complicated and the customers do not understand very well. It is high time we began to differentiate between business and bitcoin. You can decide to promote Bitcoin in whatever ways but differentiate it with business. Accept payment in fiat and you can buy bitcoin with the profit you make from your business. It is very simple.",

It's clearly a NO!Second, there is another total misconception that the seller doesn't incur any fee.Assuming you get paid by 10 people for stuff worth $5, when you need to actually use that money you're looking at 10 outputs you have to move, a bad day in fees and you're again losing 10%, do you think is worth it?
