Removed or trashed posts affects users activity as well as your rank.Quote from: FAQ: Everything you need to know about forum 'activity, account ranks and meritCan activity or my rank decrease?Yes. It can only decrease if you have all the posts you made from a particular period deleted or the threads you posted in trashcanned. If you do it's possible to drop rank until you have enough activity again.Quote from: UchihaSarada on March 24, 2023, 08:09:59 AMIt should be 0 post, 0 activity.Again, posts moved to trashcan is still counts. That's why you see 1 post on that profile and 0 activity.",

Write in any topic in the Russian section of the post with any text, then I'll delete it to the trashcan. Thus, we'll check whether the posts, which are moved to the trashcan, are counted in activity or not. And we'll close this question. You can choose any topic, or I can give you a link to any topic, as you want. Remember your post count before you write your post.",

It's normal for the forum with so many users and such crazy activity to have some issues showing the post count correctly.Noramly you notice this with the small accounts with just a few posts, but it happens to the big accounts too. Back in the day of the thread bumping times, this was a normal issue. I've seen accounts with 20 post counts and 0 real posts. After a day (some cases days) those were reset back to the real numbers so it happens often.",
