But nobody did not pay attention to the fact that If country lowering the currency they might be up for something. Now russia currency aswell falling for the same reason wich is keeping rates low and currency value low so this way they can finance war and military. If we look at 3 countries Poland, Turkey , Russia their monetary policy show's clearly they use lower rates to finance their military. Now all the world talking about weak russian currency but nobody don't pay attention If country currency is that much low then this country might be very dangerous for other countries.  The lower rates can give huge financial power.",

Poland spends on army to deter Russia from an attack, so their military power is growing, and Russia is arming itself in panic before the collapse of the front in Ukraine. Poland accumulates military power and Russia burns it through a senseless war. Poland has a healthy economy and Russia is burdened with huge sanctions, so it has to give huge discounts to smugglers and sanctions evaders. i have heard that the raw materials that russia sells to china do it at a 40% discount. and china take advantage of the discount and fill warehouses to the top. As soon as the economy slows down, Russia will be in big trouble. Poland can cut back on spending at any time, russia can't.",

      "body": "On August 14, the Russian ruble fell to 16-month lows: on the Moscow Exchange, the dollar crossed the mark of 101 rubles, and the euro exceeded 111 rubles. The Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia met for an emergency meeting, where it decided to raise the key rate from August 15, 2023 from 8.5% to 12% per annum. The rate increase was unscheduled, since the next meeting, which was supposed to consider monetary policy, was supposed to take place only on September 15th.The main reason for the weakening of the ruble is the consequences of a large-scale war that Russia unleashed against Ukraine, and, accordingly, the effect of foreign sanctions that were introduced by Western countries, primarily the United States and Europe.The fall of the ruble was affected by the blocking of a significant part of the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Russia by the deputy borders of the Russian Federation, the disconnection of state and individual private banks from SWIFT, as well as the voluntary refusal of foreign counterparty banks to continue relations with Russian banks. The inflow of foreign currency into Russia has significantly decreased and this has violated the stability of the ruble.Therefore, the fall of the ruble, which is already one of the three worst world currencies, is natural and there is no manifestation of its strength and foresight of the Russian leadership. Everything is just the opposite.Source:https://focus.ua/economics/586148-rubl-ishchet-dno-kak-i-pochemu-stremitelno-padaet-kurs-rossiyskoy-valyuty",

An empty place. You can't buy anything for it, it's not profitable to hold it. It is a toxic asset.Rupiahs and Yuan, Russia cannot convert into something important - stable currencies like the US dollar, or buy critical goods for the economy. Russia's \"friends\" India and China are now literally \"financially screwing\" Russia ! India has banned and blocked the ability to convert Rupiahs into dollars. And also imposed strong restrictions on the sale of Rupees to Russia. Russia can't buy anything but primitive goods from India with the Rupees it can manage (and there are also frozen Rupees). China has done the same. To understand the magnitude of the problem: \"Russian oil producers, who have ramped up shipments to India by 11 times, are facing an inability to get a return for the crude they have sold. According to Reuters, about $39 billion is hanging in Indian banks, at the current exchange rate it is 3.6 trillion rubles, which is the annual budget of the entire program to support the Russian economy.\". This fact you can easily check",

      "body": "That makes no sense whatsoever!For starters it's the law of supply and demand, when they print fiat nonstop, it dumps in value and in the past couple of years (starting from COVID in 2020) Turkey has been printing a ton of money to keep the economy afloat but at the cost of significantly increasing the inflation and devaluation of Lira. From 1 USD being 5 Lira in 2020 to today's 27 which is a 440% rise (or devaluation of Lira).This has practically ruined Turkish economy.Secondly what you explained about intentionally decreasing the exchange rate (like what China does) ONLY makes sense for countries that export and need to stay competitive not for a country like Turkey that heavily depends on imports. In other words when the national currency dumps, it becomes more expensive to import anything.Specifically Turkish military complex heavily depends on imports whether importing arms like air defense or fighter jets which they buy as a whole, or importing parts to be used in manufacturing arms like in their drone industry. Having a weak fiat makes it extremely hard and super expensive!Now when you compare that with another Country like Russia you are forgetting that Russia doesn't rely on imports as much as Turkey does specially in arms, parts and most importantly energy.Even the currency devaluation is not even close to being the same 440% compared to 50% (dollar rise against Lira and Ruble).Quote from: Collateralbank on August 17, 2023, 07:45:51 PMTurkey been keeping rates low in order to invest in military and now turkey is one of most powerful country in Europe.It is the most powerful military in \"Europe\" but it is at best a mediocre military globally considering how Turkey has only lost any battle they entered over the past couple of decades and are still stuck in Syria and Iraq being bombed into oblivion by militia",

You refer to Sun Tzu, but fail to realize when the situation is actually beyond the control of or indirectly caused by the poor economic actions of the leaders of both countries. They have not skillfully navigated themselves into these positions, where their currency is super weak, but have through sheer incompetence engineered their own downfall. The Turkish Lira imploded because Erdogan tried to interfere with central banking functions and go against all the best advice that was presented, which required a painful but necessary adjustment, because he wanted a win at an upcoming election. Putin failed because he did not understand the huge backlash that came with invading Ukraine and some of the most extreme measures ever enacted against another country to isolate it from the richest trading partners in the world. Both were down to very poor leadership.",

Thanks for the compliments and I appreciate your thoughtful insights. Indeed, the effects of currency devaluation can vary depending on the specific economic context and the country's overall strategy. As you suggested diversification of economy is certainly crucial step for achieving long term economic stability. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the short term gains over long term potential consequences when considering currency devaluation as a tool for economic growth.",

Turkey has been struggling with devaluation of their fiat currency for years, although it has truly skyrocketed in 2022. A very high rate of inflation is bad for the country because it normally means the prices rise up too much, the salaries and other payments can't catch up, people are getting poorer. It's also unhelpful for popularity of a politician. DW article on Turkish inflation doesn't even mention the military, not does Euronews. In the meantime, the way op wrote about it being done intentionally to spend money on the military and actually being stronger while appearing weaker makes it sound as if it's an actual fact, not a mere assumption.Even if it's related to military spending, one could easily argue it the other way around: Turkey might be overspending on the military, which has a negative impact on the economy (although in case of Turkey I'm not convinced in that). As for Russia, it managed to stabilize their fiat last year, following the invasion and sanctions, but there's only so much a country can do while facing heavy restrictions and vastly overspending on an imperialist war, so trying to portray Russian inflation as intentional is bizarre.",
