Check on that.No. You haven't known this whole cryptographic stuff outrightly. If you do, you shouldn't be asking how important it has been and how it's gonna improve...............makes me feel you haven't aligned with 'em current rehab which has made you looked Bitcoin disdainfully, that's naive.AFAIK, cryptocurrency has tamed Fiat of its prevalence and has made peeps free from the shackles of banking slavery. It will help alot in future (as it has been doing for more than a decade now) people are open to a system where I can trust anyone with safe-trade trnx, all reflecting on the Blockchain (how sweet can that be compared to banking and its Incessant, personal recognition with passport photographs and IDs yet, feel unsatisfied and control your funds however they feel like). It's not gonna replace Fiat totally but, it'll do some more good in the future.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

      "body": "I personally believe that if Bitcoin will continue growing at the rate it is now, it is going to help our society in the way we have never seen before. The basic reason for this is because the money we use, fiat currencies, are being printed out of thin air. And this creates hyperinflation, economic instability and generally weakens society. But with Bitcoin, we have a cryptocurrency that isn't printed out of thin air; so long as people continue using it, we don't have to worry about inflation because there can't be inflation without massive money printing as seen in modern day economies. Bitcoin may be imperfect, but it is infinitely better than what we use now.",

Bitcoin is still a volatile digital currency with a fairly high risk, but behind that bitcoin is decentralized or not regulated by anyone. Bitcoin is an optional payment instrument and a good investment asset for the long term.Indirectly bitcoin will be very useful to grow our economy and become a good investment tool with some control done.",

If this is the regular response that everyone here gives whenever someone asks a question truly when they want to learn from the community, they will not become comfortable, become afraid of expressing themselves and will limit participation so they don't get gaslighted. You can see that OP is truly a newbie, Please be accommodating and hospitable, you were once a newbie to both bitcoins and the forum.",

I mean accepting here is accepting Bitcoin as an investment, currency, technology, and also product development. We have seen so many people take or earn money through Bitcoin from time to time. That is why Bitcoin is very important moreover for those who know the influence of Bitcoin on altcoins. However, if society is the one that is on the opposite, Bitcoin means something that is bad, to be avoided, and also a manner for criminal things. Theywillthinkroughly and negatively about Bitcoin.

The convenience of fast transactions, the free storage of your funds without unnecessary control and eyes, as well as the education of a person who is responsible for his actions, which is important for the younger generation. Being organized and responsible for your investments, analyzing the market, and having the ability to properly manage your funds are all advantages of bitcoin.

Bitcoin is just trying to claim his rights. If bitcoin dominates in the world of the future, then this will undoubtedly be a huge step for human society, which will allow it to rise a step higher in development, because technology has always pushed for this. Perhaps bitcoin will change people's lives for the better. At least in terms of ecology. Eliminating paper money from the general circulation, for the production of which a lot of wood is spent all over the world, and switching to btc, our descendants will only be grateful.",

Perhaps in Philippines, there are small businesses which accepts this currency as a mode of payment but not all proprietorship would do the same because they are scared of the risks involved by doing so, and we cannot blame them for that.
