If this thread is inappropriate, please tell me so and I will close it.Quote from: Lucius on August 18, 2023, 10:07:18 AMQuote from: light_warrior on August 17, 2023, 04:13:49 PM~snip~A limited number of people can read the personal messages. Personal messages are stored in the database in encrypted form and only those who have the decryption key can read them.Given that my post, in which I stated, is another example of who can technically read PM, for those who do not read what others write and respond only to certain posts I will quote again. The post from 2012 is out of date anyway, unless Gavin still has the privilege of reading PMs, which would not only be illogical, but also dangerous since he's long gone to the dark side.Quote from: Lucius on August 17, 2023, 09:34:33 AMQuote from: suchmoon on February 10, 2020, 09:47:52 PMWe don't log your IP address when the extension contacts our server but if you don't trust us you should use Tor or VPN. The extension can technically read any data from your BitcoinTalk session, including your PMs, but it doesn't do so. It collects user IDs from the page you're looking at - e.g. a list of posts in a thread - and sends that list of IDs to bpip.org to get info about those users, and only does so if you turn the optional features on (these features are off by default).The extension works even if you browse BitcoinTalk.org without being logged in. The source code is not obfuscated and can be examined by anyone with sufficient JavaScript knowledge using developer tools built into most browsers. Same tools can also be used to check network traffic to/from the extension.Okay, let's do it that way. I registered an alternate account Light_Warrior (Alt) and sent a test message to that account. Let the reputable suchmoon read this message using his BPIP extension. I'll even allow him to post it here in this thread.",

I am new here you guys are senior, i always afraid to talk in between such topics but i am seeing this topic for quite some times, like many topics and threads i have read in these 2 days. Point is, dear logfiles, the meaning of suchmoon post is, these extensions have the capability to read and provide all the PMs but they do not do so because the setting is not set to show that data to public which means they could see them also.The thing i am unable to understand is, when we try to send PM to someone we see a note at the bottom left corner that \" Note: PM privacy is not guaranteed. Encrypt sensitive messages.\" Which is also a open indicator for everyone to be prepared for all types of security. Which also means, these extensions have access to our PMs which i think should not have because i am ok with Administrators to have such access but not other members who are not even a part of the team of Theymos. TBH, if one do want to share someone a secret message they should avoid to send that directly instead do encryption or use TG to make discussions.",

When I wrote that private messages can be read only by those who have the key to decrypt the database (i.e. a rather limited number of people) and quoted the words of theymos, the esteemed Lucius responded by saying that I cannot read the forum and quoted the words of the esteemed suchmoon as a refutation of my words. That is, it turns out that the esteemed Lucius is 100% sure that the BPIP extension can read private messages. That's what I propose to prove in practice the words of respected suchmoon, which are so zealously referred to by respected Lucius. Because a man should be responsible for his words.

Basically, whatever you see, the extension could see and potentially even more. But just to be clear, I'm not talking specifically about the BPIP extension; I mean any browser extension in general. And this has nothing to do with the fact that private messages are encrypted on the server. So, it is important to be mindful of what you are adding to your browser.

Is it possible to add code to an extension and still access private forum user message or is it a priori impossible without getting additional permissions from theymos?That's possible and can be done by a malicious actor who knows JavaScript programming. The malicious actor can change the code of the extension in a way that the extension will be able to collect the information about the private messages of a user. And, the malicious actor can do that without theymos's permission because in such cases the permission of the administrator isn't required. A user gives complete permission to an extension to access all the data of bitcointalk.org would know that he/she is willing to allow such extension to be installed on his browser which could theoretically access and read the data of bitcointalk.org on that user's browser where the extension is installed. Like @suchmoon clarified that people could look at the source code of the extension to verify that the extension is not collecting data of the user's PM's, and that's more than enough for us to know that there private messages of a user are in privacy of the user and they won't be shared by the extension. However, you should know that the extension can access the PM's and if someone add some code changes in the extension then in that case it may collect the private data of the user without anyone's permission.",

I was not saying that the malicious actor would change it on a particular user's system, but it would change the code altogether and then upload the extension on another site or upload it on chrome's extension page from another account which is not the original account of the extension.

The BPIP.ORG provides a reputed extension as we all know and it would never do anything to read the PM's of a user. There are chances that the malicious actors who may create a similar clone of BPIP extension with the same code but with additional permissions of reading someone's PM's but that thing doesn't have anything to do with BPIP.ORG and the user who installs such extensions should be responsible for any damages he/she receives by installing such extensions.",

But if do not open the private messages page when the extension is running, it will not be able to read private messages. And the extension has no access to the encrypted database itself, where private messages of forum users are stored. Speaking strictly theoretically, let us assume you have a malicious extension installed in your browser (I am not referring to the bpip.org extension here), and you access the bitcointalk.org forum using your credentials. At this point, an active session with the website is established, granting access to any forum page, including your private messages. The extension could theoretically exploit this active session to access your private messages in the background, all without you even noticing. Therefore, it is not necessary for you to open your private messages for a malicious extension to \"read\" them. And once again, this is unrelated to encrypted data in the database, as the entire process takes place within your browser.",
