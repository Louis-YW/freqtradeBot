I could find the transaction OP is talking about on the blockchain. As the outgoing transaction was made just after the receiving transaction and with a very high fee, it seems that the fund has been stolen.",

      "body": "Nothing more than your wallet is comprised and your coin was stolen. Sorry about that, but you need to know how to protect your wallet.For protection of your seed phrase, you can add passphrase along while generating your seed phrase, different keys would be generated, anyone that knows the seed phrase but that do not know the passphrase will not be able to compromise your wallet with only seed phrase if you use a strong passphrase. Back up the passphrase in different location from the seed phrase. But the con is that if you lost the passphrase, you will lose your coin, just like if the seed phrase is lost. You will have to protect both seed grade and passphrase. If you do not want to go for passphrase, protect your seed phrase more in a way no one can sees it. Do not trust anyone with your device. Also you can get a hardware wallet.",

Quote from: Mysterio on January 28, 2023, 09:03:38 PMheres the info, wheres the BTC?  seems stuck in limbo with no transaction notice on my side It's not stuck in limbo. Your transaction history shows an incoming transaction followed by an outgoing one. These two transactions are 1 second apart. You should consider your wallet and the device it's installed on as compromised. Do you still have the exact address you downloaded your Electrum wallet from? A lot of time passed since you last used your wallet in 2021 and who knows what you did to get infected. Did you download any Electrum updates and how? Did you ever verify the signatures for any of those updates?How much do you know about basic computer security, and is the computer used for torrents, porn, dubious websites, cracked software and games, etc?  Malware and viruses can easily spread over email as well if you don't know what you are doing.",

You should also assume that any other wallets you have stored on that computer, as well as any online logins you perform from that computer, are similarly compromised, since you cannot be sure if it was malware which compromised your wallet and such malware could also compromise anything else on that computer.Time to format your device and install an up to date OS on it, and not an outdated and insecure one such as Windows 7. Create a new bitcoin wallet with the seed phrase only ever written down on paper, and send any remaining coins from other wallets to it. Change all your passwords.",
