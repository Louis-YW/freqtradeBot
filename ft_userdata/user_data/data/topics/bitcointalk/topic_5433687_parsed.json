  "content": "QuoteSHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Ant Group's founder Jack Ma will give up control of the Chinese fintech giant in an overhaul that seeks to draw a line under a regulatory crackdown that was triggered soon after its mammoth stock market debut was scuppered two years ago.Ant's $37 billion IPO, which would have been the world's largest, was cancelled at the last minute in November 2020, leading to a forced restructuring of the financial technology firm and speculation the Chinese billionaire would have to cede control.While some analysts have said a relinquishing of control could clear the way for the company to revive its IPO, the changes announced by the group on Saturday, however, are likely to result in a further delay due to listing regulations.China's domestic A-share market requires companies to wait three years after a change in control to list. The wait is two years on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR market, and one year in Hong Kong.A former English teacher, Ma previously possessed more than 50% of voting rights at Ant but the changes will mean that his share falls to 6.2%, according to Reuters calculations.Ma only owns a 10% stake in Ant, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, but has exercised control over the company through related entities, according to Ant's IPO prospectus filed with the exchanges in 2020.Hangzhou Yunbo, an investment vehicle for Ma, had control over two other entities that own a combined 50.5% stake of Ant, the prospectus showed.Ma's ceding of control comes as Ant is nearing the completion of its two-year regulatory-driven restructuring, with Chinese authorities poised to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on the firm, Reuters reported in November.The expected penalty is part of Beijing's sweeping and unprecedented crackdown on the country's technology titans over the past two years that has sliced hundreds of billions of dollars off their values and shrunk revenues and profits.But Chinese authorities have in recent months softened their tone on the tech crackdown amid efforts to bolster a $17-trillion economy that has been badly hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"With the Chinese economy in a very febrile state, the government is looking to signal its commitment to growth, and the tech, private sectors are key to that as we know,\" said Duncan Clark, chairman of investment advisory firm BDA China.\"At least Ant investors can (now) have some timetable for an exit after a long period of uncertainty,\" said Clark, who is also an author of a book on Alibaba and Ma.REGULATORY SCRUTINYAnt operates China's ubiquitous mobile payment app Alipay, the world's largest, which has more than 1 billion users.Ant, whose businesses also span consumer lending and insurance products distribution, said Ma and nine of its other major shareholders had agreed to no longer act in concert when exercising voting rights, and would only vote independently.It added that the shareholders' economic interests in Ant will not change as a result of the adjustments.Ant also said it would add a fifth independent director to its board so that independent directors will comprise a majority of the company's board. It currently has eight board directors.\"As a result, there will no longer be a situation where a direct or indirect shareholder will have sole or joint control over Ant Group,\" it said in its statement.Reuters reported in April 2021 that Ant was exploring options for Ma, one of China's most successful and influential businessmen, to divest his stake in Ant and give up control.The Wall Street Journal reported in July last year, citing unnamed sources, that Ma could cede control by transferring some of his voting power to Ant officials including Chief Executive Officer Eric Jing.Ant's market listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai was derailed days after Ma publicly criticised regulators in a speech in October 2020. Since then, his sprawling empire has been under regulatory scrutiny and going through a restructuring.Once outspoken, Ma has largely remained out of public view since the regulatory crackdown that has reined in the country's technology giants and did away with a laissez-faire approach that drove breakneck growth.\"Jack Ma's departure from Ant Financial, a company he founded, shows the determination of the Chinese leadership to reduce the influence of large private investors,\" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.\"This trend will continue the erosion of the most productive parts of the Chinese economy.\"As Chinese regulators frown on monopolies and unfair competition, Ant and Alibaba have been untangling their operations from each other and independently seeking new business, Reuters reported last year.Ant said on Saturday that its management would no longer serve in the Alibaba Partnership a body that can nominate the majority of the e-commerce giant's board, affirming a change that started mid-last year.https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/ant-group-founder-jack-ma-to-give-up-control-in-key-revamp/ar-AA1655oC....Ant group is the owner of alibaba which is essentially china's answer to amazon, and a very good global retail platform. If I was located in europe or asia I would definitely consider shopping on alibaba for things like mopeds, bikes, scooters and electric vehicles. They have some great deals on there. Although it is known that there are some hidden fees for US shoppers in the form of tariffs and assorted costs. For those who do not recognize the name, Jack Ma was unhappy about the direction of chinese COVID lockdowns and publicly criticized the effect they were having on the chinese economy. After which time, he disappeared for awhile and was not seen in public. Some speculated Jack Ma was in prison. Others said he was dead. Months later, Jack Ma was once again seen in public after it was announced by the media that he had taken a vacation.Now it seems that Jack Ma is ending all influence and ties he has with ant group. Being an outspoken capitalist with an ambitious nature, I wonder if Jack Ma will now be free to pursue other business ventures. He certainly could have access to good start up capital given his net worth. What would be a good investment or start up to pursue given the current economic and financial climate of the world?",

      "body": "It appears that the rumors are true. Jack Ma has given up most of his control of everything he built after being persuaded by the Chinese government. It only started when Ma seemed to have taken a liking in collaborating with the west in expanding his business empire. Of course this was not taken by the Chinese government in a good way. I think that's better for him since he won't have to worry about the continuous pressure anymore and his words will no longer be guarded by the CCP since he has foregone control of Ant group. Pretty sure the control will be transferred to the friends of the CCP. It's only a matter of time.",

Pretty sure the control will be transferred to the friends of the CCP. It's only a matter of time. I think his open criticism of China's policies have put him into a very big problem. Oppositions to the policies of the Chinese Communist Party is a highway to intimidation, imprisonment or even death. Just like many billionaires in Russia are committing suicide the Chinese government has their own way of dealing with oppositions or critics. I think he was forced to drop his position in the Ant Group due to his disagreement with the government. And he name is now in the bad records of the authoritarian Chinese government.Except he reconciles with the Chinese government, it would be very different to start up a new venture in China. I think he should consider moving out from China and establish a business somewhere else. Considering his vast knowledge of online marketing, he could still build another business that can compete with Amazon and Alibaba. Investing in renewable power or electric cars sectors wouldn't be a bad idea.",
