I can't see a valid proof of a successful withdraw. The second image link shows deposits, not withdrawals.This forum post seems more like an Advertisement for bc.game.  OP, you can prove that this is your account? Screenshots can be faked with inspect element. If I win 9.6K USD out of a 200 USD bet, the last thing I would do is to take screenshots of my casino account.   I would be so happy that I will forget to do such thing (and I hate bragging about making money).Anyway, congratulations for your winnings (if your story is actually true).",

I wanna say congrats for your win if that's real but people may trust you even more if you can show a small proof for your withdrawal.The fact that if these days people are always doing so good to advertise any platform. I don't wanna try to have a bad opinion about that. Congrate for your win. I can only hope if that will be a real thing. Im not feeling doubt some may not fully believe on it.",

I once deposited $2000 and I also played Dice and I wanted to play with $0.20 ... but I typed it incorrectly as $20 and started \"Auto\" bet with 1000 bets. It stopped betting after about 200 bets with insufficient funds and when I checked ... I noticed my mistake and nearly blown my top!!!!It is easy to make mistakes.... so you should always double check all your inputs, when you pre-configure the games. Congratulations on your win and do not deposit all the wins back into the casino.... take some for yourself.",

I'm a rather serious person when in terms of playing so I rarely make mistakes in inputs like this so it's probably not going to happen to me. I also don't think casinos would bar you from receiving your winnings, that's not a casino if so that's more likely a scam (or your account did something wrong, in this case, the VPN thingy which I wouldn't blame if the casino ever did something about it).",

If I were you I would put aside all but 200 USD of those winnings and continue to gamble (if you still want to gamble) with that 200 Dollars. The rest should be invested or held on to. As far as KYC goes, you might not have reached the number that lets the alarms go off. So 9.6k is a safe win at that particular online gambling casino. Thats very good to know. Usually such winnings do not go unnoticed by the casino and they usually try everything to hinder you from cashing out. Hopefully these kinds of happy mistakes happen to you again!",
