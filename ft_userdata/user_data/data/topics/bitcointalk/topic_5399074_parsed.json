      "body": "I think centralised futures are probably better to rely on (ie commodities on exchanges) - you're paying them a fee to maintain the peg so it's a bigger incentive.Most stablecoins have problems maintaining their pegs during volatility and I think commodity backed ones will be even worse without some sort of arbitrage.",

If they issue a token for corn, they would need to grow and produce corn to balance the supply side of the equation. With the token issued guaranteeing the holder exchange for a set quantity of corn.It would be a token intrinsically backed by commodities. Similar to what venezuela proposed with their oil backed petrol token. Like a gold standard except substituting food for precious metals.Its a good idea.Another format might be to plant a set quantity of food items for every token sold. To elevate production and attempt to reduce existing prices.",

By making the reason of economic crisis, most of the food items vendors increased the price of the food items was unacceptable one. They have to think like a human, because human know the human feelings. The rest will only the money oriented person. And itâ€™s impossible to get the people as like our own concern and feelings.",

I have already seen some projects like these but those were mostly related to food supply chain distribution not to direct production. Those were highly unsuccessful attempts to tokenize agricultural sectors but I am sure if you research enough then you will find some project that still exists.",

Unfortunately most people are not holding any food coins or futures. Rising food prices hurts the average Joe the most, they need to pay higher bills in the supermarket while their savings are eaten up by rising inflation. That's also my issue why I am against rising food prices, we don't need higher inflation right now. The economies are already hurting enough from the covid pandemic aftermath. Even if some of us are making big profits, the fallout could be worse. Crypto currencies would be one good solution against the rising inflation, but with the Terra Luna crisis on top, investors are very cautious about adding more cryptos.",
