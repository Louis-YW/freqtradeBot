Athletes, on the other hand, can give back to their loyal supporters, establish their brand, and instrumentalize their career in a mutually beneficial ecosystem. In terms of blockchain network, the meCarreira team chose the Polygon due to lower transaction fees and a short transaction confirmation timeWhat does meCarreira offer ?Trade Players Like Stocks: Similar to stock market (but using a swap built-in system), use your football knowledge to trade players like stocks; buy low on young, under-the-radar talents and sell high when they become successful.Exclusive Access to Players: meCarreira can give you exclusive access to players, unique football items and experiences; meanwhile, footballers can now clearly identify and engage with their most dedicated supporters.Support Rising Talents: Invest in young football talents and rise alongside them.Become a Scout, Grind XP and Get Paid: Trade, invest in talent, and earn XP; rise up the leaderboard for rewards and bragging rights.How can I profit from players via meCarreria?With every purchase the price increases and with every sale the price decreases. For the price calculation, the meCarreira protocol uses a so-called Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM). When you buy tokens of \"Player A\" with 100 MATIC, the ensuing transaction will reflect a higher price per token due to the prior purchase. Hence, the next person purchasing with 100 MATIC will receive fewer tokens (shares) than you did. Conversely, if you decide to sell those tokens later, you would likely receive more than 100 MATIC in return due to the increased price per token. This mechanism continues to operate with each buy and sell transaction, dynamically adjusting the token price based on market activity. Similarly, if someone sells tokens after your purchase, the price per token would decrease, affecting the amount of MATIC received from subsequent transactions.How do you begin earning with meCarreira?In four simple steps, this is how this system works, where you can support the football players you are interested in and earn money while doing so:1.

Load your Wallet or Account   If you're new to cryptocurrencies, you can fund your account with a credit card or Apple Pay.
