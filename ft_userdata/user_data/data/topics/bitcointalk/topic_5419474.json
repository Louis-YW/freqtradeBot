  "content": "Banco Santander is a big Spanish bank that Quote first entered the United Kingdom in 1988 with a fifteen-year alliance with The Royal Bank Scotland. In 2004, it began its direct commercial activity with the acquisition of Abbey National. The Bank continued  to grow through acquisitions, including Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester in 2008 and 2009.  https://www.santander.co.uk/about-santander/our-historyNow it turns out that it is imposing restrictions on its customers if they want to move their money to acquire bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The reason: they say it is to protect them, but it is clear to me that they are not telling the whole truth.QuoteIn recent months we've seen a large increase in UK customers become victims of cryptocurrency fraud. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has  warned consumers about the risks of investing in crypto assets as money held in customers’ crypto wallets is unlikely to be protected by the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong. We want to do everything we can to protect our customers and we feel that limiting payments to cryptocurrency exchanges is the best way to make sure your money stays safe.Limit on cryptocurrency paymentsFrom 15th November 2022 where we identify payments to cryptocurrency exchanges using Mobile and Online Banking, we’ll limit the amount that you can send. These limits are applied per account. You’ll be restricted to:a £1,000 limit per transaction, a total limit of £3,000 in any rolling 30-day period. While there may be some reasonable justification for this, as there are indeed people falling victim to scams in the world of cryptocurrencies, I think the bold highlighting is the crux of the matter. People who get scammed are not usually scammed for having their cryptocurrencies in their hardware wallet, on the contrary. What really happens is they are very upset that people can keep large amounts of digital currency in their own wallets and avoid the bank.Some people call it the Satander Bank.",

Unless and until there is emergency situation one can easily cop up with the situation with 3000 GBP. That is still good amount of money one could need at any given time. If not then there is always p2p option open for us. I mean direct contact with friends and family members so that we can avoid the KYCed platforms. This makes better sense because we can directly send the funds to their wallet and they can directly send us cash or wire transfer for personal reasons. Everybody stays happy. Believe me, one day peeps gonna start to follow such methodologies if banks gone too far with the restrictions. They talk like they own the money deposited by us.",

The limitations can be annoying for big users, but surely those can find other banks and make their own deals. I don't think the justification over scam prevention is particularly reasonable, but if they set the same limitations and justified it as fighting financial crime, I'd probably think that it's fine.Maybe the op is right that they simply don't want people to be the sole owners of their money, but then they could limit withdrawals to non-custodial wallets but allow centralized services.",

It is unlikely that anyone will be heavily effected by this move except for maybe traders who would generally be using a business account if they've been doing it for a while. They're saying nothing about users who store bitcoin on a hardware wallet, so I don't understand why you felt the need to jam that in on an unrelated note?",

But we all know that. Yes, bitcoin will lead them to lose their power and control on financial world which is the reason that we are all witnessing governments and banks are always looking to regulate or even ban bitcoin and other cryptocurency adoption. But, nothing negatively will happen just because of their action against cryptocurencies in long run due to bitcoin's potentials and other revolutionary characteristics.Quote from: mk4 on November 05, 2022, 04:10:53 AMmaybe people should be using P2P.Every action against cryptocurrencies from banks or government authorities will lead people to exercise the true practices of decentralized environments.
