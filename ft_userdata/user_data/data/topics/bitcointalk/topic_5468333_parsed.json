      "body": "I don't think Ban Appeal is usually given much of an option when you contact them through mail; it has been proven multiple times here on the forum, and it's also clearly stated on the message that your chances are very little.Back to the reason why your account was banned in the first place, I believe it might have something to do with this.  Account farming. Allowed?  I did a quick search on your profile, and that was among the few negative reports I found for your account. I don't know how true it might be, but I guess it might have something to do with why your account was banned, or maybe you made a mistake of plagiarism in the past, which might also be another cost of such a ban action.",
