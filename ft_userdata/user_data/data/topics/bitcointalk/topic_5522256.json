  "content": "Recently, Putin: Who can stop Bitcoin? No one. And so I guess that is the signal that Tkachev could have been waiting before making this proposal.QuoteMOSCOW, December 9 - RIA Novosti. State Duma deputy from the New People party Anton Tkachev sent an appeal to the Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov with a proposal to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia similar to state reserves in traditional currencies; RIA Novosti has a copy of the document.\"I ask you, dear Anton Germanovich, to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia by analogy with state reserves in traditional currencies. If this initiative is approved, I ask you to submit it to the government of the Russian Federation for further implementation,\" the appeal says.https://ria.ru/20241209/rezerv-1988201715.htmlI guess since they are moving forward with de-dollarization and obviously doesn't want to used it. Or maybe they want to get away from the financial sanctions from the West. So it really make sense that they will go with Bitcoin right now.Gonna be a race moving forward as who's who or how much countries are going to stock pile Bitcoin in the future.Trying to play devil's advocate here, could Bitcoin be the de-facto currency of the \"criminals\"?

But then there's that whole criminal angle that peoiple bring up bitcoin's privacy features make it a go to for illegal activities. It's kind of a double edged swordAs it was said - all try to grab their share due to the US doing and thinking about it too.And Russia is inclined even more to do so - after all, they need some leverage to be able to maneuver more during these times.",

The USA flexes it's power and influence too much and this only motivates others to get free from the USA as soon as possible.If Russia really creates a strategy Bitcoin reserves, then this means that the party is on, we should expect serious adoption and regulations. Trump wants to mine the rest of the Bitcoins in the USA, he will try to attract miners and then have control over them, i.e. set the censorship on Bitcoin transactions but Russia will also try to attract miners and share a significant portion of hashpower to get rid of the USA's influence over transactions. But I don't understand this, Bitcoin is not anonymous and the USA can track and leak Russia's addresses. The USA can force its partners to not accept transactions from Russian Bitcoin addresses. I think that Monero is the only real solution for Russia but it's so anonymous that it's unacceptable too.Could Satoshi imagine that we would go this far?",
