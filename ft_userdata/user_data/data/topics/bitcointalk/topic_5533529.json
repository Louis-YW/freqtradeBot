  "content": "Guys, I'm in a tough situation and I really need advices.¬†I got very close with a person who convinced me to put money into altcoins (coins changed periodically). The person turned out to be a fanatic of the opportunity to become rich with crypto(leverage, shitcoins), but in reality only loosing.¬†I myself have not bought coins before. Now I have 10x less money from the original amount in altcoins, and it's a very small amount of money, in thousands only.¬†I could just sell the remaining coins and take the rest of the money, but the thing is... I REALLY need somehow as much as possible close to the original amount of money, and if there's a chance to revive money I need to try to at least partially return the amount I put to coins initially, since now there are no other ways to generate money in other ways for now for me. üü¢üü¢üü¢Question: I AM WONDERING IF IT'S A GOOD TIME TO CHANGE ALL ALTCOINS (most of them) TO BITCOIN NOW ? IF I have probably up to 4 months , maybe a little bit more, Can't say for now.Don't tell me that it was stupid. I already know!

Apparently, the market is red now, even Bitcoin is experiencing a dip now, but we have high hopes it would recover soon and surge higher, but I don't know if your shitcoins would do same. You don't need anyone to advise you dude, DYOR and decide the best thing for yourself, but bear in mind, Bitcoin is more suitable on a long-term investment, although short-term investors may make gains, but it's not to compare with long-term investing profits.",

      "body": "I, or anyone else, would be wrong if we say that you are going to recover all your money if you reinvest all the remaining funds in Bitcoin because you mentioned you are down by almost 10x, and for Bitcoin to help you recover that or get near it, it will have to reach a price of $890k+ based on its current price, or at least above $700k to make you reach near the initial capital you had. However, it can be said that you might get some profit from Bitcoin but you also need to remember that there is absolutely no guarantee for that from this point; the market can enter the bear market any time.I don't want to discourage you or anything, but you made a mistake and it is going to be a lesson for you for sure. Now, with the remaining funds, you should try and trade suitable and more trustworthy assets with them. Try to read the market a little bit, understand how it moves, learn to do analysis and do that, give it some time, and with some knowledge later on, you might be able to recover some of the money you've lost.Good luck.",

I would not trust other altcoins to be honest or even if I do, it will be so much lesser than how much I trust bitcoin. If this is all you have and you desperately want it to grow, I say put it in bitcoin. But we are quite in a tricky situation now. We are almost near the bear cycle and no one really knows for sure if it will come now or there is still another peak in price. Four months in bitcoin would not give you a complete guarantee profit. I know you are tired of hearing it but holding bitcoin for a long time is the best case here to be honest.",

This is the harsh reality ... Yes, you can sell these alternative cryptocurrencies and buy bitcoin. However, making a profit from bitcoin is closely related to the Hodl strategy. The probability that the price of bitcoin will rise to $ 850,000 in the near future is very close to zero. This is an unlikely event. Of course, you can try to continue speculating with alternative cryptocurrencies, but most likely you will lose all your money quite quickly. You can also go to the casino to play. Yes, there is a certain chance of success, but it is not very big. Therefore, in my opinion, you are better off selling your alternative cryptocurrencies for fiat money.",

I lost all of my signature campaign funds and other extra money because of it and it's really devastating because right now I am going to spend more time and effort again just to earn those losses. If you got those coins and lose 10√ó from it I think you should just wait for it to recover like until maybe the fourth quarter this year or if you are really worried if all of it will lose it's value then consider converting to Bitcoin.",

Now it has gotten to a critical point you suddenly remembered the forum. Well there is no miracle that can make you recover all you have lost within the number of months you still have left. So it's better to take whatever that's left for you and count the rest as loss.¬† You can decide to switch to bitcoin that's fine, but there's no guarantee that you will recover everything you have lost within a short time. Bitcoin is best invested with money you don't have need for a long time. At this point, just take what's left and Man up. This is my advice to you!!",

This is the mistake that you should regret. Wanting others to tell you what to do.Maybe today it is a good time to dump those shitcoins and tomorrow being a good day to buy them. If you ask others today and they give you good advice, you still can't make a move tomorrow because others may not give you any advice.That's not to mention different people may use different strategies that you may not like to follow. For example I always say that nobody should bag-hold any altcoin. Altcoins are good for short term trading. Meaning when they are starting to get pumped, you enter that altcoin and try to ride a portion of the pump and then dump it quickly to get some profit out leaving that coin behind.This is the NPC chart that you say you are bag-holding. The pump of this shitcoin starts in April 2024 and by mid May is starting to really pump. That is when I'd get in if I were trading shitcoins. The indications are the price rise (obviously) and the increased volume that is being injected into it which goes from 1-2 BTC/day to 10-30 BTC/day. That's the entry. Price then starts going up giving you profit. If you had entered when price was about 10 satoshi you could get out at about 30 satoshi in a couple of days (almost a week) with 3x profit ignoring the fact that it went all the way to 60 satoshi later with the total profit of 6x. Be satisfied with the smaller profit which is still a good profit.In long term, altcoins have no potential. All of them get dumped without exception. As you can see in this chart as well (NPC got dumped back to its April price). Which is why they should never be \"held\".",

But I think you bought these tokens when the market was good, which is why your token is in a bad state due to the bad market conditions. To invest in altcoins, you need to understand the market well. What I can see is that you bought such coins after hearing from someone else. It is not right to invest in altcoins like this without analyzing it yourself properly. There is a high possibility of losing money by doing this. The current market condition is bad, so wait a little. If the market is good, then it is better to leave the tokens even if there is some recovery.But one thing I like is that you are making an attitude to invest in BTC even after being in such a bad situation. If you had invested in BTC instead of the altcoins you have bought, you would not have had to worry about anything. Because no matter how low the price of Bitcoin is, you would not have lost much. Since you are looking to invest in Bitcoin, you can start investing in Bitcoin by maintaining DCA. Remember that investing in Bitcoin requires a long-term investment.",
