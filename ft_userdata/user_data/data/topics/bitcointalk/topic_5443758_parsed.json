I'm open to give more info and games to the moderatorsSo play and win as much as you canAlso remember. Follow my future posts for more free fix in this league nowStay tuned. I don't wanna make any statement on your allegations. It looks like you take the credit if Bangalore have won the match, if not it is your bad luck. It is good that you've got the best insider to provide you with the right information. If possible go find someone else who might even give insider information like which ball there'll be wicket and so on.Things weren't the same as the past. In the past players involved in such kind of activities for money. Nowadays opportunity missed is missed for ever. For this reason players find themselves good and never gets into match fixing.",
