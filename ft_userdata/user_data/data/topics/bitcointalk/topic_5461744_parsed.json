I’ve been studying JavaScript injection techniques and I found this on YouTube… looks legit but I dunno Firstly I think this post should be directed to other boards like wallet software were experts on software functioning can quickly help out. And from my findings this Exodus wallet is a red flag for saving your Bitcoin base on conversation I have reviewed, issues of missing funds, expensive charges etc are always talked about.Quote Wanting another opinion External wallet would be my own opinion because it's reliable and safe.",
