  "content": "Hey guys, so iâ€™m considering starting my own competitor to OrdinalBots.com They charge a pretty high fee and I think i can compete on the edge of better UX and marketing. Iâ€™ve got a big crypto presence on youtube and tiktok, and know tons of other creators as well - so I know how to grow. Looking for a developer or someone with relevant knowledge who may wanna partner up with me on this. Done list: - Design UX mockups - Marketing Strategy/Content ideas- Social media mgmt and Twitter bot Need help:- Developer for back end architecture - Someone committed to updating and improving the site over time (cheaper, file optimization, etc) Â - Someone who knows how to set up a reliable payment system and a secure data storage. -How to set up a cloud-based system for real-time data processing.Dont really use this much so feel free to dm on telegram if you wanna partner?",

      "body": "Summary of your post is that you don't know how to do this but you just have idea and wanting others to do all the job?I don't do social media, but if you ever needed FUD for your competitors, shilling for your own project, you know where to find me. I'm trying to stay with the flow as I have seen that shilling is working greatly for people around the world. Remember, a good strategy is to have a plan B for every plan. Causing panic, spreading FUD, complementing own projects, these are the tools nowadays used by 99% crypto ecosystem.ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤¥",

I have lots of things Iâ€™d like to see added to Ordinals style NFTs and am watching this market to see what kind of innovation is happening. With web3 as a guide, I think there is still lots of functionality that could be added to NFTs on Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain.",

Backend developers who are willing to hop on another project sort of out of the blue are unfortunately far and few between. You'll find frond-end developers are more receptive to this. If you're unable to find someone for the backend stuff, don't give up on trying to learn some of the back-end stuff yourself.",
