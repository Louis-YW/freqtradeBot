  "content": "according to Glassnode on-chain data analyzed by Cryptoslate, leaving less than 22% of all mined BTC moving around and exchanging hands.These indicators show that investors are starting to withdraw their digital assets away from the exchanges, whether using wallets or other methods.Indices measure the movement of currencies as a function of whether the transaction is in cold storage or in a hot wallet.QuoteThink of illiquidity as the point when Bitcoin moves to a wallet that shows no spending history, while liquidity is when BTC moves to wallets that have a history of spending such as hot wallets and exchanges.QuoteThe chart above demonstrates the amount of highly liquid and liquid BTC assets and shows the figures are currently 3 million and 1.3 million coins respectively. The data is clear that both liquid and highly liquid supply have been trending downwards amidst the current market turmoilSource: https://cryptoslate.com/research-2nd-december-the-15m-bitcoin-just-went-into-self-custody/Is everyone beginning to understand Not your Keys, Not your coins , or is it temporary because of FTX?",

However, as far as FTX is concerned, there are many negative issues that may make them uncomfortable keeping their assets on the exchange so they choose to withdraw their assets to their respective wallets.But as @mk4 says, these assets will be very easy to transfer back to the exchange when their holders start to trust the exchange again as before. For a while, the situation of centralized exchanges really lost a lot of holders as most of them withdrew their assets, but it will return to normal with time.",

Since the collapse the voices about not your keys, not your coins are echoed everywhere.The idea of using hardware wallets and non-custodial wallets are circulated almost everywhere which is why there's a sudden increase of withdrawals from exchanges.People are afraid that the collapse of FTX can trigger other exchanges to collapse as well which is why there's a panic in the community to withdraw their coins from exchanges to their wallets.Once the dust settles and bitcoin and altcoins spike up I am quite sure that people will send their coins back to exchanges to trade and take profits.",

We all know using CEX is risky but we won't need it anymore. I really doubt it, I predict that we will soon forget what FTX did, and we will soon rush to the exchanges when the bull season comes. Just one season of bulls can heal all wounds, investors will quickly forget the pain once they make a profit.",

Currently, centralized exchanges are starting to be shunned by investors and as explained by the OP Investors have begun withdrawing their assets from centralized Exchanges after the FTC collapsed and harmed many people. The event of the collapse of FTX with very many losses will be a dark history for crypto, but when compared to Mt.Gox and referring to the years in its heyday, the event of the collapse of Mt.Gox is still more significant because almost 50% of the crypto market was controlled by Mt.Gox at the time that.Quote from: taufik123 on November 27, 2022, 03:29:59 AM-snip- Mt.Gox operated from 2011 to 2014 and managed to control 46% of the crypto market from 2010 to 2014 because nothing was as popular as Mt.Gox anymore. and FTX controls only 13% of the crypto market from 2019 to 2022.-snip-",

This can be bias on my part but trusting people in crypto who are still young can be more risky - this is just my opinion.

The volume increases simply because those who don't want to learn from their mistakes start to go back in and forget what happened, which makes a lot of losses.But will you follow a system like LUNA, even though they are back with a snapshot update by changing LUNA classic to LUNA (new) but the price will still not return to normal?Normal conditions only apply to coins that are not heavily impacted by the FTX crash event.In my opinion, the same exchange as FTX will no longer be in demand and will be blacklisted even though it is still operating.",

Based on this chat, it seems that the price is what controls the morale of individuals more than technical problems or hackers, which is logical. When the price increases, more people rush to sell.It does not seem that we will witness high fluctuations in the price, so it is safe to say that the current rates will remain without much change for the next year, but after two years or more, most of us will forget what happened and the same patterns will be repeated.",
