With constant electricity, mining bitcoin will likely give better return in Nigeria.If bitcoin mining reward halved, likely the price of bitcoin will increase in a way that miners will still make some profits.But the bad electricity in the country discourage Nigerians to mine. Check this site:https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bitcoin-mining-by-countryOut of 56 countries listed in accordance to the percentage of bitcoin mining hashrates they are generating, Nigeria is not among while the countries with the lowest percentage on the list are generating 0.01% of the total hashrates each. I can not advice anyone to mine in our country.Quote from: Forever101 on October 31, 2023, 06:47:41 PMWetting go be d future of Bitcoin mining for naija in  the world. Why asked this question? Is it because of what Germany Chancellor, Olaf Scholz said recently during his visit in Aso Rock? Germany to provide cheap electricity to Nigeria, other ECOWAS countriesThinking electricity in Nigeria will be good? What I think is that Nigerians prefer to just invest and trade in bitcoin instead. There are some miners in Nigeria, but they are not many and the hashrates geneted is very small. But maybe if electricity would be better in Nigeria, there may be changes, but this will only be a speculation which can be either right or wrong.",

      "body": "Before you posted this, I was doing a research on this topic to examine the feasibility and profitability of Bitcoin mining in Nigeria. From my finding, the major expenses for Bitcoin mining is that of equipment and electricity. As soon as the hardwares and other gadgets are secured, electricity becoemes the major constraint. A greater part of Nigeria is still battling with epileptic power supply and this has placed a huge financial burden on businesses especially in the urban centres. Fortunately, there is a part of Nigeria where electricity is constant and free of charge, meaning people don't pay for electricity as it is supplied free of charge by the oil companies. I'm referring to Ogba/Egbama/Ndoni local government area that share boundaries with Imo State, Bayelsa State and Delta State. This is a part of Nigeria rich in oil and gas deposit and playing host to multinational oil giants like Shell, Total Energies, Agip and Adax. These companies built gas turbines that supplies electricity to their host communities as part of their cooperate social responsibilities. Situating a Bitcoin mining rig in this area will solve the energy demand of Bitcoin mining. Apart from this, other cost such as rent is very cheap compared to the urban areas. Indeed there is huge prospect for Bitcoin mining in Nigeria and I intend embarking on this businesses when I have completed my comprehensive feasibility studies of this and also raise the funds needed to start. However,  I'm still contrained by the distance from the city where I live to this area that is at the outskirt of Rivers State. Nevertheless,  I will find a way around it when I'm ready to start.Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 31, 2023, 08:40:05 PMThinking electricity in Nigeria will be good?

I need all the technical advice I can get to start mining Bitcoin in the place I mentioned. Each time I visit those areas I mentioned, I feel electricity is wasting already.  A lot of things are cheap in those areas... with $1500 land is secured, there is free edible water and the foods are natural and mostly grown within. I know it will cost some funds to start and that I'm already working on but I need all the technical knowledge I can get to start already.",

I do not know much about mining, but you can make use of some online articles which would be helpful. Anything that you did not understand, you can ask on mining boards which would be helpful. But all I know is that if you possible you can buy miner, I will advice you to check https://www.bitmain.com/ and see good miners or browse about the miners. Start with miners that can generate at least 100 Th/s, but they are expensive.For profitability calculator, there are many sites that you can use online. Like these:https://www.viabtc.com/tools/calculatorhttps://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/calculatorI do not know much about bitcoin mining, but there are some people that are miners on this forum, you can seek for their advice and help about anything you need it you need their help or advice for.

It's a very good idea and apart from these area you made mention of I think if most Nigerians that are really ready can also do this bitcoin mining with a solar power installed building. I think solar system in Nigeria has eradicate alot of power failure system for those who can afford it. Because it power is generated by sunlight which can not be over emphasis. Except the power is not enough to carry the mining machine. Even if that is the case I think solar system has category.One factor to consider is if its approved to be used in Nigeria because of the disadvantages.Cost of maintenance: Mining Bitcoin with machine is a highly risky thing and it also consumes alot of energy. Considering that crypto is partially baned in Nigeria do you think inportation of the machine will be possible? What if you buy the machine very costly an and it fails how can you repair? Because anything that is not ranpard is always difficult to maintain, the parts can not be found in the country.Let's take for example there are phone or car you buy and the parts are no were to be found it becomes a waste of money.Where as the mining produces little volum of bitcoin.",

Miners would make profit for sure here in Nigeria should the government completely allow bitcoin operations to exist in the country while they regulate and receives taxes from it. Despite the non uninterrupted power supply problem in the country there are places where they still enjoy uninterrupted power like in Rivers State places such as Bonny Iceland and Omoku are known for their steady power supply due to the presence of oil rig companies situates in these locations.",

The house rent they pay monthly is what you will pay yearly in Nigeria. The products they have access to their can have more quality but very expensive to what most people are using here. Bills are very costly there than you can imagine.You can use these two sites for comparison and see how United States cost of living is higher:https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/cheapest-countries-to-live-inhttps://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jspAlso to be more specific, the cost of electricity in United States is more expensive.

If you join a mining pool, the reward is shared based on the mining hashrates each miners that connect to the mining pool are generating.

If person even get am for mind, shae Niger government go allow people enter the business without Dem give them trouble. Wetting go be d future of Bitcoin mining for naija in  the world. Others don talk well here but make I throw mouth too for the matter, I go answer your question one after another so e no go dey complicated to read.1: Yes it's possible to become a miner anywhere wey Bitcoin activity aren't officially banned. The mining activity can also be done legally or illegal too if to say the government dun ban am although I no go advice this one to avoid jail time.2: The cult down in mining reward (wey be Bitcoin block reward) dey benefits miners in long time so this one no suppose be excuse why you no go mine, assuming every other factors dey okay. The current block reward na 6.25 Bitcoin wey miners dey share so make we just do a rough estimate say Bitcoin na $35k which means that 6.25 BTC = $218k+ then after the halving the reward come reduced to 3.125 and Bitcoin is trading at a minimum of $100k, e mean say the new reward is worth (3.125x$100k) $312k+ also if the miners been hodl the Bitcoin dem be received when Bitcoin reward was 6.25 dem dun get profits too and one certain thing wey dey na say the price of Bitcoin is program to increase after every halving based on the concept of demand and supply.  No forget too the transaction fees wey miners dey receive in addition to block reward. 3/4: (I go combine both last questions make my post no too plenty), the government never talk anytime bad against mining so doing it isn't illegal and if the government noticed an increase dem fit tax those running the business and make their own choppings or freestyle dem provided dem they pay for electricity dem dey consume. The only time a government go dey against Bitcoin mining na when dem dey against Bitcoin. Nigeria no get future for mining because no matter as you talk there's more profits in Hodling Bitcoin than mining and you know we only go where the money is made more. Put all those money wey you wan use set up a mining farm into Bitcoin and just HODL and see the results. Wetin I dey talk na say e no go become a popular thing.

Electricity issues even maybe like the list of one of these factors. In Jos there is a hydro powered dam that generates electricity. In the Niger-Delta particularly Bayelsa, gas-flaring is still going on if not for the poor business atmosphere in the country nothing stops one of these Bitcoin investors from writing a proposal to these oil companies so that they can convert the gas flared with is destroying our atmosphere into electricity to mine Bitcoin. This is the issue. Our policies are literally sending investors aways as it makes it hard for them to do business here and thrive.",

I small small mining industries are in the country and not the big once for now but we believe with time mining will be everywhere. There is money in mining business because a day one can make 40-60 dollars.",

And this two things wey i mention they very important to they successful for mining. This our countri e go hard say we see steady light o ah no go lie you. Steady electricity nah something wey i gell say e go take long time before niaja government fit solve this problem. And this one wey be say MTN done they carry people play well for this data. Dem done increase the price of data and the e no they last at all again. You pointed out the problems ,I love that  but I believe you could have move further to a proposal.  MY PROPOSAL:For you to consider minning  you must have enough  capital to start  it which is probably  a good capital  as alternate to investing in BTC. Learn Dca strategy, learn how to invest , do research, purchase and start HODLing your coin . With this,  you don't really need to worry about those e problems  anymore just make sure you're upto date with your research  and news.This is the little cake I could offer base on my knowledge.",
