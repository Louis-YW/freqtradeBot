Are you a believer or you think it won't do well for long. I bought it and made money but i was buying a lot of other coins too so only small fraction went to Solana. And i guess that's always the problem with me. Every time i invest i feel i made a mistake because i didn't invest enough. Then again i have lost so many times i should understand that being too greedy a sure way to to get rekt or rich. And that it's better to 100x 10% of your money and regret not investing more then let 50% of your money drop to zero or 100x",

In fact, there are a lot of coins that are more profitable than Solana, buy ETH and Bitcoin instead as it was worth regretting of not taking the move. Well, anyways, good thing it happens to Solana but it is not enough to convince me of the potentiality of the project after having some issues connecting to this project. https://news.coincu.com/100844-why-solana-is-the-biggest-scam-in-crypto/",

Sure, it went crashing down and you are talking about that in present tense like now, sol is heavily oversold and has ton of room to grow. During this pump of 2 weeks now, SOL up 132%. Eth is up 28.7% and BTC 22.9. And with Vitalic comments i am guessing that the bottom for SOL was in.So can you revisit and elaborate your comment?",

And if you are upset now that you did not buy Sol at the lowest price, I think the market will still give you such a chance. Highest ROI or Profit? ROI should simply be a breakeven of what you have engaged on this industry. But indeed it is impossible to know which cryptocurrency would generate more profit because that would depend on the amount you have invested and the coin you chose. On my end, I am never seeking for the best one; earning profit would be enough because that'll just give me regret monitoring which coin should have I invested even if that would be impossible to be certain of in the first place; you'd only know it once an increase occur. Also, it will never be too late to invest not only on Solana but to others as well. The market still is down by a high percentage since ATH, and if you will be choosing the right coin, profit will surely be earned once bullish trend enter this industry.",

If it pumped again, I'm guessing the ones who pump SOL are the ones who also have bought all SOL in the market, most likely Alameda and its backers.

Are you a believer or you think it won't do well for long. MATIC and SOL are very close as there is only a difference of 200 millions when it comes to their market caps so I would guess they will exchange positions often during the next weeks, however SOL has been the coin which has presented the biggest recent growth in the top 25 and if this trend continues it would not be odd for SOL to at some point get the 10 position in terms of market cap and not let it go as the community has shown a lot of interest in it lately.",

Before the FTX collapsed I was wishing SOL to dive down to $10 but when it did, I wasn't interested anymore. I got what I wish but I didn't buy SOL though. It doesn't look good anymore when I know it's being pumped by FTX guys and we know SOL is one of the tokens they hold just like the FTT holding during thier collapseAnyone who bought at the price of $10 raised more than double. But what I'm surprised about is the pump last week which might also go plummeting next, SOL price could also dive which is another blow for those who bought.",

Both coins are of two great blockchains but I believe polygon have lot's of demand more than the Solana. Those projects are both active and they need to keep it up because the competitions in their category are tight and if they slack off, another one will take their place. It has been a trend in the past that these two projects will be more likely to become the next BNB or ETH but as we can see, they are far from it and they really need to work to continue updates and develop their platform. Especially in this time of the crypto season when investors are losing hope in the other coins because of their lack of activities they need to take advantage of the current situation to attract more investors this year to further improve their projects.",
