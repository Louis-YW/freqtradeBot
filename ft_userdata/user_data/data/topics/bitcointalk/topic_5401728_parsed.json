      "body": "A similar case was open for  Mr Crank  and even a  recent one  for OneNuts. Here's what I found: I think Mr Crank and OneNuts accounts are owned by the same person, and here's my proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/oK67uPpafter the first case which was the Ukan's plagarised whitepaper Mr Crank was tagged with some  negative trust and flag which made him leave the account to create a new one. For a person to keep making the same mistake of managing projects with plagarised whitepaper means they don't even bother to do any research about the project or maybe they're just too greedy to reject a campaign even after they find out it's plagarised. I think OneNuts deserves a red trust, because even if the campaign benefits BOUNTY HUNTERS what about those that are going to invest in it? Â Since both Mr Crank and OneNuts are operated by the same person a trust (even if it's neutral) should be created to notify people that both accounts are owned by same person. Quote I don't know if the proofs I provided above are enough but those are the only ones I could find.",
