When someone wants to communicate with me, you should let them make it more comfortable as he wants to talk with you.There is so many kinds of texting ways now with mobile devices. If I am going to say something very fast and short, I send a text. But when it is helpful to someone to leave a voice text, if you are giving them important information.",

      "body": "Both voice notes and text have their advantages and disadvantages, and which one is better for you depends on your personal preference and situation.Voice notes can be great for conveying emotions and tone of voice, which can be lost in text messages. They are also faster to create and can be useful when you are on the go or when you have a lot to say. However, they can be less convenient if you are in a noisy environment or if you don't want to disturb others around you.Text messages, on the other hand, can be more convenient for many people, as they can be easily read and responded to at any time. They are also more discreet and can be useful when you need to communicate in a quiet environment. However, they can be more time-consuming to create and may not convey the nuances of tone that are possible with voice notes.",

      "body": "Just as some members have expressed in this topic, text messages are preferable, if it is a short and simple message but voice messages are better if the sender wants to convey a long message. But personally, if I must choose the one that I prefer among the two, then I will have to go with voice message. With voice message I can convey my message clearer and the receiver will also read meaning into the tone of my voice understand me better. It gives a feeling like you are directly opposite the receiver. Also I don't need to worry about typing and checking if the spellings are correct.",
