If proofs of payment are provided but in cryptocurrency, do you think the court will consider it even though transactions are tagged illegal with it? or will the case be thrown out and the owner of the property with the false claim of not receiving the money be allowed to go freely?The final verdict will probably depend on the country and how the laws work there. Suppose it's a country where there is respect for the law and there is no corruption or anything. In that case, the court will ask both parties to submit proof, such as the buyer should show proof of the payment since he claims he made the payment, and the seller will then need to prove that he didn't receive the transaction considering the seller sent the funds in a wallet that can be linked to the buyer in some way. If he sent them in an unknown wallet, I don't know how they will be able to prove that the address belongs to the seller, so that can be a negative point for the buyer.However, if the buyer can prove that the address receiving the funds belongs to the seller then the court will surely investigate to find out if the funds are received or not, and if received, they will either be returned or confiscated considering the use of cryptocurrencies is illegal within the country, and the buyer might be charged a penalty or something for it.One thing in this case is clear, the buyer will not get out of it without any trouble because you are using cryptocurrencies when it's illegal, even if the seller doesn't get away with it and with the funds, the court will probably not let the buyer have the funds as well unless they charge him a heavy fine on it.",

The law is neither black nor white there are some grey areas that I believe can always be exploited by the lawyers to turn the case in the favor of their client. An unrelated and humorous example is like that of a prisoner sentence to life in prison but then died and was resuscitated. He argued that he had already served his life sentence since he died... I don't know how the story ended but you get the point I am driving at already.",

Because it will be assumed that they both know that bitcoin activities in the country is illegal, so they will be held for breach of the law.",

The thing is bitcoin isn’t like those kind of traditional monetary system where you have cases like that, transaction will are stored public blockchain so it will be crystal clear maybe it was received after sent or not. So except the receiver wants to scam the sender the transaction will be visible for him to see.

So the sender would have give up this case sadly",

So to avoid getting any issue much better don't use bitcoin for doing p2p transaction. Much better that you should use bitcoin for investment purposes only since its dangerous to transact using this knowing that government declare it as illegal asset. So always use fiat when dealing something since this is more ideal to use especially when we talk about safety.To many crazy things that we don't want to happen so we always choose safety over our wants to transact using bitcoin.",

However, here, the Bitcoin sender has a greater loss. Even if he can prove the transaction transfer, but the recipient claims that the wallet is not his, then the sender will really lose.However, as far as I know, if you are going to make a transaction that is so big, such as buying property, there must be something called a sales and purchase agreement, including an agreement regarding payment details, invoices, and proof of payment, then there is a deed of purchase through a notary. So if it is stated in the agreement that the transaction was made with Bitcoin and the recipient's wallet is listed, then the recipient will not dare to file this in court because they understand the consequences, in fact both of them will lose.And it seems difficult to deny, because basically, there will be proof of chat for sending transactions and others. 'If the case is like this:There is no agreement letter, no chat evidence, and no witnesses to support it, then:the sender is someone who is very careless and may be easily deceived. And this is a fatal mistake because it is easy to trust or carelessly spend money even in Bitcoin for transactions without evidence, witnesses, and others. So in this case, the Bitcoin sender is the one who will suffer a big loss.",

I reckon there are a bunch of other methods out there that they're able to use to convert that Bitcoin into fiat. But considering the situation, I'd say it depends on the laws of the country? I reckon there's some lawful agreement before the sales of any property so they'd have to write up some contract or something and they'd have to talk to a lawyer about that. That should pretty much cement that they can't use Bitcoin since it's not legal right there tbh. But let's say it DID get through for some reason, I'm pretty sure before anything else, they'd both get arrested just for the fact that they're both transacting in Bitcoin, regardless of the result. The government might even take the Bitcoin themselves.",

Even if you have proof of transaction on the blockchain that you sent the funds, the justice departments will not recognize it since crypto transactions are banned there. The one selling you the apartment knows this very well and had it planned all along. Since no fiat currency is involved, the government wont do anything for you, but as soon as you try to make it a legal matter, you are ending up admitting that you did something illegal.

Secondly, if there is a disagreement between buyer and seller, it cannot be taken to court because both parties may face jail time for breaking the law in the first place.I don’t think this transaction is possible in a country where bitcoin is illegal.
