To name a few, bionic arm, retinal implants, heart implant prostheses or exoskeletons are very expensive. Yet, for some of these uses, this specific technology has already been on the market for more than 10 years. But time has not come for price reductions.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000The Hélice token(H́) is the simplest solution provided by current crypto asset technology. It should act as a booster over time to lower prices, break the vicious cycle, and trigger some capital inflow to develop prosthetic technologies. .DISRUPTING..FACTORS.0000000000000000000000Sophisticated technologies require a very high degree of individualization.     Several weeks and even several months are necessary to implant the prosthesis.     Situation creating physicalpain to patients, resultingin discouragemen   0000000000000000000000000The fragility and the evolution of the patient's conditiongenerate heavy ongoing costs.     Even the most sophisticated prostheses do not last for a long time, discouraging patients.     Duration of several years for new products to obtain someregulatory approval..HÉLICE TOKEN..SOLUTION.FOR PATIENTS  ────────────────────────────This implies a straightforward message: to reduce the cost of prostheses (and other artificial organs)by 30%, 40% or even 50%.So that the best technology benefits the greatest number of people with affordable price. For example, the Hélice token shall help to000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000✅ extend life expectancy of those patients who sufferfrom deficient organs (artificial heart for example)✅ recover some (almost) normal mobility for people who got one of their legs amputated✅ improve the sight of those who have become blindLive better. Longer. And all this for a fraction of the price that was previously required.    FOR INVESTORS ───────────────────────────The Hélice token maximum supply is 1 unit and it can be divided up to 18 decimals. The minting of additional tokens is not authorized. The token is only exchanged via a centralized platform that is managed by Hélice, with the publication of the prices The Hélice token has been designed to:✅ be highly deflationary (there will never be more than one)00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000✅ Reduce supply with time thanks to buyback-burn& offer a dividend✅ make purchasing easier (with your credit card as is the case for any purchase made on the Web)✅ invest in a meaningful project with real value andpotential growth────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────00000000000  TOKEN SUPPLYThe Hélice token has a max supply of 1 unit   0000000000000000   LITEPAPER• English Version• French Version.HÉLICE..ROADMAP.",
