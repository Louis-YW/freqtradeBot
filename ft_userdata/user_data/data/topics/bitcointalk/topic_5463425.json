Even before halving, bitcoin will have more than 3.5% uptrends and downtrends. In the next halving, before 2026, I am expecting bitcoin to have increased above $100000 which is the least price I could think of.",

What if it crosses your limit and people on your advice take exit from there so should they have the right to blame you haha, I'm more curious what's your role in the 84k race, accumulator, analyzer, manipulator, or ......

People may remember their private keys, or the means of recovering deleted data will develop, or some technologies will develop so that we can access the private key of the addresses that were used for Bitcoin in the early days (P2PK). All this will convert lost or lost coins into new currencies. It will enter the market as if it were mined coins. It is true that we will not exceed the barrier of 21 million coins, but the number of coins in circulation will increase. The increase in the price is linked to an increase in demand and a decrease in supply, which may change for a number of reasons.",

The reward that would be halved in the next several months is only 6.25BTC, not a big number.But given that the price of Bitcoin is already almost $30,000, the next halving would mean that roughly $92,000 in Bitcoin is taken off the market every 10 minutes. That's around $552,000 every hour, $13,248,000 every day. Vis-à-vis the growing adoption and therefore demand, I don't think 3.125BTC every around 10 minutes is an insignificantly small amount.I'm convinced it's significant enough to influence the price.",

Total supply is always 21 million bitcoins but less and less new bitcoins will appear from block rewards each 210,000 blocks.How is the 21 million Bitcoin cap defined and enforced?Controlled supply and Equivalent Network Time can provide more details and other views for you.",

The halving has always added impact on bitcoin price to pump and it doesn't matter if we only have 3.125BTC left to be mined. It might be very small number compare to the previous number after the halving but it doesn't mean that the quantity of bitcoin to be mined after the halving would make the price not have a pump to above 100k because after every halving comes the bull run and from history every bull run has an ATH price which do increase above the previous ATH. With bitcoin price at 29k+,this is a sign that we will have bitcoin price above 100k in 2025.",

Just the fact alone that it is going to be twice as hard to mine for half the coins is enough to give it a nice bump as it has done historically. Let's just sit back and enjoy the show, eh?This holds a pivotal significance—imagine a scenario where everyone is offloading their Bitcoins at prices north of 100k, yet there's a scarcity of genuine buyers. In essence, a price beyond 100k would merely sustain itself momentarily until the force of price correction reaches its threshold.The age-old interplay of supply and demand remains a focal point for all. While we might entertain soaring hopes of Bitcoin's value rocketing to astronomical heights, it's imperative that we grasp the underlying fundamentals. Could the phenomenon of halving alone suffice to propel its market value beyond the 100k mark?",

Also, how can you be so sure that in 120 years there's going to only be 50% increase? I would probably believe you if bitcoin is infinite supply and at the same time there's no lost coins which there's a lot already which contributes to the ever increasing scarcity of bitcoin and we all know the basics of law of supply and demand. And there's also the people that's believing that bitcoin will pump during the halving which will definitely gather media attention and we know the power of media right?",

Also lets notlose sight of the fact that it is a cut in block reward so this will affect the miners.Their costs will remain more or less the same and in the meantime they will have to work harder to earn the same reward as the did prior to the halving, which essentially means up to double the cost for them and the customer/buyer always pays the costs!",

You're the one who's expecting that percentage of gain and not us. Whatever the metric you've used into ending with that percentage, it means that you've got some basis for it. And with lesser supply during the halving, that also means that there's going to be more scarcity for Bitcoin.

The supply is and always was capped at 21 million Bitcoins. What is halving is the reward for mining Bitcoin. Therefore mining becomes less rewarding than before, and therefore the price of Bitcoin goes up. Why? Because we need mining. Otherwise transacting Bitcoin does not work. And miners need a lucrative profit otherwise they will not see the point of continuing to mine. All in all, this leads to a drastic increase in price.",
