  "content": "Hi guys, I received this email today:I thought it was just another scam, but the information of my remaining balance at FTX is correct.I checked the link (but didn't click on it), and it's the same link that's on FTX's official site.Did anyone else receive it? Is it a reason to be more hopeful?I'm curious, I was left with a balance in BUSD there, and I understand that Paxos will continue to exchange BUSD until February 2024, I wonder how this issue will turn out...Many doubts, but I hope that we can all recover at least part of the money.If anyone else has received it, please post here, and we can use this thread for some updating and information.",

      "body": "I personally did not receive the mail because I have no assets under the FTX exchange, but a friend shared similar news with me.This mail or news is certainly something to build up a little hope for, since the court and its defendant are fighting to see that all customers are paid what they are owed on the exchange. But this is really going to be tricky, and even if everyone passes the claim procedure, which I doubt because lots of people won't want to reveal their privacy to the public more than they have already done on the FTX through the KYC process. And even if all this is done, where will the money that will be used to pay back all the debt come from? I read a news story earlier that OKX returned about $157 million, which belonged to FTX and was long frozen. With few firms returning their hidden or frozen funds, will it be enough to pay back all this debt?",

Two of my friends just called me and told me they received email address and they wanted to confirm if it's really, but I told them I don't know anything about it and I haven't heard anything about it. I don't really know how real it is so we all have to be careful, and if the email is from legit sources, am sure scammers will also want to use the opportunity to scam people, they will share similar email to people and they will want to use the opportunity to scam. Now that we don't know how real the email is, we just have to be calm and keep on watching, incase if their is any link in the email we should make sure we avoid it,.",

      "body": "I don't have balance there but unless it's from official domain and email of FTX, then that's likely the update. But if it's from an unverified email and maybe FTX is working with a third party working on for the refund or releasing of the remaining funds.As said, it's better to be safe and verify first and wait until they officially mention it on their channels and social media accounts and even their website that it's valid and it came from them and that's part of the procedure. Thus, be cautious and doubtful.",

Who knows up to the judge and a bunch of other things.Keep in in mind it's not a 1st come 1st served kind of thing, but they can impose deadlines on when you have to file a claim by or you risk not getting anything.So if you don't file and were entitled to, that's on you. Kind of like leaving your coins on an exchange. That was on you too.-Dave",
