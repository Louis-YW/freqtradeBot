Probably they are only into looking those Ai project that has been declared related to that before the trend and not those new comers wanted to ride on potential market trending. That's what they are doing now because there are others who say that AI has the potential to be trending and this is what they are implementing to hype up the majority of the cryptocurrency community here.That's why I noticed in their whitepaper, the people behind this project are not listed, instead only Ultron's face was showed, and the specific address of the project is not indicated as well.",

It seems Tony's Stark was right about when he said what we need are suit of armor around the world. However we can see on that how Ultron able to change and become a villain. It depicts how dangerous AI could be. Yes its very interesting, but we should be very careful with this kind of innovation. A lot of people going for the run for it but, only to get funds from newbie. How come this project can be develop well if only Ultrons face is on their whitepaper. Obviously this is a rug pull project and we can for sure predict that their goal is only the hype market for AI.",

Thirdly, it appears that you have used copyrighted images of Marvel characters. Did you obtain permission from Marvel or Disney before using the images?Hey Stalker22 ill be happy to address your concerns here1. Firstly, our whitepaper will undergo further updates which includes more details about layers, utility, gas and testnet info.The way our AI will address the challenges of reliability, security and efficiency is through the AI deployer. Smart contracts on the chain that are created via our bot will automatically receive a verification badge that its Ultron AI Bot approved. This verification badge will tick the reliability and security of the specific contract since the deployer AI guarantees:No proxy contract, Â liquidity lock as soon as token is live, maximum taxes cannot be increased beyond 25%, no honeypot functions, no liquidity pull functions, no mint functions, minimum 95% of the supply must be locked and a built anti-bot system.2. The team is not anonymous, we have completed the KYC verification and will be uploaded to the website and whitepaper prior to presale start. We will also be hosting AMA's on various channels including Gate.io so you can come and tune in to hear from the team, those announcements will be posted on our Telegram and Twitter pages 24+ hours ahead.3. If we are approached by any of the giants in the near future we have a plan in place to either a/ try to obtain permission or b/ rebrand if needed.Thank you.",

We have had the utility in mind for quite a while now and we came to light that AI is the trend and can solve many problems in todays world. The naming and branding had to be done in a appealing manner where new members and investors can connect with. You can have the best utility in the world but if you brand it off-trend then it goes only a short distance. We have received a lot of feedback regarding the whitepaper and will be updating it with more detail in the coming days.Thanks",

If we are approached by any of the giants in the near future we have a plan in place to either a/ try to obtain permission or b/ rebrand if needed.I agree that naming and branding the project is very important, that is why I'm surprised that a serious project would choose to name itself in violation of intellectual property laws. Such a decision not only raises questions about the legitimacy of the project, but it also puts the project at risk of legal action and potential damage to its reputation. What will happen if some of these giants decide to take legal action against you? The situation could get very messy very quickly. I understand that you may not be aware of these laws, but it's important that you do your due diligence before making such an important decision. If you are determined to proceed with this plan, then please consult with an attorney before proceeding any further.I don't know. But if I were running a serious project, I would not take that risk. And all I can gather from this is that you are not a serious project.",

This always suggests that it is a potential scam. Moreover, such a fashionable phrase as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used. It is really unclear what role artificial intelligence will play in this project. The team, if there is one at all, promises to fix everything later, but already now it is announcing the sale of its tokens, but in fact the fundraising in a dubious project.",
