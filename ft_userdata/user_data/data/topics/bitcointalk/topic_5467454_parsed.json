Any game they play is just fun for them and that's probably how your kid think of it. I once saw a buddy of mine let his son play dice on mobile and he didn't find it alarming. The kid actually got bored.Social gatherings is where kids probably see more gambling activities when adults play table games as a past time. They would usually put money on the table while some kids would be watching at the back. Many of us here probably grew up in that kind of environment. We learned how to gamble at a young age but still ended up fine.",

As long as you're a gambler it might get into you child to be a gambler that's if he wants because the world today is just exposed to so many things, you hide it from your children doesn't mean they won't learn it from outside and they might even be a bettter than you are if care isn't taken. So I'd say, as parents do your part and let nature take it's cause. You can gamble in front of your kids and he or she might just over look it, like not having it in mind to try it, that's life, is all about choice.",

Most often, kids really picture out and copy your attitude, the way you behave, and the way you perceive things. They are fast learners. That's why they said that if you want your kids be a good people, show them - be their role model. And I guess it's really true because it's often the case to the kids and parents that I personally know. Honestly, it's both fascinating and worrisome. Fascinating because you can mold your kids into becoming a great adult by showing them how to be kind, responsible, respectful, and strategic. Worrisome because they might grow into a bad one if they are exposed into an unpleasant upbringing during their childhood. So it's really a matter of discipline on your side as a parent. If you think gambling has a great repercussions to one's life especially if they are exposed to it at a young age, then do your best to avoid gambling with them around. That way, they will not be curious about it.",

Gambling can create a false perception that it's an easy way to make money which can lead to unrealistic expectations and financial problems later on. Children seeing you gambling can normalise risky behaviour and potentially increase the chances of developing a gambling addiction.  It’s important for children to understand the value of hard work, saving and responsible financial decision making which can be overshadowed by the allure of gambling. Creating a positive and responsible financial environment for children is good for their well being and future success.",

Children are naturally very curious and take an interest in almost anything they see, they should not be exposed to activities they are not legally allowed to practice cause it sets them up to get attracted to it and in turn addicted to that activity.Quote from: Stedsm on September 20, 2023, 11:58:32 AMThen one day, she wanted to play it herself and asked me if she can go for it and I said \"no, it's not your legal age to go for such games\".

There is always the downside that kids will still learn everything eventually, through peer groups, television or the internet, it helps to teach it to them and point them to what they can do and what they cannot quite do yet.- Jay -",

We must keep our our hobby as a secret and its up for them when they grow up to follow what we do if they found out but we make sure that they are properly guided so that we can make sure that everything on their side is so fine and no elements can harm them.",

I think Op used the best approach to stall his kid, and if he's lucky she'd find something to catch her fancy but there are other kids who are relentless and sometimes in the absence of any adult supervision, indulge in those things just to satisfy their curiosity..",

It does not affect perception too much when current education has focused on isolating children from these bad things but before isolating gambling, it is necessary for them to know what it is and the harmful effects of gambling. But in general, this problem should be limited when there are children at home, family should be the top priority",

Never expose them about money and betting, as they will immediately think that it can also be good for them since you are making good profit from it.

It will be a big blunder to expose children to gambling by our actions. I don't allow any kid to be around me when I am doing things that are not their age level. Children can learn easily and are also prone to gambling addiction. This is why we should protect them from gambling. Children like observing what adults do, which is why it is important to also observe them before engaging in gambling. I don't allow them to be close to my phone when I am gaming. Also, the best time to game is when they have gone to bed or not at home. I also ensure that I clear my gambling browser history before giving them access to my phone. But there is also a need to speak to them about gambling if they are above 10. They need to know the gambling age as well as the need to avoid it for now. They should also know about gambling addiction and why they shouldn't be involved for now.",

Yes, let's say we can't avoid this because nowadays there are many streamers who gamble, but maybe it's not right that you will be the reason why your son became a gambler, right?
