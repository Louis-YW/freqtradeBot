  "content": "We live in a world which glamorizes and praises people who reach at working positions considered top tier, consequently bringing high status and guaranting large financial returns. At school, on the media, during friendly or familiar discussions and everywhere else that is the ideal concept of success for our society, as common sense.But what is the price to be paid to reach in such positions? i don't talk about the effort of educating yourself to be qualified to reach a position like that. Even because there are many educated and smart people who aren't at key positions on their local societies. Quite the opposite, they live on the edges of society, despite the fact they are educationally qualified and decent people.It came to my mind that a possibility could be that it's not important how literate, rightful, honest, prepared you are, rather the important is if you are able to sacrifice your own morale principles, beliefs in order to follow and fulfill the orders, desires and interests of others who can potentially boost your career upside, or simply to avoid having them as enemies, rivals who could sabotage you somehow.Some movies and stories show us that, illustrating the idea as people had to sell their souls to the devil in order to be rewarded with wealth, power and reputation in life.Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art?Isn't the root of the economical issues we face world wide the fact wrong people are at the right places? Because once you have unscrupulous individuals calling the shorts in the world, you can expect there is going to be a lot of injustice, inequality, power abuse, greed, false promises, distrust, and many other factors which eventually lead to economical disbalance, being impossible to create a propitious environment for its healthy development.",

If you are a top executive in oil or chemical industry, you could be tempted to cause a lot of damage to environment and endanger lots of lives to boost the company's profits. But if you are making children's toys or something like that, there's less opportunity for evil actions. It also depends on your country - in some causing harm to the public could be risky because you can be sued and harshly fined or even go to jail, in others you can bribe your way out of any legal trouble.Quote from: uneng on August 23, 2022, 07:52:57 PMIsn't the root of the economical issues with face world wide the fact wrong people are at the right places?

Economic problems like inflation, unemployment, lack of business activity happen for many different reasons.",

Yes, we want to be slave by our desires, especially if you are still in your younger years, but then, later on in our lives, when we experienced a lot of struggles and challenges, we will come to a realization on what's important to survive and be contented with our lives.

Defined by cycles of corruption followed by counter culture movements in the opposite direction. The roman empire struggled with high inflation of the denarius close to 2,000 years ago. Just as many nations today struggle with it. What is interesting is people often believe they're better off not knowing essential history. Making it easier for history to repeat itself.For most values and ideology we have prior precedents. Others struggled with the issues we face today for millennia. We can draw upon their example for guidance and support. And if we're lucky: learn from their success and failure. When conditions are the worst appear to be when people are discussing topics like poverty and inflation as if they never existed before yesterday. As it means we lack the historical perspective necessary to properly put everything into context. Principles normally trend somewhere between materialism and spiritualism. Everyone makes their choice. And hopefully everyone is happy with their results.",

      "body": "It is true that our society often glorifies those who have reached high levels of success in their careers. This can create a lot of pressure for people who feel like they are not measuring up. It is important to remember that success is not always about how much money you make or what position you hold. There are many different paths to success and everyone has their own unique talents and abilities that they can use to achieve their goals.It is also important to remember that success often comes at a cost. People who are successful often have to make sacrifices in order to achieve their goals. This can include sacrificing their own moral principles or beliefs. Sometimes, people have to do things that they are not comfortable with in order to get ahead.This can be a difficult balance to strike, but it is important to remember that you should never sacrifice your own values in order to achieve success. Success is not worth sacrificing your integrity for.If you maintain your integrity and morality, it might evoke envy in people around you and they may wish misfortune upon you. Remember Jesus? William Wallace? My favourite characters from fiction who go through a similar fate: Edmond dantes, Prince myshkin, Raskolnikov. It's a cruel and sick world",

You can find people even less qualified for some key positions that are given the Job because of Networking, having good friends and the ability to learn quickly and catch up.You have to be socially active and friendly. Having good friends can be a game changer you know, good friends who are very connected even without your knowledge can refer for job positions just because they want to help you, and they have also seen that you have the second skill set that I will highlight next. Your ability to learn determines a lot. If you can learn quickly, you are a good candidate for a job that you have been referred for even if you are not exactly educationally qualified for it.",

      "body": "Moving to the top of the pyramid & becoming rich is quite easy in the world... the only thing that constantly discouraged us from going further is what it takes to move to the top and become rich. Alot change their mind easily due to money/reward(Love of money). In my opinion, to sell your soul to the devil is to accept to serve him. There has to be an agreement/deal first, you will be aware that what you aiming at for money/reward is evil but to survive and feed your children you need to do it. If you accept it you have made deal with the devil.but if you reject it the system makes sure you're poor & wretched, and hope that you will eventually come back begging. People actually sell their soul to the devil by agreeing to serve him through what they do or support for reward. Once you are sold, you become his puppet and he uses you however he wants. If you refuse to continue serving him you are blackmailed, jailed, killed, etc. The only way out of it is to run to the one who is way more Powerful than him... HE is our CREATOR.I think devil is actually very much interested in talented people but he makes them use the talents wrongly. So, expect to see very talented people in evil companies/organizations but you won't be wrong to assume they are using the talents to do very bad things. Ofcourse, there are round peg in square hole workers and I typically assume they work for companies/organizations/people who don't care  much about talents or don't know how to source them put them together & use them to achieve the desired results. Another possible reason is that talents are lacking or the use of untalented people is deliberate way to weaken a country/organization.",

I totally agree with you,  first of all,  I think we have to come to terms with what it takes to be in that right place, then before we ask how many of the right people are willing to do that which it takes.The wrong people are the ones in the right places because -1. Being in that right place (at a greater level) requires one to go against his or her morals or principles.2. And unfortunately,  the wrong people are the ones who easily let go their morals or principles in quest for wealth, power and fame which are the reward those right places offer.This is why most times,  it is very difficult to find the right persons in the right places because they are not willing to sacrifice that which is required,  as doing that will mean them going against their morals and principles.",

Some people maintain the highest standards all throughout their life and career, others start off with a certain set of standards but then drop those as they try to play the career game and some were put into positions of power never having earned it but having the right connections or being manipulative enough to engineer it. For those except the super rich there is definitely a degree of getting along and having a face that fits in order to progress, you have to be strategic about your interactions in a company for all sorts of reasons but intelligence will always shine through in the long run. Even then, if you reach the top it can be possible to alter some of the bad behavior you saw on the way up, so never write somebody off because change is possible.",

I think it's better that way since working on something while your guilt and conscience is killing you inside is a torture. I've seen some people doing like that although they know what they were doing but they still proceed to do it anyway out of self respect but they needed the money. They chose to eat their own pride while working and can't blame them but that's how life it's not that easy and everyone is trying to make a living.If one could find a better job with their principle's isn't bothered I think we won't be fighting everyday to make a living.",
