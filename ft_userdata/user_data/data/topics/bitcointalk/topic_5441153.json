  "content": "Exactly a year ago Putin invaded Ukraine -- on February 24, 2022. It's a sad anniversary for all Ukrainians and also for all humanity.An article from Bitcoin Magazine, recommended to me by 1miau, recently drew my attention. Bitcoin Magazine is a great resource for many informative articles about Bitcoin but it also publishes a vast specter of philosophic and libertarian essays.This article is long, maybe one of the longest I ever read, having almost 14.000 words. It took me some time to read it but, at the end, it drove me even more to support Ukraine's cause. The article talks about tumultuous past of Ukrainian people, their struggles from the past which are continued even during present. Things causing these struggles varied in time, yet pain remained the same.We are also informed about Bitcoin adoption in Ukraine and the narrative tells us the stories of true war heroes or stories of Ukrainian bitcoiners. One story presented in the article is really touching. It introduces us Naumenko, a dedicated bitcoiner and a hero:QuoteIn 2018, Naumenko got the chance to work with Bitcoin giants like Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille as an intern at Blockstream, eventually co-authoring a paper with Maxwell and Wuille on a proposed Bitcoin improvement called Erlay, which could make the network more efficient and resilient. In 2021 and early 2022, Naumenko’s work on the Bitcoin protocol approached a new milestone.Just days before the invasion, Naumenko released “CoinPool,” a new implementation of Bitcoin which would allow many users to share the same “UTXO,” or spendable piece of bitcoin. A complement to the Lightning Network, and something that might help Bitcoin scale better and add privacy, CoinPool was the result of years of work with fellow developer Antoine Riard. The release would be an impressive achievement under any circumstance, but it was an astonishing scientific feat from a country on the brink of war.On February 24, Naumenko was shaken from a dream by his buzzing phone. His friends were frantically texting him: The invasion was happening. He had assigned a small probability for this in his mind but only a tiny one. Only 12 hours earlier, he had been riding his new electric scooter to a coffee shop to read a book. The weather was gray and depressing. There was no one on the streets. He was overcome by a strange feeling. Only when he was jolted awake at 5:00 a.m. did he realize war had arrived. He threw together a backpack and hurried to a nearby metro stop, where he descended into a Soviet-era bomb shelter, built to withstand nuclear attacks.He spent three days and two nights in the bunker. At first, when he went into the subway station, the old woman at the turnstile asked him to wear a mask. He looked at her, baffled. COVID-19 was over, and war had begun. More and more people and families with children joined him, bringing pillows and food, preparing to live there. The initial shock of war drove crowds underground, but after a few days, out of necessity, people started to return to their terrestrial lives.When Naumenko finally left the shelter, he met up with friends and decided to leave the city in a pink BMW. The car was ostentatious but was the only one available. They were afraid their ride might bring too much attention but decided to use it to split west anyway. The Russian army was in the suburbs outside of Kyiv, killing civilians, and they could hear the firefight. Time was of the essence.Naumenko’s friends disappeared into Romania, but he asked to be dropped off in a Ukrainian town right before they crossed the border. He wanted to stay and help.Putin's troops brought so much suffering for Ukraine, where Russian troops bombed and destroyed the houses of many Ukrainian civilians. Some Ukrainian cities have been destroyed completely and Mariupol, a city once populated by 500.000 people is completely ruined. Satellite images even showed that Russians have dug mass graves, most likely to get rid of Mariupol citizens which would be a war crime. Putin brought war to almost everyone in Ukraine and even those in the western parts of Ukraine need to seek shelter when Russia is launching new missile strikes. It's horrible, because any time you can get an air raid warning, hoping the rocket won't hit your house. But Putin also brought suffering to his own country. When he rushed more troops to the front to conquer Ukraine, he announced mobilization of 300.000 young men and sent them mostly unprepared to the front for his cruel war. That's what military strategists call \"cannon fodder\".Many Russians were trying to leave the country but were stopped by Russian guards at the border. They have been imprisoned and sent to the front. It's truly a shame what Putin is doing there: he has started the biggest land war since WW2, when Hitler launched an attack against Poland and later several other countries. It's completely justified to call Putin \"Putler\" because he's standing in the tradition of Hitler's actions of WW2. People are suffering because maniac Putin wants to create Soviet Union 2.0 and re-establish his communist shit hole. How can Bitcoin help to get rid of Putin's dictatorship? As Alex Gladstein described in his article Currency of last resort how Bitcoin is helping people suffering from Putin's bloody war, it would be interesting to evaluate how Bitcoin can help us to get rid of Putin's dictatorship or at least weaken his position that he needs to make concessions. Sure, it's not easy and Bitcoin alone can't stop Putin from invading Ukraine but Bitcoin can be a part of the solution to send Putin's regime literally to the Gulag How Bitcoin can contribute:Russians should disapprove Putin's war by using Bitcoin. As we all know, Putin is afraid of losing his power. He's a dictator and can't be removed democratically, therefore people need to reclaim democratic decision-making. Bitcoin is such a democratic tool and he can't ban it if people decide to use it instead of his Ruble.We, as allies of Ukraine, should help to undermine the Russian Ruble, national currency of Russia. It would weaken the Russian Ruble, national currency of Russia. And a fragile Ruble would weaken Putin's ability to buy or manufacture more weapons = less people will be killed in Ukraine from Russian missiles and Ukraine can push the Russian troops back out of Ukraine.If Putin keeps to govern in an authoritarian way, Russians should refuse to pay taxes as paying taxes in countries where no fair and free elections have been taken place should be optional. By doing so, people could force a democratic election and vote Putin out of power. Eastern Germany collapsed in a similar way.Bitcoin can help us to send aid to Ukraine as initiatives from icopress or JohnnyUA have proven.A while ago I wrote the topic Bitcoin can help a bit to reduce spreading of coronavirus. There was a small aid that Bitcoin could bring, by not using physical money, which could carry the virus.There is now another aid which Bitcoin can bring: help people from Ukraine, which maybe can not receive fiat donations, but Bitcon is unstoppable. G7 countries sanctioned Russia but it was not enough for shaking their currency too much; Bitcoin may help here as well. It's not much but is something! And, by using Bitcoin more and more we all make it more powerful and its powers are coming back to help us. It's not much but, at least, we all can do something for helping Ukraine through Bitcoin.So help Bitcoin help Ukraine!Topic is self-moderated for avoiding spam.Translations (in chronological order):Română: Ajută Bitcoin să ajute Ucraina!, translation by GazetaBitcoinFilipino: [Translation] Tulungan ang Bitcoin na makatulong sa Ukraine!, translation by Asuspawer09Polish: Pomóż Bitcoinowi pomóc Ukrainie!, translation by cyganPidgin: Help Bitcoin help Ukraine!, translation by sokaniGerman: Helfe dem Bitcoin und der Ukraine!, translation by cyganBengali: বিটকয়েন বাঁচাও ইউক্রেন বাঁচাও!, translation by DYING_S0ULFrench: Aidez Bitcoin à aider l'Ukraine !, translation by iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2Urdu: بٹ کوائن سے یوکرین کی مدد کرو, translation by snowpegaRussian: Пoмoгитe Биткoинy пoмoчь Укpaинe, translation by DrBeerIndonesian: Bantu Ukraina dengan Bitcoin!, translation by dansus021Ukrainian: Дoпoмoжiть Бiткoїнy дoпoмoгти Укpaїнi!, translation by DrBeer",

We both believe in peace, in power of Bitcoin and we try, with the few ways we can, to help Ukraine.Today is a day of sad anniversary. But with everybody's help, maybe on next February 24th Ukrainians will feel better. This is an appeal to everybody: Help Bitcoin help Ukraine!!!",

      "body": "Indeed, it’s very true that Bitcoin can be a game changer for Ukrainians. It’s a difficult time for Ukrainians and they can really need all the help they can get. As we have also seen on the forum, where many members sent BTC to our dear icopress, Bitcoin is a great source of revenue for Ukrainians. I’ve previously also written an article about Bitcoin as a medium for donations, why Bitcoin is very important for fast and international donations. Let’s hope that Ukrainians will soon be able to re-build their country and Putler finally withdraws his troops. Currently, icopress is often giving his insights on what’s happening near the front. As we know Russia also collapsed in 1917 during WW1, due to the russian revolution. It might be time for a revolution in Russia again to remove their authoritarian Putin regime. Maybe Bitcoin can help here as well because I can imagine that no one in Russia wants to be sent into a foreign country to die for such a unnecessary invasion. The article from Alex Gladstein is a great and well-researched source, where Gleb Naumenko, the Bitcoin core contributor, is outlining important reasons for Bitcoin. And as a Bitcoin Core contributer, he knows Bitcoin very well.  Bitcoin is already very advanced in Ukraine, which will be very beneficial for the coutry because I’m sure Ukrainians will see many benefits in Bitcoin. Some people tend to say that Bitcoin is not very useful but that article from Alex Gladstein is explaining in detail, where Bitcoin can have a great value. Many thanks for presenting it here, dear GazetaBitcoin.",

The issue is explained very well in the topic and in addition, also icopress, who's a russian speaking Ukrainian, has debunked the russian propaganda several times and made it clear that Ukraine, USA or NATO are not to blame for the crimes Putin is doing in Ukraine. Yes, the USA has a long history of waging war, like when Bush invaded Iraq but does it mean now, that because bad things happened in the past, everyone can now invade another country and blame someone else for the invasion? That would end in a total mess because every diehard leader could try to start a war and blame another country, what Putin has exactly done. As Gleb Naumenko has explained in his topic, we should not embolden the aggressor by bringing up apologism:  QuoteBut still, he [Bitcoin Core Contributor Gleb Naumenko] told me that he wanted to be very clear about something: “What happened is a blatant, illegal invasion. I’m tired of hearing how Ukraine’s freedom from Russia is a U.S. intelligence operation, and how helping Ukraine to defend itself is bad,” he said. “To my friends in America, please remember that the Russian oppression of Ukraine is a much longer story than the existence of your entire country. Even as a libertarian, you’re supposed to defend other peoples’ right to defend themselves. This understanding has been lost.”“I know a lot of libertarians in Ukraine and Russia,” Naumenko continued, “and they ALL oppose the invasion and don’t make apologetic arguments. They think supporting Ukraine is good. The Russian libertarians even support providing Ukraine with weapons. They know what Putin is.” One can be a dogmatic libertarian, or an anarcho-capitalist, he said, but this only works if your country isn’t at risk. To paraphrase Mike Tyson, “Everyone has an ideology until they get punched in the mouth.”The surprisingly common angle in the Bitcoin community that the war isn’t Putin’s fault is important to address. For the purposes of this essay, a short overview of Ukraine’s history will be helpful, to establish the fact that Ukraine has been in the process of statebuilding — and resisting foreign attacks, invasions and occupations — for nearly 1,000 years. This reality is encased in the country’s national anthem, which begins with the words: “Ukraine has not yet perished.”https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/currency-of-last-resort",

It's Russian Fascism or called Rashism, where Russia is trying to grab as much foreign land as possible, an imperialist strategy to opress foreign countries along Russia's border: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuscismWhen waging his war, Putin doesn't care how many of his own people are killed, too. It's a blatant fascist invasion what Russia is doing and we need to stop Putin as soon as possible. Fascist states hate bitcoin because fascism only works when you can opress your own people as Putin is doing. Once bitcoin gets widely accepted, Putins power might drop. Bitcoin is a peaceful revolution against opressive regimes. Slava Ukraini!",

In that speech, Putin has denied Ukraine any rights to be a sovereign state and he has announced thet he wants to force Ukraine to get part of Russia. Since Ukraine doesn't want to be part of Russia and it's very obvious now that Putin is a war criminal, Putin tries to shift blame for the invasion which he started himself and Putin tries to blame now Ukraine, EU, USA, NATO, United Kingdom, the baltic states, everyone to be at fault for the invasion, that Russia has launched, LOL All we need for this unnecessary war to end, is Putin to withdraw his troops, which he illegally sent into Ukraine 1 year ago and which are destroying Ukraine every day.

I'm not an Ukrainian but my expectation would be that coins should be as portable as possible, especially for people living near the front. They could quickly put their coins in their backpack if they needed to flee. Of course, we won't hope that they need to flee because it would also mean that they would possibly lose many of their other properties at home. A paper wallet (generated offline) or a Hardware wallet could be a good choice in case you need to flee. Maybe they can store a small amount of their coins on a phone or laptop for possible expenses in Bitcoin but I would expect, cash could be more suitable in such a situation. Bitcoin is mostly a good way to store / transfer a large amount of value in that case above. Regarding destroyed homes, it might also make sense to have an additional backup elsewhere. I could imagine that making a copy of your private key / seed, putting it in a box resistant against rain, cutting it in half and burying in a lone forest, where no one will detect it, is a good idea as well. But we select such a place carefully and keep in mind, where it's buried. And such a backup would need to be highly resistant against rain etc. for a long time, so we would need some sort of safe box, too. Which coins? Of course, Bitcoin would be my best choice. Bitcoin is less volatile compared to Altcoins and Bitcoin can be stored on many wallets, which are proven to be secure. And if there's a cryptocurrency accepted somewhere or available to be exchanged into cash, it's most likely Bitcoin.

Fortunately, this time the West did not decide to impose sanctions on the country that was attacked, and we also have Bitcoin, which turned out to be something that many people recognized and thus decided to help the people of Ukraine to defend themselves.As for the way in which Bitcoin can help Russia get rid of Putler and his political associates, I agree in principle that some kind of internal rebellion is needed, but here we have to take into account that hundreds of thousands have already left that country and that every more and more are leaving each day. What I want to say is that the critical mass that is crucial for change is decreasing more and more, and only those who are too afraid to raise their voice remain - with the addition of hundreds of thousands of those who hold weapons in their hands and shoot at Ukraine.I think that Bitcoin is, first of all, key in that it can provide fairly anonymous donations and that it encourages many people to donate without fear that something will happen to them because they are helping Ukraine. What we need to know is that always when it comes to war, a war is being fought on the front line, but it is also being fought in the background where the battle is being fought between the army of Russian spies which were placed up all over the world for decades and are now trying to do their dirty work.",
