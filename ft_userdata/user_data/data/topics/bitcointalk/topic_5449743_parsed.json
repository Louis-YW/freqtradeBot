  "content": "The next big future is a time of technological advancement driven by a combination of scientific breakthroughs, market demand, and other factors that are rarely predictable. However, there are several emerging or breakthrough technologies that are likely to have a significant impact in the nearest future, some of which we have recently experienced at first stage development.• Quantum computing presents fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization which would require the use of quantum computers to perform computations that are beyond the reach of classical computers.• Augmented and Virtual Reality: AR and VR technologies which is increasingly being used in gaming, entertainment, education, healthcare, official meetings and in other fields.• The web space or WWW(world wide web) known as partially as Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the devices connected to the internet, which interact with one another and pose a great potential hub to new services and applications.• The Blockchain technology which is a distributed ledger technology allows for only secure and transparent transactions without the need for third parties. It has become a problem to many governments because of the potential it poses to disrupt industries such as finance and its legal fiat system. Also the supply chain management, and healthcare sectors accordingly.• The 5G Networks as of late has become a good conversation starter topic because new devices require swift Internet service and such innovation has the potential to provide faster internet speeds and lower latency, enabling new applications such as self-driving cars, smart cities, and remote surgery to function without network hitches and or delays.*With these few examples of emerging technologies of the nearest future, what other innovations are likely to have a rather significant impact in the nearest big future?",

Another technological development I can think of is maybe or hopefully a technology that can improve the likelihood of surviving Cancer.About the 5G heard Lot's of negative rumor's about it. Have the side effect's be corrected or they are just rumors. While I believe the growth of virtual reality in games will improve the adoption of cryptocurrency, because personally if am the developer of such an immersive game am going to create my own digital currency to run in app purchases. Nice Post by the way am surprised by the low turn up.Thanks. Responding to Artificial intelligence being omitted, it could however be categorized under the internet of things, IoT or included under world wide web(www) point I stated. No doubt how A.i is gaining fast adoption despite the warning from Elon Musk and others about its domineering presence in the digital space. It is a very welcomed innovation so far and its coins is just one of the pecks it has to offer in coming days.Also 5g network is already been implemented, it is only going to take some time before it is fully adopted.",
