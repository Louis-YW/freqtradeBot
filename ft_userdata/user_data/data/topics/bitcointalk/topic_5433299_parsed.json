      "body": "Not specifically celebrities, divorce is quite frequent in countries where it is allowed and more or less hassle free. The reasons for Celebs are a bit different, since for most of the cases it is due to any of the following:- Cheating, frequently.- People marry too young and realize it has been a mistake. Incompatibility.- Addictions or money problems, sometimes stress.- People decide to follow different life options or paths.For celebs... divorce does not mean much. Usually the economic side is not important so they feel free to go.",

      "body": "But this is not limited to celebrities only. Divorce is a common phenomenon in all societies with different cultures. Almost every one of them has a relative who is in a state of divorce. In the end, marriage is a circumstantial decision that can be undone.Celebrities are more susceptible to temptations, including the ease of changing partners. In addition, the goals of the marriage contract differ from one person to another. This does not mean that there are no successful marriage relationships.",

Imagine being in a marriage where the media keeps poking into each and every detail of it. The pressure alone makes both partners to let it go.Also, money or wealth has played a very big role in degrading the moral standards of people today. In societies where one of the partners stands to gain properties and money she didn't even work hard for after a divorce, then it is quite obvious incidences of divorce will only increase, often triggered by the people who feel they will gain so much from them.",

Some also think that the celebrity lifestyle is a byproduct of capitalism, some also argues that infidelity might be a major factor as to why celebrity couples marriages don't last.The increase in the fall of many marriages in our societies is because of the decline in the application of some important virtues. Patience, tolerance, love, meekness, etc are disappearing gradually from our societies. Love has been replaced with lust and pride has taken the place of meekness. This is clear proof that money and fame don't sustain a marriage. The increase in divorce Is not just a problem for celebrities, divorce has also increased in our society. This problem that these celebrities created has been copied by people globally because most people see these celebrities as their role models and follow them to divorce their spouses. Other factors that have contributed to the increase in divorce are improved women's rights, globalization, and social media.",

Secondly marriage is a commitment, and we all know that Career comes first both these celebrities, so no one is committed to making the marriage work, or one is committed and the other is not, so they become frustrated and decide to end it.",

The majority of people that get married end up getting divorced so it might be that celebrities aren't actually divorcing each other at a higher rate than everyone else.People in the religious communities have lower divorce rates, ie orthodox jews have significantly lower divorce rates than the general population and are among the most religious -- similar cultural values usually end up in a happier marriage. How many celebrities are getting married based on similar cultural values?It's one of the downsides in todays world where seemingly values are eroding.",

Being a celebrity is a kind of lifestyle that you will be open to everyone,  and their wont be enough spend with partners. Because of all this their is always trust issues in the marriage.

When all this are not their in marriage, it is impossible for marriage to last forever.  Celebrity who understands what marriage is all about handle their marriage well and it has always work for them.",
