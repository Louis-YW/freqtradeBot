Embrace Bitcoin if it simplifies your life and has a positive impact on it.Bitcoin does not need to follow Satoshi's original plan for it to be more perfect. What's more important is that people accept and use it even though it cannot become the currency Satoshi wanted. If bitcoin stabilizes and is used as a peer-to-peer currency as it was originally intended, but people are not interested in it and it will not achieve any significant growth. So it makes no sense for it to become currency when people reject it. Bitcoin has grown as an asset and gained a lot of support because it actually brings a lot of benefits to being an asset. I really don't understand why some people still see it as a bad thing for bitcoin. Furthermore, even though bitcoin is an asset, we can still use it as currency in necessary cases such as cross-border money transfers. The peer-to-peer currency nature of bitcoin has never been lost even when it is used as an asset and investment.",

But behind it all the Lightning Network is still in the development stage and several dilemmas about the difficulty of developing the Lightning network must make Antoine Riard resign from the development of the Lightning Network, citing security issues and fundamental challenges to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is a difficult dilemma and makes the role of the Lightning Network fade. Antoine Riard said that he wanted to focus on developing Bitcoin Core.But in my opinion, even though the development of the Bitcoin Lightning Network is quite difficult, there will definitely be a solution to overcome it. Bitcoin developers are not only Antonie but there are still many who can do it well. technology can still continue to be developed and there will be a solution later.Source:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-core-developer-antoine-riard-steps-back-lightning-network-dilemma",
