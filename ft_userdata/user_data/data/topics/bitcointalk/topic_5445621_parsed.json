It damages your privacy but to avoid DDos attack, it seems there is no alternative solution.How does Captcha mitigate DDos attack?",

I do noticed especially when I am using VPN (which is the one I used often), there are many sites and even Google search engine that bring up captcha to solve, but while using my ISP for the internet connection, I see no captcha.But you should know that you wallet is not hacked, solving captcha is often used by some legit websites.",

I've never encountered a captcha on my normal ISP IP, but a lot of times on tor. If you use a free VPN that is easily abused and already has most of its IPs blacklisted no wonder it will be the same.",

Therefore only some users get CAPTCHA verification and some don't. Even though this slightly intrudes on the privacy of users, there is nothing the platform can do to prevent their sites from DDOS or other suspicious activity.",

Well, this changes things.I can confirm I'm getting the same error if I change the currency from USD to EUR and hit the homepage link in the logo.Since I assume there are no cookies left and this grabs the currency by IP locator (in this case whatever tor node) it won't keep your default INR, so yeah, it's a bug on their side. Unfortunately, I can't test right now with a tor browser or even with multiple VPNs but it gave me something to do later in the afternoon.Hmm, it seems that after getting the error even going directly to a balanceblockchair(dot)com/bitcoin/address/whateverLE:F****, Everything is giving an error and I had to go to the setting page from my history to change it back to us now works perfectly.So yeah, a site bug, nothing to do with tor this time as I can replicate it with a \"clean\" dedicated IP.",
