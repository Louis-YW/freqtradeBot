That such a humanitarian organization as the International Committee of the Red Cross, instead of medicines and medical supplies, would be engaged in the transport of cigarettes in commercial quantities, cigarettes recognized as harmful to health, causes Homeric laughter. The Armenian workers of the Red Cross have discredited this authoritative international organization. Now it becomes clear why Armenia was against the creation of a customs post in Lachin and even filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice about the illegality of creating a border checkpoint located on the territory of Azerbaijan. Naturally, the court could in no way be satisfied with such impudence on the part of Armenia and the claim was dismissed.   07/11/2023",
