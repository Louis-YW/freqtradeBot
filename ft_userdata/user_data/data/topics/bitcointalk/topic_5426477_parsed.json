If you are talking about layer 2 solutions for ethereum, then they are similar at first glance, but their protocols differ in security. You need to ask more specific questions or learn the nuances yourself. If you are talking about old Ethereum competitors and new projects such as Aptos, Sei, then the number of projects in your portfolio depends on your risks.",

They are all being created just for money purpose and no more. Those greedy developers were always looking for money from investors. A few 1 and 2 layers solutions were enough for me. This is how crypto can be called as a scam in some cases as there are so many stupid developers who keep repeating creating more and more same products.

You shall go for some who already traded at the bottom price. The problem is there are many of them and they have same specs. I have gone for some which already traded at the bottom but i were picking polygon. That's old but gold. The main question is how far adoption that already happened for all of them?",

Their blockchains can have problems with speed and transaction fees so there are Layer 2 projects to resolve these issues.On Bitcoin blockchain, we have Lightning Network and Liquid are Layer 2.On Ethereum blockchain, we have Polygon and Arbitrum as Layer 2.I want to focus my portfolio on Layer 1 projects only so I choose: Bitcoin, Ethereum (for ERC20 chain), BNB (Binance coin for Binance Smart Chain). Newer layer 1 projects must have more time in market to prove their survival.",

They have the same use but you can see different brands and each of them offering some \"unique\" features. The crypto market has become that way unfortunately partly because of the unregulated nature of the space.QuoteI don't even know which one to go for.I guess you want them all but you don't have enough funds to build a decent bag for each. Choose one or two and move to the next when you have more money to invest.",

We already knew that optimism previously give a huge airdrop to the users who use their platform, so this time it will be a great chance to engage yourself in these two. There are many more, but I considered these two now.",

I've never heard of them, but Layer 2 solutions are mostly a comparison between scalability and security, where reasonable protection is offered in exchange for high speed and fast confirmations.Most altcoins have low security, and therefore are not decentralized. Adding other layered solutions will reduce the protection of your currencies. You also need bridges, and those bridges are often hacked.only invest in Layer 1",

What I know it's better to invest to the trusted and known projects that have been proven by time.Well, we know of bitcoin as usual. While people are looking to invest their money into those projects that have technical deep meanings yet, ain't enough to be par with bitcoin. It's better to have that type of security into buying bitcoin and if there are others of the same then likely ETH.",
