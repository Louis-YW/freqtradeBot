  "content": "Living on assumption and promises is more like spending money you haven't received. People can make promises but how sure are you that the promise will be fulfilled. I will give you #5000 on Monday, how sure are you that the money will come in on Monday? Promises and assumption has caused alot of people there job, imagine leaving your recent job because a friend promise to get you a better job. This may even cause someone his/her life if one base most of his/her lifestyle on promises and assumption. I could remember when one of my friend put himself into serious debt believing he has already won a huge money from gambling. This was some year ago, match between Besiktas and Benfica. It was the last game of my friend's ticket. After 3 goal ahead by Benfica in the first half, he believed the game was over and Befica has won. He called us to celebrate. We started drinking and eating at a bar to celebrate this. After the end of the game, we were shocked as the game ended up in draw with 3- 3. This landed my friend into serious debt that took him some weeks to pay. Similar stuff happened to me when I spend my finance school fee believing my salary will be paid in two days time but was shocked after the salary was prosponed due to some reasons. The school fee was needed urgently and this put me into serious issues but thanks to my friends who bailed me out. This same issue has happened to us once or twice in our journey of life. Economically, this can affect our business. I have #300,000 to start a business. My Uncle promise to give me #200,000 to add to the business. Therefore,I made a plan of #500,000 for the biz. It was an agro business (livestock farming- piggery) so I start the business with my own capital. I acquire a portion of land and make some structures with all the #300,000 I have believing I will stock the farm with livestock with the money my Uncle promise me. This was a serious shock when my Uncle come up with stories and couldn't fulfill his promise. This render my plans useless. Remember I could have start the business with the #300,000 I have alone although in a smaller form. I have to get loan to balance up with this. If not for the loan my plans would have been highly be affected. It's better for one to learn how to  plan on money at hand and not on promises and assumption.",

However @stompix you made a very good point because scanning through the forum there were several post that says about same topic, maybe is the right time they starts using the search option for their topics to know if actually same topics have been raised.",

When it comes to money, promises and assumptions shouldn't be tolerated as they can assure you that they could pay you in right given day. Even if the one is asking is part of your family like your sibling. We always have instinct that he/she might not pay you after lending them money. If you have that mindset when it comes to lending money then don't do it, since it's your instinct that dictate that they might not pay you. Plus remember their situation like if they could actually pay you like his payroll is coming up. Then it could count as a proof for them to pay you. If you're are introvert and awkward in socializing it would be possible for you to not ask them for their debt from you which is not be tolerated for me. You borrowed money of course you'll return it.",

Plus remember their situation like if they could actually pay you like his payroll is coming up. Then it could count as a proof for them to pay you. That's true in business relationships because we can't tolerate anything to do with money owed even if it's family. Business will fall apart if it is mixed with family relationships. I have experienced this problem because I thought helping the family was an obligation so that in the end their debts piled up and could no longer be paid.Whereas we have to increase capital to cover their debts and in the end the business we run will be destroyed without anything left. The business concept sometimes has to be cruel, where the portion of assistance to family, relatives and friends must be separated, unless our business strength has reached the stage of success and has many branches.Quote from: Lorence.xD on April 22, 2023, 03:23:33 PMIf you're are introvert and awkward in socializing it would be possible for you to not ask them for their debt from you which is not be tolerated for me. You borrowed money of course you'll return it.Money debts are mandatory in nature and there is no reason not to pay them off, even if it is to family, relatives or friends. This area will usually be gray when it comes to family and most people will end up badly in family relationships. It is better when you decide to give money, it is a gift, not a debt, so that there are no reciprocal obligations from the giver or recipient and the amount can also be adjusted according to our abilities.",

As I grow older, I get to find out that not all promises made to people are meant to be fulfilled. Some people make promises just to make you feel good without the motive of fulfilling them. So because of that, I tried to tell people around me to learn first how they can live without the assumption of someone's promises beforehand.",

Why should any individual be living on promises and assumptions when we know everyone can disappoint you at any point. Sometimes the disappointment can be intentional or due to situations not under their control. For example someone can promise you a job but later on, the job is no longer available because someone has given the job to another person and it might be his manager or a superior in the office that gave the job out.We have to learn to only spend money we have at hand, it's okay to plan for money you're expecting but that should just be only plans and not spending it when it hasn't arrived. When you plan it helps you to spend wisely but never have an assurance on something that isn't in your possession yet",

There are situations that make it feel like you've already secured a win, but celebrating too early will lead to great heartbreak. There's an example in the gambling section of someone who placed a million dollar bet at 1.01 (odds the represent the player is extremely likely to win) and who ended up losing, so it could be a lot worse. The real moral is that even sure fire predictions can lead to major upsets, at least if you're doing something like buying shares in companies you have many opportunities to cash out on the way down, whereas gambling tends to be completely binary (you either win or lose immediately at the outcome).",

Work hard and work smart for your money: Most times having your own momey and practicing financial prudence through hardwork and smart work  is far better than waiting on someone else because you will be their mercy.3. Focus on what is in your control: Like your friend who went into gambling. Avoid it. You can't control that outcome.
