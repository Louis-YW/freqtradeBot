  "content": "Ever since I joined this forum, I have read so many topics of forum members introducing bitcoin to people around them for the fast growth of bitcoin adoption. I saw that there are some people that are missing from this great innovation and this set of people can be the leaders of tomorrow, and this are the orphans in the orphanage homes. This kept me wondering that how will these orphans also have bitcoin knowledge and maybe they can also be part of the bitcoin community in future. If they know the basic of bitcoin from now, as time passes on they might pick interest to know more about bitcoin, since bitcoin will soon be the talk of the town everywhere you go.I went on charity work to the Diasy orphanage home in my LGA today which happens to be my birthday to present them with gifts and food items, and I Â used this opportunity to introduce bitcoin to them, telling them that all I brought to them was gotten through bitcoin. Today is my first time to celebrate my birthday with orphans and as you can see I am in Diasy orphanage home to put smiles on the face of the orphans because this is the season to show love to people around us. I have introduced bitcoin to these lovely children after I presented the gifts to them. Mrs Inita Amaduwgu is the owner of the orphanage home and she was happy with the introduction of bitcoin to the orphans and her workers. She said that she will create time for me to come back and teach her workers, when the children have gone to school, so that they can also teach the children at their own convenient time. I gave gave them a cartoon video on bitcoin so that the younger children will not be left out.I feel very excited and have this joy in me for what I did today, and I said let me share it with you all. I thank the Almighty God for giving me the grace be plus one today.My thanks goes to julierz12 and [banned mixer] team for giving me the opportunity to work with them, because it was the money from my signature campaign that I used to buy those gifts. I also give thanks to all forum members who have motivated me in one way or the other. I wish you all a merry Xmas and a Happy New year in advance.[img width=]https://talkimg.com/images/2023/12/18/EOAIc.jpeg[/img]",

And another thing is that you adapt Bitcoin directly to a large number of people. They may have established a near future and may be interested in Bitcoin. I appreciate this initiative. Most likely, crypto currency is legal in your jurisdiction; hence, you adapt Bitcoin. I wish to do something like this, to be honest. But I am hopeless that my government has declared illegal any activities related to cryptocurrency. So I can't adapt Bitcoin publicly, though I can adapt it with friends and family. Good luck to you!",

I have seen it on this forum many times, activities that trigger us to emulate. Not being able to afford it on a large scale, at least I might only be able to do it with a small family. From what you have shown, Bitcointalk is a bridge for you to do this good and I am very happy to see it. An orphanage is the right place for your goals.The more you make them smile at your kindness, the more your income will multiply in unexpected ways. Giving doesn't have to wait for you to get rich, right? that's the poin here.",

There are lots of us here who are also generous in giving but doesn't like sharing here so it wouldn't be like a competition or just like people are using that method to attract merits, like few days I emptied my drawer and give out most of my expensive shoes and clothes to them just to show love to my fellow woman.I do this not because those clothes and shoes is old or not okay for me to use them but no, I basically selected them out to give those ladies I saw around my street because there's no reason I will have hundreds of pair of shoes and lots of clothes inside my Waldrop and my fellow women will walk on bare foot. We talks about love but most of us don't practice it instead they prefer selling them out to people than give or buy for them.Usually I love to have posted them but feels it wasn't necessary to start displaying every single items shared to people or given to people just to come show to forum about what we give or not, I didn't say you've done wrong any but I want to commend you on the good thing you have done and may you continue doing it. Our God will see you through.",

As this will ignite in them the spirit of wanting to know more about this Bitcoin you just introduced them to this day. Hence, I wish you all the best, as you strive to encourage those in need at your locality.",

I think I should let you know that we are birthday buddies, and, to be honest with you, I did mine, and I chose not to make it public as I have decided to do it within my capacity to avoid publicity as I used to do back then. It is a thing of joy to take up such a task as putting food on the tables of people you know nothing about. This has always been my plan for a long time, and this year the resources availed itself, and I made good use of the opportunity. I choose not to make things of this nature public anymore because I believe everyone gets their rewards based on their input, and I see it as not necessary to make them public.I will commend you for your good work, mate. It is nice that you took this step at this time when things are very difficult. I was having that thought too, but I had to summon up the courage to accomplish the task, and it was a task worth it. I am glad they were happy as I left them today, and I believe you too were fulfilled with your task today.Merry Christmas to you too!",

And definitely it's good to also introduce bitcoin to orphans as it is for everyone.Who knows, maybe one day, those orphans might find someone who will adopt them permanently and perhaps get a good life, be educated and then didn't forget when you came to their orphanage and introduce bitcoin and someone struck in their minds. So in the future, learn about it and then become a investors and make them financially grow and have a good life.",

Not only you have achieved your goal in going to that orphanage, but you have also inspired the children around you to get to know more bitcoin not only because it's necessary but because the future of these kids might rely on bitcoin. Most probably, these kids have find it hard to understand bitcoin at first but if you can teach them at a consistent basis, I mean by visiting them again the next time you're available, then you can expect that they will meet satisfaction learning about bitcoin and its future.Promotion of bitcoin should definitely start on the younger minds of children simply because they are keen observers and good listeners. Once they have absorbed that, then they will continue to bring up that knowledge in every stages of their growth and development.",

It takes dedication to help people and share your knowledge with them, and you did a good job on how you introduced them to the concept of bitcoin. I'm sure they listen to you as you also give them a gift that is very valuable to them. Now that you've introduced them to bitcoin, I hope some will be interested and will ask for your help or guidance on how they can start with this field, and from your nature, I think you are willing to teach them. It will be great if many young generations will have an idea of what bitcoin or crypto currency is so that they will have an option on how they will survive this world. As they are orphans, they will learn to earn by themselves, which is a very good development for them and for the community.The only problem I see is the resources. I hope they will have a device and access to the internet so they can explore more about this field of crypto currency, or bitcoin, because you are not there all the time, so they also need to explore. Anyway, we are grateful for your act of service and contribution to spreading the word about bitcoin.",

It will motivate the others who are yet to do this and it will be for posterity.Â  You did a basic intro to bitcoin and conveyed your message to the kids in the most appropriate and enjoyable manner - cartoon. I love cartoon while I was a kid and even now as an adult. You have sown a seed in their hearts. There are some challenges that you may face along the way if you want to go further in this bitcoin education with the staff of the orphanage which may be:time constraint - the staff will always be busy with the kids. Even when they go to school, there are still toddlers who will demand for their attention. Most of these organization to the best of my knowledge are understaffed. I therefore don't know how they will squeeze out time for it.Financial challenge -Â  The reality on ground is that they may want to have physical money than have bitcoin that takes a long time before its yields a good return.Educational level - I do not know the education level of these staff, but I know that most of them may not be college graduates. How will they understand the other concepts if you delve deeper into it?",
