Most of the gamblers does the same thing when they fall into the trap of the greed because their logical mind will stop functioning when it falls into the control of the greed. If you had control over your greed then you would never lose anything at all.The thing that prevented me from winning big was also greed because that emotions is very powerful that having control over it mostly in gambling is close to impossible. I also made many mistakes in gambling due to my greed, and some of those mistakes caused me huge losses as a result.",

I have friends that have told me that several times and it is happening to me too.The one that was very painful for me was when I accumulated more than 10 odds with 8 matches. All matches played that day except one which is Sao Paulo versus another club in Seria A (Brazil). I have forgotten the second club but it was a small club to Sao Paulo at the time. It has the smallest odds which is 1.01 odds or so for over 0.5. No goal scored in the match and I lost the match. There has been many like that which I have lost. But that is just gambling. As for me, I do not cash out, I prefer all the match to be played. Even while gambling on in-play matches, I may prefer to stop watching the match rather than to cash out. After the match has been played finish, I will check the score.",

For example playing in a casino game luck gives us big wins but ambition drives us to keep betting bigger (even though ideally we can get out of the casino and take those wins well).With your case, the difference is that the casino offers are made directly, while the winning offers in the game of luck that I received are offered indirectly.So far, common mistakes like the one above must have been experienced by all gamblers of any type because they involve the ambition to achieve bigger wins.",

Failed to take profit when we have the opportunity instead we continue to play to earn more which result to lose. In your case that you are playing in parlay, I think waiting for the last 2 game is not bad decision since the return is high for just a few match left. You are just in bad luck for the result to not go your way.",

I have missed out on many wins and some of them were because of greed, I remember a time I participated in a predictions contest where you have to guess the exact score of a match and in this competition you're allowed to predict for as many matches as you can and the more you predict the higher your wins are. And the minimum was predict three games score. I thought of giving it a try since I'm not involving my money and at first I predicted for 5 games but when I Saw that my payout was still growing the more I predicted I kept it going and did a total of 9 and when I checked the result the first six predictions were correct but the last ones cut my game, and it's not like a bookie were I can cash out my games before the result cut the game. I did lose a pretty amount of money due to that mistake and also learned from it.",

Gambling is luck. To cash out $200 or to win 1200, that is small. Cash out is done by the gambling sites in a way it would discourage a gambler to go for it. But if all the games have been won but remaining one, I think the cash out supposed to be more than that in amount.Quote from: kamvreto on July 19, 2023, 01:45:40 PMI am not specific in gambling, I only play slot games and some sportsbet when I need entertainment.

If you do not stake too much but stake what you can afford to lose, you will not think about losses. It is possible that any match can make a gambler to lose. It may just be only one game that make the gambler to lose. That is just sport gambling.Some people will say that they can make some prediction accurately, but that is not true. Any club can win any club at anytime. Gambling is gambling and it is very risky.",

So I don't see anything wrong with your move, for me, you made the right decision and you should stand by it.Otherwise, you will have regrets and again, it might not be good for you in the long run. Just move on the next day and bet and then see how it goes for you. Don't be bothered by it, just live another day.",

Betting recklessly is very easy when you are already in profit compared when you are still on the process of getting profit because you consider your money as disposable since you only just earn it and not part of your original bankroll.This way you can easily bet higher than your normal bets just to chase loss. I'm always experiencing this scenario until now even though I'm very aware on this particular mistakes of mine. My human nature of committing errors despite that I know what's right keeps haunting on my gambling.",

Cash out is a very good opportunity to win in sports betting especially football. I believe 5 years back the system had not been introduced and that caused many bettors losses and I also noticed that more people are betting now because of one or two advantages on the side of the gambler like cash out and betting while the game had already started. We should learn to take that kind of opportunity to cash when it present itself.",

The mistake that most of the gamblers make, is that they have no plan and they do not know how much they can risk in each game.Money management is important in gambling as it will not only help you retain your profits but at the same time it will help you to minimize the loss. Emotions won't come into play if we strictly follow money management principles.",
