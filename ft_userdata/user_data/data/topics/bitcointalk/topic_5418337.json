Such networks sometimes get their IP address reassigned by the ISP.Can you check whether your external IP address has changed?Otherwise, I generally recommend against port forwarding and for Tor tunneling instead. Sparrow has built-in Tor support, so you just need to install tor on the node machine and tunnel the Bitcoin port through it.Something like this (change port number and hidden service name):Quote from: n0nce on June 08, 2022, 01:55:51 AM[5] Log back out into your sudo account, and open the Tor config file.Code:exitsudo nano /etc/tor/torrc[6] Add the following contents, preferably in the right section (somewhere where there's HiddenServiceDir stuff commented out).Code:HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/electrs_hidden_service/HiddenServiceVersion 3HiddenServicePort 50001 127.0.0.1:50001ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed[7] Start up Tor and fetch your electrs Tor hostname.

That's why I'm wondering that your setup ever worked in the first place.I'd recommend to install electrs and tunnel it through Tor as described above, for better security.",

Configure DHCP (which already suggested) and make sure you entered correct local IP of your node on your sparrow wallet.2. Check firewall configuration on both device. There's rare case where Windows Firewall broken or it's rule changed after Windows update.Yes same LAN network. I configured the DHCP on the node PC. The local ip's are correct according to my router. The WAN ip is changing though. The firewall has allowances for both Bitcoin core and sparrow. Do I need do more indepth config than just the \"add program\" option? I also just tried installing sparrow on the node PC and it won't connect to node either.",

Especially with a spinning drive, in my experience, a harsh shutdown / power cut, doesn't leave the system enough time to write everything to disk and corrupts your blockchain data.Bitcoin Core can't recover from that by itself and will give you an error log on the next startup. You will need to reindex the whole blockchain to fix this.Without Bitcoin Core starting properly, obviously there's no way for Sparrow to connect to it.",

So strange. My only guess is that because bitcoin core didn't shutdown properly it's causing some issue. Am I just going to have to reinstall bitcoin core everytime my pc shuts down abruptly? If the issue only a corrupted file brought by the abrupt shutdown and only in Bitcoin Core, then --reindex might solve the issue.It's a command-line option and not a command so; to use it, Bitcoin Core should be started with that parameter (instructions).Ran the reindex but sparrow still wouldn't connect. Also tried rescan also with no luck. I was able to get sparrow to connect again by deleting the sparrow wallet folder in Bitcoin core.C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin/wallet/sparrowAfter deleting that and restarting Bitcoin core sparrow is connected again. I've also ordered an ups battery backup to run the node and router/modem off of so hopefully this problem is resolved now.",

Also tried rescan also with no luck. I was able to get sparrow to connect again by deleting the sparrow wallet folder in Bitcoin core.I tried to reproduce this by purposely corrupting the wallet.dat inside \"bitcoin/wallets/sparrow\" folder and it indeed failed to connect.Got this line in sparrow's log file:Code:...JSON-RPC error: RPC error response: RpcError { code: -4, message: \"Wallet file verification failed. \\\"M:\\\\Bitcoin\\\\wallets\\\\sparrow\\\\wallet.dat\\\" corrupt.Try using the wallet tool bitcoin-wallet to salvage or restoring a backup.\", data: None }So, it appears that sparrow is reliant to a mirrored watching-only wallet.dat file in Bitcoin Core.But that doesn't mean that your block index/chainstate wasn't corrupted by the abrupt shutdown as well (it's fixed by reindex).Anyway, since the core issue is the frequent power loss, then a UPS with big backup battery is indeed the best solution.",
