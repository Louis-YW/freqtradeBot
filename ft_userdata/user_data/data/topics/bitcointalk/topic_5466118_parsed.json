Currently, there are two wallets that support P2TR and multi-sig but I am afraid none of them are going to be useful in this case cause these two come only with a subscription so it is going to cost a few hundred bucks a year.Nunchuk*Muun wallet*Quote from: Yamane_Keto on September 08, 2023, 01:49:26 PMYesterday we were talking about how multisig transaction fees can be extremely low using P2TRYeah, you are right with P2TR (Pay to Taproot) multi-sig the size of the transaction will be almost half that of size P2WSH (Pay to Witness Script Hash) transactions but still it may take a while for the wallet developers to come up with stable version which supports P2TR multisig.",

The difference with native segwit (Bech32) in terms of transaction fee is not that much In fact. The only place it edges segwit is when there is many inputs compare to outputs. You can check here to see wallets that fully support P2TR because most of the wallets on your quote do not fully support both sending and receiving using it. For multi sig try to check the Nunchuk",

So this would depend on the wallet you are connecting it to. As far as I know, Sparrow wallet is still the best or one of the best wallets that you can use with Passport hardware wallet but it is not have pay-to-taproot for multisig purpose.I have made research on SPV wallets that I can use as multisig pay-to-taproot but I found none. It would have been the wallet that I would have been using by now.I think there is something off about P2TR multisig wallet. People would have preferred it as their choice for multisig wallet but no SPV wallet that is supporting it, or none that I know of.",
