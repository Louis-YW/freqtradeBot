So yes it's possible to increase the fees day by day but I also think it will also not sustain all the time in network.And I will also say the that yes it is possible to whale make some impact on network intentionally but he will also can't take it for long-last may be for the short period.",

This suggests that, like Ordinals, the Runes protocol could be a boon to Bitcoin’s burgeoning fee economy.Unedited  directly  from https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/20/runes-protocol-launches-on-bitcoin-sending-fees-soaring-as-users-rush-to-mint-tokens/Probably  you're wondering why the spike there is your answer although the the halving is over and I don't think there's  anyone trying  to squeeze it's transactions  into the block anylongerThen spammers  on the other hand try to make things spike .Quote from: The Cryptovator on April 21, 2024, 08:01:38 PM On the other hand, since block rewards have decreased, transaction fees would go a bit higher as well.

Yeah this could be some couple of dust transactions which will set a very high priority of fee and this could be more advantage to miners... so miners could be at this too",

Yesterday I tried executing a transaction  worth $25 for a an urgent request, couldn't believe it when I saw the tx fees for it was $21 as charged. I had to abandon it and go for another alternative to satisfy that request. I checked again today and discovered the fees  has dropped, so yea, it's possible it won't even get up to a week or more before the fees drops to normal. Peradventure the fees doesn't normalize within the shortest time then it should be understood that there may be miners manipulation involved to rake profits to their side using the halving as a wash-up excuse.",

That thing is named as runes by the developers, and the rune creators are spending huge amounts to get their runes minted so they can make more profits as early adopters of it.Runes are just like meme coins on Bitcoin network and if they continue popping like that then they may create more network congestion in coming days.If the hype of runes get reduced then we may see low transaction fees once again and till then we will have to cope with those fees as part of Bitcoin community.",

Of course, the Meme, Ordinal, Rune networks located on the Blockchain provide high benefits. You need to remember that Ordi is widely traded, the fees increase tremendously. Many even propose to remove tokenized tokens that ride on the Blockchain network. Although it has now gone down, this position is still quite expensive. Even after Ordinal was quiet I could still enjoy an 11sat/vB fee to send 0.1BTC.  I think there will be a time when fees will return to normal, you just need to seize the moment when transactions are not so congested.Quote from: khalidkhan82118 on April 22, 2024, 10:01:21 AMLayer 2 solutions like Lightning Network aim to alleviate congestion. While fees fluctuate based on network conditions, advancements and protocol upgrades may address scalability issues in the long term, potentially reducing fees and enhancing Bitcoin's efficiency.The Lightning network has not been effective enough to facilitate large transactions. So I think it can't be the best solution yet.

Right, it's only good for smaller transactions.@OP, you're right and it's about the same thing as brc20 and those nfts that are built on the Bitcoin blockchain. They're the ones causing these high fees.But compared to a few days ago, the fees were higher that time than of today. It's a common issue when the network has been clogged or spammed but eventually, we'll see the fees to drop soon.",

That will certainly also lead to higher transaction fees. Slow transaction confirmation times and non-scalable blocks are bitcoin's weaknesses, and it's not something new. Bitcoin is not perfect and we need to accept that fact, do not stubbornly think that bitcoin is so perfect that it has no disadvantages. If the developers don't come up with any solution to fix this, you'll see bitcoin transaction fees go even higher than they are now in the coming years as trading volume increases.",

I heard this last year when ORDI was first introduced and things just calmed down for a short while and now we are facing network congestion and increased transaction fees just because of RUNE. Is there any guarantee that after these RUNE spammers are the last and when they are gone, we will have no more spammers created?
