We must consider a fact that supply will be less than 21M bitcoins because many people lost their bitcoins and there will be more such people, more lost bitcoins in future.Bigger demand, higher trading volume, higher price over time. I mean I am looking at fundamentals to explain it.",

      "body": "In short, it is still supply and demand, if there is more demand for Bitcoin and more people are buying than they are selling, then the price of Bitcoin is going to rise, but if it is the reverse and there are more sellers than buyers, price is going to drop.Having said that, what influences people to either buy or sell is mostly external factors, for example if people read a positive news about Bitcoin, this can make them buy more Bitcoin, but if the news is negative, they might panic and sell. Mind you that even if you have a particular indicator, it might not always be accurate, though there are some obvious reasons/factors like halving that can make Bitcoin price to rise.",

      "body": "Thanks both.I was maybe not clear enough in my initial post. In the long run supply / demand and factors driving it e.g.  prices of other commodities or other markets, overall market sentiment etc. is clear. This of course to large degree translate to daily prices ranges however I'd like to understand factors impacting hourly and daily prices of Perpetual market pairs other then mentioned above.Let consider TP/SL.For instance if  there is large quantity of positions in Long and market is going up - potentially if Take Profit is triggered on all of them then the Sell orders are triggered which will bring the price down (how much down would depend on to volume) but this would be somehow misleading signal. Same in opposite direction. Large quantity of Shorts triggering TP would trigger Buy which will push market up. Are there indicators showing number of TP/SL on BTC ? Maybe some other such factors driving hourly prices?ThanksM",

What I'm talking about in particular is not external factors e.g. Economy news, FED moves etc. but more like technical analyses and indicators that would help understand if e.g. recent decrease was because of Long positions selling or entering short positions etc.  ThanksMI mean the price of Bitcoin depends on the supply and depend on Bitcoin, if there is a lot of supply and very low demand the price is going to drop and vice versa the price is going to increase. I mean even though we know this thing there are still a lot of things that are affecting the market price of Bitcoin so there is no way that you could accurately predict the movement of the market, there are some signals that you could follow but it is still not accurate and it wasn't always right, I mean if there are ways to accurately predict the market probably we are all already rich on trading, or the market is not going to exist anymore because on the market there are a few winners and many losers, there are always losers and they are the one who loses money.You could just do some analysis for your prediction, the trick here is to always be updated on the cryptocurrency space, like good and bad news in the market because that is just what creates movement. Analyze the past timelines and charts etc, and you could probably predict the market and create a good profit.",

      "body": "Op if you are a trader, you will know that the bitcoin market or price is unpredictable but we all use guess work to scale through. I am still studying the indicators of BTC and other cryptocurrencies in the trading platforms. Since I lost over $500 in my last trade. I started using this \"Relative Strength Index (RSI)\" indicator but the indicator is not friendly with me. So I gave up for now. On the trading platforms, the movement of bitcoin is unpredictable, you might think that it will go up in the next movement of the market and you trade upward, and that is when it will come down to the dip and you loss everything in the trade. I don't advise beginners to trade unless the person is very good in trading indicators.",

There's no way that we could be able to detect out that there would be a sell off on that particular point considering that most traders do share up on the same technical analysis on which if we do see that the next movement might be on long position then majority of us would be following but to know that this market is really that prone to manipulation then whales could easily fucked up those positions without a sweat on making some counter trend kind of movement on which it would really be liquidating those positions on which this isnt somehting new and those movements might really have that some tied up with some sudden fundamentals or news or doesnt really have any reason at all.This market is simply that unpredictable, no matter how hard you do make out making out some analysis whether on technical or fundamental.It wont really be giving out that assurancethat the price of this market would really be getting in line with those indicators.",
