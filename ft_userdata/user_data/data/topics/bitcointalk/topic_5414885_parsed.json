It is the distinction between a human and a pet or wild animal in the bush. Besides, it also makes one civilized and exposed to the world, it is the precipice on which current world technological advancement is certain. Going entrepreneurial these days also require some level of education at the most, else, scammers or fraudsters might take advantage of ones ignorance to reap where they didn't sow.",

What must be changed is that the education curriculum in schools does not only focus on knowledge that is not relevant to the world of work in the future but also teach skills.",

I think we're currently dealing with many millennial generation doesn't want to work if they got low salary since they think they can get better job with better payment.Education doesn't even represent the real job because it's almost different, if your purpose to school is to get job, then it's already a wrong mindset.",

High educations is not a guarantee of a successful life, good job either. Education is put on a flow. Students study with same old books (they might be looking fresh, but the material given there is same as it was 20-30 years ago). Try to remember any of your teachers - they dont look young or modern. They teach same what they has been taught, while the world around has gone far away in development. An example, what can a kid get as an education, when we live in gadget and digital world, while in most countries on computer science lessons kids learn MS Word and MS Excel for two semesters. And in the university they surely study MS Access and basic MS Excel formulas as a part of bookkeeping and financial analysis for example.",

It actually factors in more than your skill, which includes your social capability as well as knowledge on knowing how to find jobs that are well paid. Education is like a single pillar that you build, but there's a lot of self-study/research that you have to do to build the other pillars. Heck you can build the education pillar part yourself given enough time imo. I think the biggest thing education gives you is a certification that you went to one, and that's it. It sets a certain criteria of what to expect from you so companies hiring can easily see what you can and can't bring, letting them make an easy jdugement of your capabilities.",

When it comes to education, all the elements in every success for us must always be graduates who are highly educated with certificates in order to get a job. That way it will sound like a failure, but that doesn't mean education in formal schools is considered unimportant. What is the meaning of a certificate today when everyone can access knowledge for free. I will not blame the unemployment status if the government opens vacancies according to its capacity. Most of these days the government opens job vacancies with the condition that they must be certified, but look at India, a country whose education level is not even due to a high population but behind not having school certificates, many extraordinary skills. Big companies in the world will have Indians in them.Back in essence education there will be a curriculum. Now, this is the point of adjustment that the government must pay attention to. Curriculum 4.0 towards the digitalization era. Unfortunately, there are still countries that focus on 3 aspects and the cognitive aspect is always prioritized. Meanwhile, at this time the skills that are included in the psychomotor aspect are not developed. As a result, many unemployed university graduates understand the theory but are not accompanied by qualified skills.",

What we lack are per capita numbers to put everything into perspective. Are there more millionaires and billionaires being produced today as a proportion of global population, than we had in previous eras. I think the authentic numbers would surprise people. The united states exhibited greater than 10% economic growth for many years during manifest destiny and the expansionist era. Which could coincide with high wealth production.Education today is more cultural than systemic with information being so easily accessible and available. I think the main difference separating the current era from past eras is education and knowledge used to be considered cultural artifacts of high social status as a past tense. A person who was a badass in past eras was someone who could speak 8 languages who had a specialized skillset that was difficult to obtain. Today, a badass is considered to be someone who is a thug and petty thief. Our cultural values and ideology has shifted. That's the biggest force behind any regressive movement as far as education goes.",

And as time shows that the initial level of education, this period from 7 years to 17 gives only general education, in no case related to professions. This is followed by several more years of study, which is a six-year period where a person must obtain a profession. Do all countries act this way? And with the very initial education, it is necessary to motivate and educate children to a correct understanding of life, namely, that nothing in the world will be given for free, and in order to make your life successful, you must study diligently and adhere to all moral principles. A person who enters life with a higher education has a much better chance of getting a good job than someone who only went to school to pass the time. It has always been.

If a society is so full of corruption along with high degrees of absolute poverty, it requires a totally monumental effort to elevate it to the next stage. China has been able to achieve it somewhat, but the first couple decades were undoubtedly rough for the workers in the factories.
