  "content": "Hi everyone,I'm thinking running a hosting facility as I have access to very cheap elec (1cts $/KWH). I have approx 2MW available now and probably more, elec is from grid. I have a 800m² hangar nearby the transformer + 3000m² open air secured property.I was wondering what is the best option. Should I run couple of \"ready to go\" mining containers  or is it better for me to set up the hangar as a mining place and run the miners inside the hangar?Also 2MW is approx 650 S19 miners. Do you guys have an idea how many staff 650 Asic require in terms of basic hosting?Last but not least, what SaaS/app a mining facility is using for their client to monitore the miners?Many thanks for your feedback,L",

      "body": "The staff issue is actually a big one.You will find it difficult to find trustworthy people to run the mining facility.Mining is all about generating money, so most people have few qualms about getting a hold of some of that ...One simple example (that I've seen) is the staff redirecting some of the miners to their own mining accounts.Another is using the power with their own miners.Another is staff getting (illegal) kickbacks from ViaBTC to have miners on ViaBTC.Another is staff (unnecessarily) given access to the pool mining accounts and fudging things there.Generally you need to lock down the network in your facility and limit access both ways - to the miner and from the miner.Of course you also need the usual firewall stopping all remote access to miners.You also need a mining account that gives different owner vs staff level access to the mining data and account.There are of course various ways to handle this.",

Does 0.8x used to consider PSU efficiency?24/7/365 power use means you have to derate the power by a factor of .8this is to prevent wires from melting.So if he has 2000 kwatts or 2 megawatts in transformer rating x 80% gives the  proper safety factor of 1600 kwatts or 1.6 mwso 1600/3 = 533 s19 units doing 3 kwatts each.As for proper staffing a lot depends on the op and his or her knowledge of mining.500 units  can be done on 2 routers  each with 1 pc and 250 miners.  this means 2 internet lines.  which is a decent idea for redundancy.500 x 100 = 50ph hash or50000th hash50000 x .071= 3550 usd a day.as for fear of viabtc and referral misuse,  here is my viabtc referralhttps://www.viabtc.com/signup?refer=680499simply join viabtc with that referral and I get a piece of  the fees viabtc is collecting.  you the miner do not pay extra.so obviously this means by working with 1 outsider you have a record of your miners since the outsider gets the hash rate number and th referral fee.so at no cost to you you get a free check on your hashrate by some one you trust.it does not have to be my referral .So if he opens an account with 250 miners. doing 25ph from 1 router he can glance at his viabtc stats on his account and he can check with the person that has his referral to see if it matches.To be honest. this gear needs very little hands on work.depending on filters and your dirty air or clean air. Maybe a 60 to 120 day clean out schedule .500 machines at 10 minutes a machine is 5000 minutes of work. that is 80-90 hours every 2-4 months.10 minutes to check that gear is running say 4 times a day. is 40 minutes a day. 1200 minutes = 20 hoursthen trouble shooting the bad gear. maybe 1 day a month = 8 so 100 hours a month of work is about right.Of course access to a good repair guy = neededfuzzy beat me to it as I wanted to address the fraud issue.",
