  "content": "When looking through order page, was surprised i had 2 options for shipping as there is fedex or DHL.  Both are courier.  When did ledger ship devices to the US with fedex?  Recall years ago, they ship it DHL and only that.  On their website, they say DHL or colissimo... no idea what that is but i assume its for france?  So if you are not in france, it has to be courier?Anyone in the US can confirm they received their device via fedex?  Always thought it was only DHL. Also do they require you to sign for it or they just drop it at your door or mailbox?",
