  "content": "I was honestly shocked after seeing an old posting thread about a secret question that apparently shouldn't be used to recover our account if we forgot our account password. because it will result in our account being locked.this is the thread i mean :https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1206977.msg12670918#msg12670918 (PSA: ACCOUNTS WILL BE LOCKED IF THE SECRET QUESTION IS USED TO RECOVER IT)But since it's an old thread or announcement. so I also have a question whether this still applies to now?because some time ago I still have a secret question in my account. after reading the thread. finally I decided to delete my secret question.because I don't want my account to be locked in case I ever forget my password and I'm worried about using a secret question to reset it. or I also don't want anyone else trying to hack my account using it. although I'm pretty sure no one will be able to guess the answer to my secret question. because it's really an answer that only I personally know.But is it still the same now, that is, our account will be locked if we try to recover our account using a secret question?and if still the same. then wouldn't this issue be better pinned or kept in the FAQ? so that more beginners know about it. Thank you in advance",

And besides, why do you need to use a secret phrase when resetting your account password? Where you can use the email option, this applies when your account is hacked. Also I think this option of secret question provides another level on security so I don't think there is any need to delete it.Moreover, if your account gets locked as a result of using this option, you can easily get the account in your hands through sign a message by any of your previously used wallets. However, the only problem is, in this case, is sometimes there may be a delay in getting your account.",

But if you don't want to bother, then don't use secret questions when you lose your password.The best advice for you perhaps, is:1. Use a strong password to prevent hacking.2. Store your passwords securely (perhaps on a separate device) and don't save them in your browser if your device is frequently accessed by other people.3. Have a strong email password, make sure you keep your email active and you can reset password with this option.",

I thank you OP for bringing up this topic. and it seems I have to be more careful with the email that I have in order to stay active. because if my account will be locked if using security/secret question. then I think it will be quite troublesome. so it's better for me to keep my password in mind. and keep my email active. because after knowing this then of course I will not use security/secret questions.",
