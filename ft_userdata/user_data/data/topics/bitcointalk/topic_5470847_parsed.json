Trust it's as a result of the effect of what you did, because redtrust is not given that way from some information I have read so far about red trust. If you had any issues with anyone I think is something you need to sort out amicably with them except is something that involves scam which is possibly will not end of giving someone a redtag knowing too well that is scam associated.",

If you ask me it's a very insecure behavior. \"Don't you dare to challenge me and if you do i give you negative feedback!\"It reminds me of my self......................When I was six and an extreme insecure kid, lucky for me I did grow up and matured.

For whatever reason I didn't notice digaran back then, but now I find his takes for the most part humorous and not overly annoying. Let's break down 1miau's trust rating on him:Quotedigaran is a proven troll. This much is true but this in itself is not a good reason to red tag somebody. Many (most?) of us that have been around for a while have been a troll in some capacity or another, at least briefly.QuoteHe is known for spreading lies, repeatedly harassing forum (DT) members + stirring shit (msg63185119)I'm not sure about the \"spreading lies\" part, would need a clearer example than what is referenced in the trust rating. As far as harassing DT members is concerned, yes I believe that would constitute a negative, but only if they are being harassed about DT-related matters. \"Stirring shit\" is definitely more neutral rating territory.Quoteand he's known for his past shady dealings. Not to be trusted.Well the asking money for negative rating removal was certainly a faux pas, but again it was 5 years ago and I don't think another negative is warranted.",

Had digaran not disagreed with 1miau on a political subject, that rating would not be there, 1miau can lie all he wants about it but it is crystal clear.",

Who are you to decide that? And once again, you are spreading unproven accusations because I'm well aware of the wrongdoings of digaran. As I've said I gave him a pass way earlier because trolls are a waste of time. But with your accusation, that I wouldn't have read about the issue, you are once again engaging in pure speculations. Not the first time, where you've run out of arguments and instead of proof, you are trying to push your weak and unproven accusations like \"might\", \"could\" or \"probably\". What a weak Clown Show from you but I didn't expect anything else from you. Truly disappointing that you need to resort to such shady practice of defamation to score points here. Just disgusting.",

When this is \"his\" opinion about other people, when he uses the recent unjustifiable trust abuses against me to justify his own tag. Your negative tags are all within the limits of negative trust due to your abuse in the forum and you can be happy that you are not banned due to your massive trolling. But even plagiarizers don't get banned these days so, thats no benchmark at all. You are well aware about your abuse, still you are trolling everyone who dares to point this out. Are you surprised why no one trusts your flawed judgement here? Is everyone wrong on DT but our troll digaran is always misunderstood? And guess what? I can put you on ignore as well and don't give out ans Merit for your troll posts and thats also completely fine (or are you saying otherwise?

I even discovered that he was red tagged as early as 2016, that is, 3 months after registering on the forum.Quote from: MyBTT on August 02, 2016, 11:23:30 AMJust give up. Cryptodevil is known to give feedbacks and not take them back, no matter what. He only removes them on extreme cases which I've only ever seen one. You, having two counts from cryptodevil have no hope. At least you're not a store high rank.In spite of this he got the tag removed.If fail to sign a message from that address would somehow show that he is not the original owner of the account, as everyone does not agree to red tag for that, I think you could still add a couple of new red tags or 3 for that reason, at most, but if for example it was you tagging him for this, it would actually count as one. And I don't know what the merit is for, but I would say that if you employ someone who has 6 red tags, you won't care much if he has 8 or 9.Although, obviously, the reading I make, could be incorrect. In which case I would be grateful if someone could enlighten me about it.",

And it's visible for everyone, that you are the problem! But when we are at it, let me address this. Each DT member, who was mentioned in the post above, if you want to review the issue: The following post is my current suggestion how to solve the issue, where I've already conceded ground: Quote from: 1miau on November 22, 2023, 12:40:37 PMQuote from: digaran on November 22, 2023, 12:16:22 PM@1miau, why is it so hard for you to explain for everyone just for one time, and then go on with your life?@digaranI'm just trying to find a solution where we both can agree on. That's what LoyceV also wants us to do. We can also wait for a call that is given from 2 or 3 Top 10 or 20 DT members and both of us have to accept that. Repeated rants don't bring any solution, its just sowing discord. Another suggestion for mikeywith, where I'm ready to concede ground: Lets lock this topic until 01.01.2024 that the dust settles. You can watch my feedbacks and trust list changes until then. If you think, from now on until 01.01.2024 there would be \"abuse\" according to you, you could open this topic again, presenting evidence. The outcomes: - If the evidence is weak, DT will judge that accordingly. - If the evidence is true and DT confirms this, I'll accept further distrusts from DT members. - If there's no abuse, the topic will remain closed and we will move on. You could review my trust feedback and trust list any time, from every entry that happens from now on until then. That way, you could interfere into my DT decisions for some time. So you see, I'm ready to concede massive ground to find a solution here. I'm stepping back from the demand that any interference into my DT decisions is not acceptable. I'm stepping back from my demand. So, as I've said I'm ready to concede this massive ground to you. How about that?Any DT member voices if this is a reasonable approach are appreciated. Another approach could be just to lock the topic and if mikeywith still feels it's an issue, he can re-open it on 1st January 2024. That way, some time would pass to find a more level-headed solution as we will be able to review it with a bit distance. Then, a better solution could be found with much less drama. Happy to hear any answers. Â So, everyone can see that I'm really interested to find common ground, that we can move on and avoid this unnecessary drama. @frontiThanks for your post, I've already suggested the solution above, where I've even conceded ground.",
