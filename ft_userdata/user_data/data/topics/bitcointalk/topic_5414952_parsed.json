Marketcap is used. I just checked Coinmarketcap now to check the marketcap of ETHW, it has $120 million in marketcap. Not yet listed on many exchanges, like Binance. Probably the marketcap might still increase if other exchanges are listing it and its tokens and also if NFT market sites are accepting its NFTs.",

These days a lot of investors sold it after receiving the airdrop, but I believe it will have a great hype before its fate is decided.BCH and other bitcoin forks used to be this way, and in the end the community decided that their money is better invested on the main network instead of a fork that has a lot of issues in the community and implementations as well. ETHW's principle is kinda noble, considering that a lot of people supported this fork and maintained it until the end. Just another community divide I guess, that a lot of people are cashing in.",

This has usually happened in the past. Some exchanges are already claiming that those who held ETH on their exchange have already received ETHW. But I don't see ETHW in my wallets next to ETH yet. At the same time, there was information that there were some problems with the appearance of the ETHW fork. Can anyone tell me when ETHW will appear in our wallets?",

On exchanges, it is not your private key, it is not your coins, it is the exchanges that have the coins on blockchain, the exchanges may even decide not to give their users the forked coins, but they actually have it immediately after the fork.",

Its price still the same since, I think they are still working on more support. But it will be good to still have this ETH POW so there will still be an option for all tokens on top of ETH. It must be  trial and error for miners to find which is profitable, some are trying the RVN and ETC. If I would be mining, I'd go for Dogecoin using the alternative energy source.",
