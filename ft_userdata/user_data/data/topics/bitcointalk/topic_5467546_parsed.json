  "content": "Good day! Did you know that promotion is associated with making wise investments? While traditional investment requires capital, I have investments that are free. Yes, you heard right about free investment that can help you succeed and advance in life. But wait, before you think badly of me, let me finish reading this topic that I made.Just a disclaimer: this is only for the open-minded. I am not open-minded just for pyramid networking schemes. But open-minded to succeed. So if you are ready, you who are reading this, this topic is for you.Free Investment:1. Education: Education is not only obtained in school; it can also be obtained in our community, inside the house, on the internet, in books, among friends. There are also free platforms such as Youtube, LinkedIn, and others. In other words, you don't have to enroll in thousands of courses if you don't finish them or buy books you haven't started reading. So while you have access to free education, take advantage of it. There are even times when, when we talk to people who don't know, we learn, right? Their mistakes in life, how they act, spend, and earn Apparently, education is a continuous process; when you stop learning, that means you stop growing.2. Network: This is not the networking that others think of here. This is not inviting acquaintances or friends to scam you. What I'm saying is \"building a network.\" When you build a connection, for example, by simply helping your neighbor, it can give you or us a network because we meet different people every day. Who knows, one day or not, we know that our neighbor will help us one day so that you can have a good opportunity or job or have a good client. Even on the internet, connecting with like-minded people like us can go a long way toward your advancement.3. Time: What do you have now that older people don't have? that even if they want to do it or work more and expand their wealth, they don't have it anymore. Of course, invest your time in what will grow you and not in what will destroy your dreams. Three hours of hanging out with gossipy people is equal to 3 hours of free learning a course, or 3 hours of playing play station games is equal to 3 hours of doing a freelancing business, which is equal to value. Let's always remember that when time is wasted, you can't take advantage of it. As the saying goes, \"Time is money, time is gold, time is fleeting. And there are many other things that are equal to time. So make sure you can use the time on things that will help you grow. Time is free, but the things that equal it are not free.4. Health: This is also a free investment that we can make, whether it's physical or mental. Regular exercise and a balanced diet will give us energy and clear thinking. Let's not underestimate having a healthy mind and body, because it is one of our investments in the struggle of life. Did you know that a bedridden person prays that they can get up and do what they want in life? They regret why they didn't take care of their bodies when they were in their prime when they had the chance. So you are now able to take care of your health for a clearer future. You don't want what you're struggling with now to be eaten by others because your health can't handle it anymore.5. Cultivation or skills: you don't need to pay for training in schools or an online academy to have skills. Did you know that humans are capable of learning from the environment, what they see, what they experience, and even just their imagination? The skills that I have today I only got for free because of the different ways that we have now in this generation.6. Financial Literacy: learn about money and how it moves or circulates. And how can it be attracted? There are many resources on how we can grow our financial literacy, learn how to manage finances, use free budgeting apps, watch financial vlogs, and read vlogs about finances. And save for your goals. Actually, we don't need to pay a financial advisor because we can study it; sometimes we are led by laziness, so we prefer to pay someone else to study our personal finance. Success is not only measured in money but also in personal growth. I wish that in some other ways we discussed here may give help to others or everyone here in the forum...",

I buy my own supplements on a monthly basis since I can't get the best nutrition from just regular cooked meals. You can make it cheaper with planting your own fruits and vegetables but it still comes at a cost.All these free learnings you get from the internet are good for starters. You can be successful in your own way if you apply what you learned but you'll probably hit a plateau at some point. If you want to level up then you may have to pay someone that has achieved more success than you.",

But the Internet is a network because it connects absolutely everything. There, you can find sources with valuable information and save on your purchase. I have been on the Internet for a very long time. There is a lot here and for free; it takes time, and time, as the OP put it, is spent differently for everyone. I agree with the OP that anything you can get for free is not worth buying. Proper management of your time will definitely play in favor of a person who wants to achieve success. Healthy food: the simpler, the healthier. An important role is played by contacts with people and communications based on useful communication, which includes the exchange of knowledge while implying mutual benefit without financial expenses. I know many people who have a commercial streak, do not have any education and are very successful businessmen. The main thing is to decide one day for yourself that you are able to build yourself from scratch and not stop doing it.",

Even if a person does not study in school today, they still have a mobile device in use because it is a necessity. Even the people who live in the squatter area have those mobile devices. And most of the people who live there are people who don't study in schools.Given the fact that the purchase of a load on the internet for the mobile phone is made, there are others who connect with their friends who have a wifi connection to get free internet or even charge to get free electricity. It depends on the means by which an individual will do that, especially now that there is a social media platform like YouTube where you can see that what is taught in school can also be seen here. The only difference is that there is no diploma on YouTube; instead, in school, you get that.That means, in general, what Op may be referring to in what he is saying here.",

Time and money, you can't be buoyant of your skills until you put them to the test or work, most skills still require money to be properly put in place.We all believe that Time is free but not me, because your time starts since the day you are born, the way you spent your youth days growing into an adult is what will determine your old age, and there is no power or machine that can make you go back in time, to maybe correct some mistakes and stupid decisions you made. Time is very valuable, if you think you got all the time in the world you are blind.",

      "body": "Health, time, and research These three things are some of the most important things I found investing heavily in. They all start with maintaining good health. People who have good health have a better chance of making it through things, and when you have a lot of time and use that time very well, it can turn out to be very resourceful. Research leads us to discover many things that can help us grow our financial life to whatever standard we desire. To me, the above-mentioned three things are actually not cheap, and they're not free as you have stipulated. You will definitely have to either spend money on keeping and living a healthy life or spend time doing some regular exercise and a lot of other stuff that has been prescribed for you to help you as you go. Time, as they said, is money, and health, as they said, is wealth, which make both work hand in hand. The time you spend doing some things is actually not free; they can be monetized, and that's expensive because the time that could have been used for leisure and other things has been channelled into something else, which is now denying oneself pleasure in order to achieve greatness (delayed gratification). Research helps us discover a lot of opportunities, which we can then put into work, and when they are utilised very well, we earn success as a reward for that hard work.",

So the more exposure you get, assumes you get it from your community, network, the more risky chance you will invest in scam projects.Learn, do your own research and don't join any network.",

However, if we critically look at the suggestions, there are a few factors that are not as easy to access as it is if you have money backing you up or serving as your foundation. For education, even if there are free online courses available for anyone to take, having the option to pay for an extra unit and a completion certificate is far better. For health, we still need to spend a good amount of our income on supplements and ensure that the food we eat is of the best quality and fits our diet. Developing skills also comes with a price as the best platforms and channels require payment to ensure you are getting quality education and tutors to learn or develop a skill. Nevertheless, I know OP isn't being literal by saying all of these are free as in zero sum of money to spend, but my point here is that these days having money gives anyone an advantage even to these things that we claim to be free.",
