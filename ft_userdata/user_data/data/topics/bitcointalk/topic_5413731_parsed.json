  "content": "The merger event is considered to be the most anticipated event of the crypto market in 2022 and this will be an opportunity for scammers to do their thing.📢 Here are 5 common scam tips that newbies need to avoidFake Pool Staking:QuoteETH is upgraded to PoS, which means a large amount of ETH will be staked. Surely after the merger, there will be many staking pools with high APY created to hit people's greed. To be able to participate in staking requires a very large amount of ETH, 32 ETH. Scammers will take advantage of this to create smaller pools to attract people who want to bet but do not have a minimum amount of ETH.📌Note: Code:always fully understand the origin and reputation of pool/dapp staking.Scam Airdrop:Scammers will create fake tokens like ETH2.0, ETHW1… to trick users, if they want to receive the airdrop, then log in to a strange link or transfer an amount of ETH to receive the airdrop.📌Note:Code: Do not touch or interact with any strange tokens sent to your wallet.Upgrade Scam:For ETH upgrade, users will not need to do anything to switch to the POS network, our job is to hold ETH in a wallet or exchange. But many people won't know this and they fear losing their ETH if they don't convert to the POS network. This way, the scammer will give us a strange link, the website will ask for the secret phrase to complete the upgrade to the POS.This is a fairly common form of scam, when we log into a fake website it always asks us to enter the secret phrase.📌Note: Code:Never click on any strange links or websites.Support Scam:After the merge ends, there are still many people who still do not understand and do not know about the fork. These audiences are newbies to the market from 2020-2021 who have never experienced Forks or halving events before. Scammers will take advantage of this to pretend to be fake support through social networks to contact investors.📌Note: Code:Don't give the seed phrase to anyone, even reputable parties, if it was Vitalik Buterin we wouldn't give it to him either :P ;DReplay Attack: Means allowing scammers to repeat your transaction from ETH PoW to PoS.Source/Read more: https://www.holdstation.news/top-5-scams-that-will-make-you-lose-money-after-the-merge",

The main reasons that make scammers succeed are the greed of people, foolishness and lack of awareness. In this modern-day, I believe we should revolutionize with its developments, unsolicited links, HYIP, too-good-to-be-true schemes and the rest are to be avoided.Above all, any websites and organizations you do not know should be totally avoided.",

I read about something called filtering of email.This works by analysing incoming emails and then filters some phishing and spamming contents to a different folder this is done in many ways- it separates emails sent from an ip address that has previously been tagged with phishing and spamming.- it also separates emails that contains \"earn or free money phrases\"- Emails containing links from unknown sender are tagged as phishing. This filters are stored in separate inbox sometimes labelled \"other\". This emails can only be sent to your normal inbox if you release, if not you delete them if they are phishing filterssource To filter your Gmail check https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en",

You owe it to yourself as crypto enthusiast to always be at the forefront of any information regarding cryptocurrency that is trending. Read about it and acquire enough knowledge about it so you will not be easily deceived and also so you can also help others who are about to be deceived by scammers in sheep's clothing.",

The scammers appeared with the name displayed almost 100% completely compared to some famous accounts. They will leave an ETH or BTC wallet address, and with the message, send an amount of ETH or BTC to that address, which you will get twice in 30 minutes or 1 hour. Those who are not careful are easily confused because the name displays 100% accuracy but if someone checks carefully, they will find that the username will be completely different. This scam is quite strong on social networks such as TW or FB.

One this about some newbie on crypto is most of them don't even know about this forum, some are not enlightened, they just hard from friends of friends and most don't really know what they are into, few of my friends fall victim of the Elon musk scam back then on twitter. Before I introduced them to this forum which they find very difficult to create account with because of the tag on the country IP. If every newbie on the crypto space also consider or are aware of this forum I fully believe their will be less of scam cases, because you guys are really doing a great Job by warning users of every possible scam system available.

But since I have someone who have access to my phrase every thing was made easy. Key can be shared with those you can trust with your life. Because if anything bad happens all the users assets are gone for good. just like this  contract address which I believe the team behind that project have completely loss access to the wallet for years now",

Every thing has something in return where either it wastes your time, money, or the offers are absolutely a sham and/or a scam.It is noteworthy to mention that people should maximize their observation skills whenever they see free giveaways. Oh, someone randomly added you on Telegram, or someone sent you a mysterious link asking for something, or it led you in a website where you had to input your wallet, etc. Those are just some of the red flags that should trigger you in avoiding these scams.Lastly, always have doubt to every link or random message that you receive. Again, prevention is always better than cure.",
