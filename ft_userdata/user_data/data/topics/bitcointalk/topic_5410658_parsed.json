The very first nft generated a good stance but later on depleted due to some reasons of legality or big issues.  The following projects did the same too,  hype then go down or fall later on.  So I dont recommend any p2e or m2e type of projects cause cant sustain it for so long especially when the users are increasing.",

Technically you are looking for an M2E project that don’t have an IDO and just start the project for free distribution of tokens through playing there games. So far I don’t see this kind of project that exist and if you really looking for a good project then you should not looking for free because good project invest money on there product development which means they want money to cover there expenses and fund there development.StepN is the best M2E project so far while the rest is just a copy cat which usually die later on. You should pay for the tokens if you are looking for a quality project because that’s where the cool project belongs.",
