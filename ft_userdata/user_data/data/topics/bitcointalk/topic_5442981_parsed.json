Never need to rely on telegram chat as scammers can pretend the reputed user and the chat can be deleted. If anyone wants to use the escrow of MinerJones then that is perfect and there is nothing to be worried about that. As MinerJones is the most trusted user in the forum which anyone can see from his profile. At the same time base on your profile, no one should send 5$ first to you. Because there is no guaranty that you will pay for that 5$.",
