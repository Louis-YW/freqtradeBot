  "content": "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MacMinerThis is something I found while I was on the Bitcoin Wiki and flipping through random pages.This is a manager for Mac OS X written in C++ that supports ASICs and FPGAs. So it's not necessary some CPU miner from the bygone age.Side note: I wonder how you even insert an ASIC into a Mac in the first place, as even if they have the correct plug type, it still has to be recognized and exposed by the kernel.",

      "body": "I think it should be a PCIe riser or through Jtag where you can connect FPGA to a laptop or Macbook.But the problem is there is no FPGA driver for MacOS no one yet develop it. I heard someone use parallel virtual to install Linux or windows to run FPGA but there is no proper guide on how to do it.I saw this guide below but it only contains a guide on how to make FPGA work on MacOS using parallel.- https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/xc7f66/a_working_fpga_toolchain_on_apple_silicon/",
