  "content": "Let's start by saying this, we have come a long way developing the technology and improving our life. But where does that lead us to? Machines are taking over our works. Maybe good for someone or bad for those who are suffering because they lost their job. Good or bad, we are still moving forward to a future where human works will be totally taken over by machines. A report shows that in Japan, they created 4 AI based robot which went rouge and killed people. So they dismantle 3 of them while the last one somehow got access to the internet and was modifying itself with better equipments. So they have to also put that one down.  -- This was to just give you guys an example on how far we have come developing the technology in where the technology can act on its own.If implemented correctly, what we could achieve in the near future. Here's an interesting story - A guy made a simulation using AI to predict the future of Human Evolution. In the future, how we may evolve as human beings and technology surrounding us. I am going to include those as a picture down below. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - [If you want to see the full video, it's available on the YouTube. You can see that by clicking HERE.]Now we can see technology evolving so quickly and human evolution is somewhat slow, but it's still in the process. Slowly but surely we are moving towards that. Many people are choosing to replace their body parts with machine or implant new things in their body. It is true and not a science fiction anymore. We will merge with technology until we become the technology itself. Take Neuralink from Elon Musk for an example.  Aren't we already halfway through what the AI have predicted? Now let's come to the main part. What does the future hold for BTC in the evolution is really going to happen this way? On an Interview, Elon Musk said that - (When we reach to a certain point in human evolution, we won't have to work. Machine will do the works for us! And by AI's self learning ability, we won't have to teach them either. So in that era, how we will pay for our goods or energy cost by machines/robots? There has to be a universal payment method)[Link to the full video of that interview could be found HERE]It does sound like fantasy, but I do agree on this with Elon. Me may see it become reality one day. So, for that payment method! It should be something digital like Bitcoin from my point of view. If we move towards such life as predicted by this AI, I think BTC will play a major role in that future. You can take this post as a joke. I was just surfing the internet while I saw these news and videos, and it just made me rethink, what our life should be like in 10–20 years from now. If you find this interesting, let me know what do you think about this. Will BTC be the main method off all transactions, or will there be something else to replace it? For me, I will stick to BTC for sure. If the future does become something like this.",

      "body": "The future of money and the economy is hard to predict, but it will be shaped by the complex interplay of technology, societal changes and government policies. It is likely that we will see a shift towards digital forms of money and financial transactions, such as cryptocurrencies and digital wallets. This trend has already begun, with the advent of digital payments and the continuing rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies. A number of governments around the world are considering introducing their own national digital currencies, which could be accepted as legal tender alongside more traditional forms of money.However, it is unlikely that physical cash will disappear altogether. Especially in poorer countries, where banking infrastructure is less developed, cash remains the most widely accepted form of payment. Many people also prefer to use cash for certain transactions because it offers greater privacy than electronic forms of payment. My opinion is that the future of money is likely to be a hybrid, with physical cash and digital currencies coexisting for many years. The key question is whether governments will allow people to use both forms of money, or whether they will force them to choose between the two.",

Being digital has never been unique to Bitcoin. Given choice, people will use a solution that best suits their needs. And we're seeing that after 14 years, fiat is still thousands of times more popular than Bitcoin. So why should some supposed progress in the field of AI or transhumanism in general increase Bitcoin adoption? Just because Bitcoin is \"new\"?",

I don't know if the future can be anything like this, it sounds so dramatic and unreal, but even if it will happen in this dramatic way, BTC is not going to be the universal payment method. The world is governed by centralized governments, if there is going to be a universal payment method it would have to be centrally controlled somehow, but it can't be decentralized; if it has to be digital, then maybe by then cbdc would be popular, and they can just make a universal one, but they would not accept a decentralized currency as a universal payment method.I believe some bitcoiners think the goal of BTC is to be a universal payment method, but that is incorrect; BTC has achieved its goal of being a currency that challenges governent's financial oppression, it is that currency that a person can use freely without central control. Mass adoption look like the next goal that we bitcoiners want, but BTC is already performing that which it was created for.",

As for art, given that it's not like any other job, normally, I don't think it'll completely go to machines. If it was a job of an illustrator, the AI generated images can be a tool an illustrator will use, or an inspiration to create something else. If AI images are that good, the job will be to write good prompts and do the cherry-picking. If we're talking about creating art generally, what people often value is how a person expresses themselves through the art, and some art becomes valued because of the creator of the works. I don't believe Musk's idea that we won't have to teach AI.Most importantly, what's special (for now) of humans is that we can appreciate art, feel it; not that we are the only ones to make it (because we aren't, even without AI).I don't think people will merge with tech any time soon. There will slowly be more ways of doing that, but it will be unaffordable for most, and some will oppose it ideologically. Thankfully, it doesn't matter if you're a cyborg or not if you want to use Bitcoin.I did see some creepy things related to Bitcoin and humans merging with tech, though.

Fore example, it could also be used to track other items that have value but are hard to keep track of (I think Blockchain is already being used as a way to track unique assets like diamonds), or it could be used to manage the supply chain of products and materials. No doubt, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have the potential to shape the future of many industries, and the world is still learning how best to use this technology, but there are already plenty of exciting possibilities for how it can be applied in everyday life.With all this in mind, it is difficult to predict exactly what the future will hold, particularly in terms of its widespread adoption and use.
