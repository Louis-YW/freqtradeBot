Because the citizens are worst than the politicians, they're ready to sell their vote with a little money and suffer in the hands of same politicians for fours years.That was in the previous elections not in this election. People turned out in large numbers to cast their votes for the best candidate in the current election without accepting or soliciting bribes in exchange for their participation in the country's election. Nigeria's sole current issue is that politicians use military personnel to oppress the public through INEC in order to skew the results in their favor.",

Promising the voting population direct stimulus or social welfare for their votes? Of course this is the appeal socialism/communism gives. It's using government resources to purchase votes under the guise of welfare programs. These programs have never been successful. They've just created a lot of debt. Voters are susceptible to such bribes -- why wouldn't they be. It's free money!COVID produced a lot of this.

In general, purchases are not successful unless the number of candidates is large.I agree that vote selling should be highly discouraged because it is a criminal offense. But you might not understand the Nigerian situation. In Nigeria, politicians buy votes and also rig elections. They engage in vote buying just to ensure they win if they fail to rig it. The target of corrupt Nigerian politicians is to use vote buying, violence, voting suppression, intimidation, tribalism, and religion to gain political power by all means. An example is the recently conducted Nigerian elections where Peter Obi the Labour Party candidate was the clear winner but the elections were clearly and openly rigged.",
