      "body": "CBDCs are the last thing that's even remotely close to being \"secretive\". it's literally just cash that's minted on the blockchain and unlike cryptocurrencies, they are regulated by the government hence the Central Bank in the CBDCs acronym. Scalability is not going to be a problem for CBDCs since they are self-sustaining thanks to the fact that the government takes care of them. A lot of people here are very much aware and are pretty accepting of CBDCs in the crypto scene since for worse, this is just going to be one of the government's most futile attempts at controlling the crypto industry. At best this will help us bridge fiat and crypto more, leading to an increased positive outlook towards crypto, and with it, adoption. So don't go wearing your tinfoil hats and stepping inside your faraday boxes in fear of getting spied by the government through CBDCs. They already did and it's not through CBDCs.",

I do not know if it is to trick people to believe that they are cryptocurrencies, but CBDCs are not cryptocurrencies.CBDC is not to fool people into believing that they are Cryptocurrencies.  CBDC is to fool every body into thinking they are BETTER than Cryptocurrencies.I presume they will function for the first few years in an attractive way.  Zero or negligible fees.  Zero maintenance Tax.  Instant arrival into destination account no matter the country of residence.  Zero or negligible taxes if you hold on to your CBDC.  Maybe discounts for purchases of food and such.This assumption is based on their recent strategies.  Look how they are tricking people into moving from gas to electric cars.  If it sounds good enough they will move.  For cars in Romania they did zero parking charge.  Zero or lowered Taxes.  Free charging.  Et cetera.  The benefits will slowly decrease until there will be no more real benefits.CBDCs are for those people who form a majority.  They will move if they find it beneficial enough and it will be more beneficial for the start than Bitcoin or Internet Banking.  But that is because the CBDC is of course not Decentralized.  It will require clicks to add or remove supply.  Not Mining.  It will have comforting benefits for the consumer like Centralized Exchanges and Custodial Wallets.",

CDBC has just implemented the blockchain, It's good I think. This means the government believes in what we are fighting for today. So let them go, and we must follow what they build for us, but when we think is not good, and more centralization from fiat, nothing is wrong with leaving that and back to traditional crypto (decentralization).

Most countries are still engaging in pilot studies on how to use these central bank-controlled currencies for cross-border trade.

Many countries are facing inflation which has led to the loss of value of local currency. People prefer to use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation than to keep CBDCs which is the same as the depreciating fiat.",

On the other hand, there is an indirect skepticism towards a complete transformation to digital currency. The direction is, if there is something urgent, it is very possible that the Government can easily limit access in certain circumstances. What it looks like is that powerful interests will do everything in their power to destroy the digital currency component of the business.",

China is currently in the market testing phase, and their CBDC isn't finalized yet, but the digital yuan (CNY) is already out and circulating, even used by some Chinese citizens. China's government always wants to take the lead in everything, including cryptocurrency, by releasing the Digital Yuan earlier than other countries.It's important to note that CBDC is different from the usual crypto we have. CBDC is not decentralized, and the government regulates and controls this currency with its central policies. Is this bad for the world? It could be.

This is in addition to the total control (blockchain is at the heart of the technology, after all). CBDC is the \"horrible brother\" of blockchain technology. And this technology is not about making life easier for us, it is about total, comprehensive control of our money. If cash or card accounts can't be blocked at a moment's notice, or if you can't quickly monitor the movement of your money \"down to the penny\" and block it at any stage - then with CBDC technology, it will be a trivial \"one-click\" task.",

As for scalability problems, the currency will be centralized, and therefore there will be a single authority that manages data updating operations. Also, even some of the Crypple blockchains can manage thousands of transactions, so scalability is linked to certain conditions when What has been achieved is that any central currency based on the blockchain can perform thousands of transactions per second.Overall I think you need to read more about CBDCs instead of conspiracy theories.",
