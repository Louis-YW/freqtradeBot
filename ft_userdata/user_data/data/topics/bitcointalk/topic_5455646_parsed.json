Also do you deposit your total bankroll and just withdraw if you are on target profit or stop loss or you are just depositing exact amount of money for your gambling without extra. 1% or 5% are just values, but the bet size will depend on your gaming budget. With a good deposit, 1% can be significantly higher than the minimum rate. Your game budget is determined by you, but you do not have to make the entire budget for a game deposit, you can only make a certain part of it, especially if your game budget is significant. If you are consistent and do not exceed the predetermined values, then this will help you avoid losing your game deposit, and over a long distance you will be able to understand how successful you are as a gambler.",

So I don't look at the the percentage, as long as the money or the capital is good enough for me to run and bet on max, then I will do it until the money was swept under me, or I got lucky and win big and continue on my high roller style.However now? nah, yeah maybe just 1%-3%, I'm no longer that attach or look for big wins, most of the time I just played slots with small bankroll and just to have some fun. And if the money is lost, then I'll just sleep over and try to play if I feel like to.",

For example, if I want to play $30 a week, then I only play at that amount per deposit. In the past I often exceeded my limits because of my greed and always thinking if . So, I learned to change my way with a max deposit of $30 unless I win, sometimes I increase my deposit. Of course, the risk is even greater considering that I often raise bets when I lose. But now, i learn to move  away for slots for a moments",

      "body": "1% is good, but you can use 0,1% too as base bet, so your bankroll will last longer and you can survive for more rounds before hitting a long loss streak. Another factor which must affect your choice is the configuration you are using when playing. What is your multiplier, x2; x1,5; x1,1? If you are making 10% profit on every bet, you have to set a low initial bet, as when you lose, you are going to need to increase your bet by 10.You also have to take in consideration the length of your gambling session. If you want to play for a long time, place low bets, but if you are in a hurry, give yourself the right to use larger chunks of your bankroll. In every cases, don't feel forced to use the entire bankroll. Sometimes it's better to stop a session with partial losses.",

And I have not changed it for many years because my salary has not increased or decreased for so many years. 4% to 5% percentage will be too much for me based on constant inflation that always leads to an increase in the price of goods. I am a low risked gambler so the 1% to 2.5% gambling plan is my level and it has not affected my finance negatively. Sometimes there are temptations or motivations to stake higher but there is a need to control my actions to avoid regrets. Although I trust the casinos I use still I don't deposit my monthly budget in the casino because nothing is certain in life. I am more comfortable with depositing the exact amount I am staking with little or no extra.",

If I deposit $30, I won't spend it all at once but will only bet $10 for a while, and whatever the outcome, I'll quit right away. I rarely spend a single deposit to play gambling because I will leave some balance so I can use it to play gambling another day. But sometimes, I gamble over $10 because I know I still have more balance in my betting account, so I'm okay if I somehow lose more than $10.",

Let's say there's a sports event coming and I'm making $1k a month. I will deposit $10 to casino and bet all of that on the team or a fighter (when it comes to boxing or MMA) that I like. I don't bet a lot of money, for me it's more important to have an active bet than actually make money doing it because it makes watching the match more exciting. I also never hold a lot of money on these sites. It's deposit > 1 bet > withdrawal > deposit > 1 bet > withdrawal.",

Though these figures are not set in stone and should be considered as general guidelines each of us has a desired percentage in taking risks. As for myself, I do not bet randomly or without any strategy. I consider various factors such as odds, game dynamics, and my own assessment of the situation before determining my bet size. I aim to make a good decisions rather than relying on chance alone.",

Emotion is the main enemy of this one on which even if you do set out 1% amount of your bankroll but on the time that you would behaving those boost up of emotions or simply that getting impulsive then it would automatically be switching up to 1% to 10% or even more or the worst you would really be going all in. Why i can say so? because im really just like this.  , When im still new into gambling field on which i do really have that impression that making money is easy until i do make out some realizations that it should really be taken up carefullyand this is the time i do make out considerations on having that bankroll management on where i dont really spent up huge in each bet.Most of the time whenever i do experience some consecutive losses then this is where emotion kicks in and would really be minding about getting those losses back and this is where desperation would kick in too.You would only just having that feeling of regret on the time that you had blown up your entire balance which is really that a very common situation.",

Why add other risks over risks?We are already depending on our luck, therefore, make a way to somehow be responsible for our bankroll. Depending on my bankroll on that specific session, I followed my own betting amount strategy then there's a certain tier before I will consider placing a much higher bet. Others will surely say, we are just gambling for fun, therefore no need for any bankroll management or something. That's a crap thing for me and maybe they are just casual gamblers. It's more fun if we manage properly our bankroll and in the end, are able to secure good profits without being aggressive for more. On the other hand, if bad luck happened, then just stop and come back next time for another session, for our bankroll not to suffer from too many loses.",
