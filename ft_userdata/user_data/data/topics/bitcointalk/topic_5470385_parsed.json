It's essential to stay vigilant and verify the authenticity of any airdrop or website.It's not a new trick, in my opinion, it's trick that has been known already. However, there are still many gullible crypto newbies who still fall for this kind of trick that's why scammers are just rehearsing everything.They are picking up the hottest trend on crypto world and then try to copy that website at best spread the world thru different forums or even they are willing to pay ads on Google so that their fake and phishing website are on top.

And just like the rest, this fake sites will immediately ask you to connect your wallet and that's how you get phished.The original site is used for bnb chain airdrops having partnership with bnbchain. I remembered that I joined also some NFT projects airdrop and you have to connect wallet for claiming airdrop. Newbie could be easily decieved by the this phising site because most of them unaware of it, They just look for site look and didn't hesitate to connect main wallet for claiming airdrops.Thanks OP, i will add this phising site in my thread also and I hope that no one has been Targeted so far.",
