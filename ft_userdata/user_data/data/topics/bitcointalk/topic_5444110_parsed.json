  "content": "After our discussion on the spams the board was generating due to the Presidential election, this suggestion was thrown out there but upto this moment I haven't seen an thread on this. Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on March 04, 2023, 07:39:29 AMThankfully the election has come and gone and for next big event in the country we'll just create a thread to discuss things ongoing. For example, for the upcoming Governorship election, someone can create a comprehensive threads that put into account of all the 36 states or key states (states wey their election go hot) for decision. Now all decision will be carried out there and whatever threads that pops up in regards to the governorship election will be reported to be locked.Now understand say this thread like this no be for politics in general but only for the gubernatorial election wey dey come up very soon. If you get other political discussion carry am commot for this thread so we no go confused ourselves. This thread na self moderated and any discussion wey no concern the governor election I go delete am. Also any topics wey concerned this governorship election wey dey outside this thread, report am to moderator with reference to this thread and them go lock am, that's if the person no gree hear warning to lock the thread.Now to the matter's at hand, see our first discussion; It’s Official: INEC postpones Saturday’s governorship, state assembly electionsQuoteThe elections, scheduled to hold on Saturday, 11 March, two weeks after the presidential election, will now hold on 18th March.Source: https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/586918-its-official-inec-postpones-saturdays-governorship-state-assembly-elections.htmlI think we all know the reason behind this postponement but you think say e go get any effect on the outcome of the election on the 18th of March like people go lose interest or more people go dey interested in the election, within you think? Bare in mind many people postponed their business/events because of the previous election date.",

      "body": "The fair unexpected results where underdogs won and irregularities that greeted the presidential and National assembly elections have opened the eyes of many politicians. There are reports that they've imported tugs to cause mayhem, which is why the DSS and other security arms advised INEC about the postponement.This is a mixed development as lives and property are better preserved than any personal or collective engagements on the day it has been shifted to, but this is sad, especially for those that have important programs on that day. It's however double for those that formerly shifted their engagements because of the initial date, they will have to shift it again.And truly, all eyes should be on the Lagos and Rivers elections in the south. I hope the security architectures would be rightly put in place to forestall rigging and snatching of ballot boxes among others. Many hoodlums are reportedly in the two states now, and the agberos in Lagos are another foreseeable issue.Only God can help us in this country. The election that has been somewhat fair in the recent past has taken the backseat again. Let's hope that the will of the people prevails this time.",

The one wey dey para me na say the Justice system no dey work; like say the politicians don put them all for pocket.Read through the link I paste as source to the message and you go see the reason why them postponed the election. If you wan blame anybody na Peter Obi of Labour Party and Atiku Abubakar of PDP wey talk say make INEC no touch the BVAS but dem supposed reconfigure am for the Gubernatorial Elections. Based on the court judgement wey dem get from appeal na dem they cause this one now oh, make una no dey blame another person lol. Wait make I post am as the link talk. QuoteThe statement said the postponement was to make for adequate timing to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) ahead of the governorship and state assembly polls.The Presidential Election Tribunal had restrained the commission from tampering with all sensitive materials –including the BVAS – used in the conduct of the presidential election following the request by the the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP), Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, respectively, who rejected the outcome of the presidential election.Source: https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/586918-its-official-inec-postpones-saturdays-governorship-state-assembly-elections.htmlBased on the focus states; Wike dun dey play another politics and sadly people go still fall for am. See wetin I read for news today, Wike approves promotion of Rivers civil servants QuoteGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has resolved to implement outstanding promotion of the government’s workers in the state and fulfill his promise of employing 10,000 youths into the service.The governor said that he had forwarded the list of members of the Civil Service Commission immediately to the State House of Assembly for screening to enable the commission to oversee the process.Source: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/03/wike-approves-promotion-of-rivers-civil-servants/Na another another political moves be this oh in my own opinion, because why him no do am since, na just few days to election him dey run this employment dem and who knows maybe condition go dey for the labour union congress in the state to support am for him boy to enter office for him to do more immediately him enter seat. This Rivers election no go easy, una think say Wike go fit put him boy for seat abi Labour, APC or even SDP wey Senator Magnus Abe dey represent go push PDP comot for office especially after wetin Wike do for presidential election.",

The one wey dey para me na say the Justice system no dey work; like say the politicians don put them all for pocket.I completely understand your frustration. This election is different from other elections conducted in past. Thanks to BVAS the evidence is glaring. INEC said they needed 5 days to reconfigure the machine for the gubernatorial election and there's no enough time so they had to postpone the election, so let's hope there's no hidden agenda.

Him plan of putting him boy for office make him cover him nyash fit no work out. Wike approving the list of civil servant no be today e start, it's the politicians way of canvassing for vote in Nigeria.

In recent TV interviews, the labour party's candidate for the Lagos governorship hasn't lived up to my expectations, there are some blunders that show he doesn't understand the job, Jandor has a very nasty history that won't help him, and Sanwoolu is the godfather's pet.

I strongly believe say him biggest rival na LP party candidate but the PDP will definitely split votes. Had LP and PDP join forces together then they might have a big advantage to APC. APC votes might be coming from a tribal point of view and that is why they are inciting the tribal conflict that other tribes wants to take over their state",
