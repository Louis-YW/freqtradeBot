With the news reflecting growing interest in the non-fungible token (NFT) space among current investors, new research predicts that the current $3 billion market size will reach $13.6 billion by the end of 2027.QuoteIn the next five years, the key factors linked to the global rise of NFTs will continue to be the growing involvement of influencers, gaming communities, and the growing demand for digital artwork.Interestingly, the Mexican women's team was made known, launching a new NFT collection.Source of the Mexican women's team (In Spanish): https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/mexican-womens-soccer-team-launches-new-collection-of-nftsThe trend of the NFT market was also revealed, here is an image:Image: https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2022-05/0ebd8131-9816-4613-ab52-18330ed9db66.jpgGlobal NFT Market Trends.Source: MarketsandMarketsAlso MarketsandMarkets cited this trend:Quote\"APAC countries are emerging towards constant developments and market launches in the given sector to offer creators and buyers the same opportunities in the ecosystem.\"Source (Spanish): https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/nft-market-well-positioned-to-grow-35-into-a-13-6b-industry-by-2027",

NFT hype bubble is gone. No need to be a necromancer. Google trends shows that NFT was the most popular in 2-8 Jan 2022. Its May you know? the popularity of typing the NFT phrase decreased by 80%. \"As per the CryptoSlam data, NFT global sales have dropped after their record highs in January this year. While a downturn is also witnessed in a number of unique buyers and sellers and hence further dragging down the total transactions.\" https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/is-nft-market-losing-steam-global-sales-volume-halves-in-mar-11650200138313.htmlThis proves that NFT bubble popped in Jan and in april number of NFT trades dumped by half... I bet it dumped by another half in last month.And now in May 2022 some people are still excited about this? man... Its 6 month too late to be excited about this tech. Its about to dump 90-99% like with every new tech that just after bubble stage. Just like dot.com just like bitcoin in 2014 just like altcoins in 2018.",

Did the internet end when the .com bubble burst in 2000? NFTs may have a bright future despite google trends and despite a recent slump in sales. Another thing is that when a new market opens up and becomes profitable it often overheats and has to cool down to follow a healthy upward trend.",

But I think we fundamentally agree. At least 99% of NFTs today will be worth 0 in a few years, and it will be difficult to select the survivors. But that does not mean we will stop talking about NFTs, just as we did not stop talking about the internet in 2000-2002, or bitcoin in 2014, or altcoins in 2018.",

I suggest doing the same because right now there is uncertainty in every investment. People do grow tired of things easily now and soon they will find something new that will entertain them while making money. I believe there are NFTs that are made for the long term, but how rare are them will be the biggest question while keeping the value intact or more.",
