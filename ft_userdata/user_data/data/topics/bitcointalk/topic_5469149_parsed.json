  "content": "Compilation of some of the most memorable forum writeups especially those I posted myself, both the deleted and undeleted. Important to note that they all could be my posts alone unless I find other members posts that are similar to my views and writing patterns. I try to write my posts in ways that make them more meaningful and purposeful when read together in series or from beginning to the latest posts so that it feels like you are reading a book. My main goal here is to summarize the forum posts in a single thread & in orderly manner while still retaining the whole meaning & purpose when read together. I will be picking posts from the Forum Boards/Sections such as Bitcoin Discussion, Economics, Project Development, Offtopic, Serious Discussion, Etc                       Bitcoin/crypto centric Guides                        Business/Work Guides — Posts from Economics Section:Topic:   *After Making Money In Bitcoin, How is Black Tax Affecting You Economically?*...

Fund things that are profitable and necessary. Your success will prove you deserve the money you earn from crypto.Typically, rewards or money should be going mostly to people who deserve them.

Love or enjoy solving problems for people in need of your solutions. This will help you provide better service and stay long enough in your preferred business.Focus more on good business you are talented in and passionate about... Then spend some time developing your talent by learning to do the business well. Talent will make you better than your competitors while passion will help you endure long enough in the business till you master it.It is easier to get funding for your business if you know what you are doing really well and provide better services. This should drive you to attract funding from relatives, friends, banks etc. Better to start small and expand later as you become grounded in the business. .Go to places your potential customers are concentrated. You could start by offering free or \"pay later\" services to them via ads or promotions. Try to be close to the customers. Patronize them when you need something they have and remind them to patrionize you too. You could also create loyalty program for loyal customers.* But to be honest with you, part of the secret of successful business is to genuinely care for customers. People who really love and care for customers attract more customers even without ads, promotions or loyalty programs.Link to the reply: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467663.msg62938036#msg62938036Or read from archive: https://archive.fo/Dszc6Topic:  *I cannot go home if I don't make a lot of money now!!* when i was kids, i need to study very hard, to get a lot of. ..

Don't love money at the expense of people.Cursed money not worth it, my friend . It's going to make you lose alot, miserable, depressed, foolish, etc. Simply get yourself the Word of GOD( Matthew, Proverbs, etc) and read... Believe in it and do what it says and you will prosper.The secret to prosperity is to sow good seed or do good work in any good business you can find, preferably business you are passionate/talented in...it doesn't matter if it's owed by others. Use the business to solve problems for others... Then, ask the CREATOR to reward you through the business or through any other means, believe HE will answer your prayers and you will be rewarded. The more you sow (or the more good work you do) the more you reap. You don't need to be employed by anyone to benefit from this. Just look for any good business and begin to contribute.Blessings.Link to the reply: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458425.msg62498020#msg62498020Or read from archive: (coming soon) Topic:  *Can your passion lead to an increase in your net worth?*There are many diverse opinions about following one's passion and ...

The most important thing that's needed for one to run a successful company is Talents(gifts, abilities, ideas, etc), Passion and Guidance from someone/people with similar abilities who have successfully build their own businesses ethically/morally.The easiest way to ruin a talented mind is let them go through programs set by dumb people or those with unrelated abilities who typically fill large books with nonsense that takes years instead of months to go through. Better to spend that time as an apprentice under a qualified company.

But before this, consume the Word of the CREATOR of the Universe... learn basic maths, language, civics, morality, health and other necessary/important knowledge. They are what we call general knowledge for all or most people/talents.The basic education tend to be somewhat fair, natural and useful. If you wish to go beyond the basics, look for successful people in your related field/talent and those knowledgeable in the above subjects to guide you, or get the books they have written to guide you.What you call instinct are basically natural knowledge and talents. They are what society ought to build on and refine. Passing through modern school with high scores doesn't mean you will know how to solve world's problem properly. Infact people with great scores from such schools will need to rely on their natural knowledge to do well in society. Knowledge they obtain from the schools will certainly fail them because they are false Knowledge. The knowledge is actually light quencher capable of making smart people dumb and foolish.There are rare cases where knowledge is \"supernaturally\" obtained or uploaded in a human or taught by his CREATOR in the mind and spirit. These can only be possible via contact with the CREATORLink to the reply: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458045.msg62534257#msg62534257Or read from archive: (coming soon)                        Nomad/Survival Guides Topic:   *The American Dream.

I belong to a Nation, or perhaps an existence that is everywhere but nowhere.In my World or Nation, our needs are guranteed as long as our Shield remains strong. To have a strong shield is to obey the laws and do the Will of our CREATOR.

No need to be walking long distance with heavy equipments, drinks, foods etc. Just get yourself light-weight things to collect/produce clean water and good foods. Get list of strong, light and adjustable tools to make things like shelter, animal traps, fire, cloths, containers... things to extract raw material for making other important/necessary things like tools for farming etc. Get some books and writing materials. Then extra stuff you don't immediately need could be stored somewhere.It's mportant to have multiple underground storages where things with long shelf life like dried foods, drugs, etc can be stored for emergencies.Link to the reply: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407407.msg62608587#msg62608587Or read from archive:This post was created 4th Oct 2023.
