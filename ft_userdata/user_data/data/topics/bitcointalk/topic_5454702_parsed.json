  "content": "It's already 27years ago I was staying with my grand parents to look after them for a couple months. It’s about a 14 hour bus trip to get there.Though is a rural area my grand parents lived a very peaceful and lively place which am pretty comfortable living back then.In the town(current population about 120,000), it’s kind of confusing. So much has been torn down or built up in the 27 years since I lived there.It was really hard for me to locate if note for the help of google map.One of the mesmerizing things was looking at the people, wondering if they were about my age, and maybe I even went to school with them or something. Then again, there were a lot of people like me who left that town as soon as they could.everything have totally change the buildings,the way they are dressings and lifestyle are not like the old days.But in conclusion i was really happy to being back home after a very long time that i have been away.So how long or when last have you visited your home since you left and how do you feel being back for a very long time?",

      "body": "I haven't visited for quite along time and may never visit even though I have had series of dreams of me in the Community.I wish I have works to do there otherwise it's not a place I would want to visit for fun.    The old people there were incredibly nice the last times i visited but I'm not sure the current people who I believe have been too corrupted by modern cultures will know how to treat people well or be nice/civil. They are almost transforming the place into something else... less natural and more artificial stuff, like foods, drinks, roads, transportation, houses, etc. The natural is why I love the rural areas.*Note: by \"artificial\" i mean things not made naturally, whether foods, houses, roads, etc.For example, if you want to construct a house naturally, better contruct with natural things that have not been synthesized or artificially made... Better to create metals with natural fires not with fire from artificial gas, build homes with nice natural materials, ferment foods/drinks naturally, use natural manure/foods to nourish the farms, etc. I prefer community that make things that way.",

There is still many who have not left it. My hometown is not such a nice area. For this reason there is not a big reason I will want to return there. But I will visit my hometown only when I have to help me relatives because it is not a place I will go for my own reasons.",

      "body": "There is a growing rural to urban migration in my hometown. Part of the reason is that crude oil exploration activities such as gas flaring, oil spillage and others have resulted in serious pollution of the air, land and water. Not forgetting the attending insecurity that follows anywhere there is oil in Sub Saharan Africa. So, my once cherished hometown has become a ghost of itself and people who can afford to leave are doing that in drove. Actually, it's getting to six months since I last visited.",
