Since there has not been a free distribution of tokens from Metamask, so there is still time to perform a swap inside the wallet and use the official bridge - https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge to be eligible for airdrop.",

In order to maybe qualify for that airdrop i used the swap function of metamask for the wallets that i am using. I would guess that you need to use that function in order to be eligible to receive those tokens. I don't know though, that is just a feeling. That being said it is not officially confirmed yet if there will be a metamask token at all.If there will be a token airdrop then it really can be the biggest airdrop ever. That also means though that you should not expect to get a significant amount of money with that airdrop. There are just two many people that will receive it and will immediately sell their tokens.",

If you have extra funds or using metamask for quiet some time now, you already have that assurance. Airdrop will still depend on their value though, let’s see if Metamask will still push this through.",

It has been very long time but it's not yet even confirmed whether metamask will launch airdrop or not. The requirements have not yet known and this actually depends on the so many factors not only swap your token.

In all likelihood the launch of this token will not take place in the near future, because the environment for such things is extremely unfavorable right now. Most likely, the official announcement and launch of the token will take place after the end of the bearish trend, when the industry will once again see an influx of cash from various investors.",

However, they still don't give the explanation in detail, so we need to wait for more time. However, what I am thinking here is about what we need to prepare for the Metamask airdrop. If this really true, There are several ways to prepare to join the metamask airdrops. But, when reading some probabilities to get the rewards by doing some preparations and ways may be too complex. However, we need to do swapping on Metamask, use Metamask Bridge, create a Gnosis Safe wallet, donate via Gitcoin, and also Sign up for Infura. Although that may be not clear enough if we must do them all, the news said that doing those activities may increase your chance to get the rewards. Well, this is too much and seems like promoting their products and features.",

I was into one of the scammed projects,  Metamask is mostly a scam projects because last year, I had billions quantities of metamask in my trust wallet but it's worth over millions, it's an airdrop which many people participated, but it wasn't withdrawable. They gave us date that it will be distributed according to our batch and section, but I guess they were wrong.  We waited for the lunch date nothing happened because the population was much and the team behind the project couldn't manage to risk.",
