  "content": "I was on my phone today reading some article when I got a pop up notification from the X app ( Then known as Twitter) and the content of the notification made me pause to look at the notification and check if this was real or maybe it's  someone just tryna messing with people online. I further looked up the information and found out it was real. I mean why on earth would someone pay 83.65 BTC ($3,136,058) in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network? Which is typically 120,258 times more than the actual fee of 0.0007 Bitcoin ($26.66) for a transaction. I keep asking myself why in earth would someone do that because it doesn't make sense why a user would pay such an enormous amount for transaction fees. Could it have been an error when setting the transaction fee or maybe it was a deliberate attempt to manipulate the Bitcoin Market because this Scenario has currently sparked lots of discussion in the Bitcoin community if it was indeed an error or a deliberate attempt to manipulate the market.Well I wouldn't know the reason for the action and that's why I brought it here if anyone would provide a more logical reason that led to this action.",

Unless you have 20 ph tinted to them you can't join them.So if they make 30% to the blocks which are inflated to 1 btc in fess. we get 30% of 144 = 43 blocks with say 43 btc in fees vs maybe 12 due to the flooding technique. This is not good.  It could mean 30-50 sats for months on end. as a typical fee.as for money laundering via 83 block fees nope as others could win and that set of coins are lost.my scheme as listed above is more likely to happen. I can't figure a way the 83 block guy could be sure the right pool wins it.",

All of these possibilities actually exist and we do not know what is true.But I am curious to know which mining pool charged these very high fees for the transaction and is there a possibility to return these unreasonable fees in case of human or software error?",

It normally shows you what the transaction fees will be, but he never looked at that and just confirmed the transaction.",

Because we can see that this is not a low amount 83 Bitcoins is a huge amount. We have an example in the past like Paxos paid almost 20 Bitcoins to F2Pool by mistake.
