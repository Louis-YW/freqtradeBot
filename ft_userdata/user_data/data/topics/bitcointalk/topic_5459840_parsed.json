The reason is this: for the clipboard virus, the hacker needs the victim to copy the original address, which he could change to his own. That's how the malware is being programmed. But for QR codes, what you need is to use your device, scan through the QR code, and it will automatically be imputed to wherever you are sending from. So for the hacker to be able to change the QR Code scanner, they will need more extra work, but for the main time, address scanning is still the best option. And one should always cross-check his address before authorizing a transaction.",

      "body": "If you are the receiver and you click on receive and the receive address is brought up as QR code, you are safe if the sender scan the QR code directly like that. But if you copy the address and want to send, the address can be changed by clipboard malware to a hackers address. So QR code is safe if you are the receiver and the sender scan the QR code directly from your device. If you are the sender and you scan the QR code directly, it is also safe. You do not copy anything to the clipboard, not to talk of any data modified.The malware gain access to the clipboard of a device and modifies data that is copied and change to attackers data. But with QR code, no data/address copied to the clipboard.QR code used in this way is very safe. QR code is the safest for making bitcoin transaction, not only because data is not modified, but also because no way for malware to be transmitted.But always check and double check the address before sending.",

When you scan a QR code with your software wallet, the payment information is directly fed into your wallet without going through a clipboard buffer. This eliminates the possibility of malware intercepting and modifying the information. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to double-check that the payment details actually match what you see on the screen next to the QR code, just to be safe.",

If that is possible, then the phone need to have been so corrupted that the hackers will be able to steal whatever is on it without going through all that.You will be extra secure if you double check every letter in the (scanned or copied) address before sending.- Jay -",

There is nothing impossible for these hackers, and nothing is expensive for them; they are already professionals in that field, looking for victims. If they see a tool that could help them hack through a camera (if there isn't any already), it will cost them little compared to what they will use that tool for, and as such, they will pay anything to get it. You spend money, combined with skill, to get things done.QuoteScanning QR code seems secure for now but the problem with scanning is that distance transaction can not be carried out using scanning method.  How do you mean that if I send a coin to the Bitcoin address of someone, do I need the person to be in the same place as me? No. The same thing is applicable with the QR code. If you are not sending it to your own wallet, where you will directly scan it from the wallet provider, all you have to do is ask the receiver to send you the QR code, and you can scan it from wherever you are.",

      "body": "You pointed out a very good question. To understand the answer we must know how QR code works. We do know that each person has it's own unique QR code which is generated each time somewhere like in some wallets or exchanges such codes are unique everytime. Coming back to the point.In QR code scams, a scammer could replicate ke exchange his own QR code with your QR code so when an other person intends to send you money by scanning that QR code then the money will be sent to him not you. And k think detecting such activities are difficult in QR code because in wallet address we can compare the characters but in QR code it is a big difficult to compare the patterns which might look same but the numbers hidden in it might contain different wallet address and that can't be seen by naked eyes of at least without decryption of it.",

That's why it will always be advisable to me to request that the QR code be attached with the wallet below it for authentication purposes, and when that is also being done to take some extra measures for security reasons, we should always ask the sender to confirm if the address received and gotten from the QR code is the same as what was sent.Quote from: kamvreto on July 14, 2023, 10:48:51 PMIt may have happened to me, fraudulent schemes are currently growing and becoming more sophisticated.

One interesting thing is the way exchanges and some apps has included it as authentication option for login into an account, sharing files, data, contacts too. The uniqueness of the Hash is what also sets it apart. Each individual to its own hash.
