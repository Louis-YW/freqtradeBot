I think this sideways volatility will continue.If the numbers are very good or very bad then I see how we can break out of this tight range we are in. If we get a  very positive number it means fed is hawkish and might increase rates even further. If we get a very negative then we will really because it means the fed will be more dovish.",

But I see no reason for the price to go up, at least in a strong way. So, I think the rest of the month will be just as boring.",

There are no signs of improvement any time soon and many people are warning of a recession in the coming months. Before going into October, I expect the market to recover slightly before falling further in the coming months as October is considered a good month for bitcoin but now I think the opposite, I voted down and I think by the end of this month we will have a new bottom not just a drop. There is still no confirmation that the economy will go into recession, but this possibility is now very high. Recently, the US unemployment index fell but the market did not have a slight recovery, it can be seen that things are more pessimistic than optimistic. The world situation seems to be getting worse because yesterday Russia continued to strongly attack Ukraine, the escalation of the conflict is inevitable.",

And this has been the trend and so I wouldn't be surprised a sideway pattern till the end of this year. Most likely around $19k-$22k I reckon. So it's not that bad, investors can still invest because it is still cheap and at a huge discount from our last all time high.",

Though I heard that there are some popular individual investors now that have invested in Bitcoin but I think that's wont the reason it will go upside.  If we look at the daily candle it seems there's no sign of a bullish one.  Sideways could be close to accurate results.However, I'm very optimistic that the Bitcoin price will go up at the end of this quarter as the most anticipated moment.",

Maybe that's the right thing to describe Bitcoin's movement in October given the potential for inflation that will be expected to reach its highest this year although no one is able to accurately predict and analyze market price movements, but the continued impact of the recession can have an impact on Bitcoin prices even though the effect size is small.Market conditions are still very influential on the US Dollar. This based on the use of the Dollar globally makes me feel that America has succeeded in exporting inflation to many developing countries.Even so, I am still optimistic that the future of Bitcoin will be much better.",

There is a big possibility that the rest of October will just be like the previous months of the second quarter, but I would still like to believe that this month is Uptober.

I voted down because October and November 2022 according to my earlier predictions, these two months will provide the lowest price of bitcoin. That is why I will start buying back this coming December whether it is up, moving sideways, or down. Most people that have bitcoins or are interested in it know that 2023 is the year before the halving so many will start investing again. Mid or late 2023 should be bullish again. Of course, the world situation will have its own impact on the market. There are more adoptions coming up, no doubt about this. The world order if it continues to be like this will somehow urge people to admire bitcoin and decentralization to keep away from dirty politics.So my prediction at the end of the month should be between $15k to $17k.",
