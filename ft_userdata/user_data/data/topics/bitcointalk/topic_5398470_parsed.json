Is not only war that brings peace or is not only that can unit two different countries that is having problem, demonstration of peaceful protests can go a long way to solve problem that will cause damage to people, fighting with arms is adding petroleum to the war.",

Economic warefare is nothing new, the Hundred Years' War (1337 - 1453) was more of an economic war than an all out battle. Naturally, economic wars were a bit diferent back then, but it's still the same concept. What I do agree is that it's nothing like the wars of the oast century as it implements more cyber warefare.",

For example, Israel has been running a de facto concentration camp for over 50 years, and no-one is stopping them.",

      "body": "And it's a far more insidious form of warfare. Since there's no physical invasion the target country can't complain that it's being threatened. I remember North Korea even printed counterfeit dollars in it's hidden war with America. Not just destroying the economy but also funding various activist groups to sow chaos and division in the country. I'd also include the access to rivers in this one, like Turkey damming the Tigris and Euphrates and China damming the Mekong. With the latter, they've caused damage whenever they would release water without warning. You can basically hold the downstream countries hostage, whether you restrict flow or just let out the water, it's not going to be good for them.
