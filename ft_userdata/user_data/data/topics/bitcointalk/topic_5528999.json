  "content": "To me the biggest difference is how bitcoins are created. It takes a great deal of investment in time, effort, money and energy just to mine and produce a single bitcoin.Unlike altcoins, you can't just print a bitcoin out of thin air whenever you want. Any idiot with a PC can create a new crypto altcoin and print an unlimited or nearly unlimited supply for himself to dump onto the market, whenever he wants. But that's not how bitcoin works. Imagine having a money printer that prints an unlimited amount of dollars anytime you want. You don't have to do shit to earn it. Just enter the amount you want and press the print button. Voila! You are instantly rich. That's basically how garbage like dogecoin, ethereum, solana, XRP, fartcoin, pepecoin, clowncoin, etc. all work. They are just a digital recreation of the unlimited fiat money system but worse, with no discernible value beyond being a high-tech Ponzi scheme.What are other differences?A bitcoin mining facility",

A big risk is premined PoW coins, you must check this information of PoW altcoins.Bitcoin is unique by having many following things: PoW, no premine, decentralized network, no censorship, and decentralized developments so no issue if one Bitcoin developer left like how Satoshi Nakamoto left the community and no longer developed Bitcoin Core years ago.Altcoins are centralized, mass premined coins, hidden premined coins, mint from thin air with smart contracts, centralized, censorship, can die any time because development is centralized in founders and core team members.",

Of course one of them is actually mining and that's thanks to a couple of properties that the bitcoin network possess like it's POW mechanism which is basically proof of work. Other networks do have their mechanisms to like Ethereum which makes use of POS (proof of stake) in contrast to that of bitcoin.The most important thing that differentiates bitcoin's POW mechanism is it's difficult adjustments and halving protocol.  The bitcoin network actually has one of the best and most efficient difficulty adjustment mechanisms.",

Bitcoin is the foundation cryptocurrency and this is the key difference between Bitcoin and altcoins. Altcoins look up to it for growth and improvement. Many of these Altcoins having fixed supplies actually do think it’s all about fixed supply, yes I can say one of the many characteristics of bitcoin blockchain having so much attraction is the supply been fixed as such after mining ends the scarcity which has made some precious metals valuable also will have it to be valuable and pricey. But it is not all about having the fixed supply that creates demand. Demand is actually created through the chain’s utility, bitcoin offers so much utility for been used everyday like been a digital solution to financial crisis through peer to peer transactions. Most of these Altcoins with such fixed supplies do not actually have any utility as such the fixed supply isn’t enough to create any utility. The only few Altcoins that even get little attention have been those trying to scale the network by making transactions faster and cheaper than bitcoin but still due to some not having a truly decentralized network many do not go for them too, which makes bitcoin clears above them all",

This is even a great strategy and BNB is the pioneer of this idea to create scarcity and helping their token increase in value. The biggest difference between bitcoin and altcoins is: satoshi did not create bitcoin with the intention of turning it into a business or investment tool to make a profit. He simply wanted to create a peer-to-peer currency with a finite supply to overcome the shortcomings of fiat. Meanwhile, altcoins are created for business purposes, profits...It can be said that the purpose of both is not the same so the comparison is also lame.",
