I think the two option can be implemented because there series of post that contains images they might not be able to ahead editing them, but as for recent posts that has images can be possibly edited and use another image hosting site imo.Maybe lets see what other options some users may suggest here.",

This could have been better, but, just as Jawhead999 has stated, there are more users who have created a lot of topics and comments with a lot of images that can't all be edited, and there are also users who have dropped quality posts and comments with images. Those threads are still very useful, but those users might either no longer be active on the forum or be permanently banned from the forum, so their ways of editing such threads won't be there.",

He will adjust something, and the same image will appear. If someone posts an image to show it in the forum, there is nothing about privacy. I don't think anyone wants not to show their images in the forum that was posted already. About showing IP to Imgur, Imgur already know users' IP whoever used their service. I don't think people care too much about using their IP on a image hosting website. Quote from: theymos on May 17, 2023, 03:16:25 PM4: Exempt imgur links from the image proxy as above, but prevent using imgur embedded images in any future posts, to sort of phase it out. I support number four. There are a lot of members who are not in the forum anymore. Some of them are unlikely to return to the forum in the future. We don't know the possibility. There are a bunch of tutorials where a single thread contains more than five or ten images. It would be tough for someone to open all ten images and see them. Some tutorials are incomplete without images. I highly recommend implementing number four. Thanks for your attention.",

It’s the author/poster main responsibility to update all his post if he really values all his content.

If it is not a concern, #4 seems to be a better option for the forum and its users.",

My ideal choice would be to exempt the previous posts and restrict the use of Imgur for future posts. Fortunately, we have Talkimg by Joker_Josue, which is an excellent alternative for hosting images. Additionally, the script by TryNinja has helped many of us to replace our existing images with the ones hosted on Talkimg.So we do have that option as well for the previous posts.",

But this has privacy implications, since imgur will see forum users' IPs. Also, imgur has apparently banned a lot of Tor exit nodes etc. as well, so imgur images won't work for everyone.Big No!!! Leaking ip to imgur might be ok to some users but this could potentially be manipulated and exploited, I mean \"nobles\" will find a way to put their own urls, which might lead to user's IP tracking.Quote from: theymos on May 17, 2023, 03:16:25 PM4: Exempt imgur links from the image proxy as above, but prevent using imgur embedded images in any future posts, to sort of phase it out.Isn't it the same as option No. 3? How will it work? I mean If I go to my old post and try to edit, will it allow me to save without updating the imgur link? If not then it's another headache for the users and if yes then the same risk of IP leak is there. So technically speaking, option 3 and 4 aren't the same?Quote from: theymos on May 17, 2023, 03:16:25 PM2: Make it so that all past imgur embedded images show up as a clickable link instead of as an embedded image, as if the poster had just posted the imgur link instead of using the [img] tag. I could also maybe make it so that if you click the link, it will JavaScript-expand into an embedded image (using the specified width etc.) without going through the image proxy.This seems more appropriate solution from all the options presented, convert all the imgur [img] tags to clickable links. Further I don't know how this \"without going through the image proxy\" thing will work? I'm afraid it might have a risk of IP leak too, as you mentioned in option 3.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on May 17, 2023, 04:42:42 PMFor those who really want their images as it was, they can just use TryNinja's script.

This approach strikes a middle ground where users can still choose to fix their images by switching to a different image hosting service and editing their posts. At the same time, this solution addresses privacy concerns as members' IP addresses won't be shared with third parties without their knowledge or consent. It provides a practical compromise that benefits both user experience and privacy protection. The same as we already have with external links.
