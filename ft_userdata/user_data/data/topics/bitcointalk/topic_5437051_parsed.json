Reusing a known strategy? Even though everyone know about it.Yeah, I remember KIN, I think everyone is more familiar with it because it set a precedence with SEC filed a case against them.After that it wall going down the hill with this project and the price literally went to 0 if I remember it correctly.So if investors found out that the BONK project is just a reused strategy then I doubt that they will get the investors money, or at least get the consensus from crypto community. Investors are wise and enough, and if they do their own research, then obviously, then obviously they won't invest, simply as that. The stigma is still there and will remain no matter what renaming or reusing the projects will do.",
