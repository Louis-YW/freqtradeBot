  "content": "I have noticed there hasn't been an update to the Bitcoin app on my Ledger Nano S for quite some time. There usually is one, at least once or twice every couple of months. We know that Ledger no longer sells the Nano S in their official shop, and it will not be manufactured any longer, either. But have they stopped releasing updates to the crypto apps that you can install through the Ledger Live Manager as well? I don't know if the app version is the same or different depending on which hardware wallet you own. The current version of my Bitcoin app for Nano S is 2.0.6.A question for those using a Nano X or Nano S Plus: What is the newest version available for the Bitcoin app on your device?I will contact their customer support if the app versions prove to be different. Some features may only be available on the Nano X or Nano S Plus because of its bigger internal memory, compared to the Nano S. So, it's not unusual per se. I would still like to know if future updates will be released for the Nano S as well or if it's time to consider an alternative.",

No matter what software client you use (Electrum, Ledger Live, or something else), you still need to have the Bitcoin app installed on your hardware wallet. And in case of an important update to said app, you have to install it over the Ledger Live Manager. There is no way around it if you want to stay up-to-date. But the question is, will Nano S users remain updated with future code changes or not?",

And the users would obviously pick the same option too.And I can't foresee a situation where the bitcoin app becomes so large it doesn't fit on the Nano S at all, at least, not until such a time in the future that most Nano S devices have experienced hardware failure.

But if you plan to use the Nano S for many more years in the future, then it is worth considering having alternative hardware wallets. For example, a device from a direct competitor. This is where the dilemma arises: buy now Trezor model T or wait for the release of updated model, which, the release of which may happen just in the period of these 2-3 years, when Nano S will be supported. It seems to me that in this situation, one should not rush, because nothing critically unacceptable in the case of model S is happening now, but I think that there is already a reason to look at other models as a fallback.

If Nano S+ or Nano X doesn't interest you. I personally see Foundation's Passport Batch 2 as a superior product than what Trezor is currently selling. But they are still fresh compared to the competition, and I would wait a bit more before putting a significant part of my portfolio on it. Even if it's an airgapped device. Some of its cons (but also its pros depending on the person) is that it's a bitcoin-only device and for that it's quite expensive at $260 apiece. Many people like to stray into the occasional altcoin here and there, and for that price tag, I would expect the possibility to do that If I wanted to. Maybe an alternative firmware with altcoin support could be a feature they will consider in the future. At least for a handful of popular alts.",

Bear in mind that even when support ends, you will still be able to use the device as it currently is, probably for many more years. And if you buy another device now, how do you know you won't have run in to the same problem with it in 2-3 years? And bear in mind Ledger have given absolutely no indication that they are going to pull support for the S any time soon.If I was using a Nano S, I would have no concerns continuing to use it until such a time that Ledger announce support is ending, which will be years away.
