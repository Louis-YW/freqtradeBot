  "content": "Hi, I want to make a crypto exchange.  I can handle everything except how the server side automates user's wallet addresses.  For example when I want to transfer ETH into my exchange account, the exchange assigns my a unique address for this.  But this is an on-chain address.  How does it do this?  Are there PHP/ASP libraries that facilitate all these extra addresses for all the users?  Is there a single command line wallet exchanges uses that works under linux and can be scripted to do this automation?  I just don't know how to connect a user with a set of personal deposit addresses.https://snipboard.io/i95jGC.jpg",
