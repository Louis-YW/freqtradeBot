      "body": "ok so there are 2 notes in question here.first one was not funded (funding was sent to polymerbit) then FFrankie funded one of the two notes. did you follow up when you received the notes initially to have Polymerbit fund it at that time? if so, provide this message. if you never followed up upon receiving the notes and then funded one yourself, then you cannot expect polymerbit to fund the note for a second load - maybe refund you? not sure. the second note should easily be funded with no issues - provided you can show proof of you sending the funding to polymerbit.Seems like fault would lie on the point of whether it was ever communicated to polymerbit that you received your notes.if you informed them and they never did the funding, ¬†the fault is on polymerbit.if you received the notes and after 3 years are finally stating you need your funding, the fault is on you.at least that is my opinion.that said - if you work with polymerbit, I am sure they would make you whole - one way or another. if you slander them and/or attack them, they are less likely want to assist - especially if the initial reason the notes are not funded is because you never followed up years ago.",
