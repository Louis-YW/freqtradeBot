But like Pomp said, \"first they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win\" If I see goods priced in BTC locally in the grocery stores, I would really believe we're almost close to it. And might finally come true and perhaps in the the next few more years 1satoshi may actually have value for keeps.",

For example, mega stores like Walmart, Aldi, Reliance fresh can start putting label in the format of bitcoin and dollar. But there is big problem of price volatility so a fixed label would be little off track. I mean if you fix label of bitcoin and price fluctuates a lot then same mail eggs could cost different in morning and in the evening. So they will have to implement bitcoin converter in their software itself. So that after scanning the QR code it should display the current bitcoin value and then may be it will work.",

They are obviously threatened by Bitcoin, because they need to highlight it's differences to Fiat currencies to boost their own \"Bubble\".  Why are they not showing the average price increase of Bitcoin over the time that it has been introduced and compare that to the drop in the value of Fiat currencies based on inflation over the same period. ( What would have happened if one person bought $100 worth of bitcoins in 2010 and what would happen if another person has placed $100 in a Bank at the same time) ===> If I bought $100 worth of bitcoins in 2011 ..I would have purchased +/- 333.33 bitcoins ....worth about $9 167 000 today.

I even started out freelancing in 2016/17 pricing everything on a base BTC rate, but as price went wildly out of predictability, everything began pricing back at USD base.So for the trend to swing back in the other direction? What would this mean for Bitcoin is simple: price stability. That means far lower volatility, or at least extreme volatility but within smaller amplitudes.",

Bitcoin is publicly traded and its price depends on the supply and demand effect. Throughout its history, it has often reacted negatively to bad news and positively to good news. This is evident from the price movements after important news regarding regulations is released. Whenever there is talk about Bitcoin being banned, or important players requesting stricter regulations, people start panicking and begin dumping their coins. The price can't go up if more investors want to sell than to buy, especially selling at a loss. Apply the opposite logic in situations when more buying is registered for whatever reason. Don't forget the market manipulations and whales colluding to get your coin at cheaper rates. We wanted decentralization and unregulated markets and that's the price of it.",

If this is applied in a retail outlet, it will be a big problem for its administration. A simple question: how to show the price of goods before the tax office? How to prove that the price is valid at the time of each purchase? I am not saying that it is impossible. However, this is so much work that it would be easier not to use the price of goods in bitcoins, at least in retail.",

Bitcoin is too volatile for it to be practical to price things in it for now. The price can, of course, be dynamic and in both fiat and Bitcoin, for example, but if earlier today Bitcoin was worth $27k, and in a matter of hours it jumped to $28k, it's a significant difference and the sort of volatility that makes it inconvenient to price things in Bitcoin. It can be used for online stores, especially if there's an option to make automatic price changes in real time (or, say, once per hour), but imagine changing the price tags in an offline store often.",

It may take some time to adjust but it's simply like switching countries and seeing stuff being sold in a different currency. There's the issue with volatility but I think that time would solve that issue and would slowly flatten to the point that its effects would be negligible. Maybe except when extreme situations happen.
