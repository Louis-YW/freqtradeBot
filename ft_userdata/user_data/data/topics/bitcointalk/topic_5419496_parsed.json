  "content": "I didn't see a thread about Croatian football league so I decided to create one. I know Croatia is more famous for their national team than for their football league. Let's see if this thread catches up. If not, it will die out and won't bother anyone The competition started back in July. There are 10 clubs competing in the league and Dinamo is sitting in the first place. Many of you that are not from Croatia probably haven't heard of clubs other than Dinamo. Maybe Dinamo too is a little known to many of you, but I'm sure that most remember their win against Chelsea in September that resulted in Chelsea letting go Thomas Tuchel as a head coach.Back to the league. The 10 teams that are competing in this league are:Dinamo ZagrebHajduk SplitOsijekSlaven BelupoVaraÅ¾dinIstra 1961LokomotivaÅ ibenikRijekaGoricaInteresting fact (that I too wasn't aware of) is that the League earlier this year signed a multi-year partnership with Sorare. That partnership resulted in all Croatian teams that compete in the 1. HNL being available in Sorare.As for the teams, Dinamo is currently sitting on top and has finished on top for the last five years. I'm sure that they plan to continue their streak of winning the championship this year too.",

If someone asked me what are the two most famous Croatian football teams, I'd say Dinamo and Hajduk. I'd never think that someone outside Croatia have heard about Lokomotiva Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on November 05, 2022, 09:28:58 AMQuote from: slackovic on November 05, 2022, 08:35:58 AMI know Croatia is more famous for their national team than for their football league.Yes, I think the same. The team Croatia was unbelievable in 1998 or 2002 world cup. They were one of the Semi finalist in one of the world cup, if I remember correctly. Your player Davor Suker was amazing to watch.Actually Croatia didn't qualify for the next round in the World Cup 2002. We beat Italy, but was beaten by Mexico and Equador if I remember correctly. Maybe you meant that we did good in the World Cup 1998. (3rd place) and in the World Cup 2018. (2nd place). Interestingly, in both World Cups we were beaten by France - 1998 in semi-final and in 2018 in the final.You haven't heard about Modric? I would say that Modric now is as famous as Suker was back in his days. The only difference is that Suker was a striker and Modric is midfielder. Strikers are usually more famous than midfielders.But back to the HNL... Yesterday Istra beat Gorica 1-0. Gorica is sitting firmly at the last spot and in the last five matches they have one draw against Slaven Belupo and four losses.Today we have Hajduk playing against Osijek. Osijek can come a little closer to Hajduk if they manage to win. Also today Slaven is playing against Lokomotiva (I'm still surprised that BitcoinGirl.Club heard of Lokomotiva  ).Tomorrow there are two more matches. In one match VaraÅ¾din is playing against Rijeka who is for me the biggest disappointment of this season. In the other match Dinamo is playing against Å ibenik which should be an easy win for Dinamo. Interestingly, in the last game Dinamo suffered their first loss of this season against Osijek.",

That was their first loss this season. It's a shame that other teams can't follow Dinamo in it's success in european matches. I remember few years ago when Dinamo played in the UCL and two other teams (I think they were Hajduk and Rijeka) played in the UEFA Europa League. That was really a great time and I thought that other teams will do better with every passing season but it was the other way around. They got worse and started losing in qualification rounds.So Hajduk managed to win 3-1 against Osijek which took them only one point behind Dinamo Zagreb, but Dinamo have played two matches less than Hajduk. Slaven Belupo vs. Lokomotiva ended in a draw (sorry @BitcoinGirl.Club, Lokomotiva didn't win this one  ).In other news, Gorica's coach Igor Angelovski was let go following another defeat yesterday against Istra 1961. His career as Gorica's head coach lasted less than three months and ended without a single victory. So no surprise there.",

That goes especially for Dinamo who is in my opinion better than other teams. The only thing they lack is a better coach who I think should be responsible for losses against Red Bull Salzburg which in the end resulted in finishing at the last place in this year's group stage of the UCL.As for Osijek, I hope they will manage to stay at the third place and maybe even challenge Hajduk's second place.Actually the the biggest problem for Croatian football is lack of good teams that could challenge Dinamo's dominance and actually do something in the European competitions. This year Croatia had four clubs in the qualification rounds of the Europa League and Conference League but none of them, except Dinamo, made it to the group stage. If something like that repeats next year, Croatia will probably lose one or more spots that lead to the European competitions.",

With Croatian league it's different. To someone who doesn't follow the league closely it could look like Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split are close. But the reality is that Dinamo is way better team and in the end they will win the league. All other teams have similar quality. If I'm not mistaken, Dinamo played two matches less than Hajduk so there are six points that they will probably win and separate themselves from the rest of the league. Especially now when there's no more European matches so they will concentrate solely to the national league.",

And if that's not enough, yesterday they have lost a cup match against Bijelo Brdo (the club is sitting in the last place of the second Croatian league). I really don't know what is going on with Rijeka and for how long will Rijeka's coach stay in the club.",
