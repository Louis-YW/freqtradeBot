  "content": "Following the BurningManGarage thread, and some others events I started having questions on what people see as safe or as dangerous at first glance, so I have one question for both hobby miners and just board lurkers, rate the following setup while also keep in mind that just because things are ugly it doesn't mean bad, and further disclaimer, no, not my work! I just grabbed a picture from a project online, if you're curious google lenses will reveal the source in a second, but I avoid naming it because it might lead to a biased opinion.So , from 1 being it's already a miracle it hasn't killed someone to 10 being as secure as ASML EUV factory or something like that, rate it!Full unresized image hereÂ Definitely interested also in the opinions of complete newbies on this.",

The setup is dirty and it can cause problems for the one who's having this setup. I think that guy just started mining and wanted to have as much profits as possible with that setup as that setup isn't professional by any means. I can't see any good cooling or ventilation measures in this setup, and overall it's just a disaster.",

It's not very hard. Wall sockets can behave like something possessed at times, I remember nearly burning down my house when I was mining years back, I got lucky to come around at the time, if not it will be too late already, the wall socket burnt up and start a fire, which could have done some damages. How are they cooling the farm? It look more like a local made mining farm, but they can improve the wiring and also the cooling system, I rate this farm a 3 out of 10, it's too rough and ugly.",
