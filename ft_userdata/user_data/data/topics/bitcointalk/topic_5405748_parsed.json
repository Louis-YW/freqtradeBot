Backups may always exist with a snapshot of the data.Note: Also consider that all external sites that are built around the forum to enhance some functionality or cover the lack off, may also harbour your IP information regardless of the forum’s own policy to that effect.",

Anyone users must created new account with his real IP, then they can access this forum through Tor Browser when he know his special code to log his account without completing a captcha.This is wrong. It's possible to register with Tor Browser if you're very patient to solve captcha (last time i'm doing it for login, it took about 5 minutes) and willing to pay pay evil fee. Using VPN would be more realistic option though.I registered using Tor Browser, and didn't have much trouble with the captchas.  I don't think it took more than 2 or 3 attempts, (7 motorcycles?) but now I don't remember the exact numbers.  I did get flagged for evil ip, but LoyceV helped me with that.Logging in hasn't been too difficult either, and I just found a link that provides a captcha bypass.  https://bitcointalk.org/captcha_code.phpThe admin of this site have made it easy to remain private, and I appreciate that.  It can be difficult at first, but I imagine that's meant to limit bot spammers.",

You should only consider enabling this if you've staked a pubkey in the thread and you're sure that your account email is correct. I'm not sure if 3 months is enough to respond adequately to all abuse; we'll see, and I might change it later or perhaps restrict it based on rank.So, it seems that the shortest possible retention time for the full IP address is 3 months. I'm not sure if anything has changed since then, but I see the same information also on the \"About privacy\" page:I assume https://bitcointalk.org/myips.php shows only 30 days of data due to security reasons.",
