      "body": "I'm not following any YouTube and other social media Bitcoin influencers or traders, but I've read some posts about a handful of strong Bitcoin critics whose words are treated as a signal to buy. Peter Schiff is one. Each time he barks at Bitcoin is accordingly buy time. Is Paul Krugman also treated the same? Anyway, is this a wise way of trading? If you are trading like this, how different are you from these speculators or influencers? I guess they should all be treated with a grain of salt. You're probably better off following your own analyses, technical or fundamental.",

Anybody who actually knows what they're talking about isn't going to be posting their knowledge for free on YouTube. So they're all bad. Â Your average influencer can't pump or dump the price of BTC, but they can altcoins. So if you see one chatting up a particularly low-cap altcoin and its already been pumped (up far more than usual in too short a time), then that's likely a good short opportunity.Sorry I don't have specific examples to give you, I never look at that kind of stuff on YouTube. Usually I'm trying to get away from crypto stuff when I go there. Basically nobody knows anything when it comes to BTC speculation (at least in the short term), and if they claim they do know, run away from them.",

That I could perhaps try to counter trade their advice?At the moment I kind of think IvanonTech the Russian dude is pretty convincing to counter trade, what do you folks reckon?I would recommend you to avoid those social media influencers at any cost. Even, if their analysis turns out terrible or give opposing view I still suggest you to avoid those people. The Bitcoin market isn't an easy thing to manipulate and even if a social media influencer that has more than 1 million subscribers announces that Bitcoin is going to moon this weekend, don't trust that person.It's not a great thing to blindly counter trade against the analysis of those influencers whose analysis always follows the reverse trend. Because sometimes the situation can be different and instead of their advice going inverse it can go according to their predictions. The real whales can influence the market and if they all decide to do something to the market than they have the power to do so.Although, the whales are powerful enough to change the market for short term but they won't be able to keep it that way for long term. Bitcoin isn't like other alternative coins that can be altered by whales and social media influencers easily and for long term. It has its own level and that can't be influenced by a single person or a group. Only most famous people can do such things like Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos, and they will be able to do that only if they promote their own products and add Bitcoin as a premium way of payment with some extra perks.",

Why do you want to venture into an opposition attacks that only focus on tackling others on the crypto network, is that being professional as well?2. You need to be very care of those you so called bitcoin influencers or analyst, they are nothing than promoters of a certain effect or brand they were being paid for to do, where you also paid to attack someone or to join those into this funny acts of attackers calling theirselves influencers in disguise.3. I will advise you not to join them, and i don't think I can give such a recommendation for you when what you're intending for it is not upto expectation.",

Anyways, you do your thing, but I won't do the same because you are making things sound as if those bad crypto influencers are intentionally doing this, but they are learning too, as time goes on they will learn from their mistake and if you trade because of this you might make a mistake and do a bad trading.",

Look at it now! See for yourself. This is what happens following YouTube Videos.That's right, why should an experienced trader who knows his strategy tell what his capital does? All these YouTube and TikTok channels are aimed only at their own material benefit and nothing more. Maybe before, when social networks were just emerging and people were interested in connecting with those who were far from them, one could think of a sincere common interest. Today, everything is only about your own \"I\" and your glory. As soon as these predictors are wrong, they either disappear and are resurrected with a new name, or they blame everyone around them but not themselves.",

If I am scrolling through YouTube shorts then I would literally see people sharing their graphs and making thousands of dollars in 1 minute video. If you check, the account with thousand to million followers would do nothing but advertise the related products, get super thanks, paid versions of videos and in play ad videos etc etc. Basically they are getting paid for virtual influence.
