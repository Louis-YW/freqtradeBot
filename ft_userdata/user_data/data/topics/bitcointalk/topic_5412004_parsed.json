Where the market is trending down then predicting the coin will increase is contradictory. The estimated $6 is also a very high price for a coin with a circulating supply of 1.85B. Most investors predict that 2023 will be a bearish year, not a bullish.",

If there are still a lot of users of their Metaverse then I'll have no doubt of buying it with my few money. I am not talking about the price but it's entire ecosystem and with its own usage.This is not a financial advice but I just happen to like the Metaverse thing it had got.",

However, as we are still in this bear situation, it guarantees nothing. A potential project will never show a huge pump in a short period of time, we can just see it really growing in the future, unlike these hyped projects. I have no interest in Mana anyway, it is a matter of choice of altcoins for maybe I don't see it really promising. But if you really have confidence in this project, then go for it but I suggest not considering this for long-term investment.",

I think that you need to consider if mana was almost at the top of metaverse token below ape coin right now. That's my consideration to invest in this project. This can potentially to go to the moon once bullish trend will occur very soon. I just remind you that any token has possibility to increase during the bearish market.",

I like sandbox more than Mana, I also bought sandbox but not too much, this time I want to focus more on L1 projects.",

I see that MANA is still optimistic that MANA will move positively and grow above $6 and I think that's very reasonable",

But you do not have to follow what we suggested instead, search for the other info so you know if Mana can be the next of your investment or you can search for the other coins. I already bought Mana and still buying for more, especially if the price gets correction or because of bitcoin price is down because I can get Mana at a low price.",

If investors have determined that Decentraland (MANA) is a solid investment, MANA may reach $6 in 2022 and $14.4562 by 2030.Well the price of MANA is at 0,77$ at the moment and given the fact that it's ATH was at more than 5$ per token it is definitely possible that we will see prices of 1,8$ per MANA again in the near or midterm future if the crypto market as a whole is doing well. That being said i am not so sure, if MANA has the potential to grow in price even if the market as a whole is going sideways or even down. The big Metaverse hype is over again just like any other hype that was ongoing in the last 2 years.Decentraland is definitely a solid project and will still be here in a few years, but it is definitely not sure if we will see prices of 5$ or even more again so soon. This will only happen if the whole crypto market goes into Bull mode again.",

If project is doing something special in market which will stay for long term then offcourse theirs token demand will increase also.Mana is working on play to earn gaming and they did well achieving roadmap. In long term Prices will spike absolutely. We just need one bullish trend for p2E games and we might see Mana Price above 2$. What is your basis that the long-term price of MANA would spike? P2E hype is almost gone now.  It isn't swallowed by the bear market but it just losses its momentum due to several P2E getting ugly at the end.  Besides, are the player of Decentraland increasing? If they aren't then we wouldn't see any difference in the market unless someone pumps the price of MANA.",

I think i'd instead invest in other metaverse coin with relatively lower market capitalization like vulcan, etc.",
