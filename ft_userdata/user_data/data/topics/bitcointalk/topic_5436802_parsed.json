  "content": "Most have no trouble grinding 12 hours a day on MMORPGs. Spending countless hours customizing their character, leveling up and exploring digital worlds. There are gamers who spend 16 hours a day, working hard, chasing their gaming goals. While they may not think of it as work. Can it be said that tendencies people have to spend inordinate and excessive amounts of time and energy on video games, defines their true self and true work ethic.The real you is the person who can spend countless hours everyday obsessively leveling and grinding in games.There is no need to develop a work ethic or drive. We can see by the way people obsessively play games and indulge in other activities that we already have that.What is it about people that allows them to invest 12 hours a day obsessively chasing goals in games, that have no affect on their futures. Feeling it is a great use of their time. While feeling that spending 12 hours a day on a crypto exchange looking for good investments. Or investing time and energy reading and learning, doing things which might allow a person to be wealthier and more successful, is not a good use of time?Could it be fair to say that the only difference between successful crypto whales and unsuccessful ones is crypto whales have learned to treat investment and finance like a video game. Where its fun and worthwhile to explore and learn about the digital world of numbers, math and statistics which comprise market based investment and trading? In which case, could it be fair to say that being successful financially isn't so much about trying to be a different person from who you are.But rather its about learning more about yourself and learning to have the same fun and enjoyment with finance and investment. That you have with video games. That way it becomes easy to invest 12 hours a day everyday learning to grind and level up in a way which is profitable.",

Gaming is very stimulating, gives you a dopamine boost etc, it's an instant (usually undeserved) reward. The 'constructive stuff' is about delayed gratitude, to be successful in it, you need to learn to calm down and not look for constant dopamine stimulation (look up dopamine detox).But it's also possible to re-wire your brain to start taking pleasure from doing the 'boring' but useful stuff.Lack of purpose and dissatisfaction with the current world is also a reason why so many people (esp. young men) decide to check-out from society, by taking a minimum effort it takes to pay the bills and survive and just focussing on gaming. Why take any effort if there's no worthy reward in sight?",

Companies that'll do really well in a few years may be ones that drive cheap labour by making their work environments \"fun\" and turning them into games (it's one way to help with a growing military recruitment issue a lot of countries are seeing too). If you could teach someone to program while getting them to make a website for a client you have then you might be able to get money off two different people at the same time too (although this was the original concept behind the current education system a lot of countries inherited). A lot of people who will spend 16 hours grafting on an exchange might just end up gambling with the funds too (there seems to be a lot of people who get wealthy and take too many risks because of it - there's an equal number of people who live fairly risk free lifestyles and seem better off because of it).",

If they are able to grind for so many hours daily, it's an evidence they have determination, patience and are able to fulfill with long term goals. They can take what they have started until the end and that is a positive trait on an individual.Actually, video games can help people to develop those traits, so it's not entirely a waste of time and energy. They just have to know when to stop in order to start doing something else, where they can put those same skills in practice and make their lives change for the better. That is where most players fail, because they can't just do the transition because they live in a confort zone or fear the outside world.",

I saw this, and the amount of the virtual player exceeded the cost of a good car. It is difficult to imagine the level of the vanity of those people who go to buy such heroes. But be that as it may, the creation and sale of the player justify the daily sitting at the computer. It can even be called a \"good job,\" which, as they say, should be like a hobby. What a person does for pleasureBut there is another type of person who sits at a game for days without gaining a single gram of material benefit. One day, these people wake up and realize that they have nothing in reserve except for old age and glaucoma.You can spend more money, time, and personal life investing in your future education; this is what successful people do. But we must admit that the addiction to games, called \"gambling addiction,\" is comparable to drug addiction. And this is a serious disease that should be treated by professionals.",

Gaming addiction is a serious problem in countries like Japan.Anyway, I guess that your question is why so many people like spending hours doing unproductive stuff, instead of working hard and building their wealth. The answer isn't that simple and I think that the problem lies in their childhood and their families. Your parents have a role in teaching you a thing or two about the importance of discipline and hard work. The people, who are playing videogames 12 hours a day probably had irresponsible parents, who never told them anything about life.",

Look at the professionals, if you can call them that, namely the esportsmen in Counter-Strike. Entire championships are arranged, with large prize funds. Can these people be called \"drug addicts\" if they develop steadily and at the same time receive material prizes?But, unfortunately, people who spend time playing games do not always understand that, in addition to this, they also have a life in real life, and they only have one, unlike a virtual one. In real life, it is difficult to start over because, whether we like it or not, time flies very quickly, and sometimes it is too late to change something.",

You have to be obsessed (to say the least) about something to be able to spend 16 hours a day doing it. I don't want to call it irresponsibility but it's kind of hard not to. I have learned to not criticize what I don't fully understand and that's why I've always refused to talk about stuff like this. Work can be boring, that's why it's always advisable to make money from things you love. Spending 12 to 16 hours a day doing what you love while not making money from it is irresponsible. It's a different thing if you're like a start-up and working on something for 12 hours a day and not making any money from it, like an upcoming musician or a start-up programmer, etc. Thats totally different. That is staying true to your grind but playing video games all day when you have bills to pay is something else.

However, it is important to note that different people have different interests and passions, and what may be enjoyable and motivating for one person may not be the same for another.It is also worth noting that the skills and habits that are developed through activities such as gaming can be transferable to other areas of life, such as financial investment and trading. For example, the ability to focus and stay motivated for long periods of time, to set and achieve goals, and to analyze and make decisions based on data, are all skills that can be applied to financial investment and trading.That being said, it's not fair to say that only the successful crypto whales have learned to treat investment and finance like a video game, as it's not only about the way you perceive it but also about the knowledge, strategies, and experience you have. Moreover, it's not a matter of turning investment and finance into something fun and enjoyable, but rather it's about developing the interest and passion for it, which takes time and effort.In conclusion, being successful financially isn't only about trying to be a different person from who you are, but it's also about understanding yourself, your strengths, and weaknesses and learning to develop the necessary skills, knowledge and interest to achieve your financial goals.",

If it's a more reasonable number but a person's really into it, I'd add that games are skill-based and usually grant you regular small senses of accomplishment, which is what people are looking for. The games are often divided into missions, and even aside from accomplishing those you can see some flashing lights or get points in the process for killing someone, for instance. In reality, you rarely get this sort of frequent token of appreciation. You can do something good once in a while, you get a salary once a month, and maybe you hear compliments sometimes. You can get a sense of a small success way more times over a few hours of playing than over a month of living. At least, that's what I feel is the underlying mechanism. Researching investments is different, as you can spend tons of hours without seeing the results of your work, seeing that you've achieved something. Trading itself can be engaging for some if you focus on the small gains and losses you regularly get, but it's still less structured and there's no guarantee that you'll win if you try hard enough.",

This can also work in real life, but is more strenuous in most cases.

But not all gamers can take advantage of this, because there are those who waste time in front of the PC just to play games and get nothing.Real-world work ethic is no longer a bone of contention for the tech-savvy Generation Z, as revenue from games, YouTube, and other social media platforms has proven capable of transporting them to a change in social status, they enjoy it as a productive job and spend long hours at front of PC. I've come across many cases of successful gamers by now, but the question is can this be considered a long term job?",
