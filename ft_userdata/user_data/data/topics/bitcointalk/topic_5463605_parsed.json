Go to friends, be with your girl or wife, do something recreational and do not gamble for a long time until you have the right mindset to gamble again.I do not experience this anymore because I use small amount of money to gamble. I can lavish free money though, like bonus.",

If anyone has experienced this, what did you do?The trick on gambling to still enjoy it even if you are losing more than winning is stop counting all your losses and focus on your current game so that you will not be bothered by your previous games. You can enjoy gambling if you don’t consider your previous losses since this always trigger gambler to chase losses and aim for quick profit be they think that they have losses to settle.I’m not an experienced gambler and definitely not good on self control. But I just ignore my previous losses so that I will not feel the urge to play more.",

This is how it should be when it comes to having such bad luck and when you lose more than you can afford, it's time to hang the glove and think of something else before it becomes an addiction that is hard to resist when you have the means to play. because mostly this is what happens to those people who force their way to play even though they are not gaining anymore rather they always lose and constantly fall into debt.",

And before you get back on playing, keep in mind what you are doing; gambling. Gambking means you have no assurance of the outcome and that should be an enough reason to manage your expectations. You'd more often lose, no doubts about that. No matter how good your analyses are, if you are engaging with pure luck based games, there's nothing to be surprised of. Move to other game if you are sick of losing but never chase your losses. There are unlimited days for you to try again, keep that in mind as well.",

You are lucky to be bored instead of winning because under normal circumstances, I don't think you will be okay losing games back to back when gambling, most likely be angry and tired of the results.It is not all the days you will gamble you will win something, that's a normal thing but whenever you had lost line up together over in days back to back, change the game if it is a casino or improve your skills from other players, Youtoube is one of the place you can learn about casino games and if you conversant with sportbooks, change the teams or strategy, it helps alot when you do that, sport games are the kind of gambling strategies are very easy to manipulate and they work for gamblers.",

I already tried to take a break for a while to calm myself down and that worked for me.Neither way works even if you pause to cool off and then get back to gambling, and even if it does. Don't you realize before you did all that, how many times have you lost, how much money did you spend when gambling before.And if you think about it all, there's no point in stopping and going back because it just keeps repeating itself. And my question is do you count your winnings after you come back from previous losses, is it more or is it break even. And I think that the wins are not worth the previous losses, and this is what makes gamblers believe in this way and feel good.Gambling for fun without thinking anything and just to enjoy a game that is only played when there is free time with enough capital, and this is the same as spending a few dollars to a bar to have fun and you enjoy it.",

If anyone has experienced this, what did you do?Is it possible to feel bored when gambling? I don't know anyone who felt like that and that is why gambling is so addictive and dangerous, because you never get enough of it. If you aren't a responsible player, you are going to continue playing without limits. Even jackpot winners have a hard time controlling their gambling routine, proving big prizes aren't an assurance of satisfaction.Anyway, the best thing you can is to give a break after you reach your limit. If you decrease bet size, but continu playing you will feel more tempted yet to risk money you can afford to lose. So make things easier for yourself, quit cutting the temptation by the root.",

When a gambler becomes bored about playing games then there is no fun or excitement in gambling. It might be possible that the losses have begun to make the gambler depressed. When you hear stories of gamblers committing suicide, it was sometimes caused by depression. The losses have affected the person's emotions and gradually made him emotionally unstable. The best option is to take a break and reevaluate your gambling activities. It is necessary to identify the cause of the boredom and possible solution. Other factors apart from losses can lead to boredom while gambling. Family issues, work pressure, financial problem, etc, can also contribute to this boredom. Seeking the counsel of a gambling psychologist can also help determine the exact cause and possible solution. The advice to gamble only what you can afford to lose will always be the first commandment of gaming.",

If anyone has experienced this, what did you do?It's normal feeling except that I don't know about others. For me whenever I am making streaks of losses as am gambling my energy usually drops and my interest to go on with further bets dissipates gradually and the next thing is just for me to take a break maybe concern myself with something else that will take the boredom away from my thoughts.I often realized that after such break's the results are usually different from what it were when I later resume my bets again. I don't know how that happens buy I just assume maybe it's part of a twist of fate.And I discovers it works for me more often than when I still continue to gamble despite feeling bored in course of the multiple losses am incurring. In gamblingg every gamble should pay attention to what conditions really worked in their favour more often and stick to it in that way, they will mitigate losses while making more wins.",

      "body": "In gambling, experiencing losses is commonplace. in fact, no gambler will always win in every betting session. Losing is a part of risk that we all have to understand, and almost every gambler experiences this experience over and over again. as you said, the probability of winning is smaller than the ratio of losing. in other words, more often lose than win.Referring to the point you said, I don't know for other gamblers. but I also had the same experience as you said. I experience boredom to play, you could say the mood to play is gone. the reason, could be because the games I play take up a lot of time but our bankroll doesn't go up or even down. other reasons, like you said. experience boredom because they always experience defeat in every gambling. usually, cases like this refer to slot machine gambling. sometimes we play for hours, but don't get the result. Or, it could be the other way around.If the situation is like that, i usually stop the game session. because, no longer gives pleasure. because slot games for me are only entertainment, I will move on to a more serious bet, namely football betting. but if there is no interesting team for me to choose as a bet, I will usually go back to the football schedule. for slot games, maybe I will ignore it for a while before my mood recovers.",

The amount of greediness in you should be at peak and by this time we are prone to more losses and if continue we are prone to get addicted that's why we need to manage our emotions, take a break been there the result is not okay, because of my mindset that time that I need to get back what I've lost, I lose more.",

      "body": "Usually, when I gamble I set myself a very simple roadmap for how I should spend my current balance. Gambling is not harmful only when played with discipline. Gambling is a pastime that must be determined before you start playing and the total budget must be determined and played without spending more than this budget.If I start to lose while gambling I double the amount I spend per game for a very short time and give myself a very short chance. If I continue to lose in this way I continue to play with half of my general bet amount(not half of 2x). In this way, I maintain my budget control and use my budget for a longer period of time. If I lose all my balance, I take a break from gambling for a certain period of time and gamble again after a period of one to three months depending on the situation. In this way, I become a disciplined gambler and enjoy longer with my budget.According to the poll, I need to select both first two options but unfortunately both options cannot be selected. For this reason, I thought it would make more sense to tick first option as I took a break for a while after the end of the gamble.",

I would rather take a break for a while. So just stop the losing streak and then come back later and think that you have left that \"curse\" of losing.And besides, you can save some money as well if you think about it, in my opinion.",
