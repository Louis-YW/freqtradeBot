  "content": "Brief BackgroundBitcoin is a digital currency, which means that it is backed by no central bank or government. Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, in which computers solve complex equations to verify transactions. The first miner to solve the equation successfully gets rewarded with 25 6.25 bitcoins.The difficulty of solving the equations increases over time, so it takes more time for each computer to find solutions and verify transactions. As more people join the Bitcoin network, it becomes harder for each computer to be successful at finding solutions and verifying transactions. This causes the average time it takes to solve an equation to increase from 25 seconds in 2009 (when the first Bitcoin was created) to 10 minutes today.The impact of bitcoin on world population, what happens when the population rate increase?The rate of increase in the world's population is a topic of great concern. The United Nations has forecast that there will be 9 billion people on Earth by 2050, and some experts believe that the rate of increase could be even higher than that.If the world population increases, it will have a significant impact on bitcoin. The more people there are, the more money is going to be spent on things like food, water and electricity. This will lead to increased demand for bitcoin as a currency.The reason for this is that when there are more people in the world, there will be more transactions taking place. This means that there will be more money being spent on goods and services than there was before.Bitcoin is great because it allows people to make transactions without having to rely on banks or governments. When you use bitcoin instead of traditional currencies like the dollar or pound sterling, you can send money anywhere in the world instantly and cheaply without needing an expensive bank account or visa card.cited1",

This causes the average time it takes to solve an equation to increase from 25 seconds in 2009 (when the first Bitcoin was created) to 10 minutes today.The difficulty level can increase or decrease with each difficulty adjustment, depending on how the hashrate increases or decreases.The average time was always designed to be 10 minutes for each block.Quote from: Josefjix on September 15, 2022, 02:01:30 PMIf the world population increases, it will have a significant impact on bitcoin.

Bitcoin is barely being adopted by the approximately 8 billion people on Earth now. And of those who have adopted it, it's not utilized much for purchases of daily needs. An increase in population, would not significantly impact demand, unless there is a rise in adoption.",

An increase in population, would not significantly impact demand unless there is a rise in adoption. About 10+ million people use Bitcoin daily, now imagine the high rate of adoption Bitcoin would get by 2050 when the world population increased from 7 billion to 9 billion as predicted. As the population increases the adoption increases as well, high adoption would have an impact in the following ways; First, the increased use of bitcoin could reduce the cost of living for some people around the world. This would lead to an increase in standards of living for those who have access to this new form of currency.Second, the popularity of bitcoin could lead to an increase in wealth among those who own it. If you can invest your money in bitcoins and make a profit, then you have more money than ever before!Third, there is also a possibility that new jobs will be created as companies begin accepting bitcoin payments.",

Maybe you could say that people who are bullish on Bitcoin will instead buy bitcoin instead of mining it if it's the case that electricity becomes more expensive, but the effect would be too minuscule to have a significant effect on the markets.",

This is an analogy of currency in general as a medium of exchange for goods.I also doubt that half of the population has mains water or electricity that they pay for maybe also food in quite a lot of cases if they can source it locally by foraging or having inherited livestock.Filtered clean water isn't a necessity to life and might not be available in a lot of places. Electricity is likely available even less than water is and food as it's much less important and requires more infrastructure (like generators).",

This will lead to increased demand for bitcoin as a currency.You've started with outdated information (which I see it was corrected by aothers), then came up with a relation that doesn't exist.Most of the world doesn't know and doesn't care about bitcoin. And they can spend their money just as good.If bitcoin adoption will rise, it will happen because more will trust it for investments, or more businesses will accept bitcoin as payment method. At this point the size of the world population doesn't matter in this equation. And whether this will change or not in the future we don't know, and neither of the linked things doesn't give a clue in that matter.So sorry, all this is your wishful thinking.",

Also, I don't really know what's happening, are we having a population decline or the opposite? Countries like Japan and some rural parts of Finland have started paying their citizens some money to birth a child due to low birth rates on these places. Add to that the growing sentiment of Gen Z and Millennials on not wanting to have a baby by choice, and you have a solid picture of what's really happening in a smaller scale. Either which side of the board we fall into, one thing's for certain: bitcoin will not rise due to population alone. It has to be more than that.",

However, from this point of view you can adjust the difficulty rate to mine, which is already implemented. Then the rewards for minings will be based on demand, and therefore the transaction fee will always be variable rather than fixed. Plus, Bitcoin can use further denominations if there's not enough whole Bitcoin's to be used by the population. Plus, Bitcoin has been designed with adaptability in mind, so if there's any real hard issues we come across, we could potentially hard fork to correct or mitigate them.

Lemme get this straight; do you mean that in the nearest future, miners will begin mining Bitcoin in higher rates to suit the population unborn?Or that bitcoin will generally be acceptable as a legal tender?  If no, then what business does bitcoin as a store of value--with some uncertainty wether to be revamped as a legal tender but with great impediments--has to do with the increase in demand of food,water and electricity as you said?Secondly;Let's assume in a country where we have 4 million citizens and you're the president; you have made provisions--not just on your own jurisdiction but with your electoral house too--and the population increases to 5 million: are you going to place an order to mint 5 million dollars so everyone could be entitled to 1 Dollar?Well, I think no matter how the population increases, we'll still have babies, Illiterates and lastly, alot that are CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY APATHETIC...But that's a story for another day.CheersSandra❣️",
