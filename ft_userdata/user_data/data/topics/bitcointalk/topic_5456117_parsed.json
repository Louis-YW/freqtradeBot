  "content": "Even though I've chosen such a bold headline, I'm still unable to conceal my feelings of nervousness and shyness.I was born in the heart of the Hundred Thousand Mountains of southwest China, where towering peaks and ridges define the landscape. The humble yet charming river nourished my ancestors and my fellow villagers. A quaint and tranquil village was the abode of my childhood and I cherish the joys and memories from it. I had a loving family, and dear friends and relatives who were close to my heart.Yes, I am not by nature a rebellious and avant-garde person, nor do I possess the visionary insight and courage that transcends the mundane.A year ago, I couldn't have predicted that I would be selling lingerie and using cryptocurrency as a payment method on WooCommerce. At the time, I was a beginner crypto trader, still new to the industry, and simultaneously working in my own professional sphere.I support the use of blockchain technology and enjoy trading in various markets. Through diligent study, I have developed expertise in trading strategies and indicators, which have helped me earn profits. Additionally, I have a caring boyfriend who is playful at times, but never steps out of lineI have no particular dissatisfaction with myself, nor any long-term plan for the future.Although trading can be unstable, it is relatively easy for me to control drawdowns, so my daily work tends to be routine and uneventful.The catalyst for my later unconventional actions and ultimately taking a leap of faith, was discovering a random social media post from a friend. I came across an acquaintance who I didn't know closely, but had opened a B&B.I knew she was a student of fine arts, with a good family background and job. Later, I learned that she did everything on her own - from selecting the location, opening the business, to decorating and buying furniture - to open a successful B&B. It took her several months and caused significant physical exhaustion.Comparing myself to her, I suddenly realized that I, too, used to be a person with dreams and aspirations. Have I been staying too long in my comfort zone?\"I'm not afraid of dying; what I fear most is being trapped in a state of comfort and security.\"This used to be my favorite line, and now it accurately reflects my current situation. When I see her, I can only think of one thing: those who are more outstanding than you work even harder than you.Perhaps it's due to my background in literature, but while I may lack the ability to govern a country or conquer the world, the desire to change my reality simmers deep within my subconscious. This can serve as a foundation for what I am capable of changing.From then on, I constantly yearned to break out of my own limitations, yet I found myself at a loss on where to start. My anxiety and restless state unwittingly affected my boyfriend, who understood my aspirations but was unsure how to help. He suggested pursuing further education in my field, but I was averse to simply seeking perfection in my current world. I desired to create something new and bold in an uncharted sky.So here lies the question - where is my sky? This is not a children's song where the destination can be found simply by singing alongI didn't choose a non-profitable industry, but rather an industry that won't lose money. It may sound clich√©d, but it's the truth. Reflecting on the words of the sages from over 2,000 years ago, they spoke of the fundamental desires of human nature - food and sex.Luckily, I'm not much of a cook, but I do have a fondness for snacking. That's why I decisively eliminated the food industry - I can't very well snack on my own inventory, can I?Finally, I chose to address people's sexual desires. It may come with its risks, but I understand! It's unavoidable! Selling sexy lingerie and other similar items can't be wrong, right?Alright, let's get serious. The reason why I chose this industry is because I believe that most women do not treat themselves well enough, and this is often due to a lack of self-awareness.We often suppress too many of our innate tendencies unconsciously.First and foremost, we are normal people, and it's important to remember that. We are a group with differences from men, but that doesn't mean we are without desires.We need to look within, confront ourselves, and accept who we are in order to better understand ourselves.We are naturally inclined towards beautiful attire, much like male birds in nature showcase their vibrant plumage.And thus, the online store for erotic lingerie with payment options in cryptocurrency was born - CRYTIC LADY (https://rocxykshop.com/)Even though it's currently a small shop and the world of cryptocurrency isn't fully mainstream yet, as long as we're determined to work hard and make it a success, there will surely be a day when we achieve our goalsLastly, I write this piece to commemorate the days of tranquility that are soon to pass, and to celebrate the wonderful beginning that I have achieved through hard work.Dedicated to all those who love me.",
