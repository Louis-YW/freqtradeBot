One of the most outstanding examples is Qatar 2022 Token, named after the football team in the upcoming World Cup, scheduled to be held in Qatar at the end of November this year. Especially on Pancakeswap, we can see the increasing development of this token with massive gains in such a short time. So is this project creditable or just another scam?

What really drives the value of this token?It is just another scam coin and nothing more, we have seen many tokens like this on the past, a few examples that come to my mind are the squid token and the many tokens which appeared after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, if you want to participate and invest in such a coin that is your decision, but do not forget that the world cup is about to begin and once the tournament gets closer to its conclusion the price of that token will crash hard, and if you are still invested at that point your losses will be massive.",

      "body": "create an altcoin just to take advantage of an event like the world cup, name Qatar to take advantage of the fact that they are organizing the world cup, this had to be a crime, this is a scam, this is a scam. a serious person, an ethical, honest person who has a desire to create something serious wouldn't do that, wouldn't take advantage of the world cup, honestly who the hell buys these shitcoins? What do these people think when they buy these kinds of things? I wonder: did the creators of this project speak with the qatar government? did the creators of this project talk to fifa? I think they didn't! Quote from: rodskee on November 07, 2022, 02:41:23 AMafter the world cup ,or even before it ends? this will die and again , crying greed people will be out .it's always like that, these greedy people don't think, they always put money in these meaningless altcoins and I don't understand how any exchange accepts to list this kind of shitcoin, this is unacceptable, someday governments need to start putting rules on exchanges and doing inspections on exchanges , people are losing money because of shitcoins they list",

      "body": "Another shitcoin that has no value whatsoever. Another bait for short-term speculators. Look at the chart of this coin, the price has dropped almost 5 times. This is the usual behavior of any fan token.Even if this token starts to rise, it's very short-lived and if someone sees too many mentions of it on Twitter or other social media, it means certain people have purchased this token and started shilling on all available media resources. It is definitely not worth buying tokens after that, let alone applying HODL strategy for them. These tokens have no future and will never appreciate in value over time. The sporting event will end and everyone will forget about these tokens. Although that could happen much sooner. In any case, DYOR.",

What really drives the value of this token?Qatar is more on a name of a country than a team and the event is also held in qatar? . On what exchanges this coin is available? But no doubt that it's easy to access and trade on pancakeswap than any other exchanges but its also easy for the tokens to come and go on here so we must be careful buying tokens on this exchange.You said it's development is increasing but what would that be? What is the utility of this token that they are developing? It could be possible that it is the one who drives the value of this token. Another possible thing which drives the value of this token is the hype because of the upcoming football event.",
