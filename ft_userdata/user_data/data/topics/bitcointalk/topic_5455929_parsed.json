What can I do to cancel or speed up the transaction?To cancel your transaction, you must have Replace By Fee opt-in for that transaction. If you have RBF, you don't need to cancel that transaction because you can bump the fee to a higher fee rate and get confirmations.Mempools are less congested in the last four days and your transaction should have better chance to have a confirmation today than 4 days ago.https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),4d,weightWhat is your transaction fee rate?",

In the case a transaction hasn't been flagged as RBF, you can't bump its fee, even if you import your wallet into a wallet supporting RBF.

Looking at the current mempool state, your transaction or the fee that you used is very low, and it might take sometime to be pickup by miners. Not sure if xverse wallet has RBF as others have said, if not, then you can't do anything about it but to wait. Usually transactions stays in the mempool for 2 weeks and it no miners pick it up, then it will revert back to your xverse wallet.Edit: unfortunately, the wallet does not support RBF or it might not have been activated.",

I have no problem waiting as far as I can get my asset back If you had marked the transaction as eligible for RBF, you could have resubmitted the transaction with a higher fee.But, because you did not or could not, your only option is CPFP, which is a technique in which the receiver sends the bitcoins they are receiving from you with a very high fee to somewhere else. The high fee motivates miners to confirm your transaction so that they can then confirm the new transaction and get its fee.However, since an exchange controls the receiving address and they are unlikely to help, you will just have to wait.",

We all know that it's getting expensive, but if you are in hurry then there's you have to bump your fee.",

Try the Replace-by-fee (RBF) option If your wallet supports the Replace-by-Fee feature, you can try increasing your transaction fee rate to make it more attractive to miners. This might help speed up the confirmation process. However, not all wallets or services support RBF, so check if this is an option for you.",

Because it is risky to save 2 or 3 sat/byte, in future, if OP faces with a situation like this, bumping the fee to get a confirmation next hours is better.Like fee rate from 10 to 12 sat/vbyte will be good if bumping fee rate is possible.Just a note for OP to learn and to use in future because with this case, OP only can wait.",
