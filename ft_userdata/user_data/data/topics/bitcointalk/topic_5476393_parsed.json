I’m thinking if the casino don’t catch the laundering activity(since launderer is now very creative to make it looks like they are legit player) while the authorities trace the source of money of launderer and end up to the casino. I’m not sure what will be the consequences by unintentionally allowing laundering on your service,",

We have seen users come to the forum to open scam accusation thread against casinos but after much investigation it would be as a result of the casino suspecting that their service was being used for money laundering and because of that they had to lock the account until proven otherwise. It’s going to be extremely difficult for the government to tag a casino as a tool for money laundering, unless that specific casino was created for that specific but masked it self as a casino to reduce suspicions but if you’re referring to a normal casino then my answer still remains “no”.",

Also money launderers wash dirty money which means they have nothing to lose with this kind of money so they don’t consider much the risk involved from gambling games unlike us that using regular money from our hard earned salary.They can simply bet high on low house edge games then recover their losses from the rakeback of their loyalty rewards.

So for the casinos, it can still be use for such, but the chances are highly minimal in my own opinion.Casinos can't be used to launder money without being traced, since the funds would go directly to a wallet address. That's for crypto users. Then the receiver still has to mix the crypto to be anonymous. Main reason the government is working hard on following up those mixers, it's the end process. Due to the fact most gamblers still require Kyc to deposit funds in any casino, just like in exchanges, casinos isn't a safe place for money launderers. Even, not all casino restrict withdrawals for gamblers, some casinos allow users to deposit and withdraw without gambling or winning a bet. Money launderers prefer mixers due to lack of KYC. Once those details are collected or even when fake documents are submitted, they'll be trails or traces. Where the law enforcement agencies find it difficult to trace a criminal is when they've left no loopholes of any kind. I think Op is just curious about this due to the recent ban of mixers. Because this forum get tagged whenever a mixer is closed by the government. It's bringing a bad name on the forum. Promoting casinos isn't wrong, we see ads on stadiums, TVs, radios and bill boards regarding casinos and gambling. Remember, the government use the money to finance the health of addicted citizens and the nation.",

So casinos will suspend the accounts of gamblers if they notice any form of money laundering activities,  this is why, sometimes you hear cases of gamblers' accounts being locked with funds in it and an investigation is being carried out,  so for that,  the government will only have problem with decentralized casinos and that is why you see most of them closing down the businesses due to such cases at that.",

Anonymity2. Money launderingWhile with the casino = must wager first, daily withdrawal limit, KYC on big withdrawal, also there will be connections between the user deposit address => casino hot wallet => the user withdrawal address (traceable).Money laundering on a casino is still possible, but ineffective and high risk for the money launderer.And if there is a casino seized because of money laundering then it will not affect other casinos at all nor their promotions/marketing everywhere including here on Bitcointalk.",

I’m sure a money launderer account will be a whale user with max tier VIP level.Money launderers are very intelligent people, they are always in a hurry, they are not scamming people to lose money in a casino. why would a scammer who stole 100 btc deposit 1 btc in a casino with high wagering requirements to lose all 1 btc? and even if these scammers managed to win, how long would he have to keep depositing 1 btc and risk losing until he was able to wash all 100 btc? This would take a long time and he would also run the risk of not having any BTC in the end, not to mention that the chances of going through KYC would be too high. a smart money launderer will not use online casinos to launder money, what could he do, would he create a casinoand with the casino he created, he could launder the money that he stole or that came from drugs or terrorists. it will not be a person who will deposit money to launder, for years that physical casinos have been used by criminals to launder money, for many years that hotels, especially luxury hotels, have been used for money laundering, governments are aware of this, So why don't all hotels close? The answer is very simple: because members of many governments own luxury hotels. Look at the people who appear to be the owners of luxury hotels, I'm not going to talk much about that here. but the reality is that online casinos are more likely to be free of money laundering compared to physical casinos and hotels and large companies. In my opinion, when governments persecute mixers, it's because mixer owners don't ask for KYC, which makes it difficult for governments to persecute terrorists they don't like. This has become a political and selective issue, because if governments were being fair they would start persecuting hotels and their owners, but they won't do that because they also own the hotels. I hope online casinos don't allow people to deposit a lot of money and withdraw without playing much at the casino, with the wagering and kyc requirements, casinos are on the right track in the eyes of governments",

So crypto criminals just looking for obfuscation don't need to use the same schemes. And what a random casino can provide for that, they can find it at exchanges. If crypto casinos are really concerned about money laundering/obfuscation, they just need to only allow withdrawals to the addresses used for the deposits and to require a proof of ownership of those addresses. It could be done by signing a message with the private key of the address or by sending a given amount to a given address.",

Also in my country, gambling is a legal activity and at that, and we have policies that mandate every deposit to meet some requirements before being withdrawable, so for gamblers, they already know that any deposits must meet such requirements so that is a bad market for money launderers since they may lose the entire deposits in the process of trying to meet the wagering requirements.",
