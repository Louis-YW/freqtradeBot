  "content": "Hello. A friend of mine has used the Trade Medex platform, and is having issues with withdrawing his funds. He went to withdraw the funds, and got told to complete an authentification process which would take 48 hours by the Escrow team due to the big amount hes withdrawing. They also want £23,000 which would be refunded after the process. He is unable to withdraw unless he stumps that money up. Mary-jane mcquillen - this is the person doing all the advising to him. Is he being scammed?",

Is he being scammed?Yes, your friend was scamed.I just googled the company number/license or whatever it is and it gave me another company exchange as a top result. https://www.google.com/search?q=ACN+127+606+348+and+NZBN+9429042567608Code:www.axi.comIt is impossible for different companies to have the same company number. I've honestly never heard of either one, but it seems like this is completely duplicated.",

      "body": "@scottfrazerIn addition to rat03gopoh's comment, the easiest way to find out if you're dealing with scammers is by cross-checking their \"Whois result\" with the dates that appear on their website [e.g. they're showing \"awards from 2019\", but that domain was \"registered in 2023\"].A few other fake platforms using that exact template:OpenMarketTraders.comTradeLivia365.comAvantMaxTrade.com",

      "body": "Mind you, no legit exchange or service would ask to deposit a huge sum first before you can withdraw. This is an extremely common scam scheme and should be noted for future reference.I also see that someone was advising your friend? did this internet stranger randomly slid to your friend's DMs? since scam DMs are very rampant as well. Pretty sure the \"Mary-jane mcquillen\" persona is affiliated with the scam website. Perhaps try to plant some seeds with this persona--lies? something like, your friend is starting to have doubts with trade medex cause they can't withdraw so friend is cancelling his plan of depositing an even larger money e.g. 6 digits lol.",

Mary-jane mcquillen - this is the person doing all the advising to him. Is he being scammed?£23,000 to withdraw, how much do he plans to withdraw? This is a scam that you respond to by saying, withdraw this amount from the balance and allow to withdraw the positive balance.Any service that asks you to deposit money in exchange for getting more free, fast and guaranteed money is a scam.Quote from: Potato Chips on October 22, 2023, 08:01:32 AMsomething like, your friend is starting to have doubts with trade medex cause they can't withdraw so friend is cancelling his plan of depositing an even larger money e.g. 6 digits lol.I am now interested in what balance these scammers have added to the @OP friend account in their database.",

That trading they did was fake and was pre-determined2. The money they are asking for will never be refunded. Remember that in crypto you cannot reverse a transaction on your own. If you have sent the money its GONE, no questions asked.Please try to ascertain where your \"friend\" got this site's link from and tell them to avoid such corners of the internet.",

If it is because the fake or scam exchanges are using something related to reward to lure people, it should be known that people should avoid too good to be true tactics of the scammers. Scammers try to pull this trick all the time.  They know folks get drawn in by new, unverified websites making big promises.  Crypto's the hot spot now because of everyone trying to strike it rich quick.  But yeah, you gotta watch out for deals that seem too good to be true and  that's usually a big red flag something shady is going on.",

I really wonder what's always with them that they can't even look for red flags on the search engines or ask for advice from experienced users?They only remember to do so after the money is gone. £23,000 needed to withdraw another amount that's stuck in the exchanges?

Tell him to suck it up and ignore their requests to send more money in order to get his initial deposit out as the only thing that can happen is that he loose even more money.

How they usually operate is that they have an army of \"pretty lady\" fake accounts that contact guys via social media platforms/dating apps, pretend to be interested and at one point they steer the conversation towards \"an excellent investment opportunity\" and the result is what see see in the first post of this topic.",
