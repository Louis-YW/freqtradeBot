When one wants to predict a game, you go through previous games how they play and there score and the qualify/skill of the club to the best of your knowledge, from there you can be able to make your decision about who is to be your winner or not, which will not be the same with other's production.  I believe these AI are built using the same idea, but since they are machines, they will be more calculative than humans, but they won't give 100% accuracy to all games, just as humans predict sometimes correctly and sometimes incorrectly. If anything makes this proposed project work successfully, then the casino's businesses will all be shut down for good. Everyone will want to use the AI to predict and win, and when there is no losing, the casino won't have anything to keep them going since they are likely profit-oriented businesses.",

So if AI is developed further and AI is made for gambling it will definitely work well. But with the popularity Ai is gaining, i think Ai will be used as a major tool for gambling in the future",

There is that probability, based on this video it's like fast-tracking the best gambling strategy that you can come out with so instead of experimenting and coming out with results based on trial and error you can actually come out but when it comes to implementation, it's up to you how you trust the method you created based on ChatGpt.Even though the video creator gives us a glimpse of a very good model on how to win in sports betting he still put this disclaimer because he knows that there is no perfect gambling strategy, everything is a probability, so take your risk if you are ok with it. QuoteFirst, a disclaimer - Do NOT invest any money in any type of sports betting bot or algorithmic engine that you are not willing to lose. I gave this sports betting bot money because I was willing to lose money to make a great video for my AI Wizards out there.",

I'm thinkin though that they are already working with the AI for their own benefit, most probably on looking for a cheater automatically and you'll get ban right away. So don't ever think that technologies will stop the house from winning, because they are more advance compare to the ordinary gamblers and they already know what to do counter such development with AI technology.",
