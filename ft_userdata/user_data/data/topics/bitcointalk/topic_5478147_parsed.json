If you can get serious with this forum, there is much to learn and the difference will be very obvious in the depth of your knowledge which will be deeper than that of some other people who know bitcoins but not in this forum.

OP, as long as you ask AI and post answers here that are not written by your hand and mind, you will not learn anything, neither about Bitcoin nor about anything else. AI forces a person to turn into the same thoughtless creature, which, after a post about protecting Bitcoins and using hardware wallets, forces the owner to create a topic about ignorance of the basics.Ask yourself: Is there any logic to your question after you wrote this post? Who are you trying to fool?Quote from: jojoalex on December 11, 2023, 11:23:16 PMTo keep your Bitcoin safe, use hardware wallets for cold storage, enable two-factor authentication on exchanges, regularly update software, and keep private keys offline. Consider using reputable wallets and staying informed about security best practices.The use of AI is not approved by the forum.
