  "content": "Some TA based on current price-movements and support zones now the market is moving again.. Personally, I'm anticipating a bounce from around $27,500 - $27,500, based on Daily, 3D and Weekly time-frames.Strangely enough the 200 moving average on each of these three time-frames are around the same price, for the first time in a very long time (can't remember last time).Daily time-frame: 200 MA @ $27,234. Bullish with 1 re-test as support in March and will continue to increase with price above $25KLikelihood of a bounce from the 200 Day MA remains likely based on previous bullish re-test and current market structure of higher high and higher lows. Price is currently around 3% from this level.3 Day time-frame - 200 MA @ $27,470. Still bearish and will continue to decline for next 4 months with price below $40KIn previous Bitcoin bear markets price has entered a long period of consolidation (9-12 months) post bear market and bear market relief rally when the 3 Day 200 MA is declining, with price generally remaining above it. This happened in both 2015/2016 as well as 2019/2020, so could potentially lead into 2024 given price only regained this level in June. Am otherwise anticipating for this level to hold as support, as it did in previous years when price reclaimed this level, with the likelihood of a re-test at some point later in the year or early 2024, as well as the case in 2016 as well as 2020.Weekly time-frame - 200 MA @ $27,441. Remains bullish after re-test in June and will continue to increase with price above $10KAlthough the 200 WMA seems less significant as support or resistance in the past year, it is none the less priced very close to the 200 Day MA that has acted in support in recent months, as well as the 3 Day 200 MA that has acted as support (once reclaimed) in recent years.Generally I think the chance of finding a \"co-incidental\" bounce from this level seems likely, as it will merely be the Daily/3D charts playing out in their usual manner. No doubt if price does turn this MA into new support, many will claim it will be because of it's significance, but personally I think will simpler be the lower time-frames that causes this to happen.TL:DR: After initially anticipating the likes of $40K-$50K this year for a dead cat bounce / bear market rally, it's now starting to look more likely for continued consolidation between $25K and $32K for the next few months in my opinion. Volume and momentum continues to decline for both the bulls and the bears while price action remains in a bullish structure on mid to long-term time-frames, with notable confluence of mid to long-term support around $27,000 to $27,500. The bears otherwise need to breach $25K in order to invalidate the higher highs and higher lows structure of the current uptrend.For fundamental analysis I recommend Glassnode's recent newsletter: Exhaustion and ApathyAnother bullish factor based on network strength: Hash Ribbons buy signal last week",

OP's 27k is still in play as support because we haven't seen a daily close below it, although this leverage liquidation may scare people into selling and prolong the correction.",

      "body": "So $27K has broken for now, only Daily time-frame at least, with a day and a half on 3D chart and the weekend left on Weekly chart. Price reached close to $25K on leverage exchanges with $500m liquidations.Currently one of the only reasons I don't see further downside imminently is that price has already reached considerably oversold level on Daily time-frame. The last time the RSI was this low was during January and June last year, which saw 40% increases from these lows during the bear market, even if price ended up going lower some months later.So despite $27K level failing to hold as support so far, price strength is suggesting this is the local low for now, or otherwise that price will need to consolidate at lower level in order for the RSI to cool off for price to go lower in the following weeks or months, but not in the coming days basically. Either that or the RSI can fall lower than 20 and a capitulation likely worse than the previous two will occur, suggesting that capitulation hasn't occurred yet within the current context of bear market / reovery, but I find that hard to believe. That said, it could take some time to reclaim $27-$27.5K support range now that price has fallen through.",

I hope to see a rise in bitcoin price soon.Elon Musk is not the only whale in the Bitcoin market, and despite the fact that he can play a vital role in the publicity of Doge or Bitcoin, perhaps he can't still control the market entirely. During times like this, there is usually a lot of panic selling, and if the selling is too high, it causes the price to drop significantly. With the current report about SpaceX selling Bitcoin, it just said they sold all Bitcoin holdings but never specified the amount of Bitcoin that was sold. I don't really think that Elon Musk is going out of Bitcoin to support Doge Coins, and you never can tell if this was a plot to acquire more of Bitcoin since the price drop. On Binance last night, as the price plunged, there was a buy order for 100 bitcoins that executed for around $25,600, just on Binance alone, not talking about other CEX. So, this was also a plot to buy more. Just don't believe that Elon Musk is leaving Bitcoin to support Doge Coin, and you will still be surprised to see news about Tesla buying some X amount of Bitcoin.",

They recently sell $373 million worth of Bitcoin. So bitcoin price dumping. Today near about 8% bitcoin price fall. And still dumping. Yesterday Bitcoin price dropped to $25400. I think new Support Zone is $25300, From here Bitcoin price will bounce i think and it will go $30k again. Your calculation and prediction was good i think, But it break Support Zone for SpaceX sold $373M worth Bitcoin.",

My anticipation this time is for the weekly scale to hit the bottom, the price has to go down to $18k for it to be considerably a good bottom before bouncing gain. For the speculators in the futures market to stop speculating, they'd have to move to the spot market or get liquidated and by that time, prices will go up. This kind of dip has always happ[en every time there is an exchange activating their futures market. This week it was Coinbase.",

It will be difficult because Elon owns companies that wants to create a greener and cleaner environment. Bitcoin is being denounced by the mainstream as a destroyer of the environment. This will not be good for his companies' public agenda.However, I speculate that he might do something with Dogecoin that might make it his companies' first coin of choice for adoption.
