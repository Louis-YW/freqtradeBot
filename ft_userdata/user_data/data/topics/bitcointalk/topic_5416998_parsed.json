If people is on poverty, They will not seek investment including crypto and will just prioritize personal necessities which is the reason why Bitcoin price is dumping.I'm suprised that Bitcoin price is still not dumping hard despite the consecutive inflation rate bad news. I believe there are whales that buying this dip.",

Inflation rate is now way up to range of that of 1982, do you think 10k BTC is certain at this point?$17k is still the bottom for bitcoin and we haven't seen it broken yet and hopefully that it's the real bottom.Any price is possible to be reached no matter how high or low the CPI is. But you know what? It won't be like this permanently, we're just ahead of the time and we might see that it will eventually go down.We're basically at the height of it but I believe that somehow it will be lessen and the impact of this inflation rate would go positively to bitcoin because that's what it should be and I want to see the inflation rate go down.",

Crypto too. I don’t know if $10k btc will happen but is not impossible I would say. It may go even lower than $10k if certain things happen.

They are highly correlated.Nasdaq follows the CPI data very closely because high CPI means higher fed rates which means stocks go down. And when stocks go down so does crypto.Eventually it’ll decouple but nobody knows when that will happen. Right now it trades as a risk on asset.",

On the contrary, we might have hit our bottom already at $17,500.",

As long as that keeps on going, we are not going to end up recovering from anything at all. Hopefully we could eventually recover with rates going down, but it may take a while.",

I believe there are whales that buying this dip.It's because most of the holders of bitcoin have the money and the means to carry on with their finances without having to sell their bitcoins for a quick buck. If bitcoin holders were also affected hard by the inflation, for sure you'll see the price rapidly going down but that's not the case. You still have a lot of people on the buying side somewhat providing balance after each heavy sells. But we all know inflation is a creeping beast, and it will slowly get on to bitcoin in the next coming months if it continued at this pace—which I think it will since the dollar is still getting stronger by the day and a lot of economies are being affected badly.",

If the founder doesn't have any spare money, altcoins are hard to save anymore. Everyone definitely doesn't want this big disaster to happen next yearfor me, that disaster may or may not happen. many people fear that bitcoin falling too deeply will be a disaster but sometimes that is not necessarily a bad thing, it will be a real test for the market. why in 2018 bitcoin also caused a terrible crash in the altcoin market like ethereum or BNB can still exist and thrive to this day and those who believe in them have achieved great success, especially with BNB. i think there is also a real challenge for today's top altcoins like solana, dot, avax, atom... are they really worth the investment?",

So far, the market is resilient to all these bad predictions, and I hope it can continue to withstand all this flood of FUDs. It's too early to talk about $10,000 when the market can successfully resist when the price drops to $14,000. I'm not sure bitcoin can spill down that much, it will cause a big panic.",
