Running an exchange isn’t a one time buy, it takes constant work to keep it secure and up and running all the time, this is serious software that can’t afford many mistakes, so you will need a team to handle this regardless. Your best bet would probably be networking with people that are interested in this and competent enough to pull this off correctly(rare). Go trough this plan again and ask yourself how you will be able to compete with established exchanges in terms of security, reliability,fees, UX and volume. It’s not impossible, but it needs good planning and smart decisions to pull off.Even if you find a one time buy, i would advise against it, because you might regret it later when something goes wrong and not being able to fix it yourself. Also you will custody other peoples money so be careful, this is a prime target for hackers or getting sued when something goes wrong and you didn’t secure it well enough.",

      "body": "Using other exchange's API to fulfill trades on your own exchange seems like an impossible idea  Your API access will be limited within first minute of operation even if there are only 50 users on your exchange lolThen there's the question of latency. You can't use multiple exchange's API without facing higher latency on most of them. Given how volatile crypto market is, most of your orders may not even get fulfilled due to added latency. Let's forget about the technical viability of this method and talk about the financial aspect.How will you make any profit on it?? Will you be charging double fees on every trade? Because you will have to pay a fee to those exchange too on each trade. If yes, then why will anyone use your exchange??What's your endgame bro",

It’s not impossible, but it needs good planning and smart decisions to pull off.Honestly, we don't need another centralized exchange in the first place; after all dozens exist already. It will also be impossible to enter this market anyway; the established giants can easily replicate any 'selling point' a new exchange is going to bring up, and kill it instantly. Be it sidechains, second or third layer support, or lower fees.There's one thing they can't do: be KYC-less and decentralized. I believe if someone wants to tackle a task as large as creating a whole new CEX, they should seriously consider building a DEX instead, to get more attention, users and competition in this field. Decentralized exchanges are much better for Bitcoin and all of its users, but that's a different topic. Just wanted to get this idea out there.Regarding the original question: you can't just buy some 'script or source code' and throw together an exchange like that. With the amount of money you'll need for personnel, lawyers, regulatory stuff and server hardware, getting someone to build you the software will be the last / least of your worries. Sort out the rest before; a 'script' alone won't help you much, buddy.",

      "body": "So are you planning to use API from Huobi or Binance?I don't know if it would be a good idea because of the charge fees if the exchange you are planning to build is buying and selling then withdrawal fees from the Binance exchange is currently expensive like Bitcoin and ETH except on other coins. If you don't have much knowledge in programming and it is for small business purposes in your local area. I suggest you can try to build and simple exchange site with WordPress and then use BTCpayserver plugin for Woocommerce payments there is two option the legacy and the v2 BTCpayserver for WP Woocommerce. Then use a free theme builder like Elementor to design your website. All funds are directly from your wallet so you need to host BTCpayserver on your own and if you want to accept other coins then you can add more but you need to host them on your own. Guides must be in BTCpayserver documentation.Here's a sample exchange design that I found on Google using elementor theme builderThe advantage is you don't need to hire someone to build an exchange script and you are far from scammers.",

In such case, it's still possible to enter the market.I don't see the necessity of a 'local' centralized exchange (besides the fact that I question the need for centralized exchanges for 99.99% of their users in the first place).Quote from: ETFbitcoin on June 23, 2022, 12:20:28 PMAnd you remind me some country also require cryptocurrency exchange to have some amount of reserve money.How is a country's money reserve tied to an exchange business being located in that same country?",
