Do you think it would be perfect to invest in Bitcoin now or should I wait for a few more days to get a good DIP? I am actually very weak in analysis so I would like to know from your personal analysis that Bitcoin can go below 20k again?It's on a dip now so from $28k, I've seen it drop today to $26k. The possibility of bitcoin going down to $20k is there but, it may not go back there anymore too. As usual with these predictions and scenarios, we can think of it. What's best is to just DCA on it, maybe on a weekly basis or every time you see the price of bitcoin go on a correction. Because we don't know how low it may get or how quickly it will go to the other high price levels that we're waiting for.Quote from: bittraffic on March 22, 2023, 07:58:44 PMWhat I can say is that you will get the highest return if you hold past the halving in 2024.And that's why for him, DCA is the best strategy to make.",

Looks like we got a dip alright, and not the delicious kind you'd find at a party. I guess this is why they say timing is everything when it comes to investing.As for whether it's the perfect time to invest in Bitcoin, that's always a tough call. It's hard to predict the future of any investment, especially one as volatile as cryptocurrency. But hey, if you're a believer in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and you're comfortable with the risk, now might be as good a time as any to buy in. Quote from: Perfectos on March 22, 2023, 06:45:46 PMI am actually very weak in analysis so I would like to know from your personal analysis that Bitcoin can go below 20k again?Of course, there's always the possibility that the market will dip even further in the coming days or weeks. But as they say, you can't time the market perfectly, and it's hard to say whether Bitcoin will dip below $20,000 again or continue to climb. Sometimes you just have to take the plunge and hope for the best.",

So what you should do at this mixed market stage is to DCA and see how it goes. But if you feel you want to invest everything at once I will say u should be reluctant because even this 27k price tag is still low enough to gain considering the current ATH. Should we get another ATH then you could be having 2.5x+ of your investments.",

Therefore, it's important to invest only the amount you can afford to lose and diversify your investment portfolioI am also agreeing with you in this point that now it is 27.3k is enough good dip for holding or investing on bitcoin because if you see the ath of it , it is still more than 2x . But seeking for more profit will not that bad idea for now cause I think bitcointalk can slip again from this current price because market is so unstable and I don't see any upper resistance for pump. So I think investment can be done by observing some more time .",

Unfortunately, we're done with the dip, the market is now recovering, you never have to wait for the dip but instead, make a decision to buy now. If were you, I'll take the opportunity while the price of Bitcoin isn't surpassing $30k as any of these days it might be going there.

No one can tell what will happen but if we base up on the stats we can figure some things that price pump which can reach up to ATH is really possible.
