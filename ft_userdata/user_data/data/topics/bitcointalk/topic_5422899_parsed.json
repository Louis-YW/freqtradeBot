  "content": "The collapse of a major crypto exchange, has once again taken the world by storm. There is a lot of FUD being spread by mainstream media, making people believe this is the final chapter for crypto/Blockchain tech. Now, US lawmakers are pushing towards stricter regulations with the excuse of helping protect investors' interests. Other countries could follow the US, greatly stifling the growth of the industry. I'm beginning to wonder whenever the collapse of FTX would be good or bad for crypto in the long run? This looks like another Mt. Gox situation, so it's likely things will be better in the long run after the dust settles. But I'm not so sure, especially when governments are now seeing crypto as a threat to the existence of Fiat (something they didn't think about when crypto was in its early years).What are your thoughts? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

Have you seen any FUD from previous hacks on other exchanges and issues with LUNA? None anymore and that means the market already move on and more ready to face the future. We are getting wiser now.",

In the long run, that will make everyone think that it's good to store their cryptos through the wallets where they can hold the private keys.Unlike storing it on the exchanges like FTX, they have no control to the funds that they put there. So, anything can happen to it depending on what will happen to that exchanges.",

That's why massive migration happened for the liquidity from cex. - It reveals how shady the exchange site and lending platforms wereBad things- it affects the movement of crypto market in long term and triggering the trust issue by investors to the crypto- It was also making government to make intervention to the crypto with stricter regulation which is not goodAs biden has called for more stricter regulation for crypto and it was giving more bad sides rather than good sides. FTX's case was actually bad for the long term run of crypto. It was hurting so many people caused by they were loosing their money.",

Who knows what will happen to these major exchanges but my question is why is it they always triggered after the bull run? Is it just a coincidence?Seems like there's something controlling the market or so but whatever, their effect is just temporary to the community and it is somehow making the price to go down a bit so that investors will have a time to accumulate and wait for the bull run again.",

I know some people will say that it's good to get rid of rotten apples, and yeah they are sort of right, but replacing them with tougher regulations won't be as fun as people think.And everywhere i read about it, ignorant people mock and ridicule cryptos now being a scam. Uneducated people get invited to talk in news to tell that prices of cryptos were based on nothing. Those who mock loudest have a big cheering audience of followers and those will get wrong data what really happened.The underlying issues how ever are worse, i would compare it to banks and say that if they mess up, they get bailed out. In fact Binance would probably bailed them out if what they did wasn't so messed up.But i really even can't because to my knowledge even failed banks that got bailed out haven't messed up this way. We have just funded most unprofessional company with billions of dollars. Incompetence and carelessness of Sam was surreal in hindsight, they had no safe measures and it was huge FU to any kind of risk analysis. And new stuff that gets revealed like a billion dollar loan to Sam doesn't really help the situation. Even their company's psychiatrist is leaking out info that makes me think that they did even hire such incompetence on that sector that no one else would.",

Heck, it being revealed this early on just led to the issue ending early which lead to reduced damages as well. Sadly, the damage is still damaged so it's there to remain. There's also the idea that it enforces not your keys not your coins type of thing since a lot of people got hurt because of that. I do want to increase regulations though so this being brought into the spotlight might make that faster for the sake of new crypto users. Still a pretty bad thing for most people that got hit though.",

If more and more people choose to have self-custody, then it is good since, in a truly decentralized coin, it will wholly benefit the user itself. So, the kind of regulation that isn't specifically attempting to harshly control the user-side interaction with cryptocurrency, it won't be too concerning.The problem is, IIRC, there was a regulation attempt where crypto wallet developers are forced to implement an address verification mechanism that will be tied to personally identifiable information. I forgot the exact issue, but I'm sure at some point it has been talked about. With that in mind, then surely this kind of draconian regulation will harm crypto, especially those who do not have strong decentralized roots community.",

But as the problems faced by FTX went on and SBF's attitude did not give a sorry response, eventually news continued to develop and news about the FTX hack as the cause of FTX's collapse grew stronger and was claimed to be the main problem. it's just an issue made up to avoid hatred for the founder of FTX and for FTX itself.The collapse of FTX has an impact on public distrust of centralized exchanges because the risk of losing assets is very large. But I don't think this will last long term. The trust of crypto users will return if a centralized exchange provides security guarantees for investor assets. this is a new history for crypto about the collapse of extreme centralized exchanges.",
