I saw a figure of 8.6 million in seized crypto assets in another news page. They intend to return the money to the victims....Yes, as per reported,QuoteThe Justice Department today announced a multinational operation involving actions in the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Romania, and Latvia to disrupt the botnet and malware known as Qakbot and take down its infrastructure. The Qakbot malicious code is being deleted from victim computers, preventing it from doing any more harm. The Department also announced the seizure of approximately $8.6 million in cryptocurrency in illicit profits.https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/qakbot-malware-disrupted-international-cyber-takedownI'm not just sure though, how big (or small?) it was as compare to others organizations that they have dismantled around the EU region, specially around Russia and Ukraine.Perhaps it might be better if you can moved it in this board: Legal.",

I'm still seeing a lot of ransomware news on news websites like Bleepingcomputer though. Not really surprising even if they use cloud computing or whatnot, since some of them still rely on insecure methods like SIM authentication just like what. has been reported a few days ago. At the very least there is progress and people can expect they will get jailed sooner or later, although relying on government agencies to stop them is not the best choice.",

I'm happy this happened to these bad actors, either through Fiat or Crypto, any ill gotten source of making money must be put an end, it's for the greater good. Even privacy coins are facing high delisting on popular exchanges like Binance, they have no choice since there is no way to keep track on bad actors like these, Horizen had no choice but to distant itself from been privacy anymore, the pressure from regulators is high and to keep things in business they choose to stay away from privacy. I hope the law keeps working and bringing these people down on their knees to face charges.",

I am shocked to read, this bot is in working from 2008 and now it is being seized. I mean after a long period. I think they must found a good alternative to it. As market is full of competitors and this is just a single bot which was in working from that long and in that time many others also came into being. PS: I hope the funds will be returned back fast. As market need more money (hehe).",

Which made him eligible for the radar of authorities. Is there any criteria to be on the radar of agencies? It is not a taunt because I cannot make one; I am just being curious. I mean, if a thing or app is used for scamming purposes, then the use and sale of that app must be prohibited, and the servers and operators running them must be seized.I agree with you that, like mixers, they got seized after a long time of money laundering in the same way. These bots were banned. I do not think the reason for this long-awaited ban on bots is due to the fact that it was not on the radar; instead, agencies might not have some solid proof to react. Because most of the time, proof is the main thing needed to go against someone. especially when you are saying that you are not looking at people's devices and at the same time they are looking, meaning spying, but they cannot declare that, so they have to go the other way around.",

I mean it is not like becoming a victim of ransomware was the only way for them to lose access to their data, and even I, a random computer user has backups of my data, so in a way it is incredible all of those businesses which were affected by ransomware could run their operations without something that I consider to be incredibly basic for any business.",

Officially, the matter is very clear, cryptocurrencies are sold and the money goes to the state budget.You know what's even more ridiculous about your statement? That do you think that the US should give up investing in its military budget and thus buy a bunch of shitcoins or Bitcoins and then use them to defend itself in the event that there is a threat to national security A question for you - how much BTC could the US buy if all the money from the military budget was diverted to Bitcoin?
