  "content": "Interesting article to keep up with the Crypto currency's behavioral changes as well as making the right choices every time. Was reading through it, it's an old article from last year but it could point us in the right direction. It just shows cases of how every crypto is behaving these days and what action we should have so that we can make proper investments for life. Considering the crypto volatility, prices are always swinging by and hence it always makes it difficult for us no matter how much we control our emotions while investing. If the amount of investment is very large then it could be hard to keep up with the market. Many times people end up with FOMO investments too. The article also focuses on long-term investments. This one is my favorite because well, it rules out the possibility of heavy losses over the course of time. For example, we can easily perform DCA investment if it is long-term and bring down our average price. With time demand is gonna be up at least for the coins like Bitcoin and thus could make it a highly profitable investment. The article does suggest the use of bots for trading. Now I am not sure if the writer is a keen investor and trader or not, but bot is something I dislike all the time. Considering the fact that trading itself is majorly risky due to its volatility, it's always better to make with our own research, technical and fundamental aspects shall always be studied before investing. This is just to make you motivated with the crypto industry. Which one is your favorite? QuoteTop 10 Cryptocurrency Secrets UnleashedBe Prepared for the Price SwingsEvery investment has its own set of features that keeps them afloat., Similarly, the cryptocurrency market is filled with volatility. When you are buying a cryptocurrency, it indirectly means that you are signing up for the ups and downs it leverages. Sometimes, short-term steep falls are rise might even shock the investors. However, these are very common in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and you might actually yield profits from this. If you keep a close track of the growth and follow experts who are accurate about predictions, then you can invest in certain digital tokens and get your hand on good profits.  Keep a Constant Check on Its PerformanceEven if you are not a full-time cryptocurrency investor and is doing it on the sidelines for profit, you need to keep a constant tab on the price swings. Although a 24/7 observation is not needed, checking them at constant intervals is a good thing. The more complicated your investing strategy becomes, the more you should review it. While this might seem to be a thing for short-term investors, long-run investors can also follow these criteria to keep a healthy investment.  Do Your Own Research and Manage the Risk FactorsA global fact is that cryptocurrency trading is a high-risk business and more traders lose than not. Therefore, don’t get tempted to add more value to your investment portfolio once you see a profit. Most importantly, don’t take other investors’ advise on what cryptocurrencies to invest in. Every digital token has its day! Bitcoin was at an all-time high just last November and now it is down like crazy. Therefore, do your own research before investing.  Opt for the Long-Term InvestmentFear of Not Missing Out (FOMO) and panic selling is very common things in the cryptocurrency market. Currently, people are trying to get rid of their Bitcoin investments before they could fall further and eat up their potential money. Similarly, six months back, investors went crazy over the Shiba Inu rally and many beginners tried their hand on the memecoin. Although these are the factors by which the cryptocurrency market functions, opting for the long-term investment plan is the best way to yield profit.  Choose the Right Platform to TradeEven if you have picked a cryptocurrency in mind to trade, choosing the right platform also matters. While picking the platform, make sure it abides by all the regulations of the country you are living in. Other factors like exchange liquidity, asset liquidity, and fees need to be clarified before investment. Explore the other features in the platform while you are trading in it.  Use Trading BotsTrading bots are becoming a common thing in the cryptocurrency market. They are automated software tools investors use to buy and sell financial instruments at a preconfigured time or when predefined conditions are met to maximize profits. Generally, trading bots identify the market trends and suggest investors invest in cryptocurrencies that give increased profits and reduced loses and risks.  Cryptocurrencies Can’t be Completely Wiped OutAlthough countries might try to bring regulations on cryptocurrencies and their trading, a complete ban is impossible because anybody can own a wallet. Even if the country bans digital tokens, people can still use foreign accounts to trade them. Tech-savvy investors are also in the top of following such tactics. However, major countries won’t even consider banning cryptocurrencies as they know how much people have invested in them.  Digital Tokens can Come Under TaxationWhen Bitcoin made its debut in 2009, the whole concept of cryptocurrency was new to even government agencies. But over the decade, central authorities have become more aware of digital tokens and the profit investors yield. Therefore, many countries are coming up with effective taxation regulations that could come into effect in the coming months or years.  Keep the Asset Safe at the Right PlaceCurrently, there are two types of storage in the market. One is hot storage and the other is cold storage. While hot storage refers to an online digital wallet, cold is an offline wallet that is typically stored on a hard drive. According to experts, keeping your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet is the safest way to protect it from hacks and mishaps.  Try Out Technical AnalysisIf you are a pro in investing, then try out technical analysis tools to choose the right cryptocurrency. Technical analysis involves using mathematical indicators and chart patterns to try and predict which way the process will move next.Top 10 Cryptocurrency Secrets Unleashed!

Opportunities are many are with crypto, trading it is one of them and the most wonderful aspect that can make traders to get rich easily and much. The problem with it is that trading is hard and it can be deceiving one until all the money is lost. Finding the best knowledge and trading experience can lessen this risk. The risk is the reason for most to prefer the owning and holding, but it must rise to make any gain and can be tempting.",

If you only use the DCA method, you don't need to use bots, so buying and holding is as simple as that. Didn't you say long-term investment and the contrast is based on DCA? This means that it doesn't matter what the price of Bitcoin is when you are accumulating, you only need to place an occasional purchase and then save it.Of course bots will not be useful for DCA except for day traders who do have fast trading paths. Maybe it still makes sense to use bots.From the 10 points above, for me to be long-winded, the accumulation plan will be very direct in a certain period of time. no need to check prices every time, no need to use bots, no need to keep checking their Performance Constantly, and so on, just accumulate and store in cold wallets.",

I have been a victim of altcoin I was deceived by some project owners who promised their token getting 10$ per token initial from $0.0009 in me I said of holding for long then, I never knew bear was around the corner all of the sudden not barely good 2  to 4 months the bear showed up and it was to hard in way I couldn't have that feeling of selling of my investment. So I had this hope thinking there will be a corrections maybe if the bear ends the project would still continue their promises and to what they had on their roadmap, surprisingly the bear came and knocked the project till date I haven't heard anything from them and as a matter of fact I have 0$.000 on the token which worth nothing currently, and before I knew it there was no liquidity and that was the last breath of the project till date. So with this ugly situation I decided to stay away from altcoins alternatively i may buy but whenever I noticed any changes I will quickly sell off my holdings to secure my capital.",
