We are also active on social media platforms, so be sure to follow us on Twitter and join our Telegram group to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.I checked out your website and I must say, I did not find a whitepaper or roadmap anywhere! Are you guys trying to keep the suspense going? Or is it just a covert strategy? I am sure you have some top-secret plans up your sleeves for revolutionizing DeFi with your POOPU (sorry I meant to say pupu) token, right? All jokes aside, when it comes to investing your hard-earned money, it is always important to do your due diligence. So, until PUPU decides to provide us with a little more information, I think I'll stick to good old advice: only invest in projects with a solid track record and a clear vision for the future.",

Quote from: riverdip on April 23, 2023, 10:58:11 PMWhile we do not have a traditional whitepaper or roadmap, we do have a clear vision for PUPU. Dude, you are literally contradicting yourself.And what is your vision, really? Is it more of a throw-it-and-see-what-sticks approach, or do you have a more deliberate plan in mind?",
