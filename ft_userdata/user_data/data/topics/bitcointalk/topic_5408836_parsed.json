The intention is to \"obscure the ownership of the crypto exchange\".In another source mentioned WazirX has been acquired by binance and somewhat surprising they only have 4 employees including the founder which probably large operations that require more teams will not be carried out at the head office. This may be close to the accusations about the \"web of agreements.\"",

Binance buying them over is new to me, as is allegations that they're helping sanctioned parties (it's not specifically said but this has got to be what's meant).But really, are we surprised?",
