  "content": "There are a couple of moderately interesting developments with PCGS: 1. They graded some Satori coins. They chose to actually grade them too versus going the route of ICG which just verifies that it is authentic2. A Denarium was graded for the first time. So, this bumps the the coins they are willing to grade up to 5 (Cas, Lealana, BTCC, Satori, Denarium). I heard they rejected quite a few others, including CI coins. 3. There was some reluctance in the past with Buyer Funded / Unfunded coins. I tried to get a couple of Lealana Buyer Funded graded last year and they were rejected. PCGS recently graded a ton of Buyer funded coins. Steeley",

Â Also, how in the hell CI isn't up there but Titan is??? Â Also, I can confirm that my CI submission was rejected as they stated they don't grade this maker yet and that was a little over a month and a half ago.",

You are beating a dead horse as you just say it over and over and nobody agrees or disagrees really.... Personally, regardless of that opinion, NON-buyer funded will always command a higher premium, as the buyer paid extra for smoothie's personal verification and shipping. Regardless I think any coins from Smoothie/Lealana are in high-demand whether or not they are BF, as they will indeed be worth a fortune someday regardless IMO, but only time will tell if this actually comes true ofc. I actually have never bought any buyer-funded coins from smoothie. I like my coins with PGP certs etc etc... Provenance will be key someday as well I think but who knows... Fakes may fuck things all up, but again, nobody can predict the future...",

      "body": "You know all about beating dead horses? you do it on a million subjects here and in truth most everyone does.Though I dont feel that I am beating a dead horse - I have had conversations with people just this week that thought Smoothie actually personally funded the coins... There are people that just don't get it. Â So, Â I will keep saying it - all his coins are buyer funded - the ones that don't say it still are though.In the end, I am simply stating the truth.And I do understand people are willing to pay more for one without the \"buyer funded\" text - not me though. And in my opinion anyone willing to pay more for a buyer funded lealana just because it does not say it is buyer funded is an idiot - there is no difference other than the hologram.One simply needs to use the laser etched address on the coin and verify the funds personally. edit: to be clear, my point is that all that matters is verifying if the address/key are the ones smoothie applied. If so, any value assigned to a coin simply because it doesn't say \"buyer funded\" is asinine. The provenance is the same for both",

Their criteria is a bit of a mystery. Krog coins should make it at some point though. We'll see. They obviously are moving slow and will add others. Also, on another note, I just found out they also grade coins for Niue. So, the miner coin and the bitcoin coin are in their population report.",
