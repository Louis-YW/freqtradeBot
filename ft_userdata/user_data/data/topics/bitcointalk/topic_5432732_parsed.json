  "content": "Hey Everyone,Happy New Year! This website used to be an online bitcoin gambling hub HQed out of the virgin islands. I would go here sometimes to get some free sats and free spins in games. Some of my friends have won a considerable amount of bitcoin through this website. They had an incentive to hold bitcoin in their address sort of like blockfi used to have where you got like 4% interest or something like that (bad idea). A lot of people who held their coins on there have certainly lost them all. SMH.Anyways, I just went to go back and check it out, it appears that this web prompting popped up leading me to believe that they have closed shop permanently probably due to a scam or government shutdown? Or just simply moved to a new web address (which I can't find): \"This site can‚Äôt be reachedThe webpage at https://freebitco.in/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED\" Is anyone familiar with this gambling page, and does anyone know what happened to it? What is strange is that I am still getting emails from their domain email address but the website is still not showing, just odd. Maybe i'm doing something wrong or I need to try on another browser. This is my first post in the gambling section, and I plan to make many more informative posts such as this. Cheers, TREAD",
