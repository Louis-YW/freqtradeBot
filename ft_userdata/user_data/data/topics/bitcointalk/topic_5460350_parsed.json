Their account is not deleted but they just use anonymous posting feature before thatâ€™s why their account is displayed anonymous until now.Just delete all your post in the forum and report to moderators all the thread or post that canâ€™t be deleted. Just include the reason and Iâ€™m sure it will be deleted.You can contact @tryninja, @loyceV and other user that scrape data to remove your post history. I get now your concern.",

It's written all over that op isn't interested in telling why he wants his account deleted which could be personal. And since deleting the account is not doable he should abandon the account and go about his normal life. Who knows, perhaps in the near future he might have reasons that may bring him back to the account and the account haven't default can still be used any point in time.",
