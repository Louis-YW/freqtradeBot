Trustwallet is close-source and there is no way to know how the keys have been generated. It may be worth mentioning that you should never trust your memory.

Always use a form of offline backup(s).Quote from: sima_sara on September 11, 2022, 05:56:44 PM2. do people keep millions worth of crypto in trust wallet?Crypto are stored on the blockchain, wallets only allow you access it through your private keys.Preferably bitcoins worth above $1k should be stored in a hardware wallet or airgapped device.Quote from: sima_sara on September 11, 2022, 05:56:44 PM3. any chance of your trust wallet account getting frozen like they might do on exchanges?On a custodian wallet, the risk for this is very present and high. Trust wallet is non custodian, so not likely. But, it's not recommended cause it's closed source.",

So don't know if trust wallet also asks in the future. Though it says community-driven we know it's Binance wallet. I won't prefer a trusted wallet to store a big amount there. It's better then buy a hardware wallet and secures your funds. Doesn't matter if it's a billion, you haven't to worry.",

There is no chance as long no other person have access to your seed phrase or private keys. And a suggestion from me is that you should to buy a hardware wallet, hardware wallets are top notch in security. Quote 2. do people keep millions worth of crypto in trust wallet? The answer is yes, but I would not advice to do it, if you have such money, then get yourself a hardware, it is far more secure than trust wallet.

Your \"phrases\" (actually your seed) is how your private keys are derived. As long as no one has access to your seed, it is not possible to ever steal your coin (to \"hack\" your \"wallet\"). Obviously, if your phone were to become infected with malware, or if it were to otherwise become compromised, there is a risk that someone can steal your money. I would also point out that (trying to) memorize your seed is a bad idea. You should keep backups of your seed in a medium of storage that is less fragile than your memory (brain).",

Trust wallet might be good as your hot wallet, not your cold wallet.Quote3. any chance of your trust wallet account getting frozen like they might do on exchanges?This is a noncustodial wallet but it's a closed source wallet, being a frozen account is unlikely to happen. Quote4 ....You can purchase in any crypto exchangers that support crypto credit cards, but don't forget to transfer it into a noncustodial wallet or an open-source wallet which is really safe to store your Bitcoin and transfer it into a custodial wallet when you wanted to convert into fiat.",

Your wallet is unlikely to get hacked. Of ourse unless the seeds generated by trustwallet aren't completely random and someone finds a way to reproduce them. In this case not only you but all trustwallet users will be in danger of getting hacked. Quote2. do people keep millions worth of crypto in trust wallet?No one can know which wallet was used to generate an address expect the person who owns it. Besides, coins are stored on the blockchain not the wallet itself.
