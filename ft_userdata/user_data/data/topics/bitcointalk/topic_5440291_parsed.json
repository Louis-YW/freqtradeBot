  "content": "My advice to Satoshi miners is that the CoreDAO prove that the SATOSHI Project Team is behind this because looking at the project's features, I'm confident that the price will also be enormous. Satoshi offers great chances for miners by providing free mining, so they should avoid selling their core coins to investors at a loss. Instead, they should hold onto their coins or delegate them to prevent investors from controlling the system.",

Please provide more details.There are so many coins/tokens being released with the same claims that they are better than Bitcoin or other popular coins, solve scalability issues, etc and sooner or later they end up dead due to lack of usage or just bad development in general. Some of them are just forks of one over another so their innovation is actually just releasing the same network under different names. At the end of the day, regardless of how cool your project is, if no one is using it then your coin is just another shitcoin waiting to die.Quote from: Babamann on February 19, 2023, 11:06:26 AMüëç Thanks you for not make me confused to deferential between Bitcoin amd other coin.Beware of claims like \"continuing satoshi legacy\", \"the real satoshi network\", etc. Most of the time they just modify some parts of Bitcoin code and release it on their own after doing some premine so they can dump on other users when the coin gets a bit popular. You should read more about it so you can develop an awareness if a new project is trying to scam you. Some tokens also do things like this btw, so it is not exclusive to mineable coins. CMIIW.",
