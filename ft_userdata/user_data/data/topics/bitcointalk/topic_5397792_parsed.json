It will be a matter of time until the prices of LHR cards rise, while FHR cards decline. But I would wait for another 1-2 weeks so the recent downturn in BTC/ETH price is reflected in video card prices.Quote from: rdluffy on May 08, 2022, 06:27:21 PMI don't plan to buy any other cards right now, I'll continue to mine with the cards I already have and it's already paid, but it will be interesting enough to follow the changesThat is what I will be doing as well. Now that BTC is cheap, I'll dollar cost average all mining revenue into buying BTC. At the end of the year, I'll decide whether or not to build more rigs. If PoS gets delayed or the PoS merge already happened, I will build a lot more rigs.",

The longer manipulators hold this 30k btc the greater the chances remain for btc to stay at 30k, every year btc is more valuable but right now is at 10k true value, maybe next year btc true value can reach around 15k - 20k. Anyway, my point is right now is much better to mine btc than to buy btc, if btc crashes to 13k or lower then is much better to buy btc than to mine.",

This is how conditions were during 2019. What will probably happen is ETH will be unprofitable and most GPU rigs will be mining FLUX/RVN/FIRO/etc. That's what happened in 2019; GRIN provided double the revenue of ETH.Even at 7¢/kWh, the power cost will be $0.45/day. That leaves us with $0.40 of profit on average. Even if you bought the RTX 3080 for just $400, it would take > 3 years to pay it off. The only hope would be another GPU gold rush.Quote from: YellowSwap on May 09, 2022, 10:08:30 AMTo mine 1 btc you need right now around 10k usd, so idiots are overpaying to buy 1 btc right now, they are overpaying 300%, bear market btc value is very close to mined valueIt is much more expensive than $10k to mine a Bitcoin. Let's assume a farm buys an Antminer S19 95T for $6000 (includes buildout cost) on 5¢/kWh power. The power cost per day is around $4.00. Let's depreciate this miner over 4 years, which is $4.11/day of capital cost.Cost to run the S19 = power + capital cost = $8.11/dayBitcoins earned = 0.000407Cost to mine a Bitcoin = 8.11 / 0.000407 = $19,926So it's ~$20k to mine a Bitcoin for the average farm out there. I plugged less efficient and more efficient ASICs into this equation, but the end result is the same.",
