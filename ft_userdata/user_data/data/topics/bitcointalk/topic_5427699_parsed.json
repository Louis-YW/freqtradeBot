This is just a hype token so obviously it will react to any sport events that Brazil is involved.So maybe the fans and token holders are disappointed that their team lost in the World cup against Croatia and that is the main reason why suddenly it went down 60%. I'm not surprised by the price movement, it is what it is. It was created for their sporting fans so a single mistake will trigger this kind of downfall.",

We can't expect anything from this coin price as it's just pump and dump from their team result.  My advice is stay away from this kind of coin, as it has nothing to add and grow in the future.",

Tokens like this doesn't have that much utility so who will buy and use this? Does this mean that this token will only rise when the Brazil Football team wins a game? Kinda bad in my opinion, It would be better to just gamble and bet the money to a betting site atleast there are sure returns when the team you like wins. I'm not just fan of this kind of token. I know that there are many die hard football fans out there and some want to make profit out of it but I will suggest to just put your money on something logical like betting or straight up into bitcoin.",

Yes, this is like the first reaction of a country that has a huge fan based of football. This could be one of the shocking results in the World Cup but their fans should accept the lost. And others have pointed out, this is just a meme coin, so we need to be very careful as this could be used for pump and dump and this is a classic example.As the World Cup come to an end to them, I don't think there will be any used of this token, so again another reason to dump it huge.Nevertheless, the same with Croatian team, they have their own token if I'm not mistaken.https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatian-football-federation-present-vatreni-crypto-token/",

But I think this price drop will be temporarily only, the price seems to increase again gradually.Anyway, this type of fans token is very easy to influence by the current situation of the football team. That's why I am not interested to invest in fans tokens. I think investing in fans tokens (ex: Brazil fan token) is almost the same as gambling.",

So the price of the ARG coin before the start of the World Cup was about $9, and now, when the Argentine national team reached the semi-finals of the championship, the price of the coin is $3.78.",

Maybe it let's you get closer to that team and then it can give you discounts to the merchandise that they are selling. Not sure if that can be considered to as a utility but that was better than if the token is built for pumping and dumping alone. They don't mention if it's an NFT so I won't say that it was some sort of a collectible but it was still up to the person if he will treat it as one.It's only amazing that this coin movement is related to the result of the match. Maybe people who owned the token sold their token out of disappointment but that tells them that they are only going in for the hypes. They are not a solid fan.",
