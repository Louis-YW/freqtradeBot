Humans can have one behavior today and change tomorrow to something better or worst. That is just how people are. You can see someone that give the testimony that after he become a religious person, that he is no more gambling again. You can see someone that sees it as fun because not all they call a sin in a religion that some people think are sin, example is fun gambling (and not addiction gambling) and moderate drinking of alcohol. But in short, people are different and people's way of thinking are different. Religion may let someone not to gamble again but some people will continue to gamble. That is just how people are.",

Gambling is forbidden by Islam but I know one of my neighbor still doing it despite that its been discourage to do on their religion. So having this said its still depends on the person since no one can stop each individual to participate on activities related to gambling. Maybe there's a time they would stop buy for sure they came back especially when they start to get bored then still have an access to any gambling platform.",

It is true that religion alone may not be the sole determining factor for someone to change their behavior. Ultimately, it is up to the individual's personal beliefs, values, and choices. Religion serves to teach people what is considered right or wrong, but the acceptance and adherence to these teachings depend on the individual's own decisions and level of commitment.",

So, those who are merely converts may not stops gambling and until they understand the things of their doctrine and have fear to follow those things carefully may lead them to stop gambling, hence if the spirit is not convinced and the body is willing such person would certainly go back to gambling. Until the body and souls is routed and convinced then such persons will definitely quit gambling and must not be given a space otherwise whenever he comes to his carnal body he might go back to his past did.",

If a religion that someone chooses abhors gambling, they have to change to become strong devoted believers of that religion. A new convert may struggle with his addiction to stop because he just got converted, but as he increases his devotion to his religion, it can help them gain self control of themselves and strong discipline to stop gambling.",

If you have ever been under a religious teaching consistency you would understand that religion is influential. It has the power to change anybody's behavior gradually and sometimes immediately. The teachings of some founders of these religions are inspirational and you can accept them without rational thinking. These religions also have good counselors that are experienced in handling many kinds of disorders. I was counseled by a religious marriage counselor and I find her advice valid today. But stopping gambling also requires the willingness of the gambler. If you are not determined to tackle gambling addiction these religious teachings will not influence you. You should accept that you have a problem and you must show readiness to control your gambling activity.Continuing to play in the secret is hypocrisy. It shows that you are not a true believer in the religion or unwillingness to quit. It is very difficult to stop an addiction which is why it is better never to start one.",

If they are left to do it all by themself they is a possibility of them returning back to gambling or do it secretly if they feel they will be disgraced if noticed by others.",
