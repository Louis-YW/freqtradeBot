BUA Moves To Crash Cement Price To N3,500 After Meeting TinubuThat led to the rumour. If the power plants are completed and BOA reduces cement price, likely Dangote cement might reduce in price, but there is nothing like that for now.Quote from: https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/money/1555478-dangote-speaks-plans-slash-cement-price-n5500-n2700-october-1/Speaking with Legit.ng exclusively, Anthony Chiejina, the Group Chief Branding and Communications Officer of Dangote Industries Limited, described the reports as fake news.",

Because I didn't anticipate that the cost of a bag of cement would drop to N2700, in the situation we are in now, and even though Alinko Dangote's sincere desire to do so for our nation, they will persuade him to keep cement prices high. Can you imagine that in KOTONU, what they are selling bags of cement for them is different from what they're selling for us here, and we are the ones that even produce for them.QuoteBut as government done promise us say cement price go come down, na e be say nah to just dey look if them go fit do as they talk am. As you said that the government promised us, it's like you forget if not, you won't repeat that same promise. How often has the government made promises that you would go accomplish things but weren't able to? Not all Nigerians rely solely on decisions made by the government now oo my brother.",

As you take see this news did you believe that e fit happen so? my brother this county don tired everybody make u sef reason am say this kind thing no fit happen for this country wey we dey so, fuel price never come down how cement money go take come down, if fuel prices increase e dey touch the price of everything in this this country. As this economy dey so no be everybody go complain about am some people go just dey follow people talk ni just for people to be like they are also feeling it, money dey where e dey and money dey this our country as you dey see am so just for the people wey no get make them talk say them no get. Rich man go dey follow people dey complain and they will still be buying the same product they are complaining that the price is going up.Even though cement price kept on increasing every day me I have 100% sure say people go still dey buy am and they won't know that they remove money from their pocket, we say price they increase and rich people still dey build houses, big mansions and we say economy hard. I believe say this country fit better make the prices come down but that still be under probability because no be waiting governments dey promise us we dey later see.",

And even if you get evidence, Dem fit still deny am. Well, e fit be say wetin @CharlseTim tok say na just news outlets trying to create trend becos for this   news, spokesperson for Dangote Group, Anthony Chiejine don come out tok say nah lie lie news. How I see this news nah just a means to put am on the news unto say him go soon open him refinery from next month so news outlets wan like make am trend somehow.Seriously, even if the price of cement dey slashed, e no go be much of a welcome development pass wen we hear say him (Dangote) dey open refinery. Because oda competitors fit reduce their price, but no be all of them get refinery. Cement reduction (if e dey happen) go solve very small problem for naija compared refinery own becos prices of things don go up all say fuel scarcity dey hit.",

I understand that you can't just obviously  post false information here; rather, you were genuinely excited about it because it will make the public happy. However, you should always seek out a good confirmation from a trustworthy source like vanguard, the guardian and leadership e.t.c before posting anything. Even if Dangote decides to lower the price of cement to 2700 naira, it will be very difficult for him to do so because of the percentages he must give to the Nigerian government and our traditional leaders. Reducing that price today is going to have an impact on the percentage of money donated to our Nigerian government. We are aware that these people just care about their own happiness and the happiness of their families, not about us, but we should continue to pray that everything will work out in the end.",
