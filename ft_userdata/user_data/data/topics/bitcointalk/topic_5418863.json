It was burned on plywood, gilded with over one hundred 22 carat gold leafs, coated in different types of lacquer and framed with authentic wooden frame.Sale: https://scarce.city/marketplace/physical/satoshi-throw-artwork-and-tokenCreative process: https://youtu.be/KyO7oflINgI Follow on https://twitter.com/BTCmonk1Symbology of the artwork:Due to Satoshi Nakamoto name being of Japanese origin, I decided to represent my vision through traditional Japanese cultural symbology.I took traditional Japanese martial art Judo to represent the way of the battle between Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin and centralised banking system which is controlled by world’s elite.Judo fighter with the Bitcoin symbol on his shoulder who is performing a judo throw on his opponent represents Bitcoin. While judo fighter who is flying through the air with one eye pyramid symbols on his chest represents world’s elite and centralised banking system.The act in itself represents Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin as financial freedom symbol which is winning the battle and cannot be touched by centralised banking system which intends to control world’s finances.Traditional Japanese Koi fish symbolizes strength, courage, patience, and success through perseverance. All these aspects are needed to succeed on the Bitcoin journey.Japanese Torii gate on the bridge simbolically marks the transition from mundane to sacred world as from financial control to financial freedom world.Pagoda tower and lotus flowers symbolizes the path to heightened awareness, enlightenment and heightened perception what enables us to see everything more clearly in all aspects of our lives.Flying Crane represents peace, luck and longevity within Japanese culture. It is what all of us are striving for in our lives.Small garden with the maple tree symbolizes serenity, beauty and magnificence what comes when we reach our goals and balance in life.Size: 95 x 65 cm ( 37 x 25 inches ) without frame.Weight: 3 kg ( 6.6 lbs )The lot Includes:SATOSHITHROW X 11 SupplyPhysical Artwork:Dimensions: Artwork - 37.4 x 25.5 inchesFramed - 39.7 x 28 inchesWeight: 6.6 lbs",
