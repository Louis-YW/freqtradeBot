I already shared it with my local Bengali community to find its best users. Keep it up! Here is the local thread link: Click here",

Its hashpower is equal to around 15 Nerdminers.https://web.public-pool.io/#/app/1MustaoR6XLZ1fE31XmK1mXnfqMSchAuBsAnd this is an old Android phone. It equals to around 100 Nerdminers with better efficiency. https://web.public-pool.io/#/app/1BTCcVPZqsH13DenaCiLkMepJpi5m5CQuUInteresting how do you manage to connect these devices into this pool without an ASIC unit?I have 3 broken old phones and 2 broken laptops that I bought for around 5$ each and I already fixed them and no one in my family wants to use them due to the versions are outdated and slow.I might be lucky to mine a block reward if I run them for mining so what software or tools did you use? Do you have any guides that you can share?",

      "body": "Except that tiny hash rate miners are a complete waste of time and an excessive waste of power.CPU and GPU mining are very good examples of this excessive waste.With GPUs, to do 130TH/s like a single one of my ASIC miners, that uses about 3.5kW,you would need 65000 GPUs doing 2GH/s - now if they are crappy GPUs that only use 100W (though they can't do 2GH/s)that would be 6.5MW of power to do 130TH/s vs 3.5kW ASICYes that 6.5MW would be a ridiculous waste of power.Meanwhile, 130TH/s only has a 1 in 28871 chance of finding a block in a day.With CPU mining it's WAY worse.Mobile phone mining is usually a virus - stay well away from destroying your phone and your battery with mobile phone mining.... and to top it off, no single CPU or GPU or Mobile mining will earn you any BTC.",

Do you research before start mining in a pool that crashes everyday, 50 000 miners connected are just toys (nerdminers) )))) oh yeah.What would you expect ...lol 0% fees.Ha ha ha.Sorry this should be named prank-pool",
