The idea was for as many people as possible to withdraw their coins from centralized exchanges to prove if they are solvent or not. Of course, only some people would do that and take part in the Proof of Keys day. But not everyone would be interested.Quote from: TravelMug on August 06, 2024, 11:44:12 AMAs a Bitcoin enthusiast, we shouldn't put our crypto in a 3rd party exchange as we don't have total control. If you must use a centralized exchange, then use it only to swap between the assets you need. After that, withdraw your coins to a non custodial wallet. Exchanges shouldn't be used as wallets. That's what beginners don't realize and it can cause serious problems.",

Annual January 3rd Proof of Keys Celebration of the Genesis Block Is there anything called 'private key day' Apparently it is just as Pmalek and TravelMug said. I’m not surprised the movement is not popular because big investors know that exchanges do not hand out private keys to their users and as a consequence cannot be used as storage for bitcoins.

Leaving your crypto assets on centralized exchanges don’t worth it because almost all the incidence of centralized exchanges bankruptcy don’t come with any sign, they just go with customers money with no refund.To be completely safe in cryptocurrency space with your funds, make sure you move them out of exchanges to an open source wallets that you will have the private key in your possession so as to access it at anytime you want.",

It's an event where people are encouraged to withdraw their funds from the exchange to prove solvency.There are better ways to prove solvency; ie. known cold storage address and regular proof of solvency conducted by the exchange. This movement doesn't mean much because the amount of coins withdrawn and the number of people that are participating in it is minuscule and is by no means a good way to prove the solvency of an exchange.",

You used the wrong terminology here. Centralized exchanges are custodial because you keep your coins in their custody. They have control of the signing keys for your bitcoin, effectively making it their bitcoin. When you create a wallet whose private keys and seed is exclusively in your control, that's called non-custodial. Electrum, Bitcoin Core, and many others are non-custodial. Binance is custodial. Don't let the \"non\" part of the term create negative connotations in your mind, where you believe it's associated with something that isn't good.",

It doesn help either if the date the withdrawal will happen is already known and the exchange can act to buffer its effects. Why panic withdrawals due to price drop or increase affects exchanges some of the times is cause they were unprecedented and the exchange will need to take some time to process transactions by first suspending withdrawals for a period of time.Actual proof of reserves should be done by independent bodies with full transparency of the results and also access given to users to check the status of cold wallets",

I don't think that there's any need to have a date for everybody to withdraw their funds from exchanges to proof a point because any exchange can be hacked or go bankrupt before or after everybody deposits their coins back inside them. The important thing is to have increased awareness about the importance of not leaving your funds in exchanges because of the obvious fact that if it's not your keys it's not your coins. I think that the phrase is the first lesson that I learnt in this forum, followed by keeping your coins in a none custodial wallet.",

While it may not be talked about as much or even done as much I absolutely agree that you must self custody your own crypto.  Otherwise you just don't own any.  But I'm preaching to the choir here.  I was surprised that there were people who hadn't heard of it.Kresp.",
