I don’t know how it was in the past, but it was available for view before. Then I think the admin might have a reason to remove it and make it disabled that way. Maybe there was no much use for it as the overall forum stats can’t cover most of the data that we might be looking for.",

IIRC, I changed it so that topic read counts only count logged-in members, and some of the stats related on members online were totally disabled. I would like to enable them again, but it probably won't happen too soon.",

Or it it limited to a certain rank?Seem like the Bpip is doing exactly what the forum stats page (disabled ) was meant to doActually, I've thought about the same question about this. But then I forgot about it. So thank you for asking this here and this represents my curiosity too. In fact, I have repeatedly clicked on that page several times. But then I thought that it was only intended for staff or moderators. And ordinary users can't do it. But that doesn't seem to be the reason. After seeing the replies on this topic, I understand that the reason is quite reasonable. And yes, actually BPIP already represents this function. And that's great.",

Or it it limited to a certain rank?I think it has been answered by the other members of the forum but I would like to add something from myside. I don't think that user stats is a necessary feature that we want and disabling of it hasn't affected the user-experience of the forum in anyway. The feature wasn't a necessary one and it costed huge money back then in order to have this feature enabled so theymos disabled it and nobody was interested in that feature so theymos never enabled it again. The forum might be on a beefy host now but still I doubt that theymos will enable this feature because there is no need for this feature.",

That memory is coming back now to me. I'm reflecting on how that feature used to show areas one was posting in and what percentage of one's posts went into what section of the forum and all that. I'm sure campaign managers would've been using it were it still active now in their selection to sieve through applications in finding out were users are posting.Quote from: hugeblack on October 22, 2023, 10:00:35 AMThere was a massive DDOS in 2017 and things got a little better after Moving to Cloudflare.Don't you think that's becoming often this day with BTT site going offline more rapidly?",

But now after reading all the replies I can say, we don't need that, and Theymos has already said the reason was cost (MusaMohamed said in the above reply of his). Well, if the cost was high then why current stats page is enabled? And just to point out, I think the current Stats page, also has technical errors, as shahzadafzal discussed here:I found something interesting on the forum!Quote from: Mpamaegbu on October 22, 2023, 03:40:10 PMQuote from: hugeblack on October 22, 2023, 10:00:35 AMThere was a massive DDOS in 2017 and things got a little better after Moving to Cloudflare.Don't you think that's becoming often this day with BTT site going offline more rapidly?Well, that massive DDOS attack of 2017 was also similar to the recent unavailability of BTT. Like BTT going down, did the same thing happen in 2017 or what? Actually, I heard about it for the first time, so I thought I should ask if you are willing to tell the story.",
