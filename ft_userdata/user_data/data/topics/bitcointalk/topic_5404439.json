  "content": "Just as this forum is meant for Bitcoin discussion and many other things, am sure there are some crucial statistics and things about the forum nobody has ever talked about here before, as we are all used to the internal superficial statistics given by most reputable users on the forum. And that's why today I have decided to throw small light on this external data which makes up this forum, which is the reason why I'm writing this thread now. As I am sure we are all conversant with the year this forum was created i.e 2009 (immediately after Bitcoin got launch), and the total number of registered monthly users (explained by LoyceV's  thread) together with total amount of users on the forum e.t.c. But have you ever thought about knowing which country has the most population on the form?, Or what gender has the highest number here? or what age bracket of people has the highest on the forum? Have you??  No. Am sure nobody here has ever thought towards that direction, and that's why in this thread I will be explaining it all in details, so go grab a cup of juice now, sit down, as I walk you through this whole process. AlrightHow many monthly visits & time spent does the forum Bitcointalk get each month?So according to statistics I got from similarweb.com (which is an online tool which give a analysis of any given online website) we are meant to understand that the forum bitcointalk.org gets an average monthly visits of 1.6million, with an average time spent of 5minutes 16seconds, together with 3.72 pages per each visit. So what does this mean? What this means is that for each 30days period, the total number of times people come to, or login, or visit this very website called \"bitcointalk.org\" is 1.6million times, of which the average time people spend on the site for each time they visit is 5minutes & 16seconds (which is approximately 316seconds). So you can see it in the image below.Top most visited countries on bitcointalk?So according to statistics I got from similarweb.com (which is an online tool which give a analysis of any given online website), we are meant to understand that USA is the number one country with the most visit on the forum bitcointalk.org. i.e it is the country with the most highest traffic that comes to this forum each month with a percentage rate of 13.33%, followed by Ukraine 9.42%, Germany 9.29%, Turkey 4.52%, France 3.66% and others 59.77%. which means that USA and Ukraine are the top countries that has the most visit (population) on this forum. So you can see it in the image below.What age bracket has the highest population on bitcointalk?So according to statistics I got from similarweb.com (which is an online tool which give a analysis of any given online website), we are meant to understand that people within the age bracket of 25yrs-34yrs have the highest population on the bitcointalk forum, with a percentage rate of 35.85%, followed by those within the age bracket of 18yrs-24yrs with 20.93%, 35yrs-44yrs with 20.45%, 45yrs-54yrs with 11.64%, 55yrs-64yrs with 6.98% and lastly 65yrs and above with 4.14%. As you can see in the image below.What Gender Has The Most Population On Bitcointalk?So according to statistics I got from similarweb.com (which is an online tool which give a analysis of any given online website), we are meant to understand that male has the highest population on the forum bitcointalk with a percentage rate of 77% followed by female with 23%. As you can see in the image below.Geographical Location Of The Most Visit Region On Bitcointalk ForumSo according to statistics I got from similarweb.com (which is an online tool which give a analysis of any given online website), we are meant to understand that the most traffic or visit on the bitcointalk forum comes from the North American region, especially areas such Chicago, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta and Alaska e.t.c. As you can see in the image below.ConclusionSo in conclusion, I'm sure many persons will now be asking how is all this information possible? Of which I will be clearing your doubt now, because do you know we live in an era where technology rules the world, where any small bit of information put online can be access from anywhere around the world. So all this data (information) is made possible through the use of your Google account (Gmail), whereby when you want to register a Gmail account, there is always a column for name, gender, date of birth e.t.c, so what this artificial intelligence (A.I) tool does is use the information on your Google account which you used in registering on the bitcointalk forum to give an estimated data with the help of A.I tool like similarweb.com. So I hope you now understand how all this works. Alright. Thanks",

ThanksThe email account of majority of users who register on the forum, is hidden from public, and this website is not among the websites with access to user data, so a bulk of information is unavailable to them through tracking email addresses.Another way they could try getting data is by checking what user's input on their profile, in the gender, age and country option, this would most likely be inaccurate as well as many users do not fill those slots and no guarantee that those who do, actually put in correct information.",

      "body": "I’ll go for a quick self-quote here, since the post I wrote on the matter is not from that far back:Quote from: DdmrDdmr on January 11, 2022, 09:50:45 AMAs with all these sites, they can be seen as having some truth, but also some misinformation. The degree of each will depend on exactly how the information is gathered, how representative it is (ist’s often sample based) of the whole population (Bitcointalk’s Traffic), how the extrapolation takes place and compares to other sites, and so forth.We get some glimpses of what’s under the hood here:https://support.similarweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001631538-SimilarWeb-Data-MethodologyThere, it states that data is derived form 4 different sources:Quote•   Direct Measurement – millions of websites and apps choose to share their first-party analytics with us. Learn why here•   Contributory Network – a collection of consumer products that aggregate anonymous device behavioral data•   Partnerships – a global network of organizations that collect “digital signals” across the Internet•   Public Data Extraction – an advanced algorithmic engine that captures and indexes public data from billions of websites and appsThe forum certainly isn’t going to be amongst those that share their analytics with them, people using Bitcointalk tend to try to be somewhat private, therefore contributory network data should be a misrepresentation at best. The remaining two sources are darkboxes to me.The only real sources I’d trust would be data provided by the forum itself, which I’d really like to see, especially for trying to determine the weight of unique visitors per country vs local board’s theoretical potential. VPNs though are likely often used here, so even so the data would need to be read with a grain or two of salt.The data on sites like these is potentially rather unreliable, and as I mentioned above, I would really only trust data generated by the forum, were it to be made available (for example, we could get some pretty interesting insights on local board real visits vs active accounts for example).Quote from: ETFbitcoin on June 29, 2022, 11:38:37 AM<…>The site has since miraculously move the HQ from China to USA … (see https://www.similarweb.com/website/bitcointalk.org/#overview).",

For example, can you guess how old I am then?. We know that most of the users here doesn't edit their profile with their personal information. Why?, Because many of us wanted being anonymous and miraculously similarwev knows about it?. That's why I don't believe that their statistics is accurate.",

People give wrong information when creating an email account, there’s no way to verify the information on name, gender, age, provided is accurate or not. I totally agree with you, while reading the OP, this was exactly what i had in mind, for i personally know some friends, we actually have small a Bitcointalk discussion group on whatsapp and i know nine (9) accounts that registered on the forum with wrong information of themseleves, even their email addresses contain wrong information.In terms of age, 90 percent of individuals register their email account with the wrong age, in terms of gender, many male sign up their account as female while some female sign up their accounts as male.So honestly, the statistics from this site can not be trusted on depended on.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 11, 2022, 09:47:07 AMI wonder how accurate is their data when they state Bitcointalk HQ is located in china with 51 - 200 employees (i wonder if they count moderator as employees) .LOls, or maybe they just look at how big forum site is,(like the number of people that visit the forum on monthly basis) and from that, they guess how many employees the forum should likely have, this is if at all they even know that the site is a just a discussion forum and not a site to one big company.",

Why I would share my personal details and what the purpose that will serve! Most of the people in the platform use VPN so the country that is showing it will not be accurate. I think this data is not that valuable either because what you will do with this information? Showing ads based on your location like other social media!I haven't found the name India and Russia in the list which didn't surprise me because as I say most people use VPN in the forum so real location is hard to track.",
