I don't pay much attention to such forecasts, because they are not very important for my strategy. I keep buying bitcoin every week, it's my long-term investment and I don't worry too much about local bitcoin price movements.Globally, we are still at the bottom, and this is a clear sign to me that we are still in an area that is suitable for accumulating bitcoin for a long-term investment. Such analyzes may be of interest to short-term traders, in which case you need to follow the trend.",

Less bad news almost one month although Bitcoin ever dropped to lower price under $20,000 because can't break out above $25,000 in twice moment.Looking on current price after break out from $25,000 and almost reach until $27,000 seems up coming next week potential for Bitcoin break out to the higher price. Many people are waiting for Bitcoin back to higher price after crashing last year and seems this year have positive feedback and indicate with Bitcoin having good price.",

So the target could be around $28k-$32k as the upper limit this month.",

Hence my guess is that it is not a reason why bitcoin could lose sustained momentum in this up direction. Downtrend is possible but I think 25k is trying to hold. Occupying 25k we will wait for the next level at 26k - 28k - 30kAnd that is a huge reason to believe that bitcoin can go up to 30k by the end of this month.",

So therefore trade with caution. Have you not heard and seen predictions that went sour with the predictors but as a smart trader, what is expected of you is to collect profit as many times you can while the market trend lasts in that direction because it would not go that way for too long. So therefore, to be on the safe side, it is best you collect profit at every point in time while others keep looking at the market prediction. I pray for steady increase so I could keep taking profit.",

Of course, $30,000 is nearer, and it seems Bitcoin has gained a nice momentum ever since it recovered from that unexpected fall below $20,000. Although we may see $20,000 anytime within the month, if I will make a bet, I would happily place it on $30,000. I'm particularly amazed that even with what happened to certain banks that are crypto friendly and with USDC depegging, Bitcoin remains strong.",
