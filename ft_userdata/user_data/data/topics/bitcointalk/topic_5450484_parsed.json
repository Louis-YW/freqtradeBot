I don't know how widely adopted it is there, though. The big deal is if you can visit Thailand and tour around the country spending only crypto. But if you have to convert your crypto to fiat first, you probably can do that with several options. You can also to that in a number of countries.",

Converting crypto to cash is not difficult in any country as long as there is P2P platform exists. In most Asian countries, people just use binance or any exchange to convert their crypto to cash without any hassle. The real and amazing thing would be when you will be able to spend crypto directly in any country without converting it into fiat.Also, i do not think anyone should click on the link you pasted.

But this customer didn't spend any fiat from his bank account of cash that he bring with him from the home country.The main idea of this post was that you don't need credit card of cash when coming to Thailand. You can pay everywhere via our services and you can receive cash everywhere in Thailand too. Thus you can come with crypto only and everything will be arranged and paid.I described the flow here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450484.msg62181447#msg62181447Quote from: Faisal2202 on April 29, 2023, 01:25:48 PMQuote from: SportScore on April 28, 2023, 10:59:59 AMHey to all, so I'm in Thailand and I have used someone service to convert crypto to cash, and it was so amazing and fast!I want to recommend it for everyone who need cash in Thailand for crypto 100% safe!

That title is pretty misleading. I thought this is a thread about OP traveling to Thailand and spending cryptocurrencies everywhere in Thailand and it must be some interesting story and how everyone in Thailand accepts cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, it was disappointing to find out after opening the thread that it's nothing more than an advertisement.I wonder why someone in Thailand or any country shouldn't use an online P2P service instead of using a service by an individual who would come and hand out the cash to you. That's super creepy knowing it can also be dangerous since you are in an unknown country and the other person knows you got money on you.",
