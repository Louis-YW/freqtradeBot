It is awesome that you have set up an online bookstore dedicated to Bitcoin topics. That being said, I noticed that others have already mentioned that it would be cool if customers could actually pay for their purchases with Bitcoin. I have to say, I totally agree! Not only would it be a really convenient feature for your customers, but it would also help to further promote the use of Bitcoin and increase awareness of its benefits. I know that there are a number of payment processors that make it pretty easy to do so these days, so it might be worth looking into.",

Basically a middleman that takes payment in Bitcoin and then orders the book from Amazon or whatever for the customer where OP would likely have to make payment using fiat. He could charge a markup for this. I don’t think any special permits or licenses would be necessary for this. Maybe even a purse.io integration would be possible.",

That would really be nice, but I don't really know how that would work...If I take the payment in Bitcoin, which would be something that is possible of course, what happens next... I don't sell the books myself. If I than order them on Amazon myself and send them to the recipient, that is a strange workaround, plus the time difference is not something that is desirable with the volatility. Also with people returning books etc. seems like a hassle.Maybe contact the book authors that also sell their books with BTC already? That leaves only a few books.So not really sure how to implement it. Any tips are welcome because I love the idea!!!",

It should look good on all devices. Does on my Android S10 at least. Sure, it's mobile so a little worse UX. Maybe on really small screens it's uncomfortable?",

That leaves only a few books.First step would be to contact authors of books you have on your website.Since you are giving them free promotion you can ask them to send you their BTC addresses for payment and they can send books directly to buyers.For every sold book from your website you could receive small percentage payment, similar like with referral codes. I said previously there are Amazon cards that are sold for Bitcoin, you can also sell this cards on your website for indirect payment of those books.You could also add separate section for Bitcoin e-books.For example Andreas Antonopoulos is selling his e-book Mastering Bitcoin, and he is accepting payment in Bitcoin directly, using BTCPay server or Coinbase.https://aantonop.com/product/mastering-bitcoin-2nd-edition-ebook/",

But think about the potential benefits too. A lot of people who use Bitcoin prefer to use it over fiat, and Amazon does not allow that right now. And unless you can offer something unique and different, most folks are probably just gonna order their books straight from Amazon.",
