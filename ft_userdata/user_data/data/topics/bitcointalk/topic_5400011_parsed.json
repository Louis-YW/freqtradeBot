For the most part, the market is oversaturated with these projects and the industry has shifted its focus a bit to another business model, Move-2-Earn, and P2E projects are now experiencing a drop in interest and users. Even the flagship of the industry, Axie Infinity, has lost most of its audience and its price has gone very deep. In bearish times, such game projects have little interest and can only survive if they have great marketing and an experienced team with an original product.",

You are saying like this game was  good but the fact that if this is really bad game. This token is not yet listed on CMC and how can we sure what you are saying was true? Better if you suggest the team to create the new announcement thread. In here people are dong their own research, When you are shilling without providing the proof and people will not believe it.",

The fairlaunch is not even launched and so are you looking more buyers? Im feeling skeptical with your project. You have not even done KYC verification on pink sale. This may become another project to gamble or scam . i hope that people will think properly about this. What you are saying above was not true. The game has not even launched. This garbage game was even taking some characters from the existing game.",

Anyhow, let's see how it goes, but personally, I'm done with this hype already, might be better to just reinvest your profits (if you have), to other solid altcoins projects.",

Giving a good information about what already achieved by your project was good rather than saying everything developed by your project but it has zero achievement. I think that you are creating a useless thread now. Is not it better for you to did a better thing like promoting your project through various telegroup.",

I suggest to show us some proof of legality, maybe in that way it helps as many P2E are scam. People are just keen upon participating activities like this and so you can't blame why they are too many query and question. But if your intention is good and your platform is really working, that seems not problem.",

But with such shady ads, I will also ignore.OP you should create a separate topic for your project with enough information so that people can have a realistic assessment of the project instead of being shady like this, no one will be interested in your project. You are turning it into garbage project.",

To tell you honestly, the market isn't looking good for NFT/P2E games because most of them have been stomped by the bear.Also, the experience of others looking at these projects that have rug pulled makes them not curious anymore instead scared of investing into newer ones.",

Why don't you just decide to invest in this token with your own risk? Im sure that if you also understood about the risk. It seems like to me if you are suggesting metakiller.",
