Exchange site like binance can be trusted but keeping your coins in your wallet was also safe enough. I meant if there's only a possibility for the fork to happen but this doesn't mean if the fork will be happening. It has some chances for the chain to be forked by this is talking about the chance. There would be a chance for new coin will not be generated or issued by miners. It's all depend on the result from the fork. I think that you are aware about this too. You shall read whole of announcements created by some exchange sites. As long as you were not doing any transction during the fork and that would be safe.",

They will say their platform is big and they need time to proceed all things.Believe them or not, it's your decision but if you don't want to wait a few days or a few weeks later of distribution by Binance, you can store it on other Tier 1 exchanges. If you can wait, you can store it on Binance and wait!Like Luna and Luna Classic, UST, they did it weeks later when other exchanges done their works.If you don't want to rely on any exchange, store it in your non custodial wallet.",

Because that's not how The Merge works.But yeah, there will be for sure some proposed fork for the Ethereum especially since there are some discussions already about the current miners where  they are miners of Ethereum's Proof-of-work (POW) I saw some articles talking about miners that are proposing to fork Ethereum. This is very possible. For me, the safest place to store your Ethereum right now is in your personal wallet where you are the only one got access.",

This must become the main consideration. Obviously, the coin obtained as a result of the fork will be pumped, and since it will not have the same value as the original ETH, the price of ETHW will fall. Given the fact that Binance supported the fork, but does not promise a listin, it is better to transfer ETH to another SEC, for example mexc.com .",

I would never trust any exchange with large amount of assest.. exchanges are only good to keep the money which are in your use like for trading etc.but if you think the claiming process might be dificult for you and you don't want to do that then you can use an exchange. but it is better to immdetiately withdraw your fund from exchange .",

Most of the top exchanges have specifically announced fork support, all major exchanges have announced support. If the merge goes smoothly and without any issues, you can keep the ETH in a hardware wallet or any other non-custodial wallet. But if the merger process encounters unexpected troubles, investors who are not too tech-savvy or use immature wallets will run into trouble. So better for those who don't guarantee that they can handle it manually on their personal wallet during the fork, you can transfer ETH to exchanges. We won't need to do any work, just wait for the process to complete, the exchange will do the work for us.",

The move of ethereum to Pos received the support of both the community as well as other companies who also announced that they would only support ethereum Pos after the merger. Only a part of miners because they don't want to lose their jobs and don't want to sell their miners, so they support this Ethereum Pow.",
