  "content": "I'll start off with a confession - it's not my idea, I half-borrowed it from a post I saw on reddit. The thing is, my sister moved to Finland and it will be the first birthday she'll spend away from us. Now, my idea has a prank element (it includes a paranoia-provoking email, that's all I'll say) but with a sweet twist cause I want to make a qr code with a playlist of her favorite songs. Now, I saw tons of rants about qr codes expiring in the thread I mentioned and some debates about the best qr code generator. Wanted to ask here - has anyone used any of these? Thanks in advance, guys, I am on the clock, gotta start setting the stage for the surprise.",
