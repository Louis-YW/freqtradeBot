Some of this sites before you give credit to this sites you have to verify very well, because i know that some sites do pay people and mostly participants to review their site and qualify it to ne good site, so i do not trust the review of people unless i have seen a reputable person i know quite well before i will believe such act, so therefore it is better for you to verify or make your personal research on a site before you can join the sites",

Having a signature campaign would be always suggestable or recommended specially for a new site but i doubt that they would really be having the budget.If we do look in overall designUI/UX of the site then you could tell their capability when it comes to finances which is that limited pretty sure but im not making any conclusion though.Also, you should mind that lottery games arent really that something interesting which you could really say that it would really be getting that muchrecognition on this forum even if you do run a campaign, so its not really that a guarantee of success.",

What cryptocurrency available on this site right now? My concern is also about KYC, do we need to provide KYC first or it will be asked later on? Why not try to make up some register? Everything is really shown and been mentioned on op and on the 2nd post of this thread which does make out some clarification about those thingsyou are really asking.About KYC then it would be always that standard that they might not be asking on the time you do register but they would really be asking out if ever they do find out some issues on your betting or account which it isnt really that surprising anymore.So expect that one and also when it comes tosite design then it is really just that plain.Currently BTC only but it's a matter of days before new cryptocurrencies are added so I'll keep the post updated. There is no KYC required when registering or making deposits/withdrawals.Quote from: Odusko on January 01, 2023, 10:21:56 PMWelcome to bitcointalk, am glad to see that you made an official discussion thread and also seeking for members review.

These are all valid questions and concerns, and it should be clear by reading the terms and conditions of the site. Unfortunately, none of these things are mentioned in the sites' T&C. It's actually one of the shortest documents I have ever seen in a crypto casino. I can only imagine that there are no country and territory restrictions since this is not a licensed casino and supports only cryptocurrencies and no fiat. @Cryptolottery.BET You should definitely work on creating a proper T&C agreement that covers everything about your offer and services in the same way that other casinos have done it.Quote from: joebic541 on January 02, 2023, 12:26:26 PMDo you have any bounty or airdrop?

For your references: https://codecanyon.net/item/crypto-casino-slot-machine-online-gambling-platform-laravel-5-application/23088602 Good revelation, I'm also a user of the Code Canyon marketplace-produced script, I would not say that script has flaws on it, because this is verified and checked by Envato QuoteQuality checked by Envato and I cannot say if the integrity of scripts coming from CodeCanyon are in standard when it comes to the casino if you noticed this script is already sold over 600 licenses so there's a lot of version with the same feature, but the owners of these scripts need to tweak it to differentiate from the other script so we think it's new.For all users better check reviews of this script so you can gauge its features and if its worth using this script https://codecanyon.net/item/crypto-casino-slot-machine-online-gambling-platform-laravel-5-application/reviews/23088602",

Waiting for the answers.I thank you for your opinion which has represented several questions from users of this forum.There must be a lot of forum users who want to try playing on the new casino site, but it's a shame for deposits that they only accept Bitcoin. Some other users actually prefer and are interested in making deposits using Altcoins such as ETH because the fee required is relatively small and friendly compared to using Bitcoins.",

As good things does not come easily, so you would have to be patient for a bit while running your advertisement with the aid of a good signature campaign manager to run it for atmost two months and beyond as the case maybe.

We considered ETH but due to the fees this was difficult to fit into our minimum deposits/withdrawals, this may have changed and I will forward your advice internally No restrictions on specific countries, we try to make it available for players everywhere. Currently, the biggest possible win from a single bet would be on the Keno game, where by placing a maximum bet of $100, you would win up to x500 or $50kQuote from: Royse777 on January 02, 2023, 02:28:15 AMNice and short explanation video.

As you said, there is no airdrop or bounty, but we could start a campaign here on Bitcointalk and there is always the affiliate system which is also going to be improved for a more rewarding program.Regarding the T&C since it does not include terms related to licensing, KYC, etc. It may be shorter than other casinos, but it includes the main and important information.
