If you want more quickly transaction, use Bitcoin Lightning Network but it is less secured than Bitcoin on-chain transactions.How many confirmations are equivalent to 6 Bitcoin confirmations?. There are altcoins with faster transaction speed, confirmation time but if you want to get similar security like 6 confirmations on Bitcoin network, you will need 17 hours with Dogecoin, 15 hours with Litecoin, 4 days 21 hours with Bitcoin Cash.Before Proof of Stake, The Merge, Ethereum network needs about 3 hours.https://web.archive.org/web/20210811184629/https://howmanyconfs.com/",

If I receive ether from someone and having 1 confirmation, but I can send it to another person after 1 confirmation? But I think I can get you now, what you meant is how secure the transaction is?  That is correct, a single bitcoin transaction is far more secure than that of ether.How about coins that their transactions are instant? Ether transaction can take 15 seconds to 5 minutes or more. Why are the instant transaction altcoins not having the highest marketcap? This rhetorical question answers why bitcoin is superior to ether. It is not about how fast transactions are, it is about how secure the network is.",

Maybe not a very big difference if you want to send ETH, but if you want to send tokens the transaction can cost up to 50$ sometimes: so, set the same high fee required for Ether or tokens for a Bitcoin transaction and you will see that it will be (inefficiently) immediately confirmed.",

      "body": "Trust wallet does not provide the option of lightening network and RBG in my opinion. Which means you can not extend the transaction fee to increase the processing priority of your transactions. For example, your transactions are getting delayed because your transaction fee must be lower then others that's why your transactions are queued below them. I also sued Trust wallet and transaction sometime when network is highly congested took more than hours. But mostly my transaction got completed in 10 to 15 minutes max.I prefer you to not to use TW because one, it is close source so, it could also harm our funds, second, it is not mainly for BTC transactions, Third your ETH transactions are fast because the network fee doesn't effect the transaction rate here. It's the blockchain you are using makes the transaction slower and increase or decrease the priority of your transaction according to fee being paid. If you will use matic in TW then you will know the transaction are way faster and almost free of cost. For BTC, prefer to use Electrum because it have RBF option but it will cost you way more if you are a merchant. I just prefer a person to use exchange for such small transaction you must use exchanges to make transaction using there ID or email. In this way the transaction will be free and fast. Can you use Bitcoin to pay everything online?",

      "body": "Quotemy question is why BTC transaction is so slow while ETH almost instantly !!I believe this has something to do with the specification of the coins.  They have certain specification where the time when the network is able to produce block and got confirmed is coded on the system.  To put that simple, ETH is programmed to have a faster block production reason for faster transaction confirmation while Bitcoin is programmed to have a slower block production and that actually gives the reason why it confirms slower.You can see the rate how the block is generated between ETH and Bitcoin and this is the reason why ETH confirms faster than BTC.QuoteHow often is a Bitcoin block created?every 10 minutesBitcoins are “minted” during the creation of each block at a fixed and diminishing rate. Each block, generated on average every 10 minutes, contains entirely new bitcoins, created from nothing. Every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years, the currency issuance rate is decreased by 50%.What is the block production time of Ethereum?around 14 secondsEach cryptocurrency has a different block time—Bitcoin takes around 10 minutes, while Ethereum only takes around 14 seconds.Quoteto BTC is the best crypto ever but its slow nowhaving a fast confirmation does not mean being the best crypto because we have to consider the security, community and adoption of a cryptocurrency.  There are more coins that are confirmed faster than ETH but still considered as shitcoin.",

That is why lower gas price transactions take longer to process. In a pool of many transactions, some transactions with the lowest gas prices never get picked up - miners are not willing to process them. It results in them getting “stuck” in a pending status.Solution you have to do: What can I do if my transaction is stuck?I think the information above can answer all your complaints.Or you can use a second alternative besides trustwallet.com, namely: Meta Mask, maybe it's better, if you want to try it.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on July 31, 2023, 03:16:31 PMMetamask doesn't support bitcoin and OP can use electrum for bitcoin transactions.Ohhhh, yes I forgot about that.",

It is worth mentioning that Ethereum had a rollback of a transaction back in 2016 (I forgot the exact year) when there was a hack. They had a hard fork to get all the assets back for a DAO. Ethereum Classic is the real Ethereum as some of the folks didn't support the hard fork.How much weird this sounds lol! People should be more aware of what's a secure transaction. It's definitely not only about getting transactions faster, satoshi could do it faster too. Though the reason behind is not the same, there's a reason of course why it's 10 minutes.",

      "body": "Your definition of speed is wrong because you probably don't really understand what confirmation means and what its relationship with reversibility is.A confirmation is when a transaction is included in a block. From that point as newer blocks are found, the confirmed transaction goes deeper into the chain or gets more confirmation.What matters here is to find a number of confirmation where the chances of the confirmed transaction being reversed by performing an attack on the chain (eg. 51% attack on PoW chains and other forms on PoS) is nearly zero.Depending on the algorithm, the hashrate, level of decentralization, security of the protocol itself (in simple terms being bug free), and the network state this number can be different.For example for a centralized shitcoin with a weak protocol where mining is performed by centralized powers this number can be in the thousands. In fact if you look at the deposit page of most exchanges, they require very high number of confirmation for a lot of altcoins for this reason, although not all of their values are accurate or safe but it is a good practical example.But for a decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin with a solid protocol and a well spread miners and a very big hashrate this number is the lowest.In other words, as others also pointed out, for a centralized shitcoin like ETH having only one confirmation (even with the new flawed PoS algorithm) doesn't provide nearly enough security as one bitcoin confirmation provides.",
