  "content": "Recently, I have seen often talking about how Bitcoin is not going up fast enough, I usually see this mostly on social media. I haven't really seen it on this forum but I'm bringing it here just in case there are people here who have similar viewsAlmost exactly a year ago, the Bitcoin price was $30,534 on the 27th of June 2023. This was a year ago and at the time, this was a pretty impressive price because Bitcoin just hit $30k. A year from that time bitcoin is at $61, 423 (at the time of writing), that's a 100% increase in price and a 100% profit if you invested at the time. A few months ago, we were celebrating Bitcoin at $40k, so how come now that Bitcoin is at $61k we're unimpressed? How is $60k looking ordinary when the previous ATH before this year was $69k?I understand that we all want Bitcoin prices to skyrocket (which it's actually doing), but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is performing poorly. A lot of people expected Bitcoin to get to $100k immediately after the halving, but by history, it's usually not so.In conclusion, this post is for two sets of people;Those who believe it's too late to invest in Bitcoin because you can clearly see how Bitcoin has grown in price in the past year.Secondly, the post is mainly for those who believe Bitcoin is underperforming because it's not at all.",

Yes let me recall your attention and refresh your memory towards this that those who are complaining or lamenting of sudden drop of bitcoin price are equally right to say because when they invested at 73k and expect the price to hit 100k but instead it was on the reverse so they must complained and tweet whatever they want. If you say that bitcoin was 69k those who invested at 50k from the last ATH before this new ATH are still now in a profits therefore they wouldn't lament much on the price except those who venture into the market at the pick.",

It's hard to think that the bull run as a start for a new market cycle that usually lasts four years in previous cycles, will stop only 2 months after a halving in April 2024.It's harder to believe that a new ATH is only a little bit higher than 2021 ATH and if we count inflation issues of fiat currencies since Covid-19, it's difficult to consider highest price in 2024 is a new ATH.Many months for 2024 and 2025 bull run to complete, it's not time to feel uncertain and fearful.",

In short, more eyes are now on bitcoin and these eyes are expectant and impatient. Personally I find it a blessing that bitcoin has not reached a new ath just yet as this means I can still continue to buy more bitcoins at a relatively low price",

How is $60k looking ordinary when the previous ATH before this year was $69k?You're kind of forgetting that we were at 69 also in April 2021, three yers ago!I love that when panicking some coiners start to grab whatever time period is convenient and try to shove it in the face of others calling them stupid and so on and on! The fact is that it was a bit disappointing, we had the biggest event with the launch of ETF and the major money injection ever, and we just managed to get to the 2021 bullrun.To make it clear, if bitcoin drops now in a bear period to 20-30k but recovers in 20027 and goes to 80k, would you cheer it as an achievement?You have to understand your average Joe, the one you bombarded with memes about Wall Street money, he sees Wall Street money coming in and he sees an ATH the size of the one with no Wall Street money, can you blame them?",

We could say that we should not stop expecting more from bitcoin, believing it continues to grow rather than seeing it low. I know those people who remain skeptical about this green opportunity with not feel the urge to invest. What we have now will point out that despite the banning of bitcoin in some countries still it shows progressive and unstoppable growth. That gives us a clear view of where the future of bitcoin is going --that is on the bright side.",

Don't forget that the following is one of the oldest memes in Bitcoin World:People expect the market to always be volatile and something crazy to happen, and usually they expect that thing to be a massive jump up. When that doesn't happen, they start talking about poor performance.From a global economy perspective, I can also say that bitcoin is performing more than fine. Don't forget we have a recession+inflation going on in most of the world with high \"sticky\" interest rates. Such an economy puts a lot of sell pressure on markets like bitcoin that are considered \"high risk assets\" since people tend to liquidate such \"assets\". Bitcoin had a bull run over the past year.We saw this in the crash of 2022, something we have been recovering from in the past year, but we ARE recovering which is what the good performance is.",

Also every bull run so far has had corrections that scare less experienced, cowardly investors & makes them sell. We are currently in the midst of what some might see as reason to panic. There is no need to panic though, Bitcoin is doing just fine. I predict we end 2024 over $75,000 per coin.",

These same people are irrationaly thinking that we can easily breach several milestones in a short span of time without taking into account the overall amount of money that needs to be pumped into bitcoin for that to happen. The fact that this price range used to just be an ATH a few months ago and right now we're maintaining it is something even better than any inconsistent and extremely fragile bull run.

If you zoom out you can see the sky-rocketing rise of bitcoin price over the years and then only you can make proper conclusion about how it is performing.However I get the idea, certain people are looking for the short term gain, they probably bought at 63-64k USD and were willing to flip at 65k USD, not they have to hold for some time longer. Like I have said, bitcoin is something for the long term, short term is difficult to predict.Those who have been watching BTC for years, know that buying time come in once bitcoin drops under 60k.",

To be fair, I don’t think bitcoin is doing bad but we all want it to rise as quickly as possible.Many thought that due to the halving event, the after effects would be so explosive and its stagnant price came as a surprise. Despite the disappointment I still believe bitcoin will soon rise. It’s all about time and waiting.",

Indeed Bitcoin have done so well within a space of one year and it is worth celebrating.  I remever when price lingered in the \"don't wake me up region\" after which it broke out and we were so excited that price finally moved and that was even sub $40k. Today Bitcoin is sitting comfortably at $60k yet there is serious dissatisfaction in the Bitcoin community. Well, don't blame people because the expectations were high that the combined force of the ETF and the Bitcoin halving will send the price above $100k. This was the expectations of many Bitcoiner but as that didn't happen just yet, many have become frustrated with the waiting. But we must understand that the market will do what it wants and that no one can completely decide what path it will follow. Our best approach should be to think long term for therin lies the peace of mind needed by every investor. I have the feeling that the price will surge just when no one is expecting",

Under performing is an understatement because is a volatile digital currency which is not stable in one place and it is the movement of volatility that makes bitcoin more interesting to invest. Because people would like to invest when the price is down and like to sell when the price is up. And when people or investors invest in the time of high then they are also thinking that the price will rise above that amount in the present time of their purchase. And as I said those who are unimpressed are the investors invested when the price was above $60k and now that the is &/$60k and below them you don't think they would be happy about it but they have to know that bitcoin is just like that because nobody can predict the next move of the price.",
