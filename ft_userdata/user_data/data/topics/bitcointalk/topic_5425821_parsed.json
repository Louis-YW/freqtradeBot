  "content": "Hey guys,I'm trying to make an article that would rank all the current gen consoles and their mining capabilities, this is just for a random assignment that I'm doing, I'm not serious about mining on consoles I found enough info on the PS5 and Xbox Series XIS, but I'm having trouble getting any on Valve's Steam Deck. This is the console I'm talking about: https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckIt is a Zen 2 + RDNA 2 setup on Linux, and it can be easily modified. In terms of the software and hardware, what would need to be modified and what could one expect? p.s. I'm still new to the forum so I hope I placed this in the right sub-category.",

As long as you’re doing it for fun or educational reasons and not to try and make money. Obviously this device isn’t ideal for mining for many reasons and will probably cost you money without ever making you anything. For fun though this is a great project and I’m sure there will be people who appreciate having more mining data available with yet another new device. Good luck!",

First, a new ethereum should appear, which will give a big profit for GPU miners, but I don’t think about it now.",

The only reason is it was the easiest way to get a GPU at the time. Mining with laptop GPUs was also popular.They both have the same issues. In a normal market they cost more for their mining performance and mining runs them harder than they are designed for.",
