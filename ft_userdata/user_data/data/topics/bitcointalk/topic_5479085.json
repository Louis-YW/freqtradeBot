How is that going to be possible? You can’t just expect everyone to just wake up one day and realize that they can’t recall their secret phrases again and where they kept it has been destroyed with their phrases along side. Try asking more realistic questions maybe then you’ll get an actual answer. Question like this won’t yield anything good for you.",

This question is asked and answered many times, you can search and find past topics on it.The second question, all bitcoin is lost, seems to be impossible. There are about 4 million bitcoin assumedly estimated to be lost but we never know an exact number for it.I posted one thread on estimation of lost bitcoins that can be helpful for you.I believe in future, with more expensive price, people will be more careful with storage, back up, recovery so that there wil be less and less bitcoin lost in coming years.",

If Bitcoin experiences widespread loss, it could affect its usability creating challenges for its practical use as a currency or store of value. The idea of all Bitcoins being lost is unlikely, as it would require a widespread and simultaneous loss of private keys, which is highly impossible. When all Bitcoin is mined, its price would likely become more stable, shifting its role from a store of value to a means of payment. At this point, Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin as an alternative payment method could be realized. When Bitcoin was created, it was meant to serve as an alternative means of payment. Satoshi also foresaw people viewing it as a store of value for profit, leading to the implementation of the halving mechanism.",

If there was no Bitcoin left, there would be nothing to trade and the value of Bitcoin would probably go to zero. But I'm curious to know what makes you think of this scenario knowing that the last mining of Bitcoin is something that's expected to happen around the year 2140 and for the entire Bitcoin to lost can be possible in just one way. This could happen if people forget their private keys or lose access to their wallets. How could you imagining everyone forgot their private keys including you? Not likely possible to happen.For the benefit of possibility and in case it happens, the crypto market would likely crash because without Bitcoin, the entire industry would be in turmoil. This would affect not only people who hold crypto but also the companies that rely on the technology to operate.",

Well, if its about lost in value, well, let's take, for example, what happened in other coins. Of course, bitcoin will only lose its value if no more investors are coming in or no circulation is happening in the market, meaning many investors sell their bitcoin and more and more supply of bitcoin and low demands mean the price will drop. That's when the value of bitcoin will be lost, and based on the current state of bitcoin, I find hard to imagine that it will lose its value.About the loss of bitcoin due to uncertainty, if a bitcoin wallet gets thrown or is lost, then all of bitcoin will be like that. I don't think it is possible because, remember, there is still a lot of unmined bitcoin. Even if a lot of bitcoin has been lost, it is still to be mined and circulated in the market.",

First, if all Bitcoins are mined we're not alive by that time I can guarantee you that. With all of the stress that this time of living, we're expected to live lesser than the older ones. And should we say that all Bitcoins are mined, transactions will continue and miners will still do the same thing but they'll mine to confirm transactions. If all bitcoin is lost? how it is going to happen? I have never thought of that all including all of the holders unless some catastrophic that will deplete human beings so as the network will be gone.",

Moreover, some bitcoin will be lost by users. For sure.You still didn’t answer OP’s question. Therefore, I will do it. Theoretically, all bitcoin could be lost, but practically, I think this is impossible, thanks to decentralization. That is, bitcoin is present in a very large number of people (in varying quantities). Even if there is only 1 BTC left, then even then it will be possible to split it into small parts and continue to use it, but the price, I think, will already be exorbitant. If the BTC-network is ever destined to cease to exist, it will not be because all the bitcoins are lost. It definitely is.",
