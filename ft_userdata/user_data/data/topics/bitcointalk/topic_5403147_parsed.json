I personally only have in my wallet btc and a little bit of eth and I'm happy with that because I know that in the near future they will come back on the axis and go up again.",

Weak hands are probably struggling these days fighting their own emotions, not to fall for another trap because of being impatient. Otherwise, everything will fall apart and see them in the losing end. So stay calm and don't panic. What we see now won't take forever, the market dump is only temporary. Instead, this is the perfect moment to buy and hold, as it could bring huge amount of profits when bitcoin skyrocket again and reach another new ATH.",

Everyone who's feeling a panic attack should do panic in buying instead of selling and worrying about the market situation.I know that it's hard to accept and deal with it but this is the market. The volatility that we've got is really disappointing probably for the new ones but this is also the reason why bitcoin went high. You only need to be patient and don't sell at losses or if you want to cut losses, I think it's too late so just hold or buy.",

The current market situation in my opinion is a very tough test to be applied by those who are impatient.Do not panic. Everything will get better.The biggest threat when the price drops is the loss or diminishing of the estimated value you have for your bitcoins and other Crypto assets. This is a factor that makes traders panic because not all traders and investors will be able to survive without worrying at times like this. Weak hands will sell and secure their capital, strong hands will buy to make a profit in the long term. Situations like this will continue to be repeated because the weak will get weaker and the strong will get stronger. So make a choice in which group we will be at a time like this and of course the finances and the strength of the funds we have will determine everything.",

This isn't the first time that the market has been this bad and old investors understands what's at stake and what they stand to gain should the market pump at any time. So let the impatient ones go on selling for there will always be buyers ready to buy and hold cause they know what's ahead only just a matter of time.Just recently I have come across a proliferation of advise related threads on the current market  and I wonder why, cause every well calculating investor will know this is the right time to hold patiently \"there will surely be light at the end of the tunnel\".",

Worrying about such things will only make you nervous, fearful, unable to enjoy life.My choice was to buy and hold bitcoin and if there's a nuclear war or a global ban, It's not something any of us can be ready for.

I will tell you, shitcoins wouldn't survive for long term and it's high chance your shitcoins will become dead coin e.g. worthless coin without any value.

That is how the value of Bitcoin increase with the passage of time. But things will not get better they will remain the same - people will get used to it.
