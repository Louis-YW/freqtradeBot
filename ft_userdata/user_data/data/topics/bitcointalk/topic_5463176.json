Because the more satoshi you pay as gas fee, the faster the transaction will be completed. If you give bitcoin transaction as 1 satoshi volume then hundreds of thousands more transactions will be buried then your transaction will be stuck for a long time. So to control it, you must increase the amount of Satoshi as volume, then the transaction will be completed very quickly. In most cases you can pay satoshi according to blocks and your transaction will complete quickly depending on the gas volume satoshi you pay.",

Maybe unless someone bought some Bitcoin right before some major event happened and the bitcoin Atm used an old fee and ended up getting added to the back of the list but that is rare.Most confirm quick because they don’t want people calling and complaining that their BTC isn’t confirmed yet. Also the atms got like a 10% fee so the actual fee is more than enough to cover the transaction fees.",

Before your transaction is broadcasted on the blockchain each nodes check the transaction and if anything unusual is found the transaction is dropped immediately. So saying a bitcoin transaction could even been seeing on your wallet is definitely wrong because it is after the nodes check the transaction that it could be added to mempool and subsequently the blockchain. Any transaction not in the blockchain can never be seeing in the wallet, in fact it takes at least one block confirmation for it to appear on an exchange and probably three for wallets. So a fake bitcoin transaction cannot pass this processes. The only way bitcoin cannot be seeing on the receiving address is when it is dropped back to the sender addresses after many days of unconfirmation in the mempool or if it is double spent to another wallet.",
