Those altcoins are 99% crappy, and the 1% that is better is not even similar to bitcoin.Bitcoin is the only one that is permitionless, borderless and censorship-resistant. And people need it, and they will chase it.Not to invest and become rich, but to protect themselves and their property.",

They are not the same, bitcoin maxis are totally different to altcoin investors. Obviously if there are less alts it suggests the price of bitcoin will be higher.Sometimes altcoin guys need to get totally rekt first to give them the push to be bitcoin only. Itâ€™s a painful experience for some guys.",

Some fresh shitcoin that was created 3 days ago will only attract thousands of dollars in investment, while the big shitcoins attract hundreds of millions.Shitcoins will remain popular because Bitcoin became too boring for trading addicts, they want more volatility and more opportunities to get rich quick. Perhaps many of such investors wouldn't invest in Bitcoin anyway, and would go for some other high risk assets like penny stocks or derivatives.",

And now I think people are starting to realize the huge difference.But what makes people still choose altcoins is because they want profits that they can achieve quickly even with higher risks. but even now actually trust in bitcoin continues to grow bigger. maybe if the number of choices were fewer then of course bitcoin would really be the most chosen option. even though it's like that now. i.e. even now bitcoin remains the most widely chosen.",

If you have made up your mind to do something and there it comes and you are doing another it seems though you are confused and you are yet to make up your mind for it but in respect to this topic you have raised, if it is someone who has knowledge of what they want then they can not be bothered with the numerous options they have seen. If at that stand, I think doing a little research would be ok to get insight of what they really want to invest in but if you have already done that, you should know that bitcoin has a big advantage over other Cryptos which must not be mistaken for a mismatch.",

There is only one best crypto which is bitcoin. If people fail to recognize bitcoin because of other options around them then they are doomed or they don't know what they are doing. A lot more cryptocurrencies will come in the future so there will be no lack of options for people. But choosing the right asset will secure their investment.",

So, too many options of crypto coins won't affect much to people's choice for the main investment. I believe everybody knows that Bitcoin is the only safest coin to invest in for the long term. But since altcoins prices are more volatile that offer the potential for bigger profits, people diversify their assets. Investing in altcoins isn't the wrong choice as long as people know which altcoins deserve to invest in!!",

Bitcoin is different, it is out of the reach of these altcoins both in terms of value for money and respect it has due to its price. Comparison is impossible, so thinking that altcoins are hindering the people to choose Bitcoin over them is a myth. For those who love btc, they will buy btc only. And altcoins are good, because when there are no choices, even investors get bored which is why we also see new companies' stocks popping up each day to give us more opportunities or to fetch away our money.",

I've said it years ago when I first joined the market that IMO most altcoins is just noise that's there to distract you and siphon some of the money away from bitcoin. Many of these coins exist only to decrease bitcoin's market cap and leach into it. You could see it in 2018 when a lot of these bitcoin imposters started to come out like BCG, BTG and so on. IMO people who are investing in altcoins are either looking for fast gain (pump and dump) ore are hedging against bitcoin, or at least trying to. A good example of a hedging altcoin is XRP but I don't think it's going to come out on top. Â don't own any XRP, I see no reason to go against bitcoin. If bitcoin fails XRP and other hedges will fail as well.",

It is the same with all the other things in life too. There will always be people who will be willing to invest in other crypto or alts. Otherwise, how could someone know that if they are bad or good. Let's say from your example. Movies right. Even if you find one movie worth watching, are you going to watch that over and over? And also how are you going to make sure that particular one is good and others are bad if you haven't watched them yet? After sometime in crypto world, people who are investing in shit coins are also investing in bitcoin too. But they are spreading their vision towards other side. When there are only countable few left, after trying them, investors will move towards Bitcoin for sure if they are not making any profits from those alts, and they know the future what Bitcoin holds.",

At the same time, they could earn -100 Â , but that's another story. If those opportunities would not be there the 100$ would go to BTC or at least a part of it.",

Your analogy is sound but the way you made use of it is wrong. You are supposing as if bitcoin has the same amount of popularity and acclaim as any other altcoin in the market, which let's face it, is not true. Bitcoin is the top dog in the market since Day 1, and that will never change. The way you used your analogy sounded like I could confuse Stranger Things on Netflix with any other show in there which is just not the case. Even newbies know the difference between investing in bitcoin and investing on a god-knows-what coin, so it doesn't make sense to confuse bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies just because there's a sea of them now.",

If there were fewer cryptocurrencies, bitcoin would have more investors than it does now, and other altcoins would also have more investors than they do now. More cryptocurrencies allow for greater investment diversification.",
