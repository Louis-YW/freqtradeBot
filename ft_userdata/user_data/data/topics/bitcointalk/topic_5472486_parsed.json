Their experts too started selling strange services in a way that was not ok. I guess thats why it does not exist anymore. You could buy positive reviews from their so-called \"experts\" on ICOs which turned out to be scams. They did not care as long as they got paid.",

They will provide whatever information if you pay them. I noticed it when they insisted on listing ripple years ago. Ripple is not a crypto. It is a centralized database and yet cmc listed it on the top of their market cap list for years. (They still do it btw) Cmc helped ripple build its reputation, not for free probably. At least they used to have a way simpler ui, now (after binance acquired it) it looks just like another Chinese brothel where you can’t get away without getting scammed.",

This post was made to ensure that cryptocurrency users do not make their conclusions based on data from only one free analytical service. Any information now needs to be checked for accuracy on several services.It’s better to look for information on official sources of the project.",

These applications require huge budgets for development and launch, in addition to operating costs, and therefore market whales like Binance are the only ones able to monopolize these services, and therefore they have absolute capabilities to manipulate data and blackmail whoever they want, whenever they want.This news does not surprise me because it is not the first time that one of the service platforms that dominate the largest part of the market has sought to extort its customers in various ways.",

The problem is that the costs are unreasonable. Just for the feed or API it feels like it's huge. They now know how valuable data from CMC is, so they turn any information there into business.",
