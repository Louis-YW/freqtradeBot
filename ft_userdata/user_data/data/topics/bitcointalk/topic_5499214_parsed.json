The BRC20 tokens and Runes are the cause of this. Bitcoin is created in a way that more of them like BRC20 tokens can still come to existence and also become bitcoin tokens.",

Bitcoin is created in a way that more of them like BRC20 tokens can still come to existence and also become bitcoin tokens.You are right about ordinals and Runes and how they spam the network, but the current increase in fee rate to around 500 sat/vbyte wasn't caused by them. That was caused by the big volume of consolidation transactions that were broadcasted with high fees in the past few hours.Here is an example.ffcf09aa48a4ea7a2d7650d012316fd84cb18eef3491502c3b209249320185a5",

I don't know if you can even force such a thing from the code, am I wrong?On the subject,  I always thought that you spend money to make money, this is about money flow, so even if they spend the transferred sums on blackjack and hookers they don't have to spend 40 millions a day on fees, if they do so then it means they make 45 millions out of this, so forgive my language but where are those 45 million coming from?Someone is enabling those fees to exist by spending it and with what purpose and more of a concern of mine with what LIMIT?",

For the last few hours, they have been spending over $15K on each transaction as a fee and for a block, it's around 300K I am not sure if someone is actually sending this TX with this fee or if their automation script got messed up and spending more than what they are supposed to do.I assume later is the reason and it's late because they realized it and put the force on the pedal.",

For example in this ongoing attack the exploit had to be patched in early days (the unlimited witness size) and other ways they use (the OP_FALSE OP_IF thing) should have become non-standard.QuoteOn the subject,  I always thought that you spend money to make money, this is about money flow, so even if they spend the transferred sums on blackjack and hookers they don't have to spend 40 millions a day on fees, if they do so then it means they make 45 millions out of this, so forgive my language but where are those 45 million coming from?Someone is enabling those fees to exist by spending it and with what purpose and more of a concern of mine with what LIMIT?When it comes to this particular spam attack the participants are the regular people who are gambling on junk that is not even real. Just because someone is calling that junk \"token\" and has created a market where these gamblers can bet on its price. This is what makes it last and hard to counter. There is no limit to this either, they don't need millions to pull off this attack either. For a newbie who is hoping to make a big profit (like a grand if the junk gets pumped) it doesn't matter if their transaction costs like $50.P.S. The 500 sat/vb is caused by the consolidation as @hosseinimr93 said but it is shooting up this high because of the ongoing spam attack that had already kept the mempool semi-congested.",

Those in the network get a lot of benefits, but they have a bad effect on the ecosystem.But they continue to evolve and more and more attention is paid to the network, is it possible that someday it will not interfere with the main network, or will this continue to happen?",

If we should say that they should censor this kind of transactions then it affects decentralization of the network. This persistent high fees has made bitcoiners to treat it of late like an investment rather than a currency for transactions. I myself wouldn’t advise anyone to make transactions when the fees will eat up the fees.",

In the last few months I've been constantly paying below $5 for my transactions and they were always going through. Sometimes it took 30 minutes, sometimes 2 hours, but it was always done pretty fast, especially when compared with banks that don't send transactions on Sundays at all and it often takes them 2 or 3 hours to process a transaction on working days. Don't pay the average, check what will get you processed within 5 or 6 blocks and pay that, unless the transaction is so important it doesn't matter if you pay $20 or more, as long as it's through within 10 minutes.",
