  "content": "Few days ago, I came across a topic on this forum discussing that ledger now gives customers to option to store their wallet seed phrase through a cloud service within the wallet, several users, not just on this forum but also outside this forum, expressed deep concern as no one is sure any longer on the true privacy of the ledger hardware wallet..Going through a channel I subscribed to on telegram this afternoon, I found this information which states that \"Ledger Confirmed that the government can get access to customers funds - though I tried to do some research to ascertain the validity of this information, that is, to try and get the real source of the information (since it was not shared on the telegram post) to make sure it's authentic, but all efforts proved abortive since I am not sure about the social media the screenshot was taken from - here is the shot..Though like I said earlier, I've not been able to verify the authenticity of this information, but then, if this information be true, then I think we all should be very careful with ledger devices - privacy wise.",

      "body": "This is likely to happen in any way. The ledger's first mistake is to even integrate an option that will allow users to backup their phrases to an online storage (where is the decentralized and privacy protection here?).We know there is so much concern regarding how users are losing their funds on a daily basis, but those losses are most often caused by user carelessness, which should not be used to justify what the entire customer wants. There could also be a possibility that they might actually have user data, especially for those who got the new wallet after the cloud update.It's always safer when you don't have access to something at all than having it and telling someone that their secret is safe with you. If the government finds out that users wallet access is in the hands of the ledger management, they can request immediate access to it with any fabricated excuse, and any register company will find it hard to refuse a compliance with the fed.QuoteBut assets could get frozen. No, they can't freeze the funds on the user's wallet since those funds are not on a centralized platform but are under each phrase or private key that makes up the wallet. You can always import your phrase using another wallet and move out your funds, but what they can do is help you empty your wallet and send you a notification to come clean and claim your funds.",

And the solution made by the ledger is for their users that if the seed phrase is lost, they can still recover it by accessing the fund here.       But many people are worried about this because it appears that the users have no privacy because they will be asked for KYC, something that is not good in my opinion. Maybe just replace it with another hardware wallet that is better than the ledger, after all there are also many newly released hardware wallets that are better than the ledger and more secure.",

Almost every entity is willing to give out your information to government if found coupable or under serious investigation. Anyone who wants to live a 100% private life should also ensure that there is no cockroach in his/her cupboard. The government is too powerful and I have learnt from others mistake so many times. The government is not isolated but connected. If you want to be private, just go there 100% and pay any amount it will cost to be private. Once you are exposed in one way, they will get you from the loophole. Even if Ledger doesn't disclose your funds to government, if the government come for it themselves, you will surely disclose it.",

This has been confirmed by multiple Ledger officials, so it is pretty solid information. Ledger has made it clear that for their \"Recover\" service, they will be handing over user's private data to external companies registered in the EU and US. It is not surprising, really. We all know that law enforcement agencies in those jurisdictions collaborate closely when it comes to investigations and prosecutions.So, it is pretty obvious that if any legal issues come up, there is a chance that user's private information could be accessed and used in those investigations. It is definitely something to keep in mind when considering the risks and benefits of using such a service. It is a bit sad, though, that many newcomers to the crypto might not be aware or concerned about these aspects. It is just like when people trusted centralized services like the FTX exchange to hold their funds, and we all know how that turned out.",

I'm talking about 2019 when I bought mine. At the time it was a decent option and I've got mine in person from a physical store, so I did not have to share any personal information with Ledger and avoided the leak.As long as the cloud update isn't enforced and you can decide not to do it (unless you cannot, but you should be able to, at least for now), I see nothing wrong with this. The problem will start if they one day decide that unless you do the update you won't be able to use the device. In such case I'll probably do it and immediately move my funds, to protect them from theft.",

It's peer to peer, not trust your peers in the bitcoin industry. This only solidifies that notion. Now this means you literally can't have anyone get a hold of your bitcoins otherwise you risk losing them through hackings, and now through the government issuing a subpoena and therefore accessing your funds which I must say is a massive dick move.
