I recall it was possible to take Bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain and bridge it to WBTC which was on the Ethereum blockchain.Both RenBTC and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) do the same thing, they basically lock your BTC and issue you a token on the ETH chain, it's NOT a real bridge, there is no real peg between those, if BitGo goes down everything goes with them, including the real BTC and the fake WBTC.A real bridge is not currently possible and I pretty much doubt it will ever be unless both chain devs come to a mutual understanding, otherwise, the only true options are in the second layers on BTC like liquid or RSK",

I know its very easy to bridge with ETH, ARB, POLY, BNB, ZkSync, etc however is it possible to bridge back and forth with the BTC blockchain?Bitcoin's base layer lacks support for complex smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, for cross-chain bridges to be possible, you must first tokenize native BTC into a synthetic asset that merely mimics the value of BTC.As far as I know, you can only get wBTC through a custodial bridging process. You deposit Bitcoin, and in return, someone mints an equivalent amount of wBTC tokens for you. So, basically, it is an exchange.",

You could just deposit your BTC, and then on the withdrawal process, you can choose the network you want to withdraw your WBTC to.I agree with you on this method that is less risky than using cryptocurrency bridges. Using centralized exchanges have risk too but we can avoid KYC by choosing non KYC centralized exchanges to use.

Probably still in the making. There are some bridges before that I encoutered of but it seems its like an atomic swap version or crosshain. Bridging is something like sensitive of. As far as I know avalanche develop a bridge of bitcoin directly to avax network bitcoin but not of eth. But you could already converted that unit into eth and bridge to common L1 after that.",

Or some other stablecoin?Nothing has changed, there is still one point of failure. It is true that in the case of CEX, the probability of failure is greater, as your account can be frozen or identity verification may be requested, but all current bridges require trust in them, trust that there is no vulnerable when locking your bitcoin and that there is enough From the liquidity to sell WBTC, here if there is not enough liquidity, you may sell WBTC at less than its price.Why not try P2P DEX like bisq It's decentralized, and you have many options so you won't have to worry about liquidity.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on September 11, 2023, 01:19:58 AMCryptocurrency bridges are not good enough in their security and many bridges were hacked.

I get that some people may want that but that doesn't mean that wanting something equals to logical thing. You may want something that is illogical and useless as well.You should not really need or require an onchain ETH type of wrapped bitcoin on that chain, it is really not a smart thing to require, just get out and get bitcoin and it is equally possible. I get that some people do not want to pay the transaction fee but risking it that much gives you bigger risk and the transaction fee looks a lot less costly at that point. Either you lose 5 bucks on the fee, or you lose it all .If you are not aiming at just BTC and want to stay in the chain, pick something better.",

Or some other stablecoin?This is the price of WBTC versus the price of Bitcoin during the last year. Do you think that this currency is really locking Bitcoin 1:1, or is it closer to being a stablecoin whose price is linked to Bitcoin, but the difference here is that in the case of the dollar, there is a difference of a few cents, and it was at the level of 30 thousand $ is not noticeable but the difference of .001 Bitcoin would be significant.All of these currencies will end up closer to what happened with Luna, so no one knows what will happen when the price of Bitcoin rises and everyone wants to sell. your best options currently are CEXs and we have a good list ----> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5461920.0",

For a higher fee, there's also those non-deposit exchanges like eXch.cx which have started advertising in BitcoinTalk through their own signature campaign. Third-party risks are probably the same as Bitstamp and other centralized exchanges, but they act like \"bridges\" and there's no need to go through KYC.Plus OP, why not hold the actual base coin/unit for that blockchain instead of holding Bitcoin as an IOU in another blockchain? It's better to hold the shitcoin than holding an IOU in a blockchain of a shitcoin.",

At least in this way you can avoid the charge fee and also avoid the possible issue of liquidity problems, of course we can't say that. You know the risk is always there in such transactions.

In my perspective, it is possible, but making a move is difficult.Most of the time something like this is designed with a trading purpose in mind. Faster transaction and relatively cheap fee to transfer with a shaky guarantee that you don't lose your Bitcoin as long as you don't sell your wrapped tokens. Tokenization is the last thing that matters when people do this. Even if they did, you can argue that you don't need other chains and use Bitcoin instead. It is really not difficult, others give you examples of services doing that already. CMIIW.",
