So when my balance returned to 12.4EOS i tried withdrawing but my withdrawal got declined After i asked in. Live chat if that normal a guy moderator there told me i habe to deposit 30$ to be able to withdraw and wager it 5times Wich is ridiculus. After i moved to chat it turned to be the guy from players chat is the same guy in the live support he told me to deposit 0.0005btc and wager 5times to be able to withdrawing. Btw first in live chat they accused me of multi accounts . i never had any other account in this site btw. Better stay away . i did mean to try the site with just a small amount. https://ibb.co/4PZMx3Dhttps://ibb.co/ym9XYYyhttps://ibb.co/GH7QQgJWith a little investigation i foind that the same OP Coinbox1 is the same one in players chat who asked me to deposit more and accused me of multi accounts when i refused to do so. Also is the same in live support Also by cheking the Trustpilot page its obvious so many fake reviews from the owners of truatdiceIf someone read the reviews its like from the same personhttps://www.trustpilot.com/review/trustdice.win",

It's there for anti money laundering. When you play on a gambling site, you should look into their ToS before depositing so you know if you'll be able to comply.Also, don't look for any of their reps to reply in this thread, they have already stated they will not reply in this section ever again. Your best bet is to post in their thread.",

I still can’t understand why only new users that claims to get scammed by casinos, i have also some issues with casinos such as delayed withdrawal or high wagering requirements. But they always process my orders of withdrawing.I believe that you didn’t read their ToS, and your story doesn’t make any sense because let’s be honest why a casino will choose to scam you and destroy their reputation for 8$? While they can scam other users with way much higher balances. The reviews from trustpilot are paid for, i mean Trustdice pays you if you provide them with a review from your choice.",

There’s no way that they will watch you betting pattern just defeat while they have a lot of customers that betting more. Why they will need to cheat if the house edge will surely make them win in the long run.X5 wagering requirements is really high but that’s their ToS and you are obligated to read that before you register before you accuse a service as scam.",

But for this case, I'll say there's nothing wrong from their side. The terms is agreed by you upon signing up, there are plenty of materials to study about the terms on this forum. IIRC, the wagering requirement even discussed on their ANN thread.Quote from: Martingaleboy on June 18, 2023, 04:49:47 AMMy posynis for warning others.

We appreciate it.We'd really appreciate it more if you can change your thread title to better fit your goal, perhaps something like, \"Warning: Trustdice Withdrawal Requirement\" instead of \"Just got scammed by Trustdice.win stay away\". Which one you aimed for? A scam accusation report or a simple warning to the community?",

      "body": "well, it is important to read the casino TOS, unfortunately this is something that not many people have been doing, but they should start doing, because many casinos have placed high wagering requirements, and when people don't read the TOS then we see things like this one from this thread, you just need to keep playing so that you meet the requirements and then make a withdrawal, I hope that after you meet all the requirements they don't ask you to kyc, and after you meet the kyc they don't accuse you of having given a fake kyc, because even though this casino has some positive reviews on askgamblers.com, they have had a lot of relationships on casino.guroand people have been complaining about kyc and fake documents that the casino keeps saying that people are giving away and that's why it blocks the account or freezes funds, I don't know how far these complaints can be true, maybe they are fake complaints, but in this situation it's better that you use another casino and before creating another casino make sure you read the casino's TOS well and then analyze whether it will really be worth using the casino or not. don't look at the bonus, forget the bonus, look at the wagering requirement and the casino's reputation, it makes no sense to use a casino with 2x or more stake requirements to be able to withdraw money or that has frequent scam accusations and always for the same subject",

Their dice game is provably fair. So you can verify the fairness of the results by yourself. You can read more about how their pf algorithm works and how to verify the results from here: https://trustdice.win/blog/bitcoin-casinos-the-provably-fair-algorithmQuoteAfter i asked in.
