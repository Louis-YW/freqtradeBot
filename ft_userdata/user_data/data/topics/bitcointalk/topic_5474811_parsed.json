When it comes to investing goals, there are also risks and tolerances for investors due to AI potential and rebalancing.  Furthermore, AI is biased, which might lead to erroneous reception. It is also not ideal for such scenarios, which is another approach for forming opinions. According to the definition of AI (artificial intelligence), other names for \"artificial\" were \"false or fake,\" not true.

My Strategy is centered around using AI to analyze data and trends of the current market and then rebalancing my portfolio based on my findings. What are you all doing/have done to build your portfolio? My way of building a Bitcoin portfolio is consistency and knowing the right way to use purchasing strategies when I have money. Bitcoin is the best choice especially for me at the moment and bitcoin is also part of the choice that I continue to believe has a path to financial freedom. You are so confident in claiming that you are an experienced investor, but unfortunately there will be many people who will start to underestimate you because this gesture does not show your strength as an experienced investor but rather tries to offer yourself to teach other people.I am not hinting at your method and perhaps there is no clear picture of that strategy. Al is not completely 100% accurate though they can do that and you also have to carry out your own analysis before making a decision. I don't know how you will do it and if you use this strategy every time you enter a trade without evaluating and matching it with your own analysis. Because I am a typical person who likes to see the predictions of many people before deciding on a decision based on my own analysis.",

For Bitcoin, I use the DCA strategy, which provides the opportunity to buy Bitcoin once every two weeks or once a month. For altcoins, this is a bit difficult because you have to find the altcoin.But I tried to analyze the altcoins that are in the top 50-100 list. I am still focusing on investing in Bitcoin rather than altcoins. I have never used AI to analyze data or market trends to find the coins. Moreover, I don't focus too much on buying altcoins. I still have some altcoins left in my wallet.Could you tell me what kind of AI you are using? Maybe we can also learn from the AI you use. Well, who knows, it could also be of benefit to us.",

My Strategy is centered around using AI to analyze data and trends of the current market and then rebalancing my portfolio based on my findings. What are you all doing/have done to build your portfolio?AI can't analyze data and trends of the current market and if you rely on AI's analysis then surely you'll see huge losses in crypto world. A better thing is to learn about the market from scratch and once you learn about it in detail then try investing in crypto most probably into Bitcoin when you see dips. It's the best strategy so far for investors find dips and accumulate Bitcoin during those dips. The portfolio will grow over time and you'll also be profitable in long term.My simple strategy is to buy when you see dips in the price of Bitcoin or some other major altcoins but the trusted and reputed ones and hold those for at least a few years and gain at least 100% or more profit from each coin other than Bitcoin because it's worth it to hold Bitcoin for long-term instead of selling it to earn 100% profit from the initial investment. When you gain 100% Profit then sell 50% of the altcoin and wait for other opportunities to invest the money. It's that simple but someone who's greedy and who can't control his/her emotions won't be able to do that and that's why I believe that only those who can control their emotions of greed will have profits for long term.",

All I am doing is, doing my own research and buying when I have some spare money. It's not like DCA even though I know DCA is the best method to build up the portfolio. But you can still buy alts before they get listed on some exchanges. Actually, it's hard to know which crypto will be listed on exchanges and which won't. Because most of the crypto project promises that they will list on this and that exchanges, but after the presale, they just get vanished and never get listed in any exchanges. So, I recommended to invest in some established coins.",

What are you all doing/have done to build your portfolio?So now AI can analyze the data to predict the future. IMO it can be really dangerous as if AI analyzes the data of Shiba INU or PEPE and suggests you buy that token for the long term then how will you react? In the past these two projects have shown amazing growth but I don't think they have a bright future. So be careful when using robots to predict the future because i think there are still some sectors where human brains can outperform AI.My strategy is simple, keep buying every dip and repeating this process till the bull run starts. I also tried to keep some assets in altcoin based on their narratives. If I am investing in an AI or GameFI project then I will pick the top two from those categories and invest an small amount in each.",
