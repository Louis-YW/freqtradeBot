Here's a link to the release for anyone interested in checking it out.The recent turmoil referred to in the article is the current bear market, which is present in every speculative market, even stocks.The idea that regulation benefits the public and prevents such situations is false.We've had real estate crashes, stock crashes etc; while they are regulated.Quote from: vEmpire-DDAO on July 12, 2022, 12:58:03 PMPlenty of 'experts' are saying that the crypto industry should welcome the regulation with open arms, as centralization would, apparently, further stabilize the market and protect the investors' funds,The term 'experts' get thrown around a lot, and doesn't have much meaning in present day reporting.Centralization of a decentralized market does not make it better, it just makes it easier to control, which is the major aim of the report.",

However the scaremongering remains inefficient.They will never succeed. They will fail, their banker criminal friends will fail and Bitcoin will stand.",

Moreover I don't know what are they doing with the funds in their accounts.Again, regulation does not mean protection from market volatility, but from bankruptcy, poor capital management and so on.",

They can only nake recommendations and that's going to be the case. It depends on the country itself whether they want to impose any rules or not and if they want to, they can use the recommendation as a guideline. So that's fine! I don't see any impact here! Let them do their job and we will do ours. That should be it! Nothing to worry about. Rather it is very much possible that a favorable guidelines will be issues.",
