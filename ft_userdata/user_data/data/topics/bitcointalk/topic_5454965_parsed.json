On top of that, Chipmixer was only running through an onion link, which could only be accessed using the Tor browser. Thus, any kind of Chipmixer website on the Clearnet is almost definitely a scam or phishing attempt. Thus, it'd be best to stay away from any kind of website that resembles the real CM and stick to a few alternative mixers that you can find around the forum.",

Maybe there are still those folks that have funds there and trying to acquire their funds that's stuck there but due to the seizing, it was left there. The trickery is maybe telling these people that they can recover and send it back to them unless they pay a fee or it's simply just portraying as the legit one and anything that's deposited there is gone forever.",

Chipmixer has been seized, that means, just forget Chipmixer and never use any name/service associated with them, they aren't going to return back and don't expect that one of their moderator or co-owner escaped and decided to rebuild a similar business.

There's something with brands, when a particular brand is flagged, everything including name or activities involving the brand is also flagged.There's actually nothing on the internet today which has a prefix or suffix of ChipMixer that is legit.In the case that ChipMixer is cleared of the allegations against them, they will likely re-start with a new domain, unless FBI and other regulatory bodies involved in the seizure of the site will make a public notice about the case which I know they cannot.",

These are statements of truth but I have an excerpt from the last paragraph of your posts...\"clarify us what has happened, and cover the damages of their clients\"ChipMixer was the most popular mixer known in Bitcointalk,  but considering how popular they were, we didn't see cases of clients complaining of loses.
