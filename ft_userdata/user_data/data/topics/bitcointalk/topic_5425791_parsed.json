  "content": "QuoteEmployment is an ultimatum game, where playing along might get workers less than employers, but refusing to play gets everyone zero.Inflation is up. The stock market is down. Unemployment is just 3.5 percent. Yet labor force participation remains stubbornly low, with only 62.3 percent of the civilian population working or actively looking for work—well below pre-pandemic levels. And even before the pandemic, that figure had been steadily declining for years.There are plenty of uncharitable theories about why the American work force is shrinking as a percentage of the population, resulting in 10 million unfilled jobs and a lot of well-wrung hands. The most common is simply that Kids These Days don't want to work and it'll be Gen Z's fault when the U.S. is no longer a global economic superpower.A substantial number of younger people are not, in fact, keen to get hitched with an employer. In 2022, \"for every [25- to 54-year-old] guy who is out of work and looking for a job,\" American Enterprise Institute economist Nicholas Eberstadt told the Fifth Column podcast, \"there are four guys who are neither working nor looking for work.\"But the Kids These Days hypothesis is complicated by the fact that while the labor force participation rate includes people 16 and older, the largest component of the most recent reduction appears to be older people who took retirement early and/or previous retirees who have not rejoined the work force at the rates they once did. This trend may well reverse itself if the stock market continues to decline and retirement accounts evaporate, but for now it looks like baby boomers turning on, tuning in, and dropping out—however belatedly—are at least as much of a labor force problem as wayward youths.What these two groups have in common can be found in an old chestnut of game theory: the ultimatum game. Even if you don't know the 1982 paper that popularized the experiment, you've certainly encountered the phenomenon. Imagine two people, one of whom is given $10 and told to propose a way to split the money with another person—a stranger, let's say. The catch is that if the stranger doesn't agree to the deal, they both get nothing.Economists and psychologists alike love this experiment because it captures an interesting facet of human behavior that appears irrational at first glance. Surely the second man should accept any deal offered by the first. So what if he's offered just a penny? Free money is free money! Who cares if the other guy gets to keep $9.99? Instead, across all cultures and contexts, people reject offers they perceive to be unfair: The details vary, but human beings turn down money with astonishing consistency if they think they're being done dirty.This allegory* to economic unfairness may well be what unites the \"quiet quitters\" of Gen Z and the early boomer retirees: They increasingly perceive the terms of employment to be so off-kilter that they would rather not work at all, even if that decision screws them over in the end.\"The process of contracting a worker is often close to ultimatum bargaining,\" explained Elwyn Davies (then with the University of Oxford) and Stanford University's Marcel Fafchamps in a 2016 paper exploring the effects of competition on behavior within the ultimatum game. \"The employer specifies a job description and proposes a wage and the worker accepts or rejects.\"So if employment is an ultimatum game—where playing along might get workers less than employers, but refusing to play gets everyone zero—what is causing the perception that the terms of employment are no longer worth accepting, even when both parties would benefit?Positive views of capitalism more generally have slipped since 2019, with 39 percent expressing negative views in an August Gallup poll. Another Gallup poll found an uptick of 3 percentage points in people who say they are \"completely dissatisfied\" with their jobs, while the number of people who were \"completely satisfied\" fell 8 points.The perception that conventional jobs are essentially offering workers a pittance while greedily holding back the bulk of the wealth is common in places like the r/antiwork subreddit, which has 2.3 million members. In fact, there's at least one discussion of the ultimatum game itself on that subreddit, which pulls some figures on companies' revenue vs. worker compensation and concludes: \"If working for Apple was the ultimatum game, the proposer just got $100. They're offering you 23 [cents], and they keep $99.77. Deal or no deal?\" The relative sizes of these numbers might also explain why simply raising wages hasn't brought people into the workforce, especially when paired with increased awareness of and dissatisfaction with the gap between CEO pay and worker pay in large corporations.Early retirement also makes some sense on this accounting. Older people may have expectations about what their compensation or responsibilities should be, with reference to either the generation who retired before them or to their younger colleagues. When they are not offered what they perceive to be their due, they would rather zero out their income than continue to work.Paul J. Zak, a neuroeconomist who has done experimental work on the role of empathy and perspective-taking in the ultimatum game, cautions against an approach that is \"too econo-centric.\" Large and unpredictable government subsidies to individuals and corporations erode the broader sense that hard work will be rewarded and is worth pursuing, even if the wages offered previously seemed fair. There is almost certainly more at play than wage and price levels alone.The pandemic threw a wrench into this and every sociological and economic question and will continue to annoy academics looking for patterns for at least another century. Many jobs did get appreciably worse during the height of COVID, when death suddenly became a possible side effect of working in the grocery store, a factor that shouldn't be underestimated. But decreases in labor force participation predate the pandemic.In many ways, work is better than it has ever been. It is less dangerous, requires fewer hours, is less physically taxing, and affords the purchase of better stuff than for most of human history. But the supply chain interruptions of recent years paired with rapid changes in the terms of employment during the pandemic may well have disrupted the sense that the deal workers were being offered was fair.The temptation of the ultimatum game is to dismiss the results as irrational and therefore bad. It's easy to dismiss workers as lazy or employers as short-sightedly selfish. But the consistency with which individuals in nearly all situations perform in the ultimatum game actually highlights something good about people: They care about what is fair and they will devote significant effort to making deals where everyone wins. The authors of that 2016 paper found, for instance, that in an environment with multiple employers and multiple employees, the offers tended to start higher and employees tended to do better overall. Competition causes employers to think harder about what workers want and to offer it as seamlessly as possible.Right now there's something broken in our economy that is preventing employers and employees from cooperating with each other. The result is that too few deals are being struck and everyone is suffering. The challenge ahead is how to rebuild a sense that the game is fair and everyone is playing in good faith.https://reason.com/2022/12/01/the-labor-market-is-broken/....Here we have a deep analysis with the potential to explain trends being current labor markets being broken:QuoteWhat these two groups have in common can be found in an old chestnut of game theory: the ultimatum game.

A job that pays $10 an hour is a big deal for a lot of people in developing companies and what is not known is that there are real brilliant talent in these developing countries. A lot of them just need an opportunity. So what these outsourcing companies do is go for the ones with the most of experience and they get the job perfectly well with way lower cost. More and more business will start to outsource once they see the advantages of doing so.",

That is the government salary paid jobs, they can not afford anything near better living because of inflation as the main cause and that is why every home to survive have other things to do to raise money by the side. In Africa and especially in Nigeria unlike before where the culture is that the man is the bread winner of the family and goes out to struggle to feed the home, this is no longer happening like that as the reality of the economic hardship is even biting the women folks when the husband can't sustain the family from what he is able to bring, the womei now works and in some families are now the bread winners. People have resorted into different means of survival and at the end of the day, what comes in from those means far outweighs government salaries. Begging and corporate begging is what some people have found to do. When you go to eateries, you see the service attendants there from the gates, doors and those in service expecting you to drop some change for them and this happens across the world not only in Africa, that is corporate begging.",

There are thousands of people working everyday and not making as much as the CEO, and that is the biggest problem.I am not saying that one worker should be making as much as the CEO, of course not, but if CEO yearly earning equals to over 1000 of his employees, that's unfair and it is not free money neither these workers are working 8 hours a day minimum and for 5 days a week minimum as well. That is over 2000 hours per year, and we are talking about 1 CEO worth over 2.000.000 hours work done by the employees, do you think that is fair? It is not fair and it is not for nothing.",

Wealth growth flatlining for other income brackets, could have reached a breaking point where having a job and working full time no longer allows many to pay their bills. In which case, the point and motive for working declines.Isn't that just capitalism? Money gets more and more concentrated, and it's up to government to prevent that. The US isn't very good at preventing it, and the EU mainly acts in the interests of large corporations too, so the current result isn't really a surprise.A market crash seems unacceptable to central banks nowadays, so the classic \"reset\" won't happen. What's left? War?\"is it just capitalism\"capitalism is not wealth generation for all. its instead 'all wealth roads lead to the capital'(AKA a pyramid). where business owners dont have to work hard because the residual income from thousands of customers below them give that one guy 1000's combinedwhilst those at the bottom of the capitalism pyramid themselves need to find more then one job for them to get enough income to survive oncapitalism is a pyramida pyramid that cannot support more then X layers before there is no one on the bottom to find more income streams to survivewhen businesses saturate the market and cant get $10 from each customer of 100m customers to be \"billionaire status\". they are then stuck having to raise the ask for $11 from each, then $12 from eachwhilst the bottom of the pyramid are not seeing their bottom increase from $10 to $11 then $12 at the same rate as the asks from the topbusinesses are asking for more from customers. but not increasing their own employee pay at same increase ratecapitalism doesnt work",

      "body": "There is also a good old \"no-work\" system going on, where people quit, and that leaves companies wanting for workers, and they cant profit at all without workers, and that resulted with them hiring people for higher prices as well.I mean think about it this way, if you had a worker who got 20 dollars an hour, and he quit, and you put out ad to hire someone for 20 bucks an hour, and nobody replied, or at least nobody acceptable, what would you do? You would put it at 25 per hour, then 30, until you get a worker. So that is actually a great way to tell the companies that you are not willing to work for peanuts when they make billions and actually get a decent profit.",

That is done in other parts of the world as well. They are freelance nurses and in the pandemic period they did this to make more money, there were some nurses making more money than doctors in my nation for example, all because they had part time contracts which means they could do 8 hours in one place, and 8 hours in another back to back, and definitely tiresome no argument there but they could also work 7 days a week, meaning they could technically work up to 100 hours a week, considering they were getting paid by the hour, that means 400 hours a month, making them more than most doctors. But now the need is lesser, and everyone is going back to regular full-time these days.",
