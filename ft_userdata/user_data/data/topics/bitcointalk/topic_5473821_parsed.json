I am offering from $50 - $1000 depending on the details.2. Reason to buy these items is to have transaction / trading / appreciation history that is separate from one's own wallets or accounts just in case. Such bought histories can become handy without having to leak your own transaction history which in many cases lead to a cold wallet (main wallet). You can CoinJoin to spend from cold wallet which everyone should do but in certain cases some people may not want to leak how many x profit they have made and keep cold wallet as their own private intel.3. I am not only looking for ETH wallets.You could send me more details about the ForkDelta wallet.",
