  "content": "We may have come across a tweet Link, but when we click on it, it takes us to an account with a completely different username. This is because the username of that Twitter account has been changed, making it difficult to prove that the account truly belongs to a user who is evading ban.. So I was proposing that after any user is reported for Plagiarism, Ban Evasion, or any other offense that may result in a Ban, the ID number of all the user's social media accounts be reported in a separate thread.The reason for this is that even if the username of a Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or other social media account is changed, the ID number remains the same, so if a user tries to avoid a ban by changing his/her social media usernames, the ID number in this thread will serve as proof that those accounts are truly connected.I decided to open a Twitter account just to demonstrate what I mean.  here's an image before I change the namehere's the link of the tweet before I changed the user: https://twitter.com/cantsaybttalk/status/1584047918712991744?t=5YjgC6GhiYMr7fsDXBKekg&s=19you can see that when you click on that link it takes you to a Twitter account with another username, like I said earlier that the username has changed. Now let's see how the twitter id can help link both account together. Before I changed the username from @cantsaybttalk to @cantsay108 I saved the ID number using https://findidfb.com/find-twitter-id/ (we have other site also.)image of @cantsaybttalk ID number and here's an image showing the ID number of the new Username (@cantsay108)You can still see that after changing the username the ID number still remains the same.  NOTE: Once the username has been changed you can't use the previous username to check for the user ID number. We could also use a certain format for reporting:Code:[B]• Reporting Social Media Account of Banned User•[/b]Bitcointalk username:Bitcointalk profile link: Link to a post where the social media account was posted (Archived form):Social Media id number: [list][li]Facebook id: [/li][li]Twitter id: [/li][li]Instagram id:[/li][li]TikTok id: [/li][/list]Image with id number: There will also be a Spreadsheet where all of the reported account will be recorded after verifying if they're truly correct so users can easy browse through to check if an ID number already exist.  SPREADSHEET Example• Reporting Social Media Account of Banned User•Bitcointalk username: voa664Bitcointalk profile link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3440975Link to a post where the social media account was posted (Archived form):  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram  Social Media id number: Facebook id: 100011486178832Twitter id: 1148133176453357568Instagram id: 7279328583TikTok id: N/A Images containing social media id: Twitter id Facebook Id: Instagram Id:The only question now is whether mods/admin will regard this as proof that both accounts are owned by the same user.If they agree, I can lock this thread and start a new one where the reporting will take place.This, I believe, will also benefit the forum in some ways.What are your thoughts on this? Do you have any suggestions?",

You can not force people to use social media platforms if they don't want to. You should not require them to do it as a prerequisite to join the Bitcointalk forum.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 23, 2022, 12:26:48 PMI expect people who use this trick eventually will make mistake by copying wrong link or forget to change username when they create new account. But on a side note, i wonder how bounty manager react when username on given link and twitter page is different.Managers should make their jobs easier by marking 'Ineligible\" for any participants (bounty hunters) who change Twitter or Facebook handles during the campaign time. The rule should be the same like if a participants change avatar and signature during a campaign time.It is unnecessary for them to check either Twitter UID or Facebook UID.",

I never considered it being utilized to catch forum ban evaders. I have a strong suspicion that many people have utilized this technique to link their just opened account to their former social media account, which was previously linked to a banned account. Except when they are purchased, building a social media account is difficult and will take time, hence this method is a better option for them. Both buyers and sellers could easily fall for this trap. This is a suggestion that should be considered, and I hope the forum can use it.",

Few hundred thousands so finding all those numbers and compiling into a thread or software is almost not possible so what can be the better idea is to ask opinion about adding their UID numbers of social media accounts while posting the Proof of authentication post so atleast in future bounty hunters will have lesser time to trace and link the accounts.",

Do you have any suggestions?Certainly, Twitter ID is the best solution for monitoring the activity of an account on Twitter. but trading twitter accounts are much more common than trading forum accounts, and a suspicious user can always refer to the fact that he bought a TW account and does not know its previous history. and you can't blame anyone for that.your proposal makes sense but requires a lot of extra work and I think it is not sustainable. I would say that the managers should take responsibility for that, (mainly those who run shit token campaigns) because they are the ones who accept the low-level quality of participants. it would be in their interest to filter the participants, but they don't seem to care much about the quality of the campaign. with rare exceptions.",

      "body": "Interesting technique. I am curious, is it possible to find out what someone's social media UID is without using a third-party service such as that findidfb website that you mentioned? Facebook and Twitter doesn't give people the option to find that?Seems like quite a complicated process for several reasons:1. The admins aren't going to make posting your social media UID when you apply for such campaigns mandatory.2. Most bounty managers aren't going to do it either. Nor do they care abut stuff like that when the goal is just the quantity of posts/tweets. So those hunting for ban evaders will have to do all this manually when they have a suspicion. Alternatively, maybe guys like LoyceV or DdmrDdmr can automate the process somehow and find a way to query that site for UIDs, connect the numbers with known social media account names and Bitcointalk accounts, and then dump all that data somewhere.",

Basically, bounty hunters are lazy and what they join and work with social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook and so on) are simply zero- or very low-quality. They simply copy and paste their own works repeatedly or worse, plagiarize works of others.We should consider the initial idea and reason why projects decide to run bounties that are useless. But project teams don't lose anything, they run bounties and pay with tokens that are minted by their teams from the air. By that, they don't have to care about work quality of bounty hunters. If companies don't care, why bounty managers should care about that.I agree that if we want to keep the forum clean from bounties, let's consider some potential solutions.Disable that board.Another suggestion (years ago) is: force altcoin projects to pay their bounties with Bitcoin, to reduce their scam intensity and require them to consider more about work quality of bounty hunters.",
