People think say to make investment na when you go begin receive like 200k to 5m for monthly go make us do investment or even diversify our investment. Na this things dey kill our Youth wetin make them no fit focus to save or investment, since them go always say make we shop first money for investment dey come na so man dey carry dey poor for life. I could remember a post in the bitcoin discussion side wey been say even though we no fit raise to $200 per week, or per month make we at least raise $10 either every week or month for investment by so doing you go see say you ¬†no go know wen you don end up saving much in BTC and that may turn your story maybe during bull run or after halving since we dey always get new ATH after halving.Then back to wetin you talk say the kind of money wey we dey get no go fit allow us do things dey wey we want, go really show say we no ready to utilized the small one wey we dey received at the main time. Yes na true say we go enjoy oo but it should when needed or when called for, man shall not live by Bread alone.",

People mind dey very unpredictable just because you help people no mean say dem owe you back help, the only way to plan your retirement na to make investment and this investment no be human resources like children, relative or others but business wey be say when you old, even though you no dey present the business fit run e self and dey deliver profits for you. Many of our parents no plan their retirement days and dat's why we have people that are meant to be relax and enjoying life still hustling in their old age. No be say dem no been dey ball when dem dey young or received better salary but dem no plan well for when dem no go fit work again that's why we have to be different, dis our generation need to have investment plans in multiple businesses so we no go get all our eggs for one basket.QuoteJust as the fear of poverty (diesease) is a motivation to create wealths (health) and more wealth in abundance, so as the thought (fear/conciousness) of old age stage(tirement) should motivate us with an early plan against retirements.Getting a retirement plan dey very easy to do but I no understand why our people no dey do am abi dem too dey live in the moment and no dey think about tomorrow. You fit dey invest 10% of your salary into any better investment way you know say legit like Bitcoin and you use am as your retirement plan. Make I say you dey receive 100k monthly salary and you invest 10% monthly wey be 10k, for one year na 120k you dun invest so and if you do am for 10 yes that's 1.2 million wey you dun invest be that, make we forget about the gains first but only reason the investment capital wey dey guarantee to come out from our investment and make we say we dey approximately 30 years when we get work and we work for 30 years that's 3.6 million investment. Even though the business no dey profitable and you only get your capital out, you can use that to do another new business investment and live comfortably without depending on anybody.

This is the first problem, most people don't ever think of what they would do after retirement until they collect that retirement letter then issue of investment or building a house will then come and most of them sometimes opt for building a house because they know that the luxurious apartments they are staying they can't afford it after retirement and so they quickly build a house and then start struggling to feed themselves and family while others after retirement because of greed or the fact that they don't have anything to fall back once they retire and their retirement is already closed by will be looking for high ROI and then invest in a scam project while others get wrong investment ideas and plans.¬†Another way to sure of getting something from their children and those they are taking care of is also trying to get a good job opportunity for them because we all know how job hunting in Nigeria is and I guess this is the reason most parents do decide careers for their children.Most people don't have long term plans for themselves, they just continue to live everyday as it comes by while others have short term plans. Aside all these there are still reasons to invest early because sometimes people lose their jobs one way or the other which may not be their fault and the next step for them will either be getting another job or starting their own business (this one may be tasking if they don't have capital while the other is that they may start hunting for job which may take years before getting a good one).In the end the best is to plan early so that getting something to fall back on after retirement, if one might not get old their children and family may have something to fall back on since we have heard of stories are some families final struggles Started after the death of their breadwinner. Investing in bitcoin won't be a bad idea either like Hal Finney did for his children",

Damn.When we talk about retirement, it means when we quit cuz age don dey and no strength to keep UPs again. No be say na when we don Carry money load keep to dey enjoy oh but it call for planning of how to live the rest of ur life at the tirement stage(old age)So my ask ....If tirement (old age) com, how u want take manage ur life? Cuz by then u go lost your aid youthful means of survival ü§î.Some of my friends go say, ‚Äúlife no suppose hard‚Äù lol‚Ä¶ no worry, person way go laugh this talk go dey‚Ä¶Meanwhile, it takes planning to enjoy this life.

Dey concious, take responsibility & advantage 4rm ur youthful stages to¬† plan ur old age so that e go easy for u cuz if u no fit do am at ur youth, u no fit do am at ur old age.Carry am 4 mind say u need help others to fit get help when in need cus as wen u grows old, u must need helps if not financial help but Errands and some health caressings.This na why we need to invest on people and plans towards our tirement (old are).No go dey help help people dey think say you dey plan your old age or use dem as your retirement insurance. People mind dey very unpredictable just because you help people no mean say dem owe you back help, the only way to plan your retirement na to make investment and this investment no be human resources like children, relative or others but business wey be say when you old, even though you no dey present the business fit run e self and dey deliver profits for you. Many of our parents no plan their retirement days and dat's why we have people that are meant to be relax and enjoying life still hustling in their old age. No be say dem no been dey ball when dem dey young or received better salary but dem no plan well for when dem no go fit work again that's why we have to be different, dis our generation need to have investment plans in multiple businesses so we no go get all our eggs for one basket.QuoteJust as the fear of poverty (diesease) is a motivation to create wealths (health) and more wealth in abundance, so as the thought (fear/conciousness) of old age stage(tirement) should motivate us with an early plan against retirements.Getting a retirement plan dey very easy to do but I no understand why our people no dey do am abi dem too dey live in the moment and no dey think about tomorrow. You fit dey invest 10% of your salary into any better investment way you know say legit like Bitcoin and you use am as your retirement plan. Make I say you dey receive 100k monthly salary and you invest 10% monthly wey be 10k, for one year na 120k you dun invest so and if you do am for 10 yes that's 1.2 million wey you dun invest be that, make we forget about the gains first but only reason the investment capital wey dey guarantee to come out from our investment and make we say we dey approximately 30 years when we get work and we work for 30 years that's 3.6 million investment. Even though the business no dey profitable and you only get your capital out, you can use that to do another new business investment and live comfortably without depending on anybody. Make we dey learn to invest and we'll be independent in our old ages. Very true Boss.diversification of investment dey very necessary especially on a flexible sector of investment such as BTC and real estate investment way no require skills and man power for management and marketing skills so at your retirement u fit still dey financial independence. I also look at some retired persons and even on their old ages them still dey cater for their responsibility financial challenges then u go hear the papa dey say... My son CryptopreneurBrainboss, u know say I no dey do much with money again, take this #100K support ur business, Charles Tim, u no get job, take this #200K start somewhere. I want renovate the house, I want buy 1 kabu-kabuka car way go dey carry me up and down cuz I no too fit for Waka about.I think him dey execute all these on the course of him running investment. Super. üí™ na that type them dey say retired but never tire.",
