Let me rephrase and add infos, I wrote it not clear enough:I run S17 on stock firmware mining to Braiins pool. For some reason, all the S17 models, but not the S17e, stopped hashing and show 0 hash. All work shows as \"discarded\" in the miner status. The kernel log is fine. I will attach it below. The miner stopped hashing some days ago. Every other model I own works fine. I tried reflashing the firmware and also tried different stratum servers.Some other ppl I talked to had the same problem. Other pools seem to work.Code:Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0Linux version 4.6.0-xilinx-gff8137b-dirty (lzq@armdev2) (gcc version 4.8.3 20140320 (prerelease) (Sourcery CodeBench Lite 2014.05-23) ) #25 SMP PREEMPT Fri Nov 23 15:30:52 CST 2018CPU: ARMv7 Processor [413fc090] revision 0 (ARMv7), cr=18c5387dCPU: PIPT / VIPT nonaliasing data cache, VIPT aliasing instruction cacheMachine model: Xilinx Zynqcma: Reserved 16 MiB at 0x0e000000Memory policy: Data cache writeallocOn node 0 totalpages: 61440free_area_init_node: node 0, pgdat c0b39280, node_mem_map cde10000  Normal zone: 480 pages used for memmap  Normal zone: 0 pages reserved  Normal zone: 61440 pages, LIFO batch:15percpu: Embedded 12 pages/cpu @cddf1000 s19776 r8192 d21184 u49152pcpu-alloc: s19776 r8192 d21184 u49152 alloc=12*4096pcpu-alloc: [0] 0 [0] 1 Built 1 zonelists in Zone order, mobility grouping on.  Total pages: 60960Kernel command line: mem=240M console=ttyPS0,115200 ramdisk_size=33554432 root=/dev/ram rw earlyprintkPID hash table entries: 1024 (order: 0, 4096 bytes)Dentry cache hash table entries: 32768 (order: 5, 131072 bytes)Inode-cache hash table entries: 16384 (order: 4, 65536 bytes)Memory: 203608K/245760K available (6345K kernel code, 231K rwdata, 1896K rodata, 1024K init, 223K bss, 25768K reserved, 16384K cma-reserved, 0K highmem)Virtual kernel memory layout:    vector  : 0xffff0000 - 0xffff1000   (   4 kB)    fixmap  : 0xffc00000 - 0xfff00000   (3072 kB)    vmalloc : 0xcf800000 - 0xff800000   ( 768 MB)    lowmem  : 0xc0000000 - 0xcf000000   ( 240 MB)    pkmap   : 0xbfe00000 - 0xc0000000   (   2 MB)    modules : 0xbf000000 - 0xbfe00000   (  14 MB)      .text : 0xc0008000 - 0xc090c424   (9234 kB)      .init : 0xc0a00000 - 0xc0b00000   (1024 kB)      .data : 0xc0b00000 - 0xc0b39fe0   ( 232 kB)       .bss : 0xc0b39fe0 - 0xc0b71c28   ( 224 kB)Preemptible hierarchical RCU implementation.

I want to sell them with stock FW, most recent versions.1) On the site, S19 and S17 miners mine to Braiins.2) S17 pro models stopped all together one day while all others worked.3) S17e and S17+ stopped working, S19 still hashing well.4) All S17 models drew power and the share cound went up, but they produced 0 hash because all shares were discarded.5) Tried reboot and reset and reflash withot success.6) Tried different servers and braiins /slushpool adresses without success.7) Checked the network, changed DNS, tried a mobile router. No success. Braiins OS worked on Braiins, also with the V1 stratum servers.9) Tried different pools, stopped at Luxor because there the stock FW runs fine.I have no idea what the problem is.",
