      "body": "Here the gambling site should correct themselves than just stopping the withdrawal of the users who were able to claim bonus/faucets. This is wrong and it shouldn't be done. It is very rare to see similar incidents taking place with Casinos. These kind of errors mostly happen with Exchanges.When a casino stops the withdrawal of an user, it should have the proper reason. These days the power of centralized system can be seen on gambling sites when a person experience big wins in a series and goes for withdrawal.",

This means that if a casino believes a player is abusing their platform, they reserve the right to block or suspend any accounts. These clauses are often vague, so it's hard to know exactly what constitutes as \"fair use\", but faucet and bonus farming are two forms of abuse that are fairly common and clearly against the rules. While there's nothing wrong with playing the casino games for free, some people will go to great lengths to get as much money out of it as possible. This can include setting up multiple accounts and using them simultaneously, or opening new accounts every time they're blocked so that they can continue farming without having to wait for a cooldown period. Casinos are aware of these tactics, so they often employ algorithms that detect suspicious activity and suspend or ban players who abuse their platform. So it's important to know what qualifies as fair use before you start using a casino's services.",

I've seen cases where users create different accounts so they could abuse the faucet. They cry or complain about it when they get caught by the casino's anti-fraud system.",

Just like in landbase casino's, you might be smarter in the beginning, but as soon as the casino's notice something is odd, then for sure you will be flag by the pitboss.So it goes down as to the question of morality, it is wrong to take advantage of casinos?Maybe the answer depends on the individual itself, whether to continue abusing until they are caught or report the bugs to the casino.",

You wanted a solution to people abusing a casino? The solution can also be found on the terms of services. I am sure it clearly states that if they farm or abuse the faucet their accounts will get blocked or the funds confiscated. So blocking is the solution for the casino. And yes, the user is in fault for not reading the terms and then breaking the terms. Just because they are allowed to claim \"tons of faucet\" doesn't mean they are allowed to break the rules. Don't like their rules, go play in another casino. The bonus and faucet rewards are mainly for rewarding regular players, not farmers.",

I don't think that your activities on Betfury count as bonus farming or abusing the Betfury system. You are simply using the casino faucet, which isn't against the rules. If you had 100 Betfury accounts and you were using them simultaneously, this would have been recognized as a violation of the Terms of Service of Betfury.Bonus farming is Ok, if the gamblers are using multiple different online casinos and their bonus offers. Trying to exploit the bonus system of one casino is definitely a violation of the Terms of Service and the user must be banned.",
