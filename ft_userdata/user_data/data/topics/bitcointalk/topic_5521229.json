Although, I feel his kids and grandkids may blame him for them missing generational wealth that is if they are not already wealth. The world is never going to forget it and at every instance, they will bring it up.I like what how the website is designed but I'm sorry, can you explain to me what it means - like, what does 300 pizza, 3,700sats/pizza, $3.56 mean in each of the cards? Thank you.",

Sorry maybe you can remind me how the hr (Laszlo) offended us over the sold of 10,000 Bitcoin for 3 pizza's because I can not remember him rendering the house and apology and can't also remember the house tell him \"Okay, we have forgiven you\" üòÅThe dude has already created a legendary event and that is why the Bitcoin community in a global range could mark an event of \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\" on his behalf.That his action has single handedly brought about the encouragement to hold our Bitcoin patiently and while on a long run we would be opportuned to increase it value.It has also created about valuability of Bitcoin regarding it is the first¬† commerical transaction being documented using Bitcoin for payment.So¬† let us not see move to be a lost. Perhaps... It has optimized the Bitcoin community with remarkable event day that Will not be forgotten but celebrated.I don't believe Laszlo will be up to date without holding Bitcoin after the incident because he was a great Bitcoin miner who had accumulated huge amount of Bitcoin within the range of 70K Bitcoin.So the 10,000 Bitcoin for Pizza payment could be less to his holdings.He has also been one of a miner who has been up steady in experimenting to reveal the potential utilizations of Bitcoin.He is indeed a legend with his performances in the Bitcoin industry which his children and future generation would even earn the honour of what Laszlo has earlier printed in the world of crypto.So let us let him breath üòÅEmm... Less before I opt out of this post, I want to remind us that he did not lost the 10,000 Bitcoin atleast he earned it free on mining and was able to exchange it some worth eatable. OMG üò≥.Atleast compare the value of Bitcoin then. Moreover, if we live by reminding this event as a lapses, or mockery, then every holders who has sold their Bitcoins in whatever profit amounts in the past would live to regret it because Bitcoin has so long been breaking into new price increases and of course increases on market values. So therefore, it is of no shame to sell as much we don't sell at lost.",

We need to think about the future and the present, and not all this.Come on mate let's have a moment of silence for someone who spent literally billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in today's value on a single purchase and for pizza at that. Well let's just say he's one big bitcoin supporter. Anyways if you read through Laszlo's profile you will find out that the popular 10k BTC purchase wasn't the only pizza purchase he made with bitcoins back then. From data I found when I read about it he actually spent around 50k BTC.Laszlo's purchase is like the highest amount of bitcoin spent on a single item although microstrategy Hodls the record of making the highest bitcoin purchase ever made 55k bitcoins. If you explore Laszlo's address you would find it mind blowing in today's value.",

We need to think about the future and the present, and not all this.I don't feel bad when we talk about the past, especially the story of buying two pizzas for 10kBTC because without those transactions, there would be no people who had to sacrifice in the early days of bitcoin. We wouldn't have it today, so we should be grateful and have deep affection for them. But I will be annoyed with anyone who brings this story up again and starts mocking early investors for selling bitcoin cheaply. What guarantee is there that if we were in Laszlo's or any other early investor's shoes at that time, we wouldn't have sold our bitcoins? I bet those who are laughing at the early investors would have done the same if they knew about bitcoin at the time, or they would be the ones being laughed at in the future.",

It is impossible to underestimate the significance of buying these 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC, because it was the first trade and monetary transaction for bitcoin with the purchase of something physically tangible. On that day, bitcoin was used exactly as its creator intended: as a means of payment.Isn't that why you created this topic, to advertise the 1st link? I had my suspicions about this.",
