Like this time, if anyone says bitcoin is a risky asset, I will say it is wrong, because the price is still low, we should look forward to bitcoin getting to all-time-high now because the price can not be less than $15000 again is my guess. Quote from: Ratimov on February 10, 2023, 10:40:40 PMThe question arises, will Bitcoin be able to show x2 in the next bullish cycle, or will growth continue to slow down?All I believe is that bitcoin can get to all-time-high. That is more than x2.",

I think it will be more than that, minimum for me will be like 2.5x growth. Others may pegged it higher, and so with my prediction, it's just a conservative estimates.Obviously it will slow down sooner or later or as we go to the next phase and the next.But there will be obvious growth right after the halving.",

I still expect us to be receiving regulators attacks left and right that would hinder that growth; so while it’s definitely very possible, it might take longer than usual.",

Next cycle, we need to take 67k as our new starting point. Next cycle, we'll could see increases of 2.0-2.5x, which would be around 125k to 150k. And it would be a 5x - 7x from where we are now.  Finally, we should also consider: last ATH (2021) we didn't have any halving but now, in 2024, we'll have one, resulting in a possibly more bullish environment.",

You are absolutely right that historical trends and upcoming halving event suggest that Bitcoin could potentially reach 125K in the next bull run, however it is also important to note that the price of Bitcoin is also impacted by macro-economic factors and market conditions, as we have seen strong correlation between stocks and Bitcoin markets during the recent years.It is certainly possible for Bitcoin to hit 125K or even more in the next bull cycle, if fear of recession subsides, and there is fall in inflation, a pause in interest rate increase, and an increase in GDP, these factors could potentially support an upward trend in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Personally, not a fan of taking averages of 1 year bear markets and those of only a few months. I'd prefer to seperate these two types of cyclical and mid-cycle bear markets. For example the mid-cycle corrections have been 68%, 61%, maybe even 51%. The cyclical bear markets have been -83% and -84% (according to such data).So the target for current bear market is around $12K. But it seems like this hasn't occured within the usual time-frame of 12-14 months.I otherwise find the 2x increase per average purely subjective based on starting price... so not going to comment on that  \\",

For example, rising inflation and unemployment don't contribute to an increase in purchases. When people have extra money, they can invest in btc, but when their economic situation is very unstable, people simply may not have free money. Without money and their investments, as you know, bitcoin will not rise in price. Remember the times of the pandemic, when a lot of unsecured money was poured into the global economy and where this money went from people's pockets.

I think we will never see x100 or even x10 again - it was possible at first, when the price was very low. x2 is quite possible if all factors converge, but I think that growth will slow down. Actually, it's logical. This is how much money is needed to make x10 from 25k or x10 from 10k.",

Anyhow, the 2021 growth was 130%, and the one right now is just 54% based on those numbers so a bit of a difference, not that it matters that much.Quote from: 1miau on February 17, 2023, 01:36:30 AMI beleive it's best for us to have a look at the big picture: From 12/2013 to 12/2017, Bitcoin increased around 16x (from 1.2k to 19.5k)From 12/2017 to Summer 2021, Bitcoin increased around 3.5x (from 19.5k to 67k).

And it would be a 5x - 7x from where we are now.  That's one thing I don't like about extrapolation on percentages,  which is such a small sample those can go any way possible, a decrease in growth from 16x to 3.5x can be easily seen as another ~80% fall growth rate and that would lead automatically to just a 0.8, and with this making the next one almost flat. But if you look from a raw number point of view, the growth is actually increasing since the last one was 48k and the previous 18k. Of course, this is a flawed model too since it would lead to unlimited and expanding growth, with over 200$ and over 600k in the next runs.",

This is also the reason on why there are new coins that has been released because there are also people who are looking for the next Bitcoin in terms of ROI. Times 2 for BTC is very possible even if other positive factors are not seen yet.There are just times where the growth speed is slow especially if we are on a time like this. We are still in the bear market. You didn't state if you much money needed before the price can rise up to 10x but I think this one can still be calculated easily for those who are good in maths .",

Of course, I would like bitcoin to grow more and more, making us all happy, but let's be realistic. Bitcoin slows down its growth over time and the number of Xs, in relation to the past ATH, is constantly decreasing. Bitcoin, with each new cycle, needs more and more fuel in the form of liquidity, it needs to attract more and more investments and cash flows. Therefore, I would count on at least 90-100k, not to mention 150k.I think that will be the bare minimum, $100k in the next bull run. But for sure, everyone is going to be happy seeing around $120k-$180k. And I do agree that it could be around in the range of 2.0ish again for new all time high.There is no formula, this is all speculation base on the past numbers that we are getting.Bitcoin market is fairly young though, so those numbers will really fluctuate as well as the data set is too small. Nevertheless, a good 6 digits 2024/2025 bull run is not that bad.",
