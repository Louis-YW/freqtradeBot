Better not to buy altcoins for now because a small drop in bitcoin price would be a huge blow for altcoins. I mean altcoins will fall massively if bear market continues. But if you want to invest in altcoin, these are few good ones:shiba inudogeneoSolanadot",

I put money in bitcoin and ethereum which I think is pretty good because in the past it was strong enough to take on market extremes. I know those two coins are quite expensive, but I try to buy them gradually, collecting them slowly until waiting for the bull run market to arrive.",

I know its too impossible, but that's fine because I'm willing to wait.  We're on the same page. I bought it worth $100 and hoped that there would be a massive uptrend later or tomorrow after the end of the snapshot. The best thing to do now is to wait for the market and for sure that more people will buy into LUNA and UST for the post-attack snapshot rewards. And, the good thing is that we have invested what we afford to lose since more than $100 is too risky, and we just need to make a stop-loss of 10% of the current price of LUNA.",

But I still have a few remaining and would be good for hold for years before I sell.Aside from it, I have BNB, gala, axs, and slp. Well, the latter is just from my holdings because should I sell them right now, I'm in losses so there's no need to sell it at losses. What's good for me is to hold them together with those investments that I'm holding in alts. And the most important, with those alts that I have is owning btc.",

There is valid reason behind it, many alts are based on PoS and it would be shocking to believe if they become very successful and sustainable in the long term. These projects always fail due to poor liquidity of the investment. For me, I’m mining RVN coin with my two rig set up. I believe in that coin a lot because of its algorithm and economical emission. I get double security of long term funding and teams good too.",

Of course it won't be much just a little bit and I'm willing to accept losing it. Many people choose luna because recently team will make luna 2.0 but I like Shiba more than Luna and I think Shi is safer than Luna right now.",

I probably bought my last altcoin 3years back and stopped dealing in them for now. This is because altcoins are never good for the long time value, bitcoin is.Getting profit is not a joke and neither a hit-and-trial. Those coins which have done well in the past will continue to do that as long as their vision is clear. Bitcoin has this but most projects employing altcoins are lacking it.New coin does not equal to huge profits. Hype does run a lot, but it is risky and ends up becoming a gamble.",
