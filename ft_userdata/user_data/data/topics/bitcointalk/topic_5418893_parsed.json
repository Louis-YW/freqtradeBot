  "content": "I'm to the point that I'm consistently profitable, now trying to optimize strategies and allocate risk appropriately between different strategies. I'm familiar with basic risk reward ratios. What I'm trying to do is incorporate average deal frequency and duration into my risk management. Let's say I do 180 day backtest on two strategies. Once fees are figured in, they both produce the exact same profit over the period. But one does it in two deals, the other does it in 20. It seems obvious to me that the one that did it in 20 is less risky, because it's more consistently predictable. Similarly, let's say two strategies both have 20 deals, but one has average deal duration of 2 hours, the other 2 days. Again it seems obvious that the one with average deal time of 2 hours is better, all other things being equal. There less time for things to go wrong. But the question is how much to factor that into expected value / risk-weighted return. How much higher return does the 2-deal strategy need to make to be \"equal\" to the 20-deal strategy?Is there any standard way for incorporating these into risk assessment? I've looked but haven't found anything. Or what ideas do you have about factoring these variables in your risk assessment?",

I'd say if the market sentiment is generally predictable over the next few months or so, maybe the 2 days/2 deal strategy is better. But as always, don't put your egg in one basket. Maybe run both strategies with more allocation on the short-term period for consistent profit, while the long-term period for high risk and high return position (not assuming leverage).",

I always forward test the top few strategies from the backtesting, but yeah, a weighted split test live is a good idea for balancing risk.And yes, I figured out quickly how essential it is to include fees in the backtesting calculations. Of course, that's another reason to favor the higher frequency strategy: it increases your monthly volume and may help you move to a lower fee tier. Currently my monthly trading volume is about 20x my average daily balance, which takes 0.06% off both maker and taker fees.",

After running a few tests, you have those parameters to factor in and change according to your needs and then look at a result or response. That way, you would know the best factor in all the elements you have tested that have the most impact on your experiment. That's a great way to check if it's effective or not.",

You don't really need backtesting that much, only you are sure with the times you have backtested then you move forward and concentrate on the forward rather than backwards. Are you saying that the past repeat itself all the time? The past only confirm to you your indicators efficiency on the way it moves with the market moving forward. Understand more with your indicators on how they are behaving in the forward market speculations.",

But how long do you run forward testing? And most importantly, what do you do in the meantime? Really, forward testing is just more out-of-sample data. At the end of your forward testing, it's just backtesting, and no better at actually predicting the future from there forward than the backtesting.The two essential things I found in backtesting are:1. Test the strategy against out-of-sample data, not just 30/90/180/365 back from today. How did the strategy do from November 2021 through June 2022? How did it do against the market (what's the alpha) from mid-June through mid-August? (BTW, my live strategy did over 60% during that 60-day window, vs. BTC, which went up 29% during that same time period).2. Don't over-optimize. If you find, for example, that a 9% stop loss is your optimum profitability, but an 8% or 10% stop loss actually puts you at a loss, then that's a bad strategy. Instead, find a range of stop losses that still keep you in profit, and put it in the middle of that range. True example.QuoteAnd if I may ask, how long have you been trading?About a year, but I have a background in statistics, finance, and modeling. And I'm obsessive about both learning and experimenting. I've been consistently beating the market since the start (not counting a few failed experiments with live data, which I've also learned not to do).I really do appreciate you sharing your experience, and maybe some day it will ring in my head, \"You know, that guy was right.\" At this point, I'm certainly not ignoring it—just taking it with a grain of salt.Let me ask you this: you say do forward testing.

People who are constantly getting ready for the bad situation could not hold too much investment, they would be scared to hold bitcoin or any other coin for that matter.There's a difference between preparing for the bad situations and expecting them. Having smoke alarms and a fire extinguisher in your house is preparing for the bad situation.Good risk management is a must. That's why most traders fail—going all in on something without good risk management, then being unwilling to cut their losses.And good risk management doesn't mean you miss something good. I caught the DOGE run last week. About 30% on one bot, 40% on another, and one that hasn't exited yet. Now, that's not the 100% that someone could've made perfectly timing an entry and exit, and I only have about 4% of my portfolio in DOGE. But the point is, it all happened automatically. I wasn't watching the news closely and even then, I didn't make the connection that the finalization of the Twitter deal was going to make DOGE surge. I literally did nothing, other than decide to include DOGE in my portfolio a couple of months ago, when I decided it had finally moved out of the realm of $#!+coin.Risk management isn't fear.If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.",

But the setback still remains that the strategy you use will deceive you as you reference the past records of the market. These past records often fail, and as you are still making success with them now, I think you should continue so that you will realize what I warn you about later by yourself.Also, from what I read from you, it seems you don't understand what forwardtesting is, it is merely trading through a demo or live account. It is just by trading an actual market reality. You might do this for 3-6 months to be fully sure of the capacity of your trading system.
