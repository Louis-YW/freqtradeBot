  "content": "Today marks a tremendous day for user data security and the DeFi industry as a whole.Anonymous KYC is Finally here.Welcome Hashbon PassHashbon Pass or NFT passport by Hashbon FiRe is the decentralized protocol for reusable identity verification on blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and other EVM-compatible networks. It challenges user-identification norms by favoring the client’s data-security over the industry’s desire to acquire as much data as possible. It does so by facilitating KYC without the transfer of any user personal information.Reshaping the Identity Verification IndustryIt is astonishing how far we’ve come with regards to many aspects within the IT industry, while KYC remains as unreasonably difficult as it always was. With the help of our protocol, passing KYC turns from a tedious and exhausting process to a single click.Hashbon Pass strives to achieve two main goals: simplify the user's interaction with the constantly-evolving DeFi space, and preserve the core values of the industry in the face of looming government interference and regulation.  In plain words, we set out to make the impossible possible, creating the anonymous KYC/AML protocol.  Hashbon Pass (which is a Tokenized All Web3 Pass - TAWP - protocol) achieves these goals with the usage of the underlying utility of NFTs.Quote“We will bring one key to many locked doors in DeFi both for users and services. With the help of our NFT Passport, users will be able to use a huge number of services without the transfer of any personal information. It's time for real anonymity without additional risks of personal data leaks. Our new product will allow you to plunge into the new world of Web 3.0, feeling absolutely protected,” – comments Grigory Bibaev, CEO & Founder of Hashbon.Why DeFi Needs Hashbon PassWith regulation enforcing AML procedures, KYC is slowly becoming a prerequisite for usage of services. This can exponentially increase the risk of exposure to a data leak.The largest leaks in 20 years led to the loss of 13.2 billion records containing user personal data, and these only include confirmed cases that were covered by the press. By 2025, this figure could reach 17 billion.We’ve implemented features making Hashbon Pass a must-have for users as well as businesses (B2B & B2C), with potential to change the world of user identification as we know it. A few of which are:Easy integration with all popular protocols & supported by all wallets allowing for NFT storage User data security                - No more careless transfers of your data               - Personal data stored only by licensed verifiers               - Full GDPR compliance Ultimate convenience                - Pass CAPTCHA & age verification with 1 click               - Pass 1 KYC, access all popular protocols Privacy-oriented compliance with AML/KYC                 - Determine the user’s age, citizenship, credit score, social rating, & their absence                  on blacklists & sanctions lists without requesting their documents. One Solution For AllHashbon Pass presents a clear solution for 3 groups of people:Users who are tired of the malicious user-data industry, looking for convenience and security Services looking for secure & seamless user verificationVerifiers looking to join Hashbon’s initiative in bringing new standards to the counterintuitive verification procedureYour Data, Your Choice.With Hashbon Pass, your basic information is recorded on the blockchain – nickname, citizenship and date of birth. Scanned documents and personal data are stored only by licensed verifiers and remain inaccessible by third parties.However, we understand that our solution may seem radical to many services, as there is an entire industry revolving around the sale and transfer of user data. This means that some services may not grant users full access to services without receiving your data. That is why our protocol has 2 modes of operation, anonymous & non-anonymous. You can remain anonymous when accessing services while still maintaining the option to share your information with entities you deem trustworthy. At the end of the day, you’re in control of your data, and you get to choose who can and cannot view your personal information.Find Your Perfect MatchHashbon Pass is centered around providing you with the ultimate experience. With features such as verifier rating, SSI, and mandatory requirements for verifiers, our NFT passport ensures the safety of your data while providing you with ultimate convenience.For the sake of creating a mutually beneficial interaction between the user and the verifier, we have created a special evaluation system that is constantly displayed online.This system determines the rating of each verifier and assigns it a confidence coefficient. Users tend to trust verifiers who do their job the best, which is why it’s important for the verifier to gain the user’s trust and thereby increase their profit through commissions.

We don't ask for any details from the user, they just fill up a nickname when creating the passport. Once they've created one, they will they'll have to submit their documents for verification.

Additionally, the IT industry has become quite malicious with regards to user data distribution.

What are you looking at here in the next 6 months to come?That is correct. Your personal documents are stored only by licensed verifiers. In order to ensure the safety of our potential users, we believe keeping this information hidden from the public eye would help in not putting a bullseye on the provider we've chosen. We have, however, chosen a provider that works in different regions, including the EU, middle east, the US, and more. This ensures that our passport can be widely supported right out of the box. At a later date, we'll be announcing our list of providers.The partner service provider knows that you are verified because our NFT Passport informs them that you're verified. If you have a Hashbon Pass, you can visit the service provider, authenticate yourself with your NFT passport, then start using their service without having to submit any documents (unlike using these services without our passport, which would require you to pass KYC). This would apply to CAPTCHAs, 18+ verification, ect.We're glad to see that you see promise in our project, we see great potential too! We understand that our account isn't incredibly well-ranked, as we use it primarily for announcements. This may mean that our bumping power is relatively meaningless. Hopefully the post will gain some traction. We're here to answer any potential questions and spread the word As for our plans for the next 6 months, you may refer to page 34 of our White Paper. There you may find our roadmap detailing our plans for the foreseeable future.Our product would fit right in with the DeFi market, since DeFi project have had to complete KYC procedures on their clients, which contradicts the idea of DeFi. However, they may have to do so in order to get listed on centralized exchanges such as Binance. Our NFT passport would facilitate KYC procedures for their users, all without the concerns related to giving a third-party your personal information.Having a dedicated DeFi thread would be great, sadly however, bitcointalk doesn't have a dedicated section for DeFi, meaning that we don't have an easily accessible thread for our announcement. Unless you mean having the tags [ANN][DeFi] instead. That can be arranged easily",

Allow one hacked or one busted project, u will behold a dozen others. Allowance means endorsement. Time to put things in check.It makes sense that your trust would be dissolved by this point. Our trust certainly has been exhausted, which in turn, inspired the creation of Hashbon Pass. Over the past few years, services have started implementing mandatory KYC procedures, however, many of these services aren't licensed to deal with user data. In an ideal world, these services would have rules to adhere to. Unfortunately, the world of user data is only becoming more malicious as time passes. It's almost like a wild west. Our goal is to minimize the transfer of data and their sale by limiting who has access to your information. By making it so only licensed verifiers have access to your personal information, it's fair to say that this will mitigate user data distribution. Keep in mind that these licensed verifiers cannot share your data with law enforcement agencies without a court ordered subpoena, meaning that your data is safe in other cases.Additionally, these verifiers have to comply with GDPR, which means that you always maintain the right to be forgotten, resulting in permanent deletion of your data upon your official request. If your data is being handled by authorized & licensed parties, you will remain in control.",

Anonymous KYC means that the service you're trying to use will not have access to your personal data. For example, I have a verified NFT passport. I visit website A which requires KYC verification before I'm granted full access, so instead of providing them with my documents that they would then verify, I can provide my own Hashbon Pass, which would tell the service that I have been verified, giving them access to simple information like my age, citizenship & nickname, as well as access to information regarding my presence on blacklists and sanctions lists if I were to be on any. This lets them grant me full access to their service, assuming that I meet their usage requirements, all without having to process and receive my personal documents.

Since they're licensed, they're qualified to work with user data. These verifiers accept a wide range of ID documents, including a driver's license, Passport, or a personal identification card. In addition, our NFT passport can run in a non-anonymous mode, which allows you to use it as a personal document for verification. This mode will transfer your data in case the service provider is adamant on receiving personal data before granting you full access to the service. SSI allows you to decide when you'd like to surf the web anonymously and when you'd like to share your data. Who you grant access to your data is ultimately your choice.",

      "body": "Quote from: ADAM Alams on June 14, 2022, 08:28:44 PMIs there any charge to use your service?There is a fixed one-time fee when creating the passport. This fee depends on 2 factors: 1- How much the verifier charges for user verification; 2- The user's document validity period. This fee is designed to reward verifiers for completing KYC verification as well as reward miners. Once the passport has been created, there will be no more payments until you need to create a new passport once yours has expired. When you have your own Hashbon Pass, your registration process and every future KYC verification turn into a single click.",

I am curious, what details are you gonna ask from users?How it is anonymous KYC? Can you elaborate more on this?If there will be no transfer of personal information, how are you going to get the details of the users?And from the list of your partners, what kind of collaboration do you have on them? We don't ask for any details from the user, they just fill up a nickname when creating the passport. Once they've created one, they will they'll have to submit their documents for verification. Once the user is verified, the passport then is marked \"verified\". Since the submitted document has been verified by licensed verifiers, the \"verified\" status on their end is sufficient for partner service providers. This means that you can start using their service without having to provide them with your documents, even if they require you to pass KYC.This, as a result, dramatically reduces the distribution of your data, meaning that if a certain database of a service you've used becomes compromised, your data will not be at risk. Additionally, the IT industry has become quite malicious with regards to user data distribution. This allows the user to be in control of their own data, with their authorization being the decision-maker on who can and cannot be granted access to their data.You may refer to page 15 of our White Paper to learn more about Hashbon Pass' Description of the biometric verification process, which provides a description of the Hashbon Pass protocol algorithm.If you'd like to read up on what data is stored on the blockchain & by verifiers, you may refer to page 18, \"How the Hashbon PassProtocol works\".As for your question regarding partners, we were able to increase our reach as well as integrate additional features further expanding on our utility:Our ONTO partnership brought ONTO wallet support to the Hashbon Rocket dApp, as well as 4000 USD in rewards for our combined communities.Our Polygon partnership brought support for their blockchain, allowing users to complete transactions using Polygon HASH Token with minimal transaction fees, saving our users a lot in fees.UniFarm's partnership brought staking to our clients with incredibly attractive APYs prior to the release of our native staking & farming. All of our decisions regarding partnerships take into consideration our community of HASHtronauts.What kind of documents do you accept?",
