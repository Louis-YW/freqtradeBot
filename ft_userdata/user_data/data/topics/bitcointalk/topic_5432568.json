I express my gratitude in this thread. Thanks!",

This is a Bitcoin forum and it is normal that we put the perspective on it, on an economic/financial component of life and the best element created to store and transfer wealth, but first you have to have good health and a good relational environment. Best wishes to you, yahoo62278, that all goes well and you have a fresh start in 2023. We will be waiting to hear from you and your return to the forum when you are fully recovered.",

I needed to set that target from January 1st so I'm really focused on achieving it, and maybe you need to set it too.

Happy New Year to every bitcointalk user, in sound health and wealth.Maybe 2024 will be fun filled. I had open heart surgery in 2021 and it took at least 6 months to heal up where I could even sleep on my side, let alone go out in public feeling ok. I am assuming this surgery will be 6 months or longer as well. So depending on when the surgery happens, it'll be late 2023-end of 2023 before I'm feeling healed up.",

But the intention of this post was really not to fish for merit; out of sincerity of heart, joy, and excitement for a new year, I made it. I created this post on the 31st and saved it on my draft, saying to myself, \"I will be the first person to wish the forum a happy new year.\" (No hidden intentions.)Woow ðŸ˜¯ðŸ¥´, Â did I Â screwed up this time? .. sir, it's really depressing to find out that my messages angered you, owing to the fact that the year just started and with me pissing off someone like yourself in this forum. If I am not yet on your ignore list, I plead guilty and ask for a second chance.Â My messages may have been centered on selfishness, but that's really not what it is, sir. I just wanted to get your thoughts and advice on my posting style. Back then, in school, if a lecturer reviews a student's work, they apparently give a comment (either good or bad), and that is exactly what I meant when I said review and advice.Â Quote from: yahoo62278 on January 02, 2023, 04:58:25 AM@OP pissing members off that are merit sources isn't really a smart move is it? Why the hurry to get merits?Â People have their intentions for every action they take, but if you ask me, I never intended to piss him off. It's true I have enough merit to be a full member, but being a full member by rank alone and not in knowledge, does it make any sense? My request to him was not to cause a fight; I guess he was right when he said my PM is beyond stupidity, but it is just painful to mean something in a fair approach, but it gets interpreted the other way around.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on January 02, 2023, 05:21:28 AMGreed?Â  Manipulation?Â  Who knows?Â Not any of it sir. QuoteAnd the thing is, I did take a look at his posts and while he certainly puts effort into most of them,a lot of what he writes is disjointed ramblingIt seems like I still got the review, just the way I meant it.
