  "content": "Since Anonymity and Privacy are so much important when you have Bitcoin in your wallet. That is the reason for my creating this topic. If you have or know any other wallet that provides you with the same then please leave your reply. Let's get started.The need for secure and private Bitcoin wallets has become a pressing issue for users. With so many different types of Bitcoin wallets available, it can be difficult to know which one is right for you. Let's explore the top 3 Bitcoin wallets for complete anonymity as per my understanding.Let me first discuss the type of Bitcoin wallet available on the market.There are many different types of Bitcoin wallets, each with its own unique features and benefits. These include online wallets, hardware wallets, and mobile wallets. While these wallets offer convenience and ease of use, they may not always provide the level of anonymity that some users require. In this situation, anonymous Bitcoin wallets are useful.What do we need to look for in a wallet for privacy & anonymity?In order to choose an anonymous Bitcoin wallet, there are several important factors to consider. First and foremost, security features are crucial. Look for wallets that offer private key protection, two-factor authentication, and other security features to protect your privacy and keep your funds secure.Another important factor to consider is offline storage. Many of the most secure and anonymous Bitcoin wallets offer cold storage options, which allow you to store your funds offline for added security. This can be especially important if you are storing large amounts of Bitcoin.In the end, consider choosing a decentralized and non-custodial wallet for greater control over your funds. Decentralized wallets allow you to maintain full control over your private keys, while non-custodial wallets do not require you to trust a third party with your funds.My recommendation of Bitcoin wallets that are best for complete anonymityWasabi Wallet:Wasabi Wallet is a desktop Bitcoin wallet that is designed specifically for complete anonymity. It offers private key protection, coinjoin transactions, and Tor integration for added privacy. Wasabi Wallet also offers cold storage options, which allow you to store your funds offline for added security.PROS-High level of anonymity and privacy.Offers coinjoin transactions for added privacy.Allows offline storage.CONS-Beginners might find it more challenging to use it.Samourai Wallet:Samourai Wallet is a mobile Bitcoin wallet that is designed for complete anonymity. It offers private key protection, stealth mode, and coinjoin transactions for added privacy. Samourai Wallet also allows for offline storage and does not require any personal information to be submitted during the sign-up process.PROS-High level of anonymity and privacy.Offers coinjoin transactions for added privacy.IMO it has a user-friendly interface.CONS-This is one of the smallest issues as it is only available as a mobile app but some users would question the security of mobile devices Electrum Wallet:This is my personal favorite Bitcoin wallet which is available both for desktop and mobile devices. I recommend the desktop Bitcoin wallet as it provides more features, strong security than the mobile app. It offers private key protection, two-factor authentication, and multi-signature transactions for added security. Electrum Wallet also allows for cold storage options, which can be especially useful for storing large amounts of Bitcoin.PROS-High level of anonymity and privacy.IMO it has a user-friendly interface.Very simple interface.CONS-May not offer as high a level of anonymity as other walletsRecapWhen it comes to choosing an anonymous Bitcoin wallet, there are many factors to consider. Look for wallets that offer strong security features, offline storage options, and decentralized control over your funds. Wasabi Wallet, Samourai Wallet, and Electrum Wallet are all excellent choices for those looking for complete anonymity in their Bitcoin transactions. The ideal wallet for you will ultimately depend on your unique requirements and tastes. Consider your priorities and choose the wallet that is right for you.",

You recommended using 2FA for increasing the security and privacy while that's not a good idea.If you want to have 2FA, you have to go for a custodial wallet and due to obvious reasons that you know, we should avoid custodial wallets. You can't have 2FA on Wasabi or Samourai at all. As I said in my previous post only electrum allow you to have 2FA.

However, still you would get anonymity if you are constantly using new receiving/sending addresses generated by Electrum. Transactions cannot be made hidden on the blockchain but they can only be disguised. If you are so concerned then It is better to use Chipmixer which is free as the platform does not charge any fee. For any transaction they would charge the miner fee. If you are not aware on how it works then you should read page 9/30 of this PDF file on - Everything You Ever Wanted to Know AboutBitcoin Mixers (But Were Afraid to Ask). If you want to know which Bitcoin Mixer you should then you should read the below post. 2023 List Bitcoin Mixers Bitcoin Tumblers WebsitesI do not think everything written by the OP is correct. I know a lot could have been discussed in this post as many important points were left out. I would be happy to read this post and then verify the content by visiting those links rather than judging it with a reply. If you are someone who believes on others rather do it all yourself then you might encounter problems in the future.",
