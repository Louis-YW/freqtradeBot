More I do not know after my research, as a pure desktop walletFor any answer, even just links, I am grateful.",

      "body": "Wasabi still offer coinjoins, but they use the blockchain analysis firm Coinfirm to spy on all your inputs and approve whether or not they are allowed to be coinjoined at all. It is the very antithesis of what you want from a privacy wallet, and so Wasabi should be avoided at all costs.Trezor is simply a gateway to Wasabi coinjoins, so they should also be avoided for the same reasons above.For a simple desktop wallet which offers coinjoins, then your best bet would be Sparrow (connected to your own node of course), which utilizes Samourai's Whirlpool.For the best coinjoin implementation, but a more complex set up and use, then go for JoinMarket.",
