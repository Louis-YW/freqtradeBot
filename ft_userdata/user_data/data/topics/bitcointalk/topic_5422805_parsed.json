This depends on how they are currently storing their bitcoin, but $50 for a decent hardware wallet is almost always a good investment.Do they already have a hardware wallet, an airgapped wallet, paper wallets, or some other secure storage solution? Then go ahead and buy more bitcoin.Are they storing their bitcoin on a simple hot software wallet on a computer or mobile phone? Then unless they are only purchasing very small amounts of bitcoin that they can easily afford to lose without a second though, they should probably be buying a hardware wallet.Are they storing their bitcoin on a centralized platform? Then they don't actually own any bitcoin at all. They should definitely buy a hardware wallet instead of giving $50 away in return for some worthless IOUs.",

I know it may be tempting to buy bitcoin now given the current price, but I personally sleep much better after getting one and wouldn't change it for owning a little bit more bitcoin. As a matter of fact, I bought mine after getting hacked ~5 years ago and losing almost all bitcoin I owned up to that point so even though I had like 0.01 BTC left, I bought one nevertheless.",

And some cold wallet companies are running promotions.Right now, in your opinion, it pays off to spend 50~60$ buying a cold wallet or buying BTC?I will be somewhat advocating the other way than the previous posts.Maybe you can spend an hour and learn how to make yourself a cold storage (or maybe paper wallet?) using nothing more than an USB stick that you'll boot your computer from now and then.So you can spend 5-10$ on an USB stick if you don't have one already and you can buy bitcoin for the rest of the money.However, if your technical skills are not good enough for this, then you may already have a nice amount in a hot wallet, and then hardware wallet is a must.So it's really up to you, your skills, how much BTC you already have, ....Of course, it's optimal to buy bitcoin when its price is low and buy hardware wallet when bitcoin price is high, no matter there are promotions now. A not too difficult to achieve doubling of bitcoin price will beat the best promotions you can get for hardware wallets.",

Someone having a hardware wallet could motivate the more regular purchase of BTC. In addition to feeling safer, you also end up wanting to monetize the purchase/investment.Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 23, 2022, 09:48:46 AMOf course, it's optimal to buy bitcoin when its price is low and buy hardware wallet when bitcoin price is high, no matter there are promotions now.

There is no exchange that is safe and secure for saving your crypto assets, just look above your screen on this website, look to the news update theymos has pinned above, online accounts or centralized exchanges are not safe for anyone to save their funds there, you may not lose it today, but you may someday.Binance isn't safe, they have been doing shady stuffs for a long time, just that they are yet to run into trouble, it does not mean they wouldn't, Sam Bankman-Fried was doing shady stuffs with people's money for a long time, but it only took a week for everything to completely collapse and for people, and the exchange too to go bankrupt, and hacked too by the way.Hold your funds in your self custody, trade on decentralized exchanges that is trustless; with binance, even in their p2p service you have to trust binance, in decentralized exchanges like Bisq you do not trust anybody, and you would not lose your data to the exchange.",

In one case, the best solution would be to buy a hardware wallet, in the other - btc.If you have around $1,000 in crypto currencies, then it's worth spending $50-100 on a HW device. This makes sense, as those $50-100 spent will avoid a $1,000 loss. In my opinion, this is a reasonable price for safety and security.If you have 100-200$ in crypto, then I see no reason to buy cold wallet and in this case it is better to spend 50-60$ to buy bitcoin. Both hardware wallets and bitcoin are now discounted.",

Although there are HWs that are close to being cold storage, the most popular ones like Ledger or Trezor are not. In order to make a firmware update or to install a coin app, you have to connect such a device to the Internet, and that completely cancels any connection with the cold wallet.As for that amount, I wouldn't hesitate at all about what I will do, because for $50 you won't be able to buy BTC that will ever mean anything to you - but if you invest that money in HW, it will have a long-term positive effect on the security of your digital property.",

If you don’t have big amounts, and just trading money, then according to me buying a cold wallet isn’t worth. Moreover whenever you aren’t trading the Bitcoins, you can use desktop offline wallets to store your coins. These are way safe than online wallets and exchanges and often come in handy.

That the analyzed perspectives have even been very interesting, which I thank you in advance.About having HW or not, this question is also interesting. This is because I have always been very conservative and kept BTC in my own wallets (Bitcoin Core / Electrum) - always in self custody. On the other hand, I don't have any wealth, so I was never attracted to an HW wallet.",

To me, buying a cold wallet will be my first option, this is a promotional period as you said and the price will not stay low for a long period. Btc on the other hand still have some more months of winter ahead base on the circle, there is a high tendency you can still catch a decent price after spending money on a cold wallet.",
