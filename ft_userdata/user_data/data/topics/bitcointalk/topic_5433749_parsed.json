We will be running an escrow service so this will protect buyers and sellers.Selling fees are set to 5% for the first month, minimum withdrawal is $25 direct to your wallet.  Any advice welcome, we want to start something mainstream which shows the masses that bitcoin can be usedliterally for anything. Thanks guys",

      "body": "Hello bitcoinbayshop, i was taking a look to the About page and found this:QuoteYour Payment Is Safe And SecuredYou’re payments with Bitcoin Bay will always be safe and secure. We use Blockchain.com to hold all funds. I would say is a bad idea to have all the users' funds on a web wallet. There are more secure ways to handle the customers' money, and this can break the trust of a lot of them.This kind of EShops aren't new at all, I mean, you are using wordpres with woocommerce... I have done some of those in the past. But I would like to know what plugin you use or how do you manage the bitcoin payments?",

Thanks guys Out of the above lists by bitcoindust, It depends on your budget, but paid adverts would get you immediately what you need. Working with SEO would consume so much money, and the results won't manifest easily. Get untop with google Adwords and expose the site to both parties, store owners and buyers. Hence, staying in the market for long term should be your concern, as the market changes it could change for the good of bitcoin ecommerce stores, and you won't get left behind. Another strategy which is not on that list is email marketing. It'll be wrong for clients to visit a store with few store owners. With the help of mass email from an expert; getting the attention of store owners could be of help to your growth. Consider scrapping emails on IG or company websites. It's more effective and you'd see more results.",
