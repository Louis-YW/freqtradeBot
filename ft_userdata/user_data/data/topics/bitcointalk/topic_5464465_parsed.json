It's a tactical war initiated by US by inviting Ukraine to join NATO. The sole intention of US was to gain uninterrupted access to Russian border. Ukraine is just a scapegoat. So when BlackRock is planning their investment in Ukraine, the intention is now very clear. If the access cannot be received by war tactics, the next step is to gain access of the financial markets and gain so much dominance where US government can put pressure to have a military base in Ukraine. Well thought out plan by the only warmongers of this century.",

BlackRock has never cared for anyone else apart from making huge profits. These sharks just seem like sheep in daylight, offering to render support to Ukraine in their time of war but if there's something I've come to understand about how the US operate, they aren't magnanimous; there's always a catch.It's bad that Zelensky is gullible enough to not be aware that the US is just using subtle means to enforce their stronghold and just as @Pooya87 rightly stated, they are no good. According to this  news, BlackRock and JP Morgan are supposed to help set up a reconstruction bank aimed at steering public capital into rebuilding projects that could rake in billions of dollars. Wow, such a sweet proposition! But why such a bad idea? His investments has been known to profit from war and conflict.",

America indeed influenced the Russia - Ukraine war and sparked the flame by inviting Ukraine in NATO. While at least some of your examples are correct, I hope that we can agree that Russia has an equally impressive list of wars they've provoked or kept going. Both are very far from being innocent.And on the invasion of Ukraine, no matter what USA or NATO did, it's still Russia that has started it. I mean, come on, how on earth can anybody sane claim they are defending themselves when they are actually attacking their neighbors in the neighbors' own country?! Even more, Russia did the first move in Crimeea, you seem to forget that. Plus, you also seem to forget that Russia has prepared the invasion with an energy war against Europe (halting the supply now and then to affect the prices to feed the pre-war effort and in a hope to blackmail the other countries that they'll cut the gas supply entirely).Quote from: avikz on August 25, 2023, 05:14:52 PMNow with BlackRock's investment it's just more evident. As already said, there are companies that try to make their entry no matter who and when will win the war.But yes, here you do have a point, USA has its habbit of selling both bullets and bandages.

It's not a military effort at all, and as the focus is on restoring and reconstructing, it might well be conditional upon Ukrainian victory and the end of the war.Also, perhaps many people don't understand how bad the situation is. The economic losses from the war are estimated at $230 billion and growing, and this doesn't account for how messy things are with poverty, employment, and other things that were exacerbated by the war.This BlackRock prospect, as many others, are a way to think ahead and ensure that Ukraine doesn't collapse after being drained by the war, and can gradually rebuild to at least resemble its former past, for starters. Such deals do nothing to scare off Russia, to bring the end of the war closer, or, for that matter, even to keep Ukraine's economy afloat right now.",
