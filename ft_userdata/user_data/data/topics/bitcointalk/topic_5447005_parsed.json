  "content": "The Microsoft GitHub have decided to implement AI completely on the platform to communicate with developers and customers. They want to cut cost and save up more money for other projects. Hence, Github will operate as usual without any problems, its available for developers 24hrs. AI will remove lots of people from work looking at the way tech companies choose A.I over engineers and techies. Tech guys and engineers contributed in building AI and it's taking their jobs from them. At first I didn't think of AI taking over the jobs of techies and engineers, I thought content writers would run out of jobs, but it seems AI will affect tech guys more. What do you think? https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/github-microsoft-layoffs-microsofts-github-lays-off-142-india-staffers-all-techies-fired-report-3902373",

Or those who worked in the fields. Let's have a bit of historical perspective:A history of jobs replaced by technology, and the new jobs that it created",

AI solves all these \"problems\" and, as they say, increases efficiency, and those at the top will profit more than before - for them, in any case, it's a win-win situation.After all, how can you compete with something that can do your whole day's work in just a few minutes?",
