If you don't have any idea how to trade better to research first, make it a habit to avoid this kind of incidents.They ask KYC, your personal information, if you dont like the idea, you can use kucoin[2] instead, you can use them and withdraw as long it will not exceed 1 bitcoin.Also, don't leave your crypto in an exchange for very long time. withdraw it to your wallet such as electrum, mycelium, trust wallet for alts, these are non-custodial wallets.Exchange should be used only for trading (spot, future, margin, p2p), avoid their other features if necessary.[1] https://binance.com[2] https://kucoin.com",

Again thanks to all.So you can able to withdraw but only once which is obvious that the scammer is trying to attract you with profit to push yourself again to invest.There is no investment site where you can actually earn money almost investment sites and cloud mining sites are 99% scams.Don't trust anyone if you only found that guy in youtube comments and want to talk to you through other contacts outside youtube it's obvious that he has a plan for you. Since you already have an account here on the forum always ask here if you found another site that you don't know so that other users here will give advice and tell you if the site is legit or a scam.",

Again thanks to all.Yeah, most newbie fall for it, you can find these scammers in most social media websites' comments and PM's particularly: Facebook and youtube - comment sections for investmentsYoutube How to vids - comment sections for how to hack crypto wallets, any kind of tricks to crypto investments.Intagram's - investment in DMsTwitter - tweets/retweets for scam giveaways and DM's for investments.Targets are newbie asking questions that's why you need avoid them unless some are legitimately asking questions,  as long as its investments related - AVOID.Talking about investments, well, actually there are still legit websites, but they are not that profitable as what other are expecting. I'm talking to crypto/bitcoin casinos investments. Although, I don't know if what new casinos are currently offering investment on their sites I only knew yolodice and bustadice as found on this thread[1][1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5239794.0",

There was a reply saying.....Was their username highlighted in their reply? if not, then it isn't from the channel account.But even if the reply is actually from the channel account, it doesn't mean it should be trusted as hacking youtube accounts to conduct scams are pretty rampant and there are channels who are already malicious from the very start. Best to not entertain any strangers coming to you to talk about money, it is most of the time a scam attempt. You know what they say, if it's too good to be true, it probably is.As a last resort, you can try to come up with a little story to make them feel a reinvestment is possible when funds are released, who knows maybe they're dumb enough to bite lol.",

A while ago, there was an intense promotion of \"PI\" Ponzi scheme, so I think these scammers are trying to get free visits by taking advantage of the popularity of that scam currency project.Mostly, these scammers are lazy, try to get more information from them, for example, tell them you want to withdraw and pay to them directly, or you have a balance in Binance and you need Binance ID account to send it to them.",

Thanks.@MRFurian, if I may suggest you 'please' avoid with exchange site bi-finance.tech, there are some oddities I see, especially regarding their social media.From the data I see.https://www.bi-finance.tech/#Clumsiness.1. Telegram: cannot be accessed.2. Twitter/Facebook: also cannot be accessed.3. YouTube, the same cannot be accessed.Only: WhatsApp can be accessed.This is a sign, they are trying to trick users only through WhatsApp.As far as I know honest exchange is active via YouTube broadcasts, Telegram Twitter and Facebook, unlike bi-finance.tech, I'm sure anyone dealing with bi-finance.tech services can end up in disaster.",
