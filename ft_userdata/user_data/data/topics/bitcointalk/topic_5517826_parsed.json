  "content": "The FBI says that Eric Council Jr. used a SIM swapping attack to make a fake X post from @SEC claiming Bitcoin ETFs had been approved.QuoteThe FBI has arrested an Alabama man who is accused of hacking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account in January. The indictment (PDF) alleges that 25-year-old Eric Council Jr. worked with co-conspirators to take control of the account and post a fake message from SEC Chair Gary Gensler about Bitcoin ETFs that caused the price of Bitcoin to jump by more than $1,000 momentarily.To carry out this scheme, Council is accused of creating a fake ID using the information belonging to the person in control of the SEC’s X account. He then allegedly tricked AT&T into providing a SIM card with the victim’s phone number and install it into a new iPhone he purchased. Finally, Council was able to gain control of the SEC’s account using recovery authentication codes sent to the number, and later return the iPhone to the Apple Store where he’d bought it.What a missed chance, he could’ve just waited, especially since it eventually got approved, and now we’re in a bull run... He wouldn’t have ended up in jail. But really, nothing’s safe nowadays, not even the SEC’s X account, which investors keep a close eye on since SEC announcements can hugely impact Bitcoin.If he gets convicted, he’s looking at 5 years behind bars...pretty harsh. He probably didn’t realize just how big the penalty is for what he did. Although, maybe he made some money off it, just not much, since the pump back then was just over $1,000 compared to the $10k increase we’re seeing now.",

I mean, why would they send a recovery code to a number that was not used to register on the site? Or are the regulations different in different regions? If you get logged out of your account and you don't know the password, the recovery authentication gets sent to the email or phone number used in registering the account, so wy was it sent to a different number? And no, they don't send to another number even if the number is the number of the owner of the account. I do not know the full details but X have some questions to answer and they can also be sued for negligence or whatever if its what I think.",

QuoteHe later conducted internet searches for “SECGOV hack,” “telegram sim swap,” “how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,” and “What are the signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement or the FBI even if you have not been contacted by them.” So only the perp who did the sim swap was arrested and he's pretty amateur judging from the search history lol. It's been revealed that he had co-conspirators whom he sent the OTP to, as well and they seem to be the folks who accessed the X account. Quote from: https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/fbi-arrests-alabama-man-january-2024-sec-x-hack-spiked-value-bitcoin Council shared those codes with members of the conspiracy, who then accessed the account – and issued the fraudulent tweet on the @SECGov X account in the name of the SEC Chairman, falsely announcing the SEC’s approval of BTC ETFs. Council received BTC payment for performing the successful SIM swap. Shortly after, Council drove to Birmingham, Alabama to return the iPhone used in the SIM swap for cash. So it seems like Council is just an errand guy or something. I wouldn't be surprised if he just received instructions how to sim swap too. His co-conspirators most likely have been paid and/or profited a much bigger amount.",

Hackers engage in it for different reasons. It is possible that he did it just for fun or fame. Or he is a trader or is working for a big trading firm that wants to use fake news to manipulate the market and make profit.  QuoteAfterward, he bought a new iPhone with cash, using both the SIM card and the device to obtain access codes for the @SECGov X account. Council then shared these codes with other conspiracy members, enabling them to access the account and post a fraudulent post. For his role in the successful SIM swap, Council was paid in BTC.https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/18/fbi-arrests-hacker-behind-sec-x-account-fake-bitcoin-etf-announcement/Since he was paid and he had to sell the phone he used for the hack, it is likely that he was hired by people or organizations whose intention was to make profit from the manipulation. Maybe further investigation will expose more details about the hacks.",

Who knows, it is possible that he has some cryptocurrency holding and that fake tweet from the currently hacked SEC X account could have hype his holding and profit from it.  I also do not think that it was unintentional or the suspect does not know the consequences.  He just thought that he would never be traced since his number is the same as the creator of the SEC X account.Quote from: Ziskinberg on November 12, 2024, 03:36:32 AMThose deepfake scams are actually more effective, where they convince investors to send money directly to a wallet or even control their computer to transfer funds to an exchange.
