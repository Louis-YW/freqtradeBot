  "content": "The President of America, Joe Biden became a victim to COVID-19 after series of tests run on him come out positive, discloses White House physician, Dr Kelvin Connor. He further disclosed that although the President is not showing any signs of the symptoms, they will still take precautionary measures.. Biden, when tested positive, had prior vaccinations and two booster shots but still experienced \"very mild symptoms\". And the last test conducted was Tuesday last week and the results came back negative.It was also gathered by a statement coming from the White House that Biden has begun taking Paxlovid.Paxlovid is an oral, antiviral pill that can be taken at home to help keep high risk patients from getting so sick that they need to be hospitalized..Concerns have been raised regarding the health and age of the President as by November, he'd be turning 80, but Biden believes he can come out of this as he compares himself to Trump, when the latter had a similar issue.Where I want our attention is on the Paxlovid drug and it's side effects which are; - an altered or impaired sense of taste. - increased blood pressure - abdominal pain, etc..For his age,  is it wise to continue with the consumption of the drug? And can he recover quickly?  Biden tests positive link",

If the president of America is found positive in covid-19 severally that means the information circulating around is fake information and which no one can believe in that if they always find it positive in any test run they perform concerning covid-19 I believe that it is a political propaganda in order to bring his political ambitions and carrier down. If actually it is a positive patient of covid19 starting from when the information were stipulated and till date.without adequate treatment.",
