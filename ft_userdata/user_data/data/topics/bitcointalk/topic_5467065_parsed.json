  "content": "I'm researching the topic on how many users actually report their winnings or losses to the tax authority, and from the current research there's a major discrepancy in the processes from country to country; Quote#1. Residents of the UK, Canada, and Australia don’t need to pay anything at all, as these governments view this money as the result of good fortune and do not view gambling as a profession. These earnings do not need to be reported, and nothing is owed on them.  #2. Malta is also pretty simple. Gambling winnings are only taxed if the player is a professional gambler, though this term is not strictly defined, but if you're earning above the \"grace amount\" of 12950 EUR, you can apply for it. #3. The US taxes all gambling winnings as income. In fact, there’s even a special form for documenting your gambling wings: Form W-2G. This money is counted towards your yearly income and will be taxed at whatever bracket you fall into at both the state and federal levels. You must keep track of the type of gambling, the amount of the gambling winnings, and the general ratio of the winnings to the wager, as these will all be needed for filing. Conversely, any gambling losses that occur on a real money online casino platform can be tax deductible in an amount up to your total yearly winnings. Losses and winnings must be filed separately and not as a net amount.  Source: EsportsHeadlines.com Now I'm quite curious how other gamblers are managing this part of the story, if they manage it at all. So, question to you, did you ever consider paying taxes on your gambling winnings, or deduct the taxes with the losses you've created? If not, what is the reasoning behind it?",

I hardly make a big bank from gambling on a yearly basis so it doesn't make sense to even add that to the income tax returns. I think authorities should only go after casinos since they rarely end up in a loss. It's probably more costly for them to go after most casual gamblers that don't even keep a record of their wins and losses.",

Tax code in my country which is the Philippines is pretty vague when it comes to gambling winnings, although it says that if my winnings are around 200 USD below are taxed at 10% while anything above would be taxed at 20% pretty big to be honest and this is the first time that I've known of this because I don't think the Revenue Service in my country hasn't been on my ass yet for taxes regarding gambling winnings, I only play poker though so it's possible casinos and lottery wins are a different thing.",

This is risky in some countries, and can be considered tax evasion. If unfortunate, the player can in a day get unlucky twice, if caught by the casino, he'll lose his earnings and as well face the Government. There are other means of avoiding the tax, like compiling a good number of losses amounting to less winning amounts when checked alongside your winnings. Since smaller amounts don't get taxed. I read on quora a player that gets slips of losses from different players and submit as their own losses, thereby, deducing the amount of tax expected to be paid for winning. But, for how long will that be? any player that wins big may not continue to avoid paying taxes.

The  tax on gamblers who win big, are also seen as income, used by the government to maintain the country. That's why different countries differ in terms of gambling winnings, in some countries it's not required for a gambler to pay tax for being lucky.",

On the other hand, it is the casino themselves who pay taxes to the government, but I think it's very lenient to some extend as our government are trying to attract casinos to put here, to bring jobs in our country.But if they are going to say that we will have to pay taxes then why not?

I don't know about other countries but in my country you don't need to pay anyone to keep gambling, it's a game of luck and many gamblers will lose money, the government understand this, if it's other way around every single gamblers will be forced to pay tax or something related to it, I mean isn't it why the government in some countries are going after crypto investors? They know that casinos will never lose or run out of business because its a win situation for those who are running the business, it's like feeding off people and the government understand it, only few countries ban casinos, it's a lucrative business.",

There are exceptions but you could generally consider most gamblers to be in the general league when it comes to their finances. It's a fun hobby and they spend a bit of leisure cash on it, winning some weeks and losing other weeks. There is only a tiny fraction of people who will need to look at their gambling winnings to the level that you are suggesting. People who might be in the esports scene, especially good sports bet gamblers and even professionals in areas like poker. I wouldn't imagine that most countries will benefit from doing anything when it comes to their gambling spend, they won't get any tax breaks because it is considered a leisure/optional activity and has even traditionally been frowned upon as a \"sin\" so is more likely to be penalized than anything.",
