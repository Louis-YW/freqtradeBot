      "body": "For support and resistance, Fibonacci retracement can help. For overbought and oversold market, you can read more about RSI and Bollinger Bands. You can read more about RMA and EMA.Know that indicators are of great help, but they can fail at times. While using indicators, you have to use low leverage in many cases which is very important. Know that trading is beyond using indicators, but if you know how to use indicator and coupled with experience, patience and low leverage, you will make profit than loss.Low leverage for the purpose of 'if the market fails', there are possiblity that the market will still correct itself back to your direction and what you think will be loss will become profit. Some traders says they use stop lose, I always think this is for high leverage traders. Know that trading is highly risky, use the amount of money you can afford to lose to trade and use the amount lower than the amount you can afford to lose to train.",

This indicates that a daily level (1D) is stronger than an hourly level (12h, 1h), or that a level of 5m is weaker than a level of 30m or 45m. A weaker or stronger terms refers on how strong the reaction was when that level was hit.- Second, the strength of SnR is determined by how frequently it was hit or by the first touch principle. This means that if the PA touches the level one time, it has to test that level again in order to break it.Now, these are only some of the fundamental ideas I've used from lessons I acquired on YouTube and Reddit, but they still don't apply to trading in a strict way, so take it with a grain of salt.",

Typically daily time frame and longer is the best to use as reference for SnR and the rest was just as basis for futures trading or short term trade.",

It's a continuous, dynamic change, and it would be tricky to have the same support and resistance from different traders. It's emotional and biased toward the trader.For example.You can see the resistance here. I have a bot that automatically computes possible support and resistance using the Simple Moving Average or SMA. The user will set the period. (depending on the number of candles you would use = Period). The bot, then, after buying, could trade at a specific price gain from your original position. It does it automatically. Using this as a spot market strategy, you will buy at support and sell at resistance. With futures, you can short at resistances and long on supports. Either way, it's going to depend on how you are going to set it.",

During a bear market the resistance level needs to be broken to see a bull market to start and in a bull market the support level if not sustained it will crash to a bear market. That is as much as you need to remember while trading.In a quick-decision making situation, place buy orders at Support or lower than Support levels to anticipate a discounted price for buying when the drop happens and vice versa. But these are nothing new, most traders know this or have been doing this regularly without knowing it.The difference is only in those who realize that a bear market is the time to buy and not panic sell and the bull market is the time to sell and not drool.",
