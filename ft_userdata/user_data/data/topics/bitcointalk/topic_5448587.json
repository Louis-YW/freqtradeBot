  "content": "Recent cryptocurrency investors, especially new ones, might find that different strategies of investing do exist, and the best of whatever strategy employed determines the profit or loss one might incur. I came up on the term  'stacking Sats' and 'HODLing' which are investment strategies for those who don't fancy short term trading as a gain system. These strategies offer a way to further diversify an investment portfolio over a duration longer than what trading could offer.1. Stacking Sats':This is in short a nick name which in English term would refer to \"accumulating Bitcoin\". While 'sats' would mean Satoshi, as the smallest unit of Bitcoin, stacking would simply imply heaping or storing up.With both words combined to give the synonym for dollar cost averaging Bitcoin, it suffices to say that this is purchasing small amounts of BTC on a regular basis over a duration one chooses.2. HODL :Hold on for dear life!As of 2013, the term HODL first came on to the scene in a Bitcoin talk forum when a frustrated trader under the username GameKyuubi was letting his bottle of whiskey do the talking and posted the now infamous thread “I AM HODLING”.The point of GameKyuubi’s post was to let the cryptocurrency world know that, despite the serious fall Bitcoin had just taken, they planned to still hold on to their BTC. What GameKyuubi didn’t know was this simple typo would soon become an iconic term used by crypto communities around the world. HODL started gaining traction in mainstream media and late-night television, in addition to being held responsible for the creation of countless memes.3. Trading Bitcoin: I included this as one investment strategy because one would have to have invested some funds in Bitcoin, before it could be used in whatever format one deems fit for the best profit taking at the time. One way besides the others aforementioned for short term gain is to be a merchant trader. However, gains or losses from trading may be affected by the market volatility.*Are there other investment strategies you know or have explored to the best benefit?*Which among the aforementioned strategies would fit your investment plan and why?Let's discuss!For more read and reference visit the links below:https://www.cryptovantage.com/guides/what-is-hodl-in-cryptocurrency/#hodl-meaning-and-originshttps://dcabtc.com/what-is-stacking-sats",

      "body": "DCA is a good strategy when you are a long term investor and this strategy works best in bear market especially about one year since a start of bear market when bottom is mostly in and price is about -70% or -80% from all time high.DCA in a bull run is more risky because you can DCA at mini top or around all time high but the biggest reason why you DCA is you believe that price will be much higher than a price you buy it after a few years. In addition, with DCA you will not have to feel uncertain what is bottom, when to buy, don't have to time in the market. It will help you to feel more easily to make decision without impact from market up or down and your emotion.I disagree with hold on dear life because you must to sell your bitcoin at some time, to get your initial capital and to prevent that you will lose all including initial capital if anything which is super bad like a black swan event on bitcoin. Sell your bitcoin when its price is very high from your entry price that is enough for you to get your initial capital by just selling 10% or 30% of your bitcoin amount.After you sell part of it and get your initial capital, you can say I am not a hodler and will hold on dear life my bitcoin. Nothing to lose after getting initial capital back.",

The Bitcoin halving happened several times and everyone who made DCA in Bitcoin enjoyed saving and got a good return on it.That's why this time, the average number of communities that are now doing Bitcoin savings or other altcoins has increased.

Buying at once can also be a good strategy, but the bad negative thing on that way is that, you might lose an opportunity if Bitcoin goes even lower in price, and you don't have money to buy it at a lower price. Overall, stacking sats, or Dollar-Cost Average is kind of the same that you are stacking Satoshis. The only difference I guess is that... there's no difference on it.

What GameKyuubi didn’t know was this simple typo would soon become an iconic term used by crypto communities around the world. HODL started gaining traction in mainstream media and late-night television, in addition to being held responsible for the creation of countless memes.Well, that term really became popular especially in this forum. This is why I love the forum. There are many things that happened only here, and will only happen here. That infamous HODL, some famous names like Satoshi, Hal etc. posted here, the person behind the infamous 10,000 Bitcoin pizza.Anyway, I guess there's no need for an explanation with this one already because it's on the name already. On the other hand, I will not do this one because it's like \"You will hold your Bitcoins until you die.\" which is not one of my plans. I still want to give my Bitcoins to some other people if my time comes, but anyway, I hope that people took \"Holding on for dear life\" phrase as \"Holding long term\".Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on April 12, 2023, 07:44:46 PM3.

One way besides the others aforementioned for short term gain is to be a merchant trader. However, gains or losses from trading may be affected by the market volatility.This is where most of the profits are.At the same time, this is where most investors are losing money.The most riskiest way of the three. Trading Bitcoin is considered an investment because in order for an investor to trade, you must invest Bitcoin. Still, those expert traders are the ones who are gaining the most profit thru trading, and where they are getting those profits? From the investors who are losing on their trades.",

I don't think newbies like HODL because newbies are people who don't have much experience but always want to make money quickly. Most newbies will start with trading, especially futures trading, because they think that just buying low and selling high will be profitable and won't take too long. But after having a bad experience in trading, they start thinking about holding for a long as it is less risky as well as better return. To be honest, some people in my locality get rich with bitcoin, but mostly holding, I haven't seen anyone get rich through trading, so I'm also a long-term holder.",

Trading will be looked at by those who possess the trading skills but a raw individual in the market will be taking a huge risk to trade. People who are eager to make lots of profits look also at trading. The Holding method is actually the best and most secure strategy for someone with little knowledge of crypto. Those that see bitcoin in particular as a store of value just buy and leave their funds there, some for future profits and others to avoid the depreciation that affects the fiat.DCA strategy is used by mainly salary or weekly income earners that wants to have their funds stack in bitcoin. This method is my most preferred because it doesn’t requires much knowledge like that of trading and when bitcoin is on downturn trend the risk is easily reduced than those holding. The DCA method is preferred by me because it kind of capitalizes on the loss ground gain by early adopters. With DCA I could accumulate more and also reduce risk of buying at higher price",

The best thing would be to combine both DCA and HOLD strategies together and you should be good for both the short and long term. Seeing if the price starts correcting after hitting $30.5k, one should get ready to start doing DCA as it falls down further, and once it starts going up again, they should simply hold on to their nerves.The price might not go too deep this time, some people are expecting it to go around $20k but I would say that is a lot to expect, it might go around $24k or something and even that would be a great price for people to buy more if they want.",
