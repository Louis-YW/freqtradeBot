If I see sites or people comparing stocks with bitcoin, it use to annoy me because they are not comparable, only time is what that is needed and the difference between a digital currency called bitcoin that is recognized globally as money, currency, investment and store of value and those stocks listed with it would be known when bitcoin price fall will still give a bigger marketcap higher than the highest stock marketcap. I do not think that would be up to 10 years away.",

But with bitcoin's volatility, it may changed positively or negatively.But we're all optimistic that the bull run will be formed soon and that's going to add more market capitalization on it which means that it could go close to the top 5 which is silver and Google (Alphabet). We've seen it before that during the last bull run, market cap was around $1T+ and that's what it needs to have to surpass Meta and get close to those that I've mentioned.",

This title would be good for the beginning of an article to attract views, but there is no relationship between Bitcoin and Tesla that would make us compare the market capacities between them.When we look at Bitcoin's 2021 ATH Market Cap, we see that it is worth $1.22T. Now, Bitcoin is 50% below the ATH level and the Market Cap is down almost 50%. Everyone states that the new ATH will be above $100k and there is a very strong perception in the market. If we do some simple math, when the Bitcoin price is $100k, the Market Cap is worth $1.91T. If there is no excessive increase in the market capitalization of companies and similar things when Bitcoin ATH takes place, I can say that Bitcoin will easily push the top 3. If everything goes well, this is likely to happen in November 2024. This is not investment advice and you should make your own investments based on your own judgment.",

This sounds crazy.Different asset classes though. It doesn’t really make sense to compare tesla with btc. One is a company which makes cars/batteries etc and the other one is a commodity. Tesla might be gone in 10 years but btc will be with us just like gold and copper. Tesla is also is a very overpriced stock. The investors think tsla is bigger than toyota, vw, mercedes, ford and stellantis combined. That’s obviously a pipe dream which can end any moment. Btc’s real opponent is gold and btc is slowly catching up to it.",

But, I'd say that bitcoin is top one in its category. And also performs well on inter categories of companies or establishments. Bitcoin and Tesla correlation depends on diversity. Tesla is quite not comparable to bitcoin in terms of profits and rewards. But at a risk rate Tesla is a better choice than bitcoin. Hence, a specific set of investors would choose to drop money into tesla than bitcoin. Or vice versa, depending on the fast returns in bitcoin. Tesla could be trading bitcoin and earn profits too. Bitcoin is a fast growing technology, with different potentials. At a 3T market cap, it'll be sharing lots of benefits to investors. Thereby involuntarily boosting the talk on bitcoin in the world. Which relentless publicity, can throw it above other top companies. Though not competitors. And I don't think we should be concerned about those other companies. They're already concerned about bitcoin movement. A lot of work is happening in bitcoin and it's growing real quick. Surpassing already existing companiesQuote from: pixie85 on October 26, 2023, 07:30:47 PMThis shows how small bitcoin still is. How can a global decentralized money and a store of value compared to digital gold be as small as an electric car company and get an edge over it only because of the recent pump?I'm sure we are very early here. . It's good we are early, but Tesla may have not reached the height bitcoin has attained in market capacity. It all happened due to market violatility. Imagine bitcoin surpass Tesla a world recognized electric car at 34k. If I'm right. You'll see how little Tesla is, not bitcoin. The growth of the technology is enormous, just that people are afraid of volatility. But, it's quite a great investment. And more people are begining to think good of the violatile nature of bitcoin. They're adapting to it. Knowing that it'll definitely pump some day. Provided that people still trades bitcoin. So, the growth of bitcoin will move faster than Tesla. It's just an innovation with very less publicity, acceptance, rejections compared to bitcoin. Tesla, yes, looks like an innovation that can go extinct. Because of the price, difficulty in adapting with charging a car, trusts etc.",

I think Tesla's in deep trouble internally and financially.

Am looking forward to the halving and the bull run that follows before I even begin to consider any statistics presented about its market capitalization and asset worth against the dollar, gold, not Tesla obviously. With the massive adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide, even recent movies now use reference to crypto or Bitcoin because of the fact that it is the future of money, not Tesla that its energy demand may cause a deficiency in materials for its batteries.
