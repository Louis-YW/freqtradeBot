  "content": "The recent accusation by US Ambassador Reuben E. Brigety that South Africa sent arms to Russia is making investors sell off the South African rand and bonds. Investors are scared that the US and its allies will hit the country with severe economic sanctions. The rand has lost value since the news was published, the currency is now 19.3250 against the dollar, its weakest in three years. If it is confirmed that South Africa sent weapons and ammunition to Russia, the country will suffer economic problems because of sanctions. It will also be a big blow to the African economy because South Africa is the economic powerhouse of Africa. Many South African countries like Zimbabwe, Botswana Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini, etc, depend on South Africa economically. South Africa also employs a greater number of Africans because they have many striving multinational firms. As an African, I pray this accusation is not true because a sanction on South Africa is a sanction on the entire Africa.",

Image from Aljazeera The situation is concerning, if there are allegations or issues that are detrimental to a country it is deemed necessary to carry out an investigation to ensure the truth where the South African Government can investigate the allegations made by the US Ambassador and show evidence that can refute the accusations to maintain economic stability in Africa and mitigate the impact of potential economic sanctions. But I think it's important to wait for further information and developments before jumping to conclusions.",

It is estimated that they host about 2.9 million immigrants that reside and work in the country. There are no recent statistics on the number of Nigerians living in South Africa but according to a 2016 estimate about 30,314 stay there. And a Nigerian newspaper puts the population to about Â 800, 000. But you hardly find South Africans in Nigeria except for those that work in their multinational forms such as MTN and DSTV. We cannot also doubt that South Africa has better infrastructure than most African countries. Businesses have better chances of surviving in that country than most African economies.If South African economy gets bad about 3 million immigrants will be affected. There will increase in xenophobic crimes. Many Africans might be forced to return to their homeland to add to the number of unemployed. We need peace and stability in South Africa.",

And if the US sanctions come to their country, the economic condition of their country will be seriously affected. But if South Africa had supplied arms to Russia, South Africa would have spoken about it directly, so they would not have supplied arms in secret. Since several other African countries are dependent on South Africa's economy, this can be a threat to other countries including South Africa. But we hope that the United States should investigate the matter thoroughly and not impose such a large ban based on one person's complaint.",

Â  You are absolutely correct because the latest news is that the US ambassador that made the allegations have apologized to South Africa for making such an allegation without concrete evidence. This is a serious allegation that can ruin the political, social, and economic sectors of a country. South Africa has insisted that they are committed to its political neutrality and Arms Control Act. This might be an intimidation strategy by the West to make South Africa reduce its commitment to the BRICS alliance or an administrative or diplomatic blunder by Reuben E. Brigety.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65572154",

If SA really did the ammunition supply to Russia secretly,then they should be ready to face the consequences because US wouldn't tolerate such assist from SA to Russia. It will be like a challenge to the US government and NATO who is strongly supporting Ukraine. SA should have known this,that if they are caught it will bring sanction on them from doing business with the western world and should have made preparation for whatever the outcome will be,and if nothing has been put in place to face the consequences, I must say that SA made a wrong move that will affect the whole Africa due to their own selfish interest. If it is not true, then we don't need to worry ourselves about this accusation because the truth will be revealed with time and there will be no sanction on SA.Quote from: Die_empty on May 13, 2023, 09:19:49 AMthe US ambassador that made the allegations have apologized to South Africa for making such an allegation without concrete evidence.

Nevermind that sanctions have already weakened the U.S. dollar beyond repair, which would in turn strengthen Russian RUB. They simply see sanctions as a winning strategy and accept the collateral damage. BRICS is a danger to the U.S./NATO, so even if South Africa were not supplying arms to Russia, the U.S. doesn't want additional countries to form close alliances with adversaries.",

Instead of America being concerned about the country's economic condition, Russia has come and given its open arms to rebuild the financial system. The goal is to beat back the crisis that America is experiencing. At present, as we all know, America is busy printing money on a large scale, which means that it does not have time to take care of foreign countries before they really restore public confidence in the resilience of the declining value of the dollar.",
