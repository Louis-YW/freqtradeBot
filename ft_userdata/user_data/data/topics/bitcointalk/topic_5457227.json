  "content": "Hey fam,Been wondering this for awhile and finally had to ask. Lets say you went to pick up a Casascius coin in person and you had to fly back with it in your carry-on luggage.Is it possible that when the Casascius coin went through the airport x-ray machine they would be able to see the private key underneath the hologram? Maybe it isn't possible with the x-ray technology at the airport, but how about just any x-ray in general? Has this every been tested?Best,BTCOVERFIATS",

Maybe if for some reason you punched the private key into a metal square or something before applying the holo you MAY be able to but not paper. I’ve tried that among many other things doing some testing a while back. X-Rays were a no go",

      "body": "I think it depends on the specific type of printing involved. For example, good X-ray scanners used in airports can identify money within bags by detecting even minuscule traces of metal present in the ink used on banknotes. Metal has a higher density than paper. However, most commercial x-ray devices (even medical ones) have very poor resolution. And since Casascius coins are already made of metal anyway, all the detector will detect are the coins themselves, not the information printed on them. I suppose it is theoretically possible with some sophisticated high-tech laboratory equipment. But for that to happen, someone would need prolonged physical access to your coins. In that case, there are simpler methods of physical tampering, such as using solvents to remove the holographic sticker without leaving any visible damage.Quote from: stackinsats777 on June 22, 2023, 05:05:34 PMAny threads about removing holograms being not so difficult?

For example, good X-ray scanners used in airports can identify money within bags by detecting even minuscule traces of metal present in the ink used on banknotes. Metal has a higher density than paper. This is correct, furthermore.... each security thread has a specific signature. If you ever wondered how a cop knows which cars to pull over for civil asset forfeiture... well there you go. Almost all banknotes contain both metal fibres within the substrate, and metallic pigments within the intaglio ink (the part of the design that feels raised to the touch).This is rather similar to MICR toner found on cheques. These include but are not limited to: Magnetic ink (containing ferromagnetic components), IR-metameric Inks (can be seen under certain IR light).",

Any Cipher Bond or Cypher Bills that I made I placed two thin pieces of aluminum foil on each side of the private keys.    Also since I printed two private key formats, it would also obfuscate the qr code in a way as well.     Another way is to print out the same qr code and place over each other in the opposite direction so if the can be read they would be unsweepable.",

There are companies that can test the toner to find the particle size, chemical makeup, and foreign particulate (such as metal). It's possible to buy security toners that would emit such signatures, such as MICR toner.But no would make that mistake, since those toners cost about 5x a normal aftermarket cartridge.",

I think if you put enough (criminal) energy in cracking most of these physical security features, you can possibly find ways.Regarding the X-ray question: I remember discussing this a while ago with some folks that are quite tech savy and their estimate was with a modern and rightly callibrated x-ray-machine you would probably be able to read an engraved private key. Haven't heard of anyone putting this to the test so far, though.Also I am certain there is current technology (if not just an x-ray machine) that would be able to do this. Most of this tech is probably still extremely expensive and only in the hands of a few researchers and scientists in fields that don't really care about stealing a few BTC from crypto collectibles.",
