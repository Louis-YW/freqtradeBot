These are two important sentence there.

To invest in this market, is to accept the high risk involve in all of the currencies.But you can minimize potential high losses if you will dedicate your funds to valuable alts.As we can't tell when will the bullish period will happen, you are just waiting basically what will happen next.But while waiting, you are just hoping that your choices are good to increase your portfolio.In my opinion, as much as possible, better diversify your assets outside crypto market.",

Are you confident that cryptocurrency will recover, and when do you think that will happen?I've been in the crypto space since 2016 and I've learned a lot from the market cycles I experienced. Compared to stock market, it's normal here that a crypto could pump 10x then go down 80% of its ATH. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile and these dumps are to be expected after pump. Market will not always go up and also down. It will surely recover but it's difficult to say when it will be because there are real-world issues that also affects these dump.",

There is no certainty but Im sure as Ive been staying for few years and Ive saw how the cryptocurrency go back or surpass its level. Its just need time and growth more.Imagine someone completely buying bitcoin throughout the years and never selling. The supply shorten and thats what makes it in demand. In time people will realize this that most bitcoin are getting lower and lower.",

I think gradually the price will start to bounce back.If we are to wait for the whales then we are going to be in a big big trouble. We need to realize that the best thing about our current situation is not whales and it could be us. How? Well simply just put our money in there and increase the volume. Since the volume is low, regular people like you and me who do not have much could get into crypto, buy bitcoin and increase its price.Of course, whales could come in and drop it a lot right away, but they can do that for so long, eventually they would have to stop. Even though rich people have a lot of money, they are outnumbered so we could take them on and if enough of us could get together then we could increase it. Which is basically how finance market worked in 2021 when WSB fought hedge funds on GameStop.",

No, theres nothing like certainty; this is why like other investments it is a monetary risk. The word that should be used for crypto currency market is probability. This is why every trader focuses on these and choose trades that has the highest probability to grant them win/profit \"with respect to btc movement\"",

As others have said, we are in a cycle, unfortunately, we are now in the bear market so it might be a long and hard grind till next year. And again, as its previous trend, usually the recovery starts after the bitcoin block halving process. And this activity will occur sometime early 2024. So count a couple of months after that, maybe we can see some semblance of recovery then and probably the eventual bull run.",
