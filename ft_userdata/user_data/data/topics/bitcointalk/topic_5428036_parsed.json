Putin has maybe <10 years before he dies of old age or until someone within his own regime poisons him so it isn't necessary for anyone to meddle in Russia's own demise. If they take drastic war action that significantly effects global interests then maybe the analysis changes. Until then, there needs be no action.",

      "body": "How do you think that is possible. Putin is Russian President and a sovereign country that is not in America or control by it. Biden can have the interest or wish to do that to remove Putin but is not in the power of US president to remove russian president. The countries that have sovereignty have power of independence.",

Leaders are just a distraction and myth that they will do anything for you. The only difference is the perception that one leader will make your life worse slower than the other is the greater truth.Quote from: suchmoon on December 12, 2022, 04:08:36 PMBiden - president of Russia, makes sense. No big deal if he doesn't speak Russian, gibberish in any language is still gibberish. Never thought I'd see the day that you'd finally bash him. I think he should be a permanent cast member of SNL to play himself or any wacky character they come up with. He'd be funnier than all the rest of them minus the groping of female and even male cast members especially if there are children involved.",

The US and her allies are careful because Russia and her allies are also powerful. They can only give Ukraine financial and military assistance lack the will power to join the war. One of the potent force of hurting Russia is sanctions and more of these punishments are still coming. The only people that have the power to remove Putin are his people. Russia is a democratic government and it would take a constitutional process to impeach or remove the president of Russia. And from all indication currently, it seems that Putin has the backing of the legislatures who represent the people. Biden wouldn't replace Putin except he becomes a Russian citizen.",
