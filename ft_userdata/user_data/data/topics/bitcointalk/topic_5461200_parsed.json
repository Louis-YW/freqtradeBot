  "content": "The MIT research team has made the discovery that bitcoin mining solves the climatic and environmental emissions of gases like methane by creating an overall balance for the full utilization of this gas from the electric grid ror an effective use for bitcoin mining after being converted to a useful required energy for bitcoin mining, this comes in use against the inefficient use of natural resources emissions into the environment while maximizing it through the mining process of bitcoin. https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1683130025124438016?t=M2KSGXuzc4NMNM_I44V9SQ&s=19",

But the tweet is clearly oversimplifying things.Reading the full report, I want to circle out a few things:- the report covers 1/4 of the global hash rate, so unfortunately not the majority of mining;- based on their findings, the majority of mining is unlikely to be fuelled by sustainable energy (although, again, the report only accounts for 25%);- the report supports the evidence that Bitcoin mining can help with the power grid sustainability and to use up otherwise wasted energy (and use the money to work on solutions to ecological problems);- \"Bitcoin mining may serve as a catalyst for investment in renewable infrastructure\";- proper assessment of potential climate benefits of Bitcoin mining requires more research;- the authors support the requirement of more transparency from Bitcoin miners to evaluate various claims regarding the impact of Bitcoin on the climate.",

Yeah i have also read some topic, many miners were left no choice other than the usage of carbon free energy resources because electricity, fuel usage etc are also costing them a lot. And many bans on usage of such unnatural resources had also forced them.So many miner shifted to wind power but that was not cost efficient as it was not generating enough energy. So most of the miners shifted to solar panels. And few days back i heard a news that now china has able to made solar panel that looks like big flash light like the ones used in stadiums. Means, they have increased the capacity and decreased the size. Which is way Efficient then before. Such innovation will decrease the carbon omission more and one day it will be near to zero.",

Since it is empirical there are proofs to back up their claims, so it is based on facts and not mere assumption. Although the research didn't cover a wider coverage it is a step in the right direction. For a world class university like Massachusetts Institute of Technology to come up with certain benefits of bitcoin mining to the environment and the energy sector, it means that gradually the lies of some anti-bitcoin forces are been debunked. I am aware that bitcoin miners are striving to switch to green energy in most parts of the world. The misconception that Bitcoin mining is just destroying the environment that has been promoted around the globe will finally lose its potency because more benefits and contributions of bitcoin mining will be continually unveiled. It also gives me hope that very soon bitcoin mining will be an acceptable business in many parts of the world.",

The climate issue has been used as an excuse to attack Bitcoin as a useful technology, due to the absence of official statistics from reliable research centers or research universities.Today, clean energies are used in the mining process, in addition to taking advantage of the low cost of electricity in some parts of the world. Mining companies themselves have become more concerned with the climatic effects of the mining process, and they have realized the importance of consuming clean energy, and that this also helps to reduce costs and, consequently, greater returns.",

Because it actually doesn't say that Bitcoin mining is green, it says that the carbon emissions of mining are the same as average carbon emissions of the electric grid, despite the claims of miners that they use more renewable energy. And all the supposed benefits of mining for the environment are only theoretical.QuoteIf the Bitcoin mining industry wants to substantiate climate benefit claims, it must understand howestablished carbon accounting rules function and report in line with common standards. In the past,Bitcoin advocacy groups failed to provide evidence to substantiate renewable energy claims, making itdifficult to go beyond applying grid averages when assessing the climate costs of Bitcoin mining.However, as the industry matures, we expect to see increased reporting quality entailing crediblerenewable energy claims which would allow for even more detailed analyses.",

Some efforts are underway to shift towards more sustainable energy sources, such as renewable energy, which could reduce its environmental impact.

If we look at Bitcoin mining right now, much of it is done in such a way that it is already like an evidence or a proof that the critics are wrong. So perhaps the critics somehow helped the Bitcoin mining industry to be environmentally sensitive.",
