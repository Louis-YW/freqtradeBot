      "body": "It's actually a stablecoin of USD or real fiat that run in BSC network, but since the creator is Tether, that's why they're using Tether icon. Does Coinbase ask for additional BNB as the fee? AFAIK any centralized exchange ask the token itself as the fee e.g. if you want to send USDT, the fee is also USDT, not BNB. You need to make sure Binance is support that's token, you can contact the Binance support and ask how to get the receiving address.Quote from: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/embily-adds-support-binance-peg-202200017.htmlBinance-Peg BSC-USD is a decentralised financial payment network that rebuilds the traditional payment stack on the blockchain. It utilises a basket of fiat-pegged stablecoins, algorithmically stabilised by its reserve currency USDT, to facilitate programmable payments and open financial infrastructure development.",

Because once you send it at the wrong network, it's unlikely to be recovered.It happened for so many times in different users so be careful with that and choose the correct network for sending.",

It needs a very small fee and you shall not worry about that. Quote from: rapture333 on January 22, 2023, 10:59:34 PMI was given some Binance-Peg BSC-USD to my Coinbase Wallet. In the description it says its Tether (USDT), and I am confused how to send it to my Binance wallet. Is it an ERC20 coin? A BSC coin? Do I send it as USDT, or BSC? It's not ERC20 since it was based on the binance smart chain. It's BEP20 asset. Fill your wallet with fees and you will able to sell your USDT BSC. It's USDT but based on the BSC network. Binance has two blockchains native and BSC. your asset was based on the BSC.

I thought that you meant about this https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955You can verify your USDT whether that was legit or not based on the smartcontract. You need to fill your wallet with $1 worth of BNB BSC.",
