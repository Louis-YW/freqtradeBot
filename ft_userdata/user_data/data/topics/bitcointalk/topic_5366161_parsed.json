I'd love to see the beautiful houses 1 Bitcoin can buy, but unfortunately all it can get me is a small garage:What to postI'd like to see \"objects\" that vary a lot in price per country (houses are great, but not for instance a gold bar that has more or less the same price everywhere).Quote from: hZti on June 30, 2022, 01:23:41 PMWould it be possible for people to at least post the country that they are in. This would make this so much more interesting.Current Bitcoin value (preev.com)1 Bitcoin = 60,810 USD = 52,200 EUR = 44,250 GBP = 75,220 CAD = 81,990 AUD.I'm not sure yet if I'll keep this topic open long-term, Bitcoin's volatility might mess things up On second thought: this topic may be fun to read back years later.Self-moderatedPlease only post embedded images (use img-tags), with a short explanation. If you're a Newbie, you can't post images.If you don't post an image, I'll delete your post.If your signature advertises a scam, I'll delete your post.",

In fact, very developed areas in my country are expensive, 1 BTC is not even capable of buying a plot (100 x 50ft) of land in some areas in my country, so it greatly depends on the location as the purchasing power also differs from state to state and from state capitals to remote areas. But the fact still remain that 1 BTC has grown from a very small value to an unimaginable high value.",

You can basically live on about 0.0012 to 0.0024BTC per month!

As a developing country, materials are still relatively cheap though they rose partly because of the pandemic where supplies got shrunk and of course the labor cost here is not yet astronomical. So in you still have 1 BTC you can come here in my country and build a house plus some needed appliances and gadgets inside.",

For 90% of people,,, they cannot afford this but if you manage to put downpayment and grant that means you only have 90% to pay for 30 years.In 30 years it is likely your property doubles as land in Singapore is as everyone knows limited, and you for sure sell higher than you bought, all the time.But if you are smart,,, you buy a bit outside the city LANDED property for half the price.Meaning for 1 BTC you can get 20% of the house paid and pay off the land (extremely rare commodity) in tiny Singapore.",

Or you will lose around 10% after using \"shady cash out\" service. (it is impossible to pay directly with crypto)The best logical usage would be buying property. For 43-45k EUR it will be possible to get decent looking 1 room flat (about 40m2 in house like Khrushchyovka) with ikea like furniture, electrical appliances and etc. It will be a corner flat (these one are always cold or it will be often damp at home) or on the first floor.Or if you use a shady option, you might be lucky to get same type of flat, but with 2 rooms/higher floor/better furniture and electrical appliances. You might be lucky to get a 1 room flat in a new house like this.But it will be worse offer on the market. It will be a almost like a box on first floor with <30m2. No furniture, no electrical appliances, first floor.P.S. 1 room flat it does not mean \"1 room + bedroom\" (which is typical for US). It will be just 1 room and a kitchen.",
