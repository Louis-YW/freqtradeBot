China realizes that it is an appropriate time to respond with the necessary firmness to confront US provocations. It is almost a repeat of the Ukraine scenario with the difference that America used the Mato as a front to inflame the Ukrainian situation, sacrificing its European friends who suffer from that war and are considered the most affected by it, and now it puts Taiwan in the barrel of the cannon to set fire to another area of the map.A new international map is taking shape and a new world order is emerging. China, Russia and America are the main players, with a complete absence of the rest of the classical powers such as the Europeans.",
