I am aware that there is a lot to learn in order to become a successful trader, but I will simply touch on one of the most important aspects in trading: JOURNALING. Because the market is unpredictable and can only react to the present price action, your strategy is worthless without journaling. We must keep in mind that only institutions and banks can manipulate the market; their objective is to determine where the stop loss is set, thus we must improve our standard strategies like pattern trading, SMC, and others to prevent getting liquidated.We are all aware that there is no strat with a 100% win rate, yet we can still be profitable.If you keep a journal:You can quickly identify any issues in your trades.You'll be aware of when to enter and exit the market.You will be aware of the strategy that is working for you.Also, it will support positive emotions in you.Those that don't journal:You won't have faith in your TA.You'll be hesitant to make trades.Will make you stressed out.Recommended site to journal your trades: https://www.notion.so/",
