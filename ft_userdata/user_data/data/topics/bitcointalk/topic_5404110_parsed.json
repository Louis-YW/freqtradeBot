It’s stated clearly that the alt coin I trust the most is ethereum due to the losses I’ve incurred in investing in other alt coins. The only trusted alt coins for me is ethereum. I hope you understand better now?",

I just  bought again now that the value has reduced. I still trust that it will increase rapidly soon.I guess Ethereum is one solid altcoin to begin with, it's the prime mover so most likely in the next bull run it will grown again. And I think this is the best time to buy them again, although it is still above 4 digit but the potential growth in 2024-2025 might be huge. And not just Ethereum, perhaps the top 5-10 altcoins will eventually bounce back and as others have said, bear market is the best time to buy and hold.",

Gratulations to that. You sold it pretty close to it's all time high which is always a great feeling afterwards. I would also say that Ethereum is probably the altcoin that i have the most trust in. Both in terms of general trust into the project itself and in the team behind it and of course also trust that Ethereum will remain to be the most important altcoin of them all also in the mid- and long term future. Therefore i think it is totally reasonable to invest into Ethereum now especially if you plan on holding again for a few years or so.",

Ethereum may increase again when bitcoin will be increasing first. If bitcoin is still remain in the bearish trend and how can ethereum to be bullish like what already happened in the past? Ethereum is waiting for the market trend to turn to be bullish trend again and you may see that level again when you sold your ethereum at 4k USD.This may happen in long term.",

There's no catch with that and you just did the right thing and the typical suggestion and tip that we're telling about buying low and selling high.Quote from: Superdoctor on June 26, 2022, 09:13:11 AMI still trust that it will increase rapidly soon.Me too, let's just keep holding Ethereum together.",

It is better to diversify free funds into several altcoins from the top-50. If you invest for a long time, then it is better to definitely buy Ethereum, since the risk of a scam and a complete depreciation is minimal.",

I think not mistake if you bough ethereum on higher price because drastically dump from bitcoin last year make all altcoin price drop and ethereum have lower price until now. Not have to worry if ethereum really drop and have chance back to higher price later until make new all time high above $5,000 on several years later.",

As long as we know when to enter to buy and take profits then do it. But you need to remember that dividing your portfolio balance into many altcoins is also not good. So just take one or 2 altcoins that you have chosen such as Ethereum.",
