I felt this topic should be shared here, since it has to do with things regarding the progress of the forum. There have being some merit source applications by some of our most active members on the Nigeria local board1. From Igebotz: Igebotz Nigerian Local Board Merit Source Application  2. From Charles-Tim: Charles-Tim merit source application + Nigerian local board3.Upgrade00: Upgrade00 - Merit Source ApplicationThe truth is we really wish that they are accepted soon enough so that there will be enough merits circulating in the local board. For now, we have @CryptopreneurBrainboss  who is doing his best to make sure some quality posts are awarded merits. Also, we are thanking @ hugeBlack for his thread which has being of help to all local board here on the forum. We hope that the admin approves us a merit Source soon, so more quality post will be awarded.",

You are wrong here as Nigerian local board do have some merit sources but my question to you is that even if your local board has merit sources does not mean that you will get free merits. You need to post worthy of a merit and then the merit sources may award you with merits. ? Just having a merit source in your local board does not mean that you will get rain of merits.Also if you're posts are good, and your local board does not have a merit source, you will still get merits by individuals. Also if you post outside the local board you can gain merits too so this is not an excuse to not get merits because of the lack of merit sources in the local board.",

Your country has a local board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=275.0How do you know whether you have a merit source or not?

Members with lower ranks are sometimes timid and do not want to do anything that would cost them their account. Pms are sensitive and can be reported as unsolicited. You never know the state of mind the recipient may be in when reading your message. I can imagine how difficult it would be for a newbie who’s trying to rise in ranks to summon courage and pm Theymos about making forum changes.

I have logged in to dozens of forums in order to learn something new, but the forums that I was active in it and it was the only one in which I shared opinions far from the purpose of the forum.There is no shame in asking with your main account, but you must provide evidence proving that your local board does not obtain enough merits.",

If we remove you from the equation, they will lack merit once again as CryptopreneurBrainboss allocation alone is imho not enough for board of that size. This got me thinking, if you continue to merit their posts on the regular basis, maybe theymos might conclude that they don't need more merit and not approve their member's merit source applications?",
