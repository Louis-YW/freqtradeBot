The best thing to do nah to return the money back to the sender, if person discover say the money way eh receive no come from the matching name as the sender nah to ignore the trade make the person go report am for support or make the person come the chat room come ask why you never release then u go complain give am to provide payment receipt.

So transacting with such account could put your bank account in danger, so for the safety of our account the best way to transact is by using online banking because it keeps your account more safer instead of transacting directly from bank account but however with online banking even if you receive payments from any account is not actually traceable and you could decides if you can transfer from your online bank to your real account and by then it will be much safer instead of using your real bank account on binance were you don't even no whom you are receiving from, if they have committed any fraudulent act on there account or not.",

I had to search for myself to see if there is any news of this nature but to my greatest surprises no Nigerian dailies has it on their platform so how come we Nigerians have no clue about this unfortunate incidence and the bank has not issued a press release n names were mentioned to be the possible culprit just as they usually do whenever they are conducting an investigation. Just as SmartGold has said, how possible can it  be for the hacker to just disburse such an amount of money so fast and the sellers too could not identify who made the payment via their name. How come the bank did not notice this hack onset from when it happened to swing into action. So many questions to be answered here.This further made me look into the news site to confirm the identity of the publisher or writer and I found out that he was a Zimbabwe national and  I was wondering how he got this information without Nigerians knowing what was happening.

You no go fit blame dem sha, dey no fit just block account anyhow dey like. Dem need to follow due process to do dat, that’s why dem even go courts first to get order to freeze the account. If you check am well, you dey right say dem no dey follow up sharply to block dis accounts before dem move out funds and secondly, dem go need to follow due process before dem for block any account. Quote2. Backwardness of our country in terms of blockchain education because no information from Accessbank whether dem contact Binance exchange to see if the USDT dey there so that Binance go freeze am. I no know why dem no contact dem for dis matter yet, abi na because of some kind rules wey government put on top all dis crypto platforms na him make dem no wan loud am. Because if dem meet dem, dem fit just deny d thing and dem no get proof for dat. Na d traders go come dey fall victims of d tin again. Sometimes I feel say since d government neva regulate d use of cryptocurrencies, e be like d thing no go dey possible.QuoteLESSONS LEARNTOne of the bad sides of P2P trades be say you kno no who you dey transact with as the person fit be fraudster, kidnapper, drug trafficker etc. wey dey try to hide funds, but one of the ways we fit avoid this kind type of wahala na: 1. Make we dey look for traders with good reputation and good trading history. 2. Make we no dey carried away by juicy rates, make we dey shine our eyes.Dis matter no be something wey we go blame P2P traders for, dey don’t know where you get your funds from but dey just come to sell their businesses and transact with you. Freezing their accounts is very bad and linking the scammer to dem is not good. As a buyer, na me go look for good trader to buy from and no be d seller go dey look for me wey wan sell. If na d other way round, I go fit say person fit check transaction history of trader wey you wan sell your funds to. Dis matter plenty if na true sha, but as we never hear am from dem or any official news media for naija, we fit discard d news or call am fake to some degree. If dis thing really happen ba, e go dey top of news for both public and private news outlets which we no hear anything about am till today.",
