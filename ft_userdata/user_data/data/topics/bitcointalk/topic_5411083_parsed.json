A private key is a random number from a hugely big interval. The address is based on the private key.Now if you leave a proper wallet software generate that number for you, the chance others will generate the same number is smaller than the chance for winning the lottery many times in a row. So it's pretty safe to say nobody else will have the same address.On the other hand if you pick a nice number like 123456789..... to be your private key, somebody else might easily generate the same wallet and steal your money.PS. Don't use websites generate your wallet, use wallet on your computer, or, better, hardware wallet.PPS. What I was telling was about bitcoin. Eth / metamask stuff may or may no follow the same rules, you can ask in the altcoins area.",

So, if a private key has been generated randomly, it's very very unlikely that it has been generated before. If there's a website which generate private keys that have been generated before, it means that it doesn't generate the private keys randomly and should be never used. You should never use a private key you don't know how it has been generated.You should never use a private key generated online.",

I found it interesting.This is just one of many purposes of this tool website. When you click Generate button random entropy is generated and the human readable representation for storage of this random entropy is shown as the mnemonic words (they basically represent the same).You can also enter mnemonic words (always use in offline mode on a safe computer, e.g. offline booted TAILS) and the entropy those mnemonic words represent is derived. Rules for this and more are in BIP-39.By defined rules and some rounds of hashing the mnemonic words a so called Master Private Key is derived. Subsequent derivation defined by rules according BIP-32 and chosen or given derivation path yields hierarchical deterministic private keys --> public keys --> public addresses of a HD wallet defined by the initial random entropy or the mnemonic words.The derived private keys are unique to the specific wallet whose derivation starts from the entropy or its human friendlier mnemonic words and the wallet's derivation path.

But I'm confused, if i use that address, anyone are able to access my wallet?That's a vanity address. They are generated from a truly random private key, which by chance, outputs an address that to the human eye expresses some desirable patterns.On the other hand, if you deterministically create a private key and derive an address from that, that's where you get into trouble. As you do not have any randomness as 'input', the entropy of your key will be significantly lower and significantly higher chance for someone to find / guess it.",
