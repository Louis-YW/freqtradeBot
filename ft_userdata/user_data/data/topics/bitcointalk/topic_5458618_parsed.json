      "body": "As far as I recall, telegram has a feature where one can report a profile for scam with some proof. Once the report is made, the telegram team will look into it and if proved correct will add a \"scam\" tag alongside the profile, group or channel name. This would deter future members from getting scammed once they see the tag.I suggest you also do them same and report all the profiles involved, though you have not elaborated to use here how you were scammed.",

      "body": "Your attempt to legitimize your scam with this excuse is quite remarkable.First and foremost, there is a fee wallet with the address https://etherscan.io/txsInternal?a=0x51e46fDDF884518d96EbeA18023f7B2d0A82582a, which does not belong to us. Numerous projects send their fees to this particular wallet, including the most recent one that occurred 14 hours ago. Therefore, it is important to clarify that this wallet is not affiliated with us or any project owners. It serves as a fee wallet and is associated with hundreds of tokens due to the token's creation on https://cointool.app/.The email correspondence from CoinsTools confirms the explanation we provided above.We believe we have adequately addressed the accusations of slander against us.Now, let's return to the main topic at hand. The issue lies in the fact that you charged us for our agreement but failed to deliver any meaningful results. You essentially scammed us and then turned around and accused us of being the scammers. We want to emphasize that we have not scammed anyone, and we are prepared to present evidence to support our claim. If you possess any evidence to refute our assertion, we urge you to share it publicly. Alternatively, if you acknowledge that you scammed us, we request that you return the funds you took from us.",

I suggest also including the account id number, you can do this with the help of telegram bots. Just search @userinfobot (I think there are some alternative bots if this one is not active).",
