You do not have to worry if you want something similar to BIP38 encryption, just use passphrase. But if you like the old ways, use https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org zipGenerate the wallet, backup the wallet offline on paper or on steel sheet and delete the wallet which makes it a paper wallet.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 15, 2023, 10:24:31 AMAlso is there any risk using paper wallet apart from keeping the phrase offline? The risk is if you do not generate it properly. If you want to hold only bitcoin and not spending it for a long time, paper wallet is good, your keys are offline, and online attacks won't be possible. But protect your seed phrase. If you add passphrase with it, do not backup seed phrase and passphrase together but differently in different locations.",

Years back paper wallet triumph over everything until hardware wallet came and every advice on the forum now is get a hardware wallet. Which paper wallet generator still functions today? Also is there any risk using paper wallet apart from keeping the phrase offline? Ink and paper functions very well today without the need of any 3rd party program or device like qr generator and printer.I want to remind you that paper wallet isn't the safest option out there because paper can degrade, are susceptible to environmental factors, etc. Imagine, water somehow reaches the paper, guess what? You lost your keys. What if somehow there is fire at your home or in the place where you keep your paper? There is a high chance, believe me. Also, the ink on paper can easily fade away over time. What's the last time you wrote down something on the paper and lost it? No, paper is not a safe option!Better to use hard wallet!",

If you want a better backup, you can buy steel sheet, but you can also backup paper wallet on steel sheet too, like having one back on paper and the other backup on steel sheet.

The issue is that it can not be used more then one time, since the change address will usually not be part of the paper wallet.

I guess we have established that some larger amounts should not be trusted to any hardware wallet or hot desktop/mobile wallet, and that a paper wallet has its own risks when it comes to creating the same, but also storing it. In addition to all the risks involved in creating and keeping such a wallet, many are not even aware of how to actually spend funds from their paper wallet in the correct way - and this can lead to the loss of BTC.Namely, when they want to spend their BTC, users import their private keys into the newly created wallet, make a transaction and delete the wallet without even taking into account the fact that part of the unspent coins goes to a change address that they no longer have access to. A much safer way is to simply sweep private keys in wallet, which sends all BTC to the newly created address, for which you then have a backup in the form of a seed.",

No, paper is not a safe option!Better to use hard wallet!I have written down countless things I didn't want to lose and haven't lost any as yet. Also ink doesn't degrade as quickly as it is touted to be; Get a good ink pen and a note pad, write down what you wish to store and keep it in a secure location where it cannot be easily touched by water or accessed by people you don't want reading it.For a natural disaster, having more than one secure location provides a safe backup as a contingency plan.Quote from: Rikafip on January 15, 2023, 11:17:04 AMWhy would you have to change the address for every transaction when you can simply send bitcoin to the same one?

OP is correct, paper wallets used to be the top choice until hardware wallets came along, and obviously, hardware wallets are the best and a lot more convenient these days. As for the preservation of the seed phrase, each person will have a different way of preserving it, if you keep the seed phrase of the hardware wallet on paper, it will not be possible to avoid the risks as you said. This means it's up to you, don't blame paper wallets in this case.If comparing a custodial wallet with a non-custodial wallet, a non-custodial wallet will be the safest, compared to a hot wallet and a cold wallet, a cold wallet will be the safest.",
