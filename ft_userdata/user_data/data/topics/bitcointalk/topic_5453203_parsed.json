You know what's the difference in crypto than in other markets out there?In different markets, opportunities doesn't come out that often because it isn't that volatile. In crypto market, opportunities come on a weekly basis at least. You missed on PEPE coin? There will be more opportunities out there. You might see another hype coin in the next few weeks that might pump up again. You might see Bitcoin pump up in a few weeks. You might see some altcoins pumping up in the next few weeks. Those are all opportunities for you to gain profit. Meme coin of a lifetime? I guess it's better for you to just focus on DOGE or SHIB if you are just focusing on meme coins then.This is what's good in crypto market. There are lots of opportunities for an investor to gain profit. The problem though is that these \"opportunities\" last for only a few hours at least. and after that, it's gone. Don't overreact like you lost a million dollars on it, and it wasn't FOMO, but a missed opportunity only.",

It is better to name it guilt of missing out because fear of missing out is a term used when you have opportunity to have the things, but because of fear you don't delve into the things and miss them. When I read your statement the scenario is different you missed the opportunity even you knew about the thing and now you feel guilty that why you missed the chance to buy the pepe at right moment. You have really missed a great opportunity by not investing in that useless token because even though it is useless but the pump it got changed lives of many people. I think such chances have always been popping here and there in crypto-world but only few lucky ones have made profit form those rare opportunities. Many people regret even till this day that why they missed the opportunity of buying Shiba Inu it was so cheap, but unfortunately the past is gone and no one can do anything to change it.",

Are you sure you missed a lifetime of meme coins when coins will come every time?Why do you always believe in the missed $PEPE coin because this is part of the manipulation made by the whales, of course many are subject to FOMO due to the price rising too high by thousands of percent after a lot of talk but I don't care how hard the coin meme but don't really believe that in the end, it will be a waste to fall back.",

Always look forward  Was supposed to say the same thing on which this isnt FOMO but rather a missed opportunity which lots had been saying into their minds on what they had missed out which would eventually making out that kind of regret.Yes, its better to move on because there are people who do make out some nice calls and entries on which they do make themselves getting that enourmous amount of profits because of the decisions they had missed. We cant really that avoid on having hesitation because putting up money or investing money into something is never been that simpler. Of course there's really that hesitance and doubts consideringthat it is a meme coin after all which we know that it could neither be sparking out some hype or would really be just simply ignore and die away.We arent that numb on not to see about the reality of those meme coins which doesnt have that actual utility which it cant really be just that so simple for you to have that kind ofdecision making whether you would be buying it or not.",

Maybe if you have done your investigation then perhaps you wouldn't missed it. And let this be a lessons for you, who knows, there could be another meme coin in the future bigger than $pepe itself?So with that, be very active and look for the next meme coins.reported this to be move to Altcoin discussion.",

The fact that you didn't buy it at all would be better then buying it on the top because of the FOMO. But there will be other coins flying high and you will most likely give in to your fomo and buy them near ATH if you are not careful. Don't buy anything in panic or because something has risen a lot. Markets tend to correct and there still are pump and dumps. When you have FOMO, act against it. In fact you might be better off shorting because buying with FOMO most likely get you rekt.",

This is not FOMO, it is probably because of the hype.Here is what I can say, there will always be new opportunities and trends emerging, so it is worth keeping an eye out for other exciting ventures in the future. Don't let this experience discourage you, as there will likely be more chances to participate in exciting projects that you think it is with your interests.

Based on my experience, I've missed also a lot of greater opportunities but then let so be it. I've got still my stash on the brighter side and it's more with Bitcoin and I know that it's on the right path. Forget about these meme coins and you're trying to find a gem in the market. You don't have to be that far just for you to get into this emotion of being FOMO. It might even give you more losses if you start to FOMO for an actual project that you think you're about to miss.",

That's what i called that FOMO but since you were missing it and you don't even think to buy that at the top price and that means if you were not getting FOMO. Im also the same like you.

When you fear that you have out on a trend,  then after jumping in on the train when the price is at ATH it's call (FOMO)/but in your own situation what happens is not FOMO but missing out on hype,  both hypes vs fomo means different things and direct an investor to different directions and results,  but the ultimate goal is to always stay motivated and keep your head up regardless of how many opportunities you missed because it better to miss the hype than to lose to FOMO. You will always have a better opportunity to buy some other good assets,  all that you need is to keep your eyes open and do more extensive research to discover those assets that could yield you the expected results.",
