  "content": "Earlier, everyone was invited to vote in our survey part 1, where a few suggestions of Bitcointalk members in our topic \"List of useful Bitcoin block explorers\" here in \"Beginners & Help\", were voted about, how to improve our table. Unfortunately, for some questions we got a DRAW (equal number of votes for competing suggestions). Solution: we will have a runoff-vote to ask everyone, to vote for your favorite option. He are all questions: Question 1Question 1 is based on our previous question 1 from our old survey: Blockchair is curently rated at 8/10 points in our table. Because Blockchair is a very good explorer, there have been suggestions to increase Blockchair's rating. Should it be increased or is 8/10 an appropriate rating?  At how many points Blockchair should be rated? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 7 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 8 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 9 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 10 points? (suggested by GazetaBitcoin)Question: After our previous survey didn't saw any winner of which rating should be applied to Blockchair, we are having a runoff vote between 8/10 points (where Blockchair is ranked currently) and 9/10 points which got equal votes in our previous survey. At how many points Blockchair should be rated? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 8 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 9 points? We would like to ask all Bitcointalk members how many points Blockchair deserves to have in your opinion.  Question 2After our previous survey we re-arranged our table layout completely. In our new version, specific comments are displayed via hover format, which doesn't work on mobile devices. To be consistent, we have have also archived our old version here, where comments can be seen on mobile devices as well. Question: Should we update the old version of our table as well or should the old version get treated more like an archive and not get any updates? You decide.  Plz, vote @everyone.  We are very happy to receive your votes. You can also leave a comment here or garner support for one of the options.  I'm currently considering to run our poll for 14 days at least.",

      "body": "Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 9 points?I voted for the above option to up the rating point for blockchair explorer to 9. It is one of the best explorers I have used and I have frankly had absolutely no issues with it. Should give it a 10, but that is not an available option and it is best to leave out some room to allow for imorovement.Provide updates for our old table layout, to keep it updated?Definitely do. Mobile users may be less than desktop users but they would still be interested in following the discussion and reading some of the additional comments. It would also cost little to update it along with the newer thread.Can I suggest that the hover option be made a bit more obvious, maybe with a * mark above ratings that has additional comments. Many members may miss it in this current format.- Jay -",

Many members may miss it in this current format.It's a good suggestion.  I've added a remark right behind that column to point it out and make it more obvious: ***You can hover your mouse over each score and a sign will pop up, where you'll see some comments brought up by members suggesting each Block explorer. Hover format for comments was suggested by SFR10 here. See here. I've also linked SFR10's inital suggestion. Many thanks for voting, too.",

      "body": "I don't know about the previous discussion and rating. But I will drop my own rating base on experience from other explorer that I have used. Blockchair gives me the best viewing and searching experience, it even allow me to download individual transaction history (PDF) Another thing from great about the is the part that they usually shows both incoming , pending and confirming transaction other than few explorer which I have used that will just show, total transaction in, total out, available balance always zero for unconfirmed transaction, which is always kind of confusing especially for newbies who can go into panic without seeing their balance reflect with what they are actually expecting.",

(I hope we won't end up having another draw, lol.)Regarding your question from the other topic,Quote from: 1miau on April 08, 2023, 07:34:31 PMWe also need to specify how long our poll will be running. My favorite is 14 days, a good solution we applied already in our previous survey.  I also believe that 14 days represent a relevant amount of time for keeping the poll running.",

Without a link shortener that could track clicks [I do know it's not going to be 100% accurate, but it gets the job done with regard to showing us if there's enough demand or not (BTW, I'm referring to those that don't have any ads)], I have to say keep proving the updates.",

I believe another draw is very unlinkely but in case we have a draw, we can decide to prolong our survey for 1 day? Happy to have your vote (despite you've voted for a different point amount)  .

That was the reason I checked for alternatives some time ago and also came across this voting. I've been using blockchair.com since then and never had a single problem. I like the design and that it offers various cryptocurrencies. Since it is quite a bit better than the others in my opinion, I went for 9 points.",

So far, our gang has 6 members and still growing. But maybe it's a much more plausible explanation that Blockchair just isn't ready yet to receive 9 points? (of course, it's already close to it  ).
