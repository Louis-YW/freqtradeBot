  "content": "I have developed a vanity address generator in Java. The purpose is solely academic.You can find the code here: the code is obsolete and shouldn't be used, therefore I removed it. If anyone wants to see it for some reason, send me a PMThere is a README file, but I will give the instructions here also.Instructions:1. Modify `Main.java` and change the variable `desiredAddressPrefix` to whatever prefix you wish for your bitcoin address. 2. Run `Main.java`3. Once the address is found, the program will generate a `wallet` directory:keys.txt file, which includes the address and the private key in WIF and HEX format.legacyAddress.png QR code for the address.privateKey.png QR code for the private key.I would appreciate it if you could:1. Suggest any code alteration - modification.2. Suggest a better (if any) entropy source than Java's SecureRandom.3. Suggest benchmarking tools.If there are any updates in the future, I will post them on this post, in the section below:Updates:Place for future updates",

I don't find any Android apps that can able to run .java.You are free to try but Playstore only show one app that could run java app called J2ME loader or try Java compiler.Android apps are written in Kotlin, which is like Java but it is not Java. It has its own compiler and everything.But if you use some stock app interface generated by any Kotlin IDE, and then plug this java code inside it, you will get a workable Android app to use, because pretty much everything in Android has to run via a GUI unless you already have a terminal open. That's cumbersome to do.",

As I said, the purpose was purely academic. I don't suggest you use it. I will find benchmarking tools when I find the time. In fact, the performance must be mediocre. I know that. But I wanted to try it. And indeed I managed to create my own address",

How will I compare them?In the case of my keyhunt tool you can select a specific range, so, if in you code you can do the same the idea should select the same range and check how many coincidences it found and how much time it takes.Another way to make these benchmarks is just put them at random ranges and stop them after some 15 minutes or half an hour and compare how many addresses they found, this may not be fair or may be biased because Address prefixes are random and it's not predictable how often they may appear.",
