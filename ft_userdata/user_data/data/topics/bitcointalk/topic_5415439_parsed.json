You should try to put together some evidence that indeed both accounts are connected rather than just listing some telegram accounts... But I did take a look at those wallet address you provided and it seems as if both have made transaction with each other. According to Bscscan 0x06d06C01Aaf0Af1b88824A7bcCaBD0743f8D026A made four transfer into 0x2aD895aE271887DFA2Df4856734b48E9d0B20449 and also 0x2aD895aE271887DFA2Df4856734b48E9d0B20449 made three deposit into  0x06d06C01Aaf0Af1b88824A7bcCaBD0743f8D026A You can check out the transactions here:  1 | 2  |  3 |  4 | 5 | 6 | 7  While according to PolygonScan; 0x06d06C01Aaf0Af1b88824A7bcCaBD0743f8D026A made a single deposit into  0x2aD895aE271887DFA2Df4856734b48E9d0B20449 you can also check it out here: https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xa68ba729005b7c7424a844d9ca6e1b0ad08be716ffc0d74b06fc4bf22b6f8e61But I still doubt if this transaction will be considered as a proof but Op you could try to find out if they've used same telegram account or wallet to register for any campaign in the past. Raselshorif has already been tagged so the probability of him having an alts is high.

If he/she should make any report there his post will get deleted he did the right thing creating a thread but the only problem here is that he made the thread in a wrong board.",

To the extent that the person's Twitter, Discord and Wallet addresses are all revealed in this expose.I hope the admin and moderators in their wisdom would attend to this case wisely and insightfully.",

They'll just create 100 newbie accounts and resume their activities. If you want to report users, it's better to report those that you know or find that are cheating btc paying campaigns. Those are the ones that would be hurt by being tagged.",
