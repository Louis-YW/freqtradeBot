Probably. Seems the prices are going insane now. I guess Cristiano is too busy with the World Cup and don't wanna spare any time on NFT at the moment. After a few big matches, he'll come and see his NFT prices going skyrocketing. That'll be awesome.",

But in the crypto world it is not easy to predict because it depends on many factors.The issue is whether Ronaldo fans will start buying, trading and selling NFT CR7 tokens once his ICO starts.I think, if NFTs depend solely on one's fame or hype, it won't last long.",

      "body": "Partnering with Ronaldo will further boost Binance popularity in the sports world for sure, although they've plied their trade with Lazio and Brasileirao, it would still serve as positive publicity. Ronaldo is already popular, but I feel this is not just business to him, but a means to help him reach out to his fans. Surprisingly, it could gain clout and recognition so much that even with the start of his ICO, they'd still want to trade. Take Dogecoin for instance.",

We'll have to wait until they post some announcements that it's a big hit and success.

They could sell the most limited edition at a high price, and in the future, it will go down in history as a project to have been bought and gone away. I do hope that it continues, but most of those types of projects should have some benefit to them and become inexpensive, and be developed continuously. Maybe being in an official club could make it a thing that could help them be successful in that project. Is there a good resource to read about this?",

Will the CR7 NFTs beome a huge hit ? I think the question is, if NFT will still be hype in the next coming bull run.Because if it is, then for sure, all NFTs ,regardless if it is from CR7 or some some other sport personalities will have a huge jump in price as well, lets say in 2024-2025. But if the whole hype is replaced by a new thing in crypto space, then definitely their NFTs might die as well.So hard to say what the future will bring, we will have to wait and see.",

Will the CR7 NFTs become a huge hit ? It may turn out to be a success maybe, but I don't think it will be a success suddenly like this year or the early quarters of next year. This year 2022 has been not so good for both NFT's and cryptocurrency and since we are already close to the end of the year, it is possible that this bad run spills into some weeks of the new year. It is possible that the binance team has a strategy to make this project a success quickly before it fades out, It has to be a really good strategy because NFT's already look to be loosing the hype.",

We've seen projects before promoted by celebrities and athletes but those projects still did not work as planned simply because not all investors especially in this industry can be easily carried away by popularity of the project. Many investors are putting much work on doing research for projects of interest to gauge if it would be worthy of investing their money with. Most of the time, projects under celebrities' name falls down upon being released in the market especially if its utility is not sustainable.  Unless the team of this project  will make changes with its concept concerning improvements.",

I am sure that CR7 NFTs will achieve great success thanks to the media and sports fans, and the hype will play an important role in that, as the NFTS of football legend Cristiano has had a huge global marketing campaign since the first hours of its launch on Binance, and Binance has exploited this partnership in its favor as where the new users, who are the first 1.5 million users, will get the Cristiano Mystery Box after they register with the RONALDO referral code, you can imagine the masses of football fans who will join Binance and the virtual world in order to participate in Cristiano's NFTs auction through this partnership.",
