Btc may dip further, but the price will never get to zero, at least that is something everybody who has been with bitcoin can say in agreement. There is a possibility for other coins to get to zero, but not bitcoin IMO.",

No, Bitcoin has not had a 51% attack, as far as I'm aware.Comparing the risk and reward ratio, attempting such an attack on Bitcoin would be very difficult to pull of. For one, it has a huge capital requirement to even attempt it, and there's no guarantee that the attacker would actually get any benefit from it.The hashrate is also growing, making it more difficult with time.",

Yes, being volatile is part of the petty sentiments, why? It's gives a designated time for the BULLS and the BEARS  even to NEWBIES that are also interested to HODL btc.P/s: these volatility ain't symetrical because the market doesn't run itself; sometimes, it is based on concurrent repositioning on the world's economy which, we all know as a major catalyst of degradation.IMO, bitcoin has taken more than a decade to raise a formidable and an unfathomable, structural brilliance so I don't even think an eclipse will do much harm.Sandra ❣️",

Instead of seeing bitcoin in zero value, why not expect the highest peak that it could reach in the next possible years. Bitcoin has lived more than a decade and if it will only drop into zero value, then all its struggles will all fall into nothing. However, as long as the demand of the people increases every year, bitcoin will also develop and grow more, that way its value will hardly fall into zero anymore.",

Though this is possible with several shitcoins out there, but I honestly do not think it is possible with Bitcoin.As the price of bitcoin drops, alot of investors are waiting to buy in, and as investors buy in, the price rises, this is why the price of bitcoin can never turn to zero.And also to add, what ever causes the price of bitcoin to go down to zero must be really heavy, and that might mean the end of crypto, for as it is currently, whatever affects bitcoin affects the entire crypto market.",
