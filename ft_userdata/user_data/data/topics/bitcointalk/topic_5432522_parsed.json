In trading, there should be no emotion attached to your every decision and if you are making a lot of losses then probably something is wrong with your strategy, better to adjust it and continue to learn.",

If you are using too much money to trade, try and reduce it and keep looking for better strategies that can effectively help you to have profit while trading.Quote from: Obari on December 31, 2022, 04:24:47 PM~ Do you think people intentionally go into revenge trading or is is just emotional?It is emotion, not intentional.Quote from: Obari on December 31, 2022, 04:24:47 PM~ what will you advise someone making series of losses ?Stop trading for awhile and look for better strategies. The trader should reduce the money he is using to trade. The trader should use low or no leverage, he should discipline himself from emotions by not going beyond his strategies.",

In the case of gambling a gambler will tend to make a win after several losses or in the other hand will like to make more wins after successive win but maylikely to lose their money.In Trading when you lose your trade you don't need to hasten into another trade. You have to re-evaluate your strategy and see how well it is working with the current market condition otherwise you will keep losing.",

In all cases, there is profit and loss in trading, which means that loss is part of the process of profit.Trading revenge and trying to trade in order to please your hormones will lead you to more losses. Don’t get too emotional when you are in trading because the moment you started losing, those emotions will burst out and become uncontrolled. That is why never involve your emotions when trading, although it’s a way quite impossible since we definitely put our feelings and emotions in all that we do. One thing is certain, if you see yourself you are in constant losing, then take a break and then think of new strategies that have higher chances that will work on you. Trading is not just all about profits, so never expect for trading to be always favoring your side.",

So it's not good for someone to be seriously to chase it lost in trading, so i will say that trading is not gambling whereby they most have known the exact thing the want with a strategies, because trading when you make a mistake and you are unable to identify the trading error and you also want so chase your Lost without knowing were the mistake is coming from, so if you continue you will lose for the second time.",

To avoid series of losses and all other problems, we need to leave off the trading after a attaining certain loss which is possible by following pre-determined plans.",

It is similar to gacha gamer behavior where they keep pulling even if they don't have enough pulls left just because they hope they can get some decent units. The motivation is clearly different though. I don't understand why you pull keep making more losses just because you're angry unless you're fine with burning money.Quote from: Obari on December 31, 2022, 04:24:47 PM~ what will you advise someone making series of losses ?Lots of good tips have been posted above. I'd strongly suggest they learn more emotional control at least. It's difficult to suggest trading tips when they don't even bother to learn or manage their emotion when the result is not in line with their hope. For example, the simple tips of using the money you can afford to lose are probably not gonna help them at all.There are many goods emotional intelligence books out there. Even on Youtube, you can find some decent videos. That should be good enough for a start if they don't know a single thing about emotion management.",

This type of trading is often driven by feelings of frustration, anger, or a desire to recoup losses quickly.Revenge trading can be very risky and is generally not a good idea. It is important for traders to remain disciplined and to stick to a well-thought-out trading plan, rather than allowing their emotions to influence their decisions. When traders allow their emotions to guide their trading, they may make impulsive or irrational decisions that can lead to further losses. It is much better to approach trading with a clear, calm mind and to make decisions based on objective analysis and a solid understanding of the market.",
