If you do such claims it would be interesting to know in what time zone you are, since otherwise it doesn't make any sense. Also the other things are true, especially that the price would drop a little bit to the end of the month. For example many mining farms have to pay for their monthly expenses like employee or electricity, so they dump some coins. This system doesn't work however in a strong bullrun.",

The best time for fishing is early in the morning just when you see the sun start rising and then at the end of the day during the dawn. These are the times when the fish are most hungry. Maybe not so coincidentally, these are also the best times for making trades. Get up from the bed early in the morning and buy/sell some bitcoins when you are hungry. (from 6A.M. to 10A.M.)Also from 5 P.M. to 8-9 P.M. works near flawlessly as well.",

Some others might think otherwise - but I feel it is an oversimplification of trying to fit bitcoin into the already existing fiat asset classes.For me the best time to buy bitcoin is when it is in the bear market, that is what newbies should keep in mind.",

I mean even if you know when to buy, you still have to figure out when are you going to sell. Let me decompose your statements for you:1) Ok, you buy in the afternoon, but we're in a bear market. Next month Bitcoin is down 25% from where you bought.2) Same as first.3) This is non-sense. The fact that an asset is traded more during weekdays does not correlate in any shape or form with its increase in price. In other words --> trading activity <> buying activity. See the first 2 points.4) Believe me, money coming from paychecks is nothing compared to the trading activity of institutional investors (of the so-called 'whales' essentially). Even if the fact that people make most of their Bitcoin investments on paydays the impact on the market would be insignificant is what I'm saying.",
