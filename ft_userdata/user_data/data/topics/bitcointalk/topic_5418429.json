For example in another country maybe a president forbid using crypto and mining firms even though he is using crypto to buy or trade. We need more believeer as rishi sunak to extend and allow bitcoin everywhere. And one thing more is you can't even know maybe this president is one of bitcointalk members Xd",

That's funny, but you never can tell..However, having a crypto-friendly Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was a great move and welcome development to the growth and adoption of Bitcoin, because to me there is nobody who coyld speak on behalf of Bitcoin or implement a policy favourable to Bitcoin users than a true believer, of which i'm happy the new young vibrant P.M @ Rishi Sunak is one of them. So let's just watch and see how his administration will be as it's still too early to judge a book by its cover",

Crypto is a great idea if the government wants to adopt it, but I wouldn't be surprised the journey of adoption of crypto especially bitcoin will be hindered by regulation. The UK is a great target for crypto adoption in the future, but we don't know when it will actually become a reality given that in the article they approve regulated financial instruments. That means it is not a fully decentralized bitcoin and according to the article stablecoin is one of the approved crypto.",

On one hand we need some regulation, on the other we're giving people who come from traditional finances freedom to govern our decentralized money.",

We know that Bitcoin is a threat to the existence of the existing financial system, so they are doing everything they can to discredit it. This is not new, just simply follow the money. Governments and banks will never like it (except maybe when they control it), so they will do everything in their power to prevent it from becoming a mainstream currency. This means discrediting Bitcoin and spreading misinformation about it.The only way for Bitcoin to survive is for people like us to keep pushing for its adoption and use, so it becomes mainstream, accepted by everyone and used as a medium of exchange.",

TheThe new Prime Minister's comments about his intentions to make UK a crypto hub is a proof that he is knowledgeable about cryptocurrecies.  But most of these politicians are more concerned about the revenue they can get from the crypto space and thier ability to regulate transactions in cryptocurrecies and not genuine trust on it. There main goal would be on how to centralized these currencies and ensure that people engaging in crypto transactions lose thier privacy. Thier failure to regulate bitcoin would motivate them to embrace other shitcoins and spearhead the anti-bitcoin crusade. But I am a pessimist, therefore I still believe that someday a powerful country would have a leader that would be a true believer of bitcoin and it is possible that Rishi Sunak might be that politician.",

He served as finance minister under former PM Boris Johnson. During this time, he worked to advance initiatives that would encourage the use of digital currencies and integrate them into the British economy. However, and I think this is the most important part, his stance on Bitcoin is still unclear because he is also a long-time proponent of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).
