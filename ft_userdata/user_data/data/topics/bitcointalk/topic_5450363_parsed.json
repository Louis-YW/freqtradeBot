Most of my strategies is about how to risk little and lose little or to gain little, not even martingale that can go wrong at times and lead to big loss.Betting should be fun, when using just little amount of money, not going beyond the budget set for it and if I noticed that I am winning as I am gambling, not that I am losing all the time which can make me suspect something wrong going on. I do not think there are superstitious ways to win casino games.",

Sometimes I will count the reel, how much spins before I will win and how many spins is my lost. And then the next time,  I will used that pattern to maybe increased my bet the next time so that if the pattern continues then I might win big. However, I found out that it's no pattern after all. It could be just coincidence, or just my luck playing with me and my emotions.Quote from: Kakmakr on April 27, 2023, 11:10:48 AMWhat patterns do you see and how much do you believe in it? So in my years of playing slots, I will say that there is no patterns, it is just ourselves trying to find and making that excuses that we are going to win big the next spin because we found a pattern.",

I mean, I'm pretty sure deep down that most people believe that the \"patterns\" they found in gambling are just absolutely random bs that they use to increase their confidence in actually winning. Plus, it also serves as an additional reason to blame when you lose, like oh it's because this tip I got to do x thing while doing y thing was just a fake kind of idea. But anyway, on the topic of patterns, dumb as it is, it's usually a pattern of win streaks/lose streaks for me. It's like I always have that dumb ass mindset that after some random number of losses (which I get from who knows where at the time really) I'd make a comeback, so I keep playing the same game. This only happens on games I really enjoy though, so it's not that bad.",

In fact there aren't patterns in gambling. They are personal beliefs from gamblers who think they can defeat the casino, but don't last long, because sooner or later these gamblers hit a long loss streak.A very common pattern I saw was from a youtuber who played a roulette alike game. He believed he could predict when the white house on the table was going to be hit, so he didn't play on the red and black houses, but only on the single white house for huge multiplier.For a while his method worked and it really seemed he had discovered a pattern. However, I doubt that was going to work forever, because there aren't such patterns in gambling. I didn't follow him anymore to see the end of the story (he was already playing for months), though.",

A lot of things come into play when a bet is made and it has nothing to do with the \"auto bet\" feature. (Client Seed / Server Seed & RNG and RTP ...) I did that tried to do higher bet sizes and lower bet sizes , this is purely from what I learned from the game I did, in fact have different opportunities when using higher stakes, using higher stakes a total of 50 rounds found the multiplier is high on auto spin and when on the lowest size I struggle to get that even with 100 auto/manual spins.I think it's not because the casino is rigged or anything in automatic or manual spins, but manual ones are more effective than what I've done to this day, why is it effective? because in my opinion the longer we play, the greater the chance of winning, manual rotation will take quite a long time to make slot rounds and that provides time delay which makes the chances of winning better to get a win.QuoteWhat patterns do you see and how much do you believe in it? If I'm playing a slot in Starlight Princes or Gates of Olympus when I get a big multiplier like x100 - x500 outside of the free spins, that means I have to play another 20+ minutes at different bet sizes every five manual spins, for me doing that effective in 10 times on that pattern I get 7 wins which is not bad even though it's not the maximum win.",

But actually about that autospin myth: there's a very weird and suspicious court case in Finland where man got 9 months parole sentence on suspected cheating in slot machines \"somehow\".He got video of the machines and suddenly changed his gambling style from autospins to some specific tactic and got 33k profit. Which is pretty high in here as we don't have very low jackpots in physical machines.You have to put this trough web translator, i don't think there's any english news on this:https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/mies-keksi-keinon-huijata-veikkauksen-pelikoneita-pumppasi-kasinolta-33-000-euroa-konsti-on-yha-mysteeri-kaikille/8638254 Quote from: Kakmakr on April 27, 2023, 11:10:48 AMWhat patterns do you see and how much do you believe in it?

Betting some would be fine as long as you can bear losing. No matter what game you engage yourself with, whether cardgame, dice game, sportsbetting and such; winning won't be certain. So choose what would give you enjoyment atleast, 'coz that would make your bets more worthy. What makes gambling bad in the first place is gambler's assumption of getting rich in an instant. This is more likely because of stories wherein players have earned huge reward from playing, without considering how much that player have lost during the 'run'. Everything would be based from luck or one's fate.",

I agree in general. When you play a luck based game, any of the possibilities can happen. People do martingale thinking that it will save them but then they lose 10 times in a row and boom then they need to wager a lot more to save their initial bet. When they lose 11th time, all of their stack will be gone. That's the most famous trap the gamblers fall in. Gambling is all about passing the time in a fun way. It is never about making money When the players forget that simple fact and try to make a living out of gambling, everything falls apart.",

We might believe in myths, mantras, and techniques but the result is usually luck based.

On the contrary there those who don't seem to see the Martingale strategy as one with a very high risk, but actually it is. The strategy is suited for those with big pockets and not for those with quite a bit, as you may have to lose your bets like on 7 rolls with a corresponding increase on stakes in each bets with a  possibility of a win awaiting you on the 8th and if you're someone with a bit of little pocket you may not even survive to a fifth or sixth bet not to talk of reaching 8th to recover your losses.And that's why based on this analogy, I take the Martingale strategy in gambling as a strategy favourable to those with large pocket.QuoteBetting should be fun,Gambling is only fun activity to the rich and wealthy in society, to the other side of the divide it's a different perspective and so it's dependent on where you stand that gambling especially when it involves money should be viewed as a thing of fun or not.",
