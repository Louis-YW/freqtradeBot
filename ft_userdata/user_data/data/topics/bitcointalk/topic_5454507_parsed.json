I don't have any problem with people looking at those as perfect opportunity to gain but never put any exaggerating word like that since you will just create a unrealistic scenario to get rich easily by just investing on that token. I myself will not invest on token which is hyped by random people telling that you will earn huge amount of money with this token since most of that are just another scam.",

Anyone that wish to invest in a coin knows how to do their own research and welcome the risk their about to take in investing is such coins. Analysis like this will only prove as though you’re advertising the coin for your own benefits, maybe you’ve some kind of share in the project. Let those that want to invest do their own research and invest at their own will.",

I have aidoge and its supply is super huge. Even shiba cant reach $1 at the moment how come a newly sprung project can attain that? Its all about hype and utility. As far as I can tell, arbdoge's team is quite good and diligent. They always have update from time to time and even doing a lot of activity outside their platform.  No need to hard shill this, cause you only drag others. If I were you, why not out some good details about it than telling them to fomo in without explainign whats their platform all about.",

I'm not too fond of memes because it's not really my crypto in this space, people keep talking and buying and selling, but remember to be responsible in each of your actions. I have just seen it appear a lot on social media or some communities, and maybe you are also one of their tools to spread the word, or if not, you are also turn yourself to spread these things.",

Anything Under 1$ looking cheap over the few months it could go over 100000x This is not financial advice it's just quick analyse and Im in fully becouse it has one of the biggest growth possibility.I don't think that the coin can get anywhere close to 0.1$ even in 4 years. If you are trying to promote a coin do it in a fair way rather than misleading others about it with such claims. If your own interest is in this coin then you're free to own as many of it as you possibly can but still such coins are risky because if they fail to grab many investors then they could go into dust anytime.If you are investing into it then invest in chunks only because if it goes all the way down then you will regret your decision. Many people invested in LUNC (Terra Luna Classic), in belief that soon within few months they will earn huge amounts with the coin. The influencers even claimed that it could cross 1$ in value in year 2024, but if we check the current value of the coin then it's a confirm thing that the coin won't be able to cross 0.1$ price range in many years because of huge supply.I recommend you to invest what you can afford to lose, and after that even if the coin fails to reach high levels, you won't regret anything. I'm even sure that the coin will definitely cross 10x in few months but only if the FOMO might be successful to grab many users otherwise it won't go that high in value.",

I guess if you are in floating loss right now. Your argument is a non sense thing. Don't you even see what happens with safemoon right now? it's worth nothing. The pump happens only once and it's end now. The same story gonna happen with meme tokens like aidoge and arbdoge as well.

The opportunity that you're saying could be a vain thing for this particular altcoin. Someone who might listen to you could potentially lose a lot of money.",
