There are many websites that documented many people saying that Bitcoin is dead/a scam, and then a few months later they say the opposite.It is not only JP Morgan, just take a look at the news. From the recent FTX collapse, the bankruptcy of various crypto lenders, etc you will easily find who says what and whether they are being a hypocrite or not. They just want money from retails, and there are tons of ways they can do that, including spewing bullshit on a TV or newspaper every day.",

People speak based on their personal interest. When bitcoin's value is pumping talking about it going to the moon is going to attract more attention, and when the value is a bit stuck, preaching the fud gospel would attract more attention so they say that.

I believe he has a very good reason to be sceptical as a banker, and as you mentioned, he was one of the supporters of the coin before he changed his mind. Do you know why he changed his mind? And as a banker, he has every reason to think differently about decentralized Bitcoin. That's why you should not lose respect for him. As for the maximum supply, I know that it would not change, the moment it changes is the moment that people would begin to lose so much trust in the coin.",

Morgan clearly does not understand bitcoin completely, and his concerns about the issue of bitcoin emission are completely absurd, confirming his unwillingness to learn about the subject. Many people who deny bitcoin, and generally deny anything, try to be consistent; it takes time for their views to change, but this should not be a problem for bitcoin itself. JP Morgan may also be guided by manipulation tactics, which we sometimes see from public figures calling Bitcoin a scam. It can be assumed that JP Morgan may also be its buyer and is only trying to influence the price, assuming that his opinion is important to people. Should people listen to the opinions of amateurs?",

You don't have to be emotional about his personal opinion; not everyone agrees with the ideology behind bitcoin, so there will always be those who oppose it, believing they are saving the world. BTW, there are bitcoiners who do not agree with the Gold ideology and are doing exactly what JP Morgan is doing online. You may not understand why he believes bitcoin is a scam, and he may not understand why you believe Bitcoin is freedom, so you do not have to dislike someone because of his beliefs.Furthermore, if total supply is suddenly increased, fear, uncertainty, and doubts will begin to flow in everyone's minds, and the price will suffer as a result.. How would you react if you woke up to find a top-up in your wallet? Wouldn't you panic and suspect that the system has a flaw? and begin to look for alternatives?
