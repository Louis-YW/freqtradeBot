  "content": "I accidentally see a Bitcoin address from a member here, and see there is a big difference in the number of characters. I see there are 42 and 62 characters. I don't want to show that address, but I will give an example:1. bc1qtt02jvsppq0dspclxw5u68zpuupjmy60q2jnjz (42 characters)2. bc1qtxh2pn4ea5yhevpdyaevtrl04d3le9yu2p4z60c0fqsfyc0fwswsscza7x (62 characters)So, if you take a glance, do you know the type of wallet?...here the answer:No.1 is the address which type of standard wallet where I got it from Electrum wallet, andNo.2 is the address which type Multi-signature wallet which I got it from Electrum wallet also.So, is longer safer?it depends on you, but it should be safer because Multi-signature wallet needs more 1 cosigner seed or key to access the wallet. The hacker wouldn't be able to access it if they only have 1 key and seed where you and other people keep it in different places.correct me if i wrong",

Exactly I think OP should have just said a multi sig wallet is more secure than a standard or single sig wallet. But when it is about address, the length isn’t a thing of concern in terms of security. The only time an address becomes an issue is the fact that a Native Segwit address(P2WPKH) (an address starting with bc1q) is more preferred to the Legacy address P2PKH and P2SH during transaction because it saves more than then and will have a less transaction fee cost (at least 16% less or more). And this is actually the main reason behind the disparity of the addresses, the security of a wallet depends on the private and other factors attached like 2FA, and that is why a multi sig wallet is better than a single sig because it has two or more private key or signature needed to sign a transaction. So even if an hacker or thief gets hold of one the funds wouldn’t be moved without the rest",

Like the characters do not matter only thing that matter is the level of security and encryption and of course if you wallet address contains more character then it means it has increased level of encryption. Which means it would need more keys to decrypt and encrypt then a simpler wallet address. I am not an expert but according to my simple knowledge about Data encryption and decryption. I suggested my answer.",

The hacker wouldn't be able to access it if they only have 1 key and seed where you and other people keep it in different places.They are just addresses which you can give to anyone to transfer money to your you. No address is safer than another. But between P2WPKH and P2WSH wallet, that which one is safer, definitely P2WSH which is multisig is safer.

The only thing is when setting up an individual multi sig, if a single device is used to set up the whole thing or used to store all keys ( two or more keys are store in the same place) then it defeats the entire purpose of a multi sig. even if only you owns the multi sig wallet, use multiple devices so that even if one is compromised you don’t expose more than one seed or key",

Although in practice since majority of wallets are deterministic and produce the same type of address, it can also indicate their wallet type.QuoteSo, is longer safer?Yes and no. Multi-sig address doesn't become safe just because it uses more than one key, it can become safe if the keys are created and kept separately on safe airgap systems.Additionally you should know that P2WPKH (a single sig address) is safe and multi-sig is adding another layer of security on top and it is used for a different purpose. In other words it is not about being safeer but about offering a different utility.And finally apart from address length, there are other characteristics that define the type of the address. Two of which are the starting characters (bc1 vs 1 vs 3) and in case of SegWit addresses the first character right after the separator \"1\" which indicates the version of the witness program used in the address. In these cases it is \"q\" so it is version 0.",

P2WPKH addresses are 42 characters; P2WSH addresses are 62 characters. While P2WSH can indeed be multi-sig addresses, they are not exclusively multi-sig addresses and could also be any other locking script.Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on July 13, 2023, 12:18:25 AMSo, is longer safer?No. Multi-sig is safer than single-sig against some attacks (provided you set it up properly), but longer addresses are not necessarily safer than shorter addresses, since as I explained above the longer addresses could have any locking script, even very insecure ones.Taproot addresses are all 62 characters, regardless of whether they are key path or script path, single sig or multi-sig.",

That function of a wallet where only you can access the key is useless.There are non-custodial schemes to use 2FA as well, which has to do with MultiSig. One of the keys can be held with a third-party which only signs the transaction when the 2FA is correct. However, the third-party still requires the participation of the user when using the funds due to the MultiSig setup. As such, this becomes a scheme whereby the third-party has no sole control over the coins.",
