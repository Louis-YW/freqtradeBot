      "body": "This is a good information by OP since the exchange is a sincere one for announcing to their users and merchants to withdraw their funds from their exchange within a given period of time. This are one of the reasons why we should leave our funds in an exchange but only the funds that you can avoid to lose. Exchanges nowadays are facing difficulties and crashing out of the cryto market. This is good news to those people who have funds in lazerpay to use this opportunity to withdraw their funds to avoid regrets later.",

I really would want to know the reasons to the sudden foldings of these private exchanges and I also felt the impact of the closure of paxful.com because they were one of my favorites exchanges because of its simplicity but the strict KYC should be one of the reasons they went out of business and there is a sister app of paxful which is noones by name and it's more of a copy and paste but more colourful than paxful itself.",

We don't sell, buy, or trade crypto. We are a crypto payments gateway which means you can receive payments from your clients and withdraw them to your local currency.You can also send out these stablecoins to your preferred payout wallet address.Quote from: Obari on April 14, 2023, 11:33:12 PMI really would want to know the reasons to the sudden foldings of these private exchanges You can read the reason from the Twitter link: https://twitter.com/njokuScript/status/1646531643371585546?t=XMULGkOrX7GpvSpfa2r5Sg&s=19It is because of the the company is unable to successfully raise fund needed for the growth of the company.

It came into limelight in 2021 and promises to make transactions between fiat to crypto seamless. According to their official statement by the CEO, the reason for their shotting down is the inability to raise funds to kickstart the project.",

Same as me also this is the first time i am hearing such a company name, btw hey this is cryptocurrency market so we have tons of companies offering one service or the other, Lazerpay may be one of that unpopular crypto service providers that have run out of an idea to keep the company going, but also we must know that some of those companies close for quite a few similar reasons.Such as the lack of liquidity to continue their operations or a regular policy that has affected their company's existence, we all know how wide the Nigeria market is to start-ups so to survive in this market, a project will have to build and improve on several things that will put them ahead pf competirors.",

This is the first time I'm hearing about this fintech Lazerpay but according to what I read they said it started by cutting off its work forced and also rejected the offer of an existing investor, although the offer wasn't favourable to Lazerpay.

I think waiten really be the problem with young startups in Africa and Nigeria in particular na the inability to face market challenges and the lack of prior actions to make their fit fem on the business ground before wanting to live their dream life, some of them a leave lavish lifestyle instead of continually working to improve their platforms to meet current and future demands. For Lazerpay to have started with an initial capital of $200,000 here in Nigeria and the company already folded up after 2 year shows how unprepared and mismanaged the core team have been during this period of their operation in the Nigeria e-commerce sector, for the fact that the company accept cryptocurrency for their services should have been the primary reason why the company should have been more successful even if they're not operating a cryptocurrency exchange. The CEO have a lot of explanation to do and if the proper audit of the company account is done there could be some possible indictment against the company by investors.",
