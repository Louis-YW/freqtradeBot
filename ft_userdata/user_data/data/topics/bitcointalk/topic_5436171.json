  "content": "Issue: I am trying to access funds I had stored in a legacy Coinbase Vault 2/3 multisig wallet using the Coinbase multisig recovery tool (https://coinbase.github.io/multisig-tool/) . I have all of the necessary information to access the wallet, including the Coinbase xpubkey, the Shared xpubkey and the User xpubkey. Additionally, I have both the User seed and the Shared seed (encrypted) including the password.However, I am encountering an issue with the recovery tool whereby the Vault wallet balance is not displaying upon entering in the xpubkeys in Step 1. Upon further research, it appears that there is an issue with the recovery tool referencing a Bitpay API endpoint that is no longer active. As such, the Coinbase multisig recovery tool is no longer functional. For reference, see the Reddit post and Bitcointalk forum post I'm referring to. Note, that I am experiencing the same issue described in the Reddit post (i.e. I have all of the necessary information to access the vault wallet).1. https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/ndvhom/coinbase_multisig_vault_recovery_tool_wtf/2. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5316286.0Therefore, my question is, what are some other alternative methods to access the funds in my legacy Coinbase Vault 2/3 multisig wallet? Note, that the options should be prioritized in terms of technical complexity, with less technical methods preferred.Thanks",

To your second question, the user seed begins with the character \"L\" and it is 52 characters long.Great. I think this should be relative straightforward then, although since I've never used Coinbase vaults myself I can't confirm for certain.Your key which starts with \"L\" and is 52 characters long is a compressed private key in the wallet import format (WIF). Your encrypted shared seed which begins with 6P is an encrypted private key which uses the BIP38 standard. All BIP38 encrypted keys start with 6P. When you decrypt this with your password, it should (hopefully) provide you with a second key which mirrors your other one - starting with \"L\" and 52 characters long.The combination of these two private keys alongside the third Coinbase public key should be enough to recover your wallet. We might hit a stumbling block regarding individual addresses or derivation paths, but we can cross that bridge when we get to it.Next question: What format is the Coinbase public key in? Does it start with something like \"xpub\" or does it start with \"02\", \"03\", or \"04\"?For the next steps, you are going to need to start importing these keys in to a wallet or other software.

You can do what you have to do online and then that machine never has to see the internet ever again. A live CD will work fine.

I am guessing this is a simple typo. From the source you quoted, it's clear that you need to be online when importing public keys because the software needs to check if there are still any coins in the vault hiding behind those keys. But once that is done, you can apparently take the system offline while working with private keys and transaction signing.",

The code that Andrew Chow has given there is in direct response to the user wanting to derive the individual private keys at index 14. You probably don't want individual keys like this and instead just want the master private keys which will let you recreate the entire vault alongside your already known master public keys.So yes, change USER_SEED and USER_PUB to your own values. You can then run the code as is, but it will output an extended private key at index 14 and a WIF key that you don't want. Make sure you use the keys it will give you entitled \"Master Private Key corresponding to seed\" and \"Master Public Key corresponding to seed\". Alternatively, just miss out the bottom two lines (print \"Extended Private... and print \"WIF format...).Quote from: DaveF on January 26, 2023, 11:15:53 PMNot really from what they say in the readmeAhh well spotted. Still a risk if you simply turn off your internet on your main OS for a short period though. OP should use a live OS instead, as you say.",

You can use either of these to approve a withdrawal from your multisig vault.\"Can anyone direct me to how I can create a withdrawal from the multisig vault in Coinbase? If not in Coinbase, how can I do this successfully with third-party software?I have my 3 public keys, shared seed, user seed, and vault password.
