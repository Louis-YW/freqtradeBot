It doesn't seem to be true at all. As long as FUD was not real and market will be eventually recover but once FUD becomes real then market gets hurting so hard. Only assets that didn't have direct affiliation with the thing that got FUD would eventually recover from the bottom.Quote from: libert19 on November 10, 2022, 09:48:09 PMIn such times, capital can be handy as such opportunities are like finding gold on street.

We already have a clue of what's waiting ahead and we have to be ready when that's seen.I honestly thought that FUD won't affect the market anymore because in the past, it didn't work or it's just because we went through the bull run and those didn't work.But this time, most of these FUD is really something else and they're bigger than before and that's why it's moving everyone even the ones who's been staying long in the market.",

Great things will come ahead with it since those big institutions soon will catch those knife falling so we need to prepare so that we can ride the accumulation stage. If we miss this golden opportunity to buy while market is so cheap then provably we will regret for another time again. This crashes just been fueled up by manipulators so we need to be calm so that we can think about our next move to prepare on recovery stage.",

If a FUD is successfully executed, it can trigger the domino effect and will result in continuous bearish performance.No choice but to try to withstand it no matter what.

Crashes are more often opportunities for those that see that the asset could still grow back, and that the crash was a result simply of panic. The underlying value of the asset is still there. Both those who lost and those who haven't both have the opportunity to ride on it, as long as said asset can still actually grow back.",

Two messages from CZ which I think are very relevant and current situation1: Never use a token you created as collateral.2: Don't borrow if you run a crypto business. Don't use capital \"efficiently\". Have a large reserve.SourceThe point is don't borrow or pawn anything just to buy coins that we don't know at all what will happen both in the long and short periods, using idle money is enough",

There are crashes which in the past have been caused by FUD and it is true that once the community saw there was nothing behind the FUD then there was a quick recovery.However we cannot deny there are crashes as well in which either bitcoin became overvalued and a crash became imminent or a massive event happened and then the price crashed, a few examples of this are the the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, the pandemic, the collapse of Luna and now the liquidity issues of the FTX exchange.",

Right, scenarios like the currently one are good for new investors and investors in general who still have capital to invest in cryptocurrency. It's not everyday we have bitcoin pricing 17,000$ and it's likely we aren't going to see bitcoin on this price range anymore in some years, so it's definitely a good moment to start holding crypto. However, since these are uncertain times, it's better to invest in cryptos which we know their potential by checking their history. There are too many alternatives disponible, what makes investors confused about where to put their money, therefore they should stick with what has already proved to work, that is: bitcoin investment.",

In such times, capital can be handy as such opportunities are like finding gold on street. During market crash, I limit my capital to invest. Some investors especially bigger ones, would go all out during down times because that is indeed a good time to invest edpecially if you have the money to invest and somehow 'forget' your money without being anxious about it, you'll just let it \"sleep\" in your wallet. Given that I have limited resources, I plan any amount that I will invest in order to be more precised with my investment and ofcourse to generate profit. Also factors such as circumstances would matter. It  could either limit the amount you can afford losing in an investment or boost you to go all out. Unfortunately we have different circumstances. FUD or not, if you are lacking resources you would be hesistant with your actions for sure.",

FUD is more prominent since most of the whales in this time want to continue the bear market given that they will re-enter the market and reinvest the profits they gained during the bull market. FOMOing on this kind of market scenario will be inefficient since most of the people are thinking negative in cryptocurrency after they lost money on the start of bear market. I'm doing DCA today and at the same time I'm also trying to capitalize the sharp dips and big FUD events in crypto just like what happened this week between CZ and FTX.",

In general i agree that a overall bear market or a sharp drop in prices like we are experiencing it now is a good opportunity to invest into projects that are usually already to expensive, at least for my standards. By that i mean projects like Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos and so on, projects that are already big and established. The big problem is that we just can not know yet if we are already at the bottom or if we are going down another 20% or even more from here on. I still think though that if you invest into good projects now, then this should definitely be a profitable move in the longterm, if you are holding the coins long enough.",

I’ve been involved a long time, tgis is my third bear market. The first bull market I sold nothing & suffice to say, really regretted it during the long bear of 2014-15. I didn’t make the same mistake again.It’s really quite simple, buy at times like we are currently witnessing & hold until the bull market. You have to be patient sure but it’s fool proof. This doesn’t extend to alts as lots of them are very unreliable & centralised which leads to untrustworthy devs, ceo’s or whatever rugging people.",
