  "content": "Becoming your own bank wouldn't have been possible, until Satoshi Nakamoto can up with a brilliant idea. Third party interference has been a major issue affecting those who are not part of the governmental system, making them feel almost less important especially when it comes to accessing their own deposits.Been your own banks literally gives you the same authority that financial institutions (banks) posses, such as:1. Sending money to anyone around the world with out intercountry restrictions.2. Sending any amount unlike banks that gives limit3. Acting as a third party in approving your own transactions, etc.The volatile nature of this form of money makes it a suitable investment option for those that believes in it. Interestingly, price increase and price decrease are both different opportunities that favors it's users. When the price goes up, those in possession makes  decent profit for themselves depending on how much they bought and how many they've acquired. When the price drops, people sees it  as an opportunity to accumulate more. I would say that Bitcoin is indeed a marvelous piece of art.Is there anything more interesting than becoming your own bank, approving your own transactions and also enjoying both the positive and the negative price aspect of the currency ?. What more can be magical than this ?.",

Alot of person has decided to adobt Bitcoin as a store of value, because of the freedom it give. Just as you've stated it has help make cross border transactions possible and with ease.  Banks on the other hand has lots of processing to complete for one to send money across his countries border. But if we look at it from what you've said, being your own bank. It no longer follows that way anymore because today, we now have centralized bodies that helps other keep their funds. Similar to the banks. So the idea is that what ever freedom you've choose to get using Bitcoin depends on how you've decided to store it.",

The discovery is purely coincidental and had we not discovered this we wouldn't even think of bitcoin as a \"bank for the people\". I would agree with you, albeit perhaps not quite as aggressively.OP probably does not mean to throw dirt on the image of Bitcoin but rather he seeks to address the meme of Bitcoin being \"magic internet money\". We have all heard it and seen it. And we had a few laughs. But ultimately, there are people who misunderstood Bitcoin because of that meme. That hurts the overall adoption of Bitcoin and slows down value progress. (I say slow down because a rising value is inevitable.)Bitcoin needs to be taken more seriously and much more professionally. It really helps Bitcoin's appeal towards investors and strengthens Bitcoin.",

The usual advice is getting your own wallet, cross checking before making an transactions, using the right exchanges to buy or sell, trade, protecting your device with additional protection aside your private key like 2FA factor and being security conscious.",

      "body": "It's not fair to call yourself a bank because we aren't doing those shady things that most of the banks have been doing with their account holders. Satoshi introduced Bitcoin because he really didn't like the traditional banking system which was controlled by a few people. The banks have been controlling us and our money for a long time and now after the introduction of Bitcoin we have got an option which isn't controlled by anyone. But still unfortunately we will have to rely on banks in order to purchase Bitcoin and that's a bitter truth.The volatility of Bitcoin is very high and you're right that because of its volatility investors and traders can make a lot of profit out of it. Most of the investors usually don't care much about the volatility of Bitcoin because they mainly buy it and hold it for decades and we call those investors as Hodlers. A few investors want to earn a lot of profits within 2-5 years and those investors usually accumulate Bitcoin during bear market and sell it during bull market. Ah, another point I would let you know is that you can't approve your own Bitcoin transactions. The miners are the ones who approve those transactions by adding those in the next blocks. If you had that power then you maybe able to call yourself as a magician but my friend the miners are doing the thing for us. Well, still I must say that you have shared some good information about Bitcoin and I recommend you to learn more about it by regularly visiting this forum and reading the posts of the reputed members.",

To protect our hard-earned money and also provide a good opportunity for us as users and believers in Bitcoin. And because of this matter, we are very thankful to Satoshi for so many reasons for providing these solutions in terms of financial problems.",

They want them to work smoothly, without any problems, without any extra effort, without risks. Being your own bank is not some fun activity, it's quite stressful and quite demanding. Most people have zero clue about cybersecurity and cryptography, they at best google some advice on the Internet, which will often be quite poor if they don't put effort in their research.",

Anything leaked on the internet is not safe anymore. Coinbase admits that their KYC data collector company sold users' data on the darknet for $1 each. So, we don't know if we are safe on any platform.Banks are one hand on the government. They will give your information to the authorities whenever they ask. No, it is recommended not to use banks or cards to transact your cryptocurrency. But, who cares?",

I concur that there are numerous advantages to the presence of Bitcoin.However, I'm not quite ready to part ways with some of the services offered by conventional banks at this point. Yes, BTC is a digital currency, but I can't yet use it directly for all my needs.
