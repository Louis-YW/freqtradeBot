All you will be looking for is to make profit in a legit way if you think you can. Quote from: Despairo on August 10, 2022, 09:30:49 AMI still see XRP, BCH and other shitcoins were listed on Binance, they're not removing the whole shitcoins yet.It depends on what you call this type of coin, they have high marketcap and I can not call them shit coins. In coin listing, Binance is better than many other exchanges.Quote from: Yawa2020 on August 10, 2022, 09:31:33 AMThis is not new to anyone who's involved into crypto.

He sometimes make a series of Tweet like this when there’s an issue that he wants to address. Attacking his business exchange just because he stated the truth about crypto is nonsense argument. Even Bitcoin has high volatility so how can you single out what’s the best token only without judging base on your own preferences. CZ has there own requirements on listing there tokens and we don’t have a say on what kind of tokens they are listing.",

Oh no! Impossible!Mr. CZ or should I say Sir CZ is just a good guy who from the early stages of his involvement in crypto helped the community by faking volumes, and showed the world how crypto and regulations go hand in hand by jumping from one country to another, helped bitcoin so much by charging 10x times more for BTC withdrawals compared to his own tokens, showed the world true cryptocurrencies must be decentralized with his complete centralized network and of course, he did so much for bitcoin development suggest that a rollback should be done on BTC network cause they've lost money.No, CZ is the nicest guy in the universe, he is doing so much for crypto and bitcoin and nothing, absolutely nothing for himself poor guy.Does he have a donation address?",

He is saying a cautious message but unfortunately, many real OG would find this as wash statement since we all knew that this is his business afterall. Naturally he will say things such as dyor due to volatility to avoid being bash by public. But we can sense how his business works. Take a look on projects that arent creating much volume, see them get delisted after confirmation of such weakness.",

If I was told to fill in I would answer the high profit. I think it's only natural that he has understood the risks regarding crypto. As an owner of Binance it is also an education for newcomers. I didn't catch the strangeness in his tweet. It is indeed crypto as it is. So far I've only looked at him giving very little education and questions to see what a lot of people think. Bad crypto? Yes maybe, but I think Binance has looked at researching in terms of profitability and credibility. All the listed cryptos certainly have their drawbacks and advantages. They have certainly made rules for the tokens or coins that are there. Otherwise it will worsen the Binance name.",

But out of the lots of shitty coins that we do have in the market today it do really make out at least some exclusion which they choses up on projects which they do seem to be worth and once these projects didnt really get that much liquidity or volume then it would be just normal that they would really be delisting it and so forth.There's no such thing about perfect selection because not everyproject that they do chose and select would end up on being top of the market but somewhat project owners do really get that opportunity on being listed in one of the known and biggest cryptoplatform.Doesnt matter on what type or kind of project it would be and since this is business then its normal that they would really be having these listings for added up volumeand liquidity.",
