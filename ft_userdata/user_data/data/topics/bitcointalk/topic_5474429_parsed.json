  "content": "I honestly do not know if we've had a discussion like this before on this board, but this is based on my personal experience while playing on L0tt0.com last night, I was just so close to hitting a x1000 while I was playing pick six game, which would have multiplied my initial bet amount by 1000 times.But unfortunately, I ended up with a mere x10 because the numbers didn't align well.Here is the shot below.As you guys can see on the shot, I placed a bet on 490082, and the system played 480088, and according to the information in the shot below..If my second number, which is 9, was also the same number the system played, it means that five of my numbers out of six, would have played and I would have made x1000, which Is the second to the highest jackpot being x2500.It was a very close one for me, and I did spend more than 20 minutes staring at the outcome of this game, and wondering why just one single number had to spoil what would have been a jackpot win for men, and I did x10, instead of x1000  .Lets discuss guys, how close have you ever been to winning a big about of money, a jackpot, maybe in sports betting or lotto, or any other game that has to do with numbers, online or offline, how close have you ever been to winning a big amount, and what was it that spoilt the win for you.?",

Every time I think about it, I just laugh at it, if it's for you, you're going to hit it, maybe in the future I'll hit the jackpot but from now on I will always stick to the number I think of, or better get another ticket where all your original is included, so you'll have no regret later.",

I bet your emotions were all over the place.  I hate when that happens in games, like when everything lines up just right but then fate pulls the rug out from under you at the last second.  Sucks and  big wins in gambling seem to come down to sheer luck and perfect timing.  I've had some close calls playing slots too but never on that kind of scale.  The stars really have to align to hit a jackpot.  I'm too skeptical about lotto games to play them much because the odds are so astronomically against you.  But hey, someone's gotta win eventually right? Maybe next time that x1000 multiplier will hit for you! You can't win if you dont play.",

The Mega jackpot prize is worth $576,727. The winning numbers that day is my families combination number since then and we always use those number when we have a time on buying lotto ticket.",

I could just dream about it at least hitting almost is a big factor to say that we are not unlucky for this and maybe the time has come to hit the jackpot.

      "body": "That must have been a rollercoaster of emotions. it's tough when you come so close to a big win, only to have it slip through your fingers because of one number. I can imagine the excitement and frustration that comes with being just a hair's breadth away from a life-changing win. It's those moments that keep us coming back, isn't it? The thrill of the possibility. Anyway, here's to hoping that your next round brings you the jackpot you've been eyeing. Sometimes it's the near-misses that make the eventual win all the more sweet. Best of luck in your future games!In my various experiences with different types of gambling, whether online or offline, in provably fair games like dice, I thought and hoped that I could recover the losses and win big before my session ends or before my bankroll is depleted. Unfortunately, luck did not favor me, even though my bankroll was somewhat significant for me, considering that I rarely have such a large bankroll. As for scratch cards, there were moments when I thought I would hit the jackpot with the remaining scratches, but it turned out not to be the case. Fortunately, I didn't have high expectations.",

I win some small amount but it can't cover up my losses on lottery but still decided to bet since who knows right? One of these days we are the one who can spot the jackpot and became a instant millionaire. Although its far to happen but since we are consistent to place some bets while the jackpot price became more bigger and bigger then there's so slim hope that we can win that prize.I don't have any significant number but next time maybe will bring some numbers that provably used for long time since I think if you use that numbers for long time then there's a chance that you can win some amount on lottery. Let see what will happen if luck will came then this will be good to us.",

So, you won't even feel that you really hit x1000 after that.That same way happens over and over again sometimes I am near losing almost x1000 before I get that kind of multi-win. Never had that one chance where I would receive that multi-win in an early 100 bets or so. So, I cannot say I am close enough to that jackpot that I wanted for a long time because I never had it as early as possible for me to get out and withdraw the money. Most of the time it will take hours and with small bets it sometimes gets tiring to wait for it.",

All the games on my site are instant play... It's not like a lottery, more like scratch off tickets and slots.With that said, you pick 6 numbers or you can randomize it. You can bet up to 5 rows (each with 6 numbers) on each game. The winning 6 digit number (provably fair) is matched against the numbers you played. Matches are seen on the pay table (scroll down, middle tab)Pick SixHere is my latest big win!!! (and yes... I play on my own site )",

I'm also confused about how to guess the correct number. If I may ask, what is the minimum bet to play lottery? Maybe if we play with small bets we can guess the lottery more so the chance of winning x1000 is biggerThe minimum is $0.1 cents, but this depends on which game you are playing, like for example, if you are playing pick six, there is always an option of choosing up to five rows, where you can pick six numbers for each row, minimum bet for each of those rows is $0.1 cents, you can increase it to as high as $5 if you want.Another example is, if you are playing quick pick games, you have the option of choosing any number from 00 to 49, you can choose as many numbers as you want, but minimum bet for each number you choose is $0.1 cents, but again, you can increase this to as high as $5 if you want.I hope the explanation is understandable as possible, incase you are still lost, feel free to ask.",

It is good when we observe ourselves and see where we are good in so that we can make better improvements. If you know you are not good in gambling or a particular type of betting or games, it will better we switch to other games that would aid our winnings. Just like we know that there are many gamblers that prefer to bet on sport books than betting on Casino games. When we know where we are good and the kind of games we normally get luck, it is good when we focus on what works for us than running from one bet to the other.",
