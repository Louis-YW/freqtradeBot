  "content": "Spreading bitcoin awareness or teaching people about bitcoin is the best way for rapid adoption of bitcoin. Some forum members try to force their kids,friends and relative to learn bitcoin which shouldn't be so. Learning of bitcoin should be based on interest and not by force. If you try to teach someone about bitcoin and that person is not showing any interest, it is better that you forget about it,and try to talk to someone else who will be interested on it. Remember, no matter the effort that you put in,to teach someone who is skeptical to accept new ideas or that person feels that he is a professor or knows more than you in other aspect of life,or if he is even richer than you,will end up being a wasted effort. This can discourage you to stop spreading bitcoin awareness, due to the negative responds that you will get from them.Another reason why you don't have to force people into learning bitcoin or investing in bitcoin is that,if you force them, it will look as if bitcoin is a scam because, you are over doing it and they will be reluctant. Lastly, if you want to teach or introduce bitcoin to someone, make sure that you tell him more of the risky side and don't just tell him about the benefits,so that it will be the person choice to invest in bitcoin or not. If you only tell the person about the positive side and the person gets excited and believes that bitcoin has  little or no risk,or the person thinks that bitcoin is a get rich project from your explanations. If the person invests and the market moves downward or in opposite direction away from the investor mindset,he will the discourage and might call you a scammer because you failed to explain the risks of bitcoin investment to him. One should also take note that bitcoin is a very risky investment and needs proper knowledge and understanding for a newbie to believe in it.   It is how we explain bitcoin to people that will make them decided whether to invest or not. I think that the best way one can convince someone on investing in bitcoin is when you live by example,i.e when you have invested into bitcoin and you also have what to show for it. Some newbies don't have any bitcoin investment but they are teaching people about investing into bitcoin, how will they be able to convince the person that they are talking to. Remember that knowing the theory and carrying out the practical will help you to have a proper knowledge on how to spread bitcoin awareness the right way,i.e you have the knowledge that it is long term investment that is more profitable and you have your bitcoin investment which you are holding for long,so that you can bring in more people into the bitcoin community.Let's discuss",

This thread also contains the same context as of yours but he is more focused on childs and you are most focused on overall generations. The point is, yes, we should not force anyone to learn it as, you are totally right, when your tell someone only the green gardens and positive side of something, some of them become skeptical and they begin to thought that you are trying to lure them into this scam. But if you just change your method of teaching then it will become like no i am not luring you i am justing giving you more options to make your life a little better. But i do not agree with your title (haha) as btc is a do or die thing (just kidding).",

The idea is why parents, guardians of whom understand the importance of a decentralized system and have been able to make living or earn a living from it, teach it. There were talks of introducing the crypto topic in schools and places of worship and gatherings. With time and more assurance from the bodies who are responsible for such technology operation , we would see better adoption by governments and new campaigns launching to spread the knowledge everywhere. No one is forcing anyone to learn how to use it, how to earn from it. It depends on interest and willingness to take risks per individual.",

I don't think anyone will force people around us to learn anything about Bitcoin. it will not be efficient. you certainly don't want to create a class for learning Bitcoin when those you teach have no interest in learning it.but if in a discussion, they ask you first. and you share information to answer questions. learning will occur naturally. The information conveyed will be more effective. whether they will be in on their first Bitcoin adoption or not. all leave it to their interests.Learning is not part of business marketing. it might be different if the learning is done by part of the marketing exchange platform.",

And this us something that's even risky and uncertain, who dares force anyone to buy Bitcoin? This is a big fat lie OP, keep fooling people with your useless claim because I have tried to prove why Bitcoin is better for a few people before and they turned me down, I never try to talk about it ever again, do you think it's cool to get turned down when you are trying to change the lives of many people? It's not a do or die, it's easier to avoid telling people about Bitcoin than forcing them, your claim is false, even those that want to learn about Bitcoin are still showing the sign of fear, imagine forcing them to put money into something they don't understand? They will only proceed if they feel like, there is no force and no do or die.",

And I think teaching others is a good idea but first we should teach our families, then our friends and others. But we must explain then how volatile it is and we have to share how scammers are stealing funds. Because we should also learn how we can be safe in crypto from scammers. Anyway I am not discouraging to teach others about it but if it's illegal by the government then you should be safe and involving others will not be a good idea at all.",

Why you will emphasize the risk side over its benefits while you are introducing Bitcoin to newbie. You are scaring them instead of converting them to investors since no one will invest on risky assets most importantly that you are keep emphasizing it to him as a big deal.Risk is just introduced as disclaimer but you should focus on the positive side since Bitcoin has a lot of pros over cons. Bitcoins is just volatile which can be easily solved by just holding strong. If the newbie is interested on Bitcoin then we need to introduce Bitcoin gently so that they will not discourage. Just remind them the disclaimer. It’s very hard to encourage newbie if the way of teaching that we will use is to scare them by risk involved.",

That's why they introduced it by giving them the basic knowledge of the Bitcoin's pros and cons since it's volatile and have a risk involved. And I'm with you, since this forum literally named as \"bitcointalk\" so it would side to the Bitcoin like their benefits to hook more people to join in this industry. Still it's true that there's a lot of opportunity in this industry if you only have the proper knowledge and skills, and if you've already build up your mental and decisional making since you need to think carefully for every decisions you make.",

I understand that some has got the passion to teach and also, feels the need to have progressive friends and neighbors around them. It doesn’t mean they are good people but, just the way they like to live life.There is nothing wrong with having to teach to people what they need know but forcing something on them, that’s just something you can’t do, shouldn’t do and can not archive successfully. Anyway, the term force seems to be the height of it as used in this context given the fact that, most of those you hope to teach and have them follow through would adults. Of course there is an exception for kids but, kids! Just how do you expect them to come into the system. We surely needs to be wise about the way we go about exposure.Am yet to see anyone that does better in bitcoin publicity or exposure than the bullrun does:",

Only bring it up if they ask you about it which they most likely would if they see you doing well courtesy of your involvement in the bitcoin.",

However, the best way to get people to pay attention to someone is by no trying to force them instead, try to explain how it works and how it has helped people.
