I put more emphasis on older sites (since they're more likely to be reputable/reliable ones, or at the very least, have enough info for me to judge their sites). Payment methods and varieties aren't really much of an issue, most casinos have the same sets of games most of the time anyway, especially if you consider most of the older ones. The rest can actually be rated pretty close to each other, they're not the info I'd actually care much really.",

I'm not hopeful about the bonus or rewards program because it has high wagering requirements. A good, intuitive, fast user interface is also needed to make gamblers feel comfortable playing in the casino. Customer support must also be good so that a member's problem can be resolved immediately.I don't really want to see the casino tokens myself but it might be worth a shot to see the reaction from the members. Deposits and payments need to be instant because gamblers don't want to see their deposits and withdrawals experience delays. No KYC is getting rare these days but if casinos could provide one, we would be very happy. As for the payment method, I don't think it's a big deal because as long as the casino accepts crypto, that's enough for crypto gamblers.",

It kind of became the norm and I accepted it, when I was new in the gambling world it was a bigger deal for me. The most important feature beside a good reputation is for me a big variety of games, because I like to play all kind of games. There are days where I only want to play slots and then I have evenings where I only play Black Jack or Poker. Having the option to choose from a lot of different games keeps the casino interesting. And the other important feature is to have a decent bonus program for regular gamblers.",

Reputation is the main benchmark for an online casino so that users can trust it. If the reputation is good, then there will be many users who come and register. and the age of online casinos depends on how the reputation is owned, even though the site is quite old but does not guarantee a good reputation, depending on how the casino developer provides good service for users.Everyone has their own judgment and some very important ones in my opinion are the good help response from the casino when there are problems, as well as the ease of making deposits and withdrawals. For KYC, it may be possible to follow the rules that have been recommended and also need to add an assessment of AML (Anti Money Laundering) because it is also important for the security of the site as well. If the online casino site is used for crimes such as money laundering then it is likely that the site will be flagged and will be forcibly closed, then it has an impact on users as well.",
