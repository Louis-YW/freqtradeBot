To ensure you can communicate securely, we have to utilise encryption technology native to all phones, which is A5/1 encryption. However, this encryption standard can be broken & deciphered but not in real-time. We mitigate this risk by disconnecting calls after 7 minutes.We are more than just encryption for secure communications. We employ other tactics to mitigate or defeat any potential attack.Furthermore, due to the call back feature it is actually impossible to prove a call ever took place (once you factor in number substitution & inability identify location). Furthermore, in terms of the call-back feature, there is no way of knowing who might have called them or for what purpose.Can anyone locate me?With a standard SIM card, a number of markers are provided tying the phone to you & your location. This can be extremely helpful to your carrier and anyone else who wants to track you via their cell towers. We use a series of strategies to render this impossible & tactics used include:* Your SIM card doesn’t broadcast a IMSI number (this is your phone number)* Your IMEI number is not broadcast* We connect to a random cell tower, not the strongest signal, meaning you can’t triangulate the position of the phone* There is no billing information to cross-reference* Our servers also encrypt any geolocation data residing in the call.* So besides protecting your call contents, we also protect your location, an important factor for many investigationsCan my calls be intercepted/listened to?At the moment, mobile phones connect to the phone network by connecting to the mobile cell tower emitting the strongest signal. The cell tower actually has a significant amount of control over your call. For example, when a call is made, it is the cell tower which instructs your phone to encrypt the call. It even tells the phone which encryption standard to use and worryingly your phone will agree to these instructions without any security checks (this is a fundamental design failure within the entire mobile phone infrastructure).The authorities can eavesdrop quite easily into mobile phone calls by using a device called an IMSI Catcher. This device pretends to be a mobile phone cell tower & your phone will connect to it simply because it spoofs the handset into thinking it is the strongest signal. Once the phone has connected to the IMSI Catcher, the device can instruct your phone to use no encryption thus rendering your call completely open for listening into. It is a classic man in the middle attack.* Our products utilize a number of strategies to defend against this:* The SIM card is programmed to defer to the nearest cell tower, in order to avoid connecting to an IMSI Catcher. This eliminates the risk of interception and encryption removal when using your phone to communicate.* We use a unique method to safeguard your phone. Whilst the majority of IMSI Catchers cannot intercept incoming calls, this SIM card connects to a virtual switchboard in Russia which then disconnects the call and then calls you back. The process happens in a split second and end users have no awareness of this process – it is another mitigating strategy.* Your call can also be intercepted without the use of an IMSI Catcher. In which case our call encryption is enough to prevent the call being deciphered.Do I need to provide any personal details?We provide a completely anonymous service, hence we do not need any details from you what so ever, if you wish to get a physical sim card then we will require an address to deliver to.What is the difference between a physical sim and a E-SIM?E-Sim’s are downloaded onto your phone, not all phones support e-sims however majority of the newer phones do, for example all iPhones XR and above support E-sim’s. An e-sim can only be downloaded once, hence if you change or loose your device then you will not be able to use the same sim again, however at a fee off $100 we can replace your sim card alongside your old balance.Physical sim cards can be used in as many phones as possible, it will be a normal 3 part sim card that is blank, however if you loose this and wish to have a replacement, it will cost $150.How can I top up?Right now we do not have an automated service to top up, top up’s must be done manually by contacting us directly.What payment methods are accepted?We accept any cryptocurrency.Contact:Telegram: @GhostSimsWebsite: GhostSims.comWILLING TO USE ANY FORM OF ESCROW.",
