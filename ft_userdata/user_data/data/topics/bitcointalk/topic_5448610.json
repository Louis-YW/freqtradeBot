  "content": "Hi All, Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number: Bitcoin Core 24.0.1; running on Umbrel node over Tor on a Raspberry Pi 4Operating System: Windows 11 Home 64-bitSystem Hardware Specs: 11th gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 @ 2.80 GHz (8 CPUs), 16GB memory, 500 GB hard drive, GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q Design Graphics Card.Description of Problem:My bitcoin transaction on mainchain has been unconfirmed for over two weeks.Unfortunately, the highest miner fee that was suggested by Umbrel was 1.02 sat/vbyte (without going to advanced setting and setting it manually). This is the reason no miner is picking it up.Shortly after, the on-chain transaction volume spiked and the mining fee went all the way to 15 sats/vbyte, leaving my 1.02 sat/vbyte unconfirmed after 24 hours.The Transaction is still currently unconfirmed.This transaction is not RBF compatible.I’ve tried using CPFP to push my original transaction through using Ride the Lightning app on the Umbrel Node UI, with no success. I am not able to see an option on how to isolate the unconfirmed UTXO and send it back to myself.I do see options to \"Lease\" certain UTXO's for 10 minutes. So I tried leasing all the non-relevant UTXO's and tried sending my unconfirmed UTXO (‎0.00550372 BTC - See below) back to me with a high mining Fee (30 Sat/Vbyte) with no success. The parent transaction still stays unconfirmed, as well as my Unconfirmed UTXO that was sent back to my address.I'm reading 21 days is the magic number for broadcasting to stop and the mempool to wipe any unconfirmed transactions. Is this a solid fact? I'm approaching this date. I'm also reading if the mempool wipes unconfirmed transactions, my node can still re-broadcast it automatically and it will be stuck in limbo again - which I don't want.Any help would be greatly appreciated. All relevant info is below.

I don't know if Umbrel changed that default.The transaction has been dropped from most nodes that's why it can't be searched from most blockexplorers.Since it's been two weeks+, there's a chance that it's already dropped your own mempool as well since 1sat/vB shouldn't dropped with today's average mempool.If I understood you correctly, the transaction is sent by you, correct?If so, open Bitcoin Core and check the transaction, right-click on it and see if \"Abandon Transaction\" is available.That option is only available if the txn isn't in your mempool and selecting it will basically remove the transaction from your wallet.That will enable you to spend the UTXOs used by the abandoned transaction, then send a replacement using those inputs again.Since you're on Umbrel, navigating through the options may be different but the name should be the same or similar.",

Since the way UTXO's work, i've gotten the diference (total bitcoin on wallet - what i'm sending) sent back to me as a change transaction - This is the 550,372 sats that were sent back to me.I don't use bitcoin core. I'm using umbrel and have a self hosted node. However, The concept of coin control should be analogous, so i'm looking for a way to do it within my UI - https://ibb.co/hKc0YLDI'm only seeing \"view info\", \"label\" and \"lease\" as my options for each UTXO. And the one you see that's not confirmed for 550,372 sats is my change that came back to me. I don't know how to specifically spend this one. This is where i'm stuck I think.",

I'm assuming a 1.02 sat/vbyte SHOULD be dropped as no miner would want to add that to the block as there's no incentive to do so. General Question: What's the workflow here? Let's say there's 'n' nodes on the network.My node broadcasts a 1 sat/vbyte transaction to the entire network.Assuming this single tranaction doesn't get into the block < 24 hrs, it gets labeled as unconfimed. But it's still in the mempool - My personal mempool that's working off my personal node. A collection of these mempools makes a pool of global mempools. Is this accurate so far?So, what happens if all other mempools running on all other 'n-1' nodes stop broadcasting my transaction, but my specifc node keeps re-broadcasting/relaying it to all othe nodes? My node just wants to keep pushing it through at a low fee with no success.Will this unconfirmed trasaction just stay unconfirmed indefinitly until I tell my node to stop broadcasting it?If that's the case, how do I tell my node to do so? I'm using Umbrel - I don't see any options to stop broadcasting transactions. Yes, this transactin is mine. I've attached in my previous post what I see in my Umbrel UI.",

Most nodes have dropped your transaction already, and even if you try to rebroadcast it most nodes won't pick it up since their mempools have already hit the memory limit.You need to make a new transaction. Your options to do this are either to find a way to delete the transaction from your software so you can spend the coins again, or if you can't do that, export the necessary private keys of the UTXOs you are trying to spend and import them elsewhere. The first option will be much easier. You say you are not running Core - what software are you running?",
