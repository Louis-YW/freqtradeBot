Lot 2 is a scrip note, it's like a voucher. Behind the hologram, there's a code that gave you a $50 discount on your Polymerbit order.I have never used it, and the code has expired on February 2020. The hologram is intact. All the other lots are DIY note, none of these have a private key. If you want to fund them, you have to generate your keys and you can use the hologram to keep the private key hidden.",
