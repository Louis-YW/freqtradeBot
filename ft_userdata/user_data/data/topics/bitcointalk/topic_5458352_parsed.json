There is nothing you can do about their rash decision cause your funds is in their custody. However, you also cannot remove the centralized exchanger at once because it is needed in many cases.So in this case you can use MEXC exchanger in the place of Kucoin. It is also a good exchanger among the non-KYC exchangers, Although you can also visit this topic(Current list of exchanges without KYC by Ratimov) for non-kyc exchangers. but always keep in mind that funds should not be held for a long time in these centralized exchangers. Better to get out of here as soon as possible.",

Small exchange promises no KYC --> People rush to use it --> it becomes popular --> it starts implementing mandatory KYC verification --> New small no KYC exchange pops up --> cycle continuesI won't suggest to you the best but try looking out for MEXC, Bingx or Bitget ot Phemex.",

KuCoin wasn’t even that decentralized before when it comes to KYC because it actually do require that to carry out P2P transactions, those without KYC were unverified and they were limited. So I wasn’t that surprised to see them making it mandatory. If you are looking for non KYC exchanges then you to go full decentralize and the best at the moment is BISQ. But there are others too, you check them out here at kycnot.com",

KuCoin had been trying before this new policy because I found it to be one of the most secure centralized exchanges than Binance; because with KuCoin, even if your account was compromised by another person, they would be unable to easily withdraw your funds due to the trading password.I will just urge you to avoid leaving your Bitcoin on the exchange for security reasons; you can use the exchange to purchase and trade Bitcoin, but you should save them in your personal wallet.",

I would like to mention a thread created by Ratimov where he had wrote all the exchanges which provides you the facility of using exchange without KYC. Just to clear things out, i never used those exchanges so i do not know if they provide the usage of exchange without KYC but i trust the thread so that's why i am sharing it here. Current list of exchanges without KYCI do not know if the list is shared by anyone else so, ignore it if it is, and my suggestion is to go for OKX or Huobi Global but MEXC is also a good exchange so it's up to you to select because there are many exchanges which might not be available in your country like in mine so i cannot get benefit from them but you might. There is another thread that i like to mention but it's up to you to choose because i also didn't use any of it as p2p contains high-risk factors and you have to be more careful.

Funny.This thread is posted in Beginners & Help, so it's a general question. If this thread was posted in trading discussion, I could be wrong because if the @OP is a daily trader, swap exchange can't be a solution.DEX could be hacked, but it's very rarely to happen, moreover if you trade in swap exchange, you'll receive your coins/money immediately. It's almost impossible during you swap your token, the site get hacked at the same time. Some sites give you the private key to access the wallet.Cool your heads off, when did @OP saying he's looking for a high liquidity exchange without KYC?",

If he's not aware about it, then this could be a problem if he's really don't want to submit his KYC.Usually those centralized exchange will notify their users, I haven't remembered with a centralized exchange without KYC updating their terms in silently.",

They are also promising exchanges like Huobi and Coinex because they have a little trading fees, many pairs and a decent trading volume. But I will not suggest to store much funds in these exchanges as they don't have too much reputation yet but also not too bad at all.",

If you want to use an exchange without kyc you should use DEX instead of CEX but if you have any reason to use CEX or need a temporary exchange without KYC to exchange multiple coins including bitcoin I would say MEXC. I use it here without kyc any listed coin/token can be exchanged quickly and Deposit and Withdraw are completed very quickly. I use it so I say it but I won't say you use it too but I think MEXC or gate.io without KYC after kucoin can work better.",

      "body": "IMHO, the absolute best platform for buying bitcoin without any KYC is RoboSats. Their model is the best that I have ever come across for a few reasons. - It can be run entirely within a Tor browser so very limited hardware requirements are needed. - No identities are required at all. You can generate an entirely new identity for each and every trade which makes it incredibly difficult (if not impossible) to know who is behind any given trade. - You can send/receive multiple different payment methods and currencies. You can even swap in/out of lightning to get different sats than what you already have on-chain. - You can delete a robot identity after you are done completing a trade.- All trade chat is PGP encrypted so you don't have to worry about anyone else knowing about your trade details.- Trust is minimized with the use of maker bond smart contracts. - As soon as you complete a trade and delete a robot identity, there is no trace or history of the trade on a platform. There are probably a number of other reasons to use it but with all of these mentioned above, it is without a doubt my favorite way to buy/sell bitcoin. I wrote this article not too long ago on how to use bitcoin anonymously that you might find helpful.",
