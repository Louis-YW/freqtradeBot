It is not related to transaction fee and I can tell you the opposite fact. If transaction fee is more expensive, the network will become stronger and more healthier.Because network hash rate comes from miners and miner's income comes from two sources: Bitcoin block rewards (subsidy) and transaction fees from transactions confirmed by miners in each found block. They, miners, will not leave the network, will not shut their ASICs down when they are receiving more money from mining.The health of network also depends on another factor. Decentralization of network hash rate from miner ownership to its geolocation distribution.",

I agree with you Zaguru12.but sometimes during periods when the congestion of the mempool is high even with the use of layer 2 lightning network, and proper timing the fees sometimes still remain quite higher than normal.From my own perspective I think the transaction fee future of Bitcoin can't be accurately defined because ordinals, nodes and forks have a large role to play in the network.Quote from: Faisal2202 on November 27, 2023, 03:56:31 PMBut as per your title, I will say yeah, high transaction fees will affect the bitcoin in the future and the present.

The issue is when you make daily transactions like that which can add up quick. Basically for daily transactions you need to use some form of L2. Either lightning network or some L2 chains like Polygon/Arbitium. I think many will just need to adapt to this.

There has been a number of improvement proposals geared towards making transaction cost cheaper, one of them is SegWit. There are also off chain solutions that has been implemented.Quote from: Faisal2202 on November 27, 2023, 03:56:31 PMWell, I am not a developer nor a technical enthusiast that I can suggest something new but my general knowledge says to me that I could make transactions in Batches rather than making one by one as it will reduce the fee for our transactions. I am not certain what you are talking about, but what is more important to the fees is the inputs in the transaction, and this cannot be fixed by simply sending transactions in batches.For an example; If you want to send $1000 worth of Bitcoin and do that in batches of $200 but had received little amounts of Bitcoin to make up the $1000, it's possible that your $200 transaction can have 10 or more inputs which will shoot the cost up.Consolidating your inputs during low fee periods is something that can help.",
