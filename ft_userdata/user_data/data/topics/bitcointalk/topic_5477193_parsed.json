      "body": "Only one option? It's hard but being ignorant seems to be insulting in something where many people are doing good. But with failures and making mistakes, there's a correlation of these two. If the failure isn't meant to be and the mistake is like an honest mistake, then that sounds music to my ears. Anyway, I'd also want to avoid both as much as possible. I'm done doing lots of mistakes in the past though.",

One mistake can make you learn what is to be corrected and you definitely will want to avoid the same mistake in the future.  I don't know the kid but if he is reading much about crypto later on now that he knew about SBF and the scam, he should be in crypto. There is more funny stuff to share in his comedy show once he gets to learn about it, especially what's going on every crypto channel.There's a good side to being ignorant but it is best to just be aware and even if he invests in memecoins, I would still think he has learned stuff like where the finance is going.",

Would you wanna be the ignorant or the ones who made a mistake?I would rather choose to make a mistake than to be ignorant, it is better to make a mistake because you will learn from that mistake and you can fix it or you know how to do it so that that mistake will not happen again. It's hard to be ignorant, you don't know anything. I think it is the most difficult task to be ignorant around you or anywhere. It's not bad to make mistakes so don't be afraid, everyone makes mistakes.",
