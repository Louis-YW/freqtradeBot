Take care.I discovered a website for Dollar Cost Averaging and it has a box to enter Exchange fee too.https://costavg.com/Its has DCA calculator tool for some cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and Cardano.I used it with $50 weekly DCA, since 10 September 2021, a few weeks before Bitcoin made its all time high till 25 October 2023.After about 4 years of  $50 weekly DCA, you can accumulate 0.2 BTC. Impressive!DCA gives profit as you can see from screenshots. You can type same inputs for DCA calculator and get a detailed table that I did not make a screenshot of it.",

DCA is easy and more convenience to accumulate bitcoin disregard the price of bitcoin at any given time. It is just like you are saving money in the bank and every month you save 10% of your income regularly for 4yrs and above because you want to use the compound funds to build a house. That is how DCA works but you put that 10% into bitcoin.Before you know it your bitcoin investment portfolio will have increased directly proportion with the amount used and the timeline, and also with your profit. Lump sum will have good profit, if you bought at the bottom line and this is hard to know. You might lump sum and bitcoin price dips again, you will not be happy that you bought then.

If you can be patient and get lucky, you'll end up with more profits compared to DCA. The problem is most people don't have those (catching a falling knife is almost impossible most of the time), so DCA is preferable to them.

Withdrawal fees ain't even something to talk about, because it's not that much to feel concern about, I remember a brother asking for Binance withdrawal fee when he want to start DCA, I told him to gather up the cash for two weeks straight before buying on exchange, I realize that the amount he plan to use weekly is too small and that's why the withdrawal fee is important to him. DCA is good for investment because it limits your stress of investing a lot of money at once, since only money that you won't be needing for long is what should be invested into Bitcoin, I don't even have a certain amount, because my income varies, I can earn 300 in a month or even 500 at times, it depends on the rate of sales from my business. So I can DCA with 200 this month and DCA with 100 the next month, do what is easier for you when accumulating Bitcoin and always remember that it's not a do or die.",

DCA is sometimes good and sometimes bad those who are saying that DCA is always good then I think this is wrong. It gives good profits and affordable sharing with times. DCA is not best at both in the marketing phase i.e. bullish or bearish. If you are doing DCA in the bearish market it gives you more opportunities to buy more shares because in a bearish the price is low and with time it goes down. When you have a daily fixed amount for the investment you can buy more shares if it is bearish and when the price is high it will give you a high return on the other hand when the market is in the bullish run you can not buy more shares with the same fund and you will invest for a long period because the price is high in the bullish phase. One thing more that this strategy is for those who have a long-term investment plan if you have a short-term plan then go towards swing trading, scalping, or day trading.",

(that is if the person is a newbie to bitcoin).  On the other hand, if the person already spent time establishing a position, then what he does into the future may well be influenced, in part, based on what he had accomplished so far in terms of his BTC accumulation amount and what goals that he might have had and if some of his goals might have had changed based on how long he has been in bitcoin and how much bitcoin he has accumulated in light of his other investments and the other factors that he needs to consider, as I have outlined in another one of my posts.",
