I'll explain.We all like to know what's happening in the world, and for good reason… understanding our surroundings is essential to survival. We instinctively seek information… we need information. There is, however, a problem that we face:No matter how much \"news\" you consume, you won't really know what's going on in the world.We can't know, because 'the news' is half illusion, provided by government-dependent corporations that are paid to keep you watching and to keep you joined to the status quo.Granted, they are quite good at providing pictures from disaster areas, but when it comes to explaining why the disaster happened, they mislead almost every time. Yes, some truth makes its way through the news machine, but most of it is wrapped in layers of manipulation. If, for example, you watch the news feeds all day, you'll find a good deal of truth, but you'll find it amongst a pile of half-truths. Do you really have enough time to analyze them all?One Piece of TruthThe truth about public reporting comes out from time to time, but usually well after the fact. So, here's one piece of truth that's worth remembering:...",

Due to this planet being so big and being too much information out there.Both right and left wing media have then own personal interests which seek to push forward by filtering the news which help to achieve that mission. We are busy in our lives and we have to either decide to trust people may not be trustworthy or simply disconnect ourselves from reality and only take care of information which does not have to do with geopolitics, macroeconomics, or international developments. It is very concerning, but news are not what they used to be anymore, they are more about the hosts conjectures than the actual facts.",

We actually can not know what is happening because the truth is far from us.Sometimes, the lack of information about government affairs could be as selfish as just some politicians not wanting the general public to realize about the serious inefficiencies within certain administrations. It is something it is very common to see in countries like mine, opacity for the sake of keeping a facade, does not even enhance national security to keep such information away from all of us. If you have studied a bit about Authoritarian regimes, you would know what I mean",

Where does the strength lie? Bible - 1 Corinthians 1:26-31:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/1.htm26Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29so that no one may boast before him. 30It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”Think of the trouble that is in the world. We live in peace for a while, and then we are gone. And after a few years even the memory of us is gone. It's like this for everybody, rich and poor, good and evil, Pelosi and the FBI, and all of us little people, as well.But if we are found to be believers in God and Jesus-salvation, we will live again, in the strength of God, forever.",
