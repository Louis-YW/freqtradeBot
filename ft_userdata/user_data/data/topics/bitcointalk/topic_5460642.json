Maybe diversification or something else.The tightening laws about cryptocurrency shouldn't make them get rid off from Bitcoin because there's a way to exchange and cash out without KYC.",

An unmoved old address meant a lost coin or an old address making a movement would mean to sell it.About the latter, there is nothing wrong with selling the bitcoins and it does not tell and mean a single thing. Why would you automatically say that whales who have old addresses directly affect public perception toward Bitcoin in general? There is not any related link between both of these that I could think of.",

And what is this crypto asset? 4 - regulators have \"gotten their way\", cryptocurrency is losing support and interest ?5. - your version ?1. It shows ulterior motives that no one can answer except the movers of the money.2. Never!!! Not even the old whales can end the era of cryptocurrency this time that it has been established in the mainstream of the financial market. And no, they can't be stupid enough to move to fiat permanently when the price of Bitcoin is still low. I believe they are changing their strategy towards the safety of the coin, or have a business plan that needs urgent funding.3. Refer to the second answer, and they might have altcoins they would want to change part of their assets to. It's their money, and these altcoins could be numerous.4. I don't believe this, if this was true, then they would have rather moved it to self-custodial wallets, not an exchange that would further expose them to regulations.5. Perhaps, they have special deals/contracts with exchanges that are not plain to the general public.",

This is the graph for ETH during the last month:In July 17th, the very day the article is talking about, the price dropped from $1,924 to $1,884. So, was that the impact? Maybe, but it looks like just normal fluctuations to me.Let's check it for LTC:The \"impact\" was even smaller in this case.",

And it seems they see now as the right time to get up, especially since the last highest Bitcoin price could reach $ 60k. And it's only natural that Bitcoin owners transfer their Bitcoin to exchanges because they want to withdraw their profits after holding their Bitcoins for a long time.And I think after they've made a huge profit selling Bitcoin, they're waiting for another dip so they can buy Bitcoin again. And they also don't need to sell most of the Bitcoin because just selling a few Bitcoins can make them a millionaire. Meanwhile, they can keep most of their Bitcoins for years.They now have to think about keeping their huge sum of money and will probably keep their money in crypto. If they send the money to a bank account, it will set off an alarm from the bank so their account will surely be checked. And the regulators will certainly also examine the account because there is a money transfer coming into the account. That's why keeping the money in separate wallets in crypto would be the solution.",

Or maybe one or two might but in my version, institure are interested in buying more and more BTC, big whales like MicroStrategy had already filled there bags or maybe they are just empty now. That's why we are not seeing another buying from them. But crypto is not lossing its era nor BTC. It's just small correction that BTC is currently making. In my Point, next week we might see another boom. Maybe BTC break $34k or $35k resistances. But these are just my assumption based on my instincts about Market. I know market doesn't predicted by instincts but trust me. i have superpowers.   Owners are if moving towards fiat, then how they are doing it? By selling their BTC which means there is another party too exist which is buying BTC. So, try to remain positive. But, in the short time-span maybe after this slight pump of around $35k or $40k we might see BTC coming back to $29k or maybe lower. But chances for that is highly lower. So, we should be optimistic.",

I know another analysis could be selling to hodl in fiat but that may not visibly be certain because they fear inflation that is possibly hit the fiat and its value may not purchase as much btc if the crash happens.
