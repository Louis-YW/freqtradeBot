Not only do they have a good community and development, but they are also running on a good platform IMMUTABLE X. The game is similar to left4dead, we are shooting zombies and getting their native token through it.If you are into strategy and turn-based games, you can try Splinterlands, GodUnchained, and Skyweaver. They have been in here for years and they never stop developing their project.",

We could maybe share knowledge and even play together some of those games.  If this is not the fitting place for this question please do lead me to the one that is. Thank you in advance! The market is down right now and these play-to-earn games have been hit badly and most of their tokens are very low right now. So if there are some worth our attention, it will depend on what you see with these projects. You need to DYOR and some projects that might have been told to you here could be the best for them but not suitable for you. Anyway, this is the right place for you to ask such questions, let the others have their suggestion and read what they think it's worth giving attention for the projects they will suggest.",

They have pretty much pioneered quality NFT gaming to the point they created ImmutableX to deal with tx fees for nfts. I think they are definitely worth looking at even though i have some personal issues with them, ton of communication issues during launch and deceiving technical bragging. I don't even need to understand the whole issue, i trust way more tech savvy coders than me on that. But i recon you get best experience for investing very small sums in any game and not try to free leech them. You can get so much more from them when you have skin in the game.",

Yeah it's very hard to calculate how much you will  get by playing it but at least this has some good things to be used to earn some money rather than wasting your money to earn nothing. The game like axie infinity is not giving you any money again. ROI was very very bad. It's better to stick into vulcan forged which is free to play and the economic of its token were stable without getting huge inflation like SLP. The play to earn token called lava already paired with several big tokens include USDC. These days move to earn was not so good as it was a few months ago. I think that you need to consider it again but renting shoes from others seems to be a good choice.",

With that measure, developers removed a large portion of the players from the game as well, because they don't have teams strong enough to stay competitive on PVP mode. Theoretically after doing that SLP price would rise, but what we have seen since then was an even further drop in price. Unfortunatelly a sustainable recipe hasn't been discovered by developers yet to run their projects efficiently and to make it worth for players on long run.",

You really need to avoid such games because they won't bring you any profit if you don't believe, you can look at their progress right now and see if they gonna have a chance to recover, you will see they will just give their investors some news but without any good progress about their games.",

I just googled it and instantly downloaded it for my phone because it looked so cool. So far this is the coolest game that has crypto implemented into it that i've seen. I honestly even don't care about money now, i am just playing this. Gameplay seems insanely intuitive good and rewarding to me as a gamer. All the crypto games i've tried are somewhat nonsense, bad design, buggy and laggy games that never should have been done in the first place, but this is on whole new level of gaming.

Currently I'm level 70 there. There is another game with similar mechanisms: MIR4, that came before in 2021, although it is infested with bots which affect us directly. Moreover players are too toxic. I was high level there, but just gave up.In Ni No Kuni things are a little better, because abusers can't do much against you. I hope you enjoy the game.",
