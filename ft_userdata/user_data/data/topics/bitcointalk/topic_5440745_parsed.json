  "content": "This league is moving some fans, The Kings League noise, Well, lot or little but even the president of La Liga talk about this tournament.The reality is that this KL grows in the Streamers' underworld and gains followers.Renowned players that I remembers, Kun Agüero, Chicharito, among others.It is worth noting that Gerard Piqué is one of the main precursors of this League, he is its president.I think it has a future, it is actually a rebellious league in my opinion, a football fan classist will end up hating it, but without a doubt that in times when openness to new things is the trend, it can survive in its own niche, now! compete with the traditional Leagues, it is very far.WyT?I have seen a couple of traditional bookmakers that host this league but I have not seen any crypto casino (Here).Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_League",
