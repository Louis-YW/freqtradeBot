All the top coins will not depend on Bitcoin. Whenever Bitcoin got stabled, the market will be stable as a result of that.The question is how Bitcoin can be stable.  If it got stabled that will happen?Bitcoin is not designed to be stable like the other centralized stable altcoins, Bitcoin is a volatile asset and that is how Bitcoin is designed to operate, so comparing Bitcoin to other stablecoins is a total was of time as both are designed with different network algorithms. The discussion is better as being why other altcoins market depends on the Bitcoin market to determine their conditions and the answer is simple the cryptocurrency stock market largely depends on Bitcoin for market conditions and whatever price Bitcoin settles for other altcoins will settle around the same but in different percentage. But not all coins perform in the same direction as Bitcoin some other coins move opposite direction from Bitcoin.",

You can sell at your will, and that's not the only freedom BTC gives you for being decentralized. If BTC ever become such as the stablecoin, It will become centralized and people will use it like normal currency, which is not a bad thing, but many will lose their interest in BTC for that reason. Trading and other things totally depends on price movements. If BTC stays at the same price, then trading will have no value and mining could stop. Because you can buy it at a stable price, and you can store them for a long time because you know the value won't change.",

Even stable-coins aren't stable really. So we can't imagine that Bitcoin can be stable. I don't this we need any arguments for that.",

There are enough stable coins in the market and there is no need for another stable coin. Bitcoin is different than stable coins as its value is purely dependent upon demand and supply. Finally, even if we imagine that bitcoin becomes stable, the market will still not be stable and altcoins will keep their movements up and down according to the same demand and supply concept.",

Because you and I know this is just a fantasy that can never be true. But taking a look at its white paper and all that Bitcoin represents, you get to understand that it wasn't developed to be stable but volatile, because being stable will make no difference of Bitcoin from our normal fiat currencies such as \"Dollar, Pounds, Euro\" and a big alterations of what Bitcoin truely represent of being a decentralized digital currency. So in summary, Bitcoin can never get stable like USDT",

There is no stability in currencies and stable coins only exist cause they are pegged to other currencies. Those currencies they are pegged to are not stable.Now to answer your statement above; No. If Bitcoin gets less volatile, this would not necessarily reflect on altcoins.Quote from: mr_jk on September 26, 2022, 06:29:32 PMQuestion is that how Bitcoin can be stable?  If it got stabled that will happen?Adoption and growth would reduce the speculative value of Bitcoin.If Bitcoin became less volatile, nothing happens besides a change in how traders view it.",

But when it started to have a price and then traded publicly 24x7, the price becomes so unstable and volatile that it makes trader money our lost because of it's nature.So as much as we wanted to follow your arguments hypothetically, it's not going to happen, so it's very flawed in the beginning. And that is what stable coins have been created like Tether, because they know that traders are looking for something to 'stabilized' their money against the volatility of Bitcoin.",

Fiat currencies may give the impression that they are stable but they are not, after all we are going through a period of inflation so high which is causing each unit of fiat to buy less and less each day, besides in order to make bitcoin stable, or at least to try to make it be that way, then some kind of manipulation on its supply will have to exist, and this is simply unacceptable as one of the characteristics that attracts long term holders is its maximum supply.",

I wouldn't like it because its volatility gives the most opportunity to profit but simultaneously increases the risk that you have within the market, so it's always going to be a give and take.
