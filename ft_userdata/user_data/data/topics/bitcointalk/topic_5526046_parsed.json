All those bitcoins, poof.  Even rich folks arent immune.  So you gotta have backups, my friends.  Store copies of your private keys or backup seeds somewhere else just in case and  nothing wrong with putting your crypto eggs in a few different baskets.  Spread it out.  Cause you never know when your place might go up in flames.  Then youll be wishing you had those backups.  Dont learn the hard way if you can avoid it.  Be smart and stay safe.  Protect your investment.",

Banks don’t store their backups in just one location. That way, in case of a flood or fire, they can still access their data from another location and continue operating. For us, it’s similar, we can still access our crypto holdings because we’ve stored backups in different places.",

Fire, flood, tornado, and other disasters are more or less the same in that they could make you lose your backup. It doesn't even matter if your metal seed storage could withstand severe fire or pressure. The question is, after your house is burnt to the ground, after your house is washed away from ravaging flood waters, or dismantled by swirling air, or crushed after a strong earthquake, could you still locate that tiny piece of metal? You might not.",

It's just a question where you are going to put that backup, banks? or maybe at your parents house?Hopefully for those who did get a fire-proof storage, they might not hold against the intense heat of the fire. But let's see maybe someone will claim that their storage didn't burn that much and they still have their back up intact.I read that there are some people who might not have think about their crypto though when they see their house burning, but still just try to get out alive, some only pick up their dogs and run.",

Using more resistant medium for storing coins is one way but if you have to leave home and run away, it will still be left behind and in the ruins in the aftermath you may not be able to find it. Not to mention that with crime rates rising, it may be stolen! (they've already deployed the National Guard to try and prevent some of the lootings).So a better idea is to have an emergency plan where you can quickly take valuable \"objects\" with you in case of a disaster where you have to quickly evacuate. It could be albums, a hard drive, documents, etc. and of course your paper wallet.Keeping a backup in a different location is helpful as well. This is where the importance of encryption is highlighted.",
