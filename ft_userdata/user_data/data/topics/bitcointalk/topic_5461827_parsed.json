Who decided to start an investigation into the activities of the largest financial giant in the world?Lol, AOL? The only Bitcoin-related thing in this topic is Blackrock being invested in Bitcoin. But that has nothing to do with the news headline.I have no idea whether Blackrock is going to get charged for facilitating Chinese investments, but even so, I fail to see how exactly it will have an effect on Bitcoin. Worst case, they are forced to pay a fine that they can easily afford without having to sell their Bitcoin. So there is no point in panicking about this having an effect on Bitcoin. So unless this has some effect on Bitcoin, I don't think this topic is worth discussing.",

So why is this happening right now, when cryptocurrency legislation is beginning to take shape in the US?I think that everything here is much more complicated than the formal accusations of investing in Chinese companies.",

As far as I know, this company does not make direct investments, but creates various funds that then make investments. And the companies that BlackRock has invested in have been seen to promote the development of other cryptocurrencies, not just bitcoin.",

The USA concentrates on its territory the best technological productions and entices manufacturers from Europe. In the long run, China will win because their system of governance is better, although not at all democratic.",

Not anytime soon but definitely in the future when big corporates will consider new businesses. Many Chinese businesses are leaving the US because of the crackdown on businesses connected to China. The trade war started by Donald Trump has been sustained by the present regime. Although this policy is reducing the influence of China on the US economy. But the consequence is that many viable businesses will have to leave the US to other countries. It's also good news to other nations that these businesses will move to.

The US has not also been very stringent as it is today. But if these regulations persist and these crypto firms have other options, they will have to leave the US. China thought the cryptosystem will collapse without their support, but the market grew more resistant and stronger. Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong once threatened to relocate overseas if the SEC under Gary Gensler keep intensifying the scrutiny on the exchange (although he later assured Coinbase customers that the firm is not leaving the market).",
