      "body": "Well, Bitcoin is meant to be parallel to fiats and the centralized system. It ought to be hated by them otherwise we should be worried. The worst they can do to use Bitcoin currency is to use the fake/wrapped version of it on centralized system, like the exchanges. Ofcourse, with the action of US leader, they will find it hard to impose CBDC on nations. It will likely be the nations deciding to adopt some sort of globally interoperable national digital currencies on system they individually have more control over, that allows for easy currency swapping or trading of products/services between nations and people. In regards to the \"orange hair\" being seen as the bad guy, I think badness naturally is attributed to certain characters which are meant to serve as warning when picked up by the body sense organs. The characters could also be used to ward off or fight evil/lawlessness. But it is often misused or misunderstood by most people in the system. For example, a leader who really meant to fight evil would use the characters and be misunderstood by the subjects to be an evil leader. The leader could also misuse or use the characters wrongly against those/things that  do not deserve them. The system took advantage of this aspect of nature to hide the true intention of leaders to the subjects. Those appearing nice and gentle could have abominable intentions and still be loved due to the appearances, and vice-versa.",

      "body": "There are concerns among everyone about further adoption of crypto-friendly policies (Bitcoin) and I do not think that Trump has taken big steps in this direction despite all the noticeable development in the emerging crypto market since Trump returned to the White House. Adopting crypto in the United States does not mean abandoning the dollar or classical payment systems, but there is caution due to the lack of laws regulating the sector and therefore the door cannot be opened all at once. In Europe, the situation is different because all EU countries (except Switzerland) use a unified currency and any malfunction in the currency system or a review of performance could cause economic and financial disasters. The economies of the EU countries are different and they are currently involved with the euro due to inflation crises and the relationship with the dollar, so it is not that easy to ensure a smooth transition to crypto without harming the value of the euro.",

      "body": "Have you noticed that right after the Czech Central Bank announced they're looking into bitcoin as reserve asset, Legarde was asked if EU bank wants to do the same and declined and the Czechs said that they're not going to do it either because \"no other EU central bank is using bitcoin\".This looks suspiciously coincidental and my theory is that Legarde, or her underlings from the EU central bank, contacted the Czech central bank and told them not to do it. IMO the end game for the EU is to impose CBDC and then add that to the reserves. They're afraid to use bitcoin for that first since they don't control it. They want the first officially recognized cryptocurrency to be a centralized one.",

US is going to support Bitcoin to some extent as most ETF operations are run by US companies and US government might earn some tax from those if I'm not wrong. I'm not sure about the government of US but at least people living in that country love Bitcoin and are highly interested in crypto currencies. I agree that politicians don't really care about Bitcoin and they have no expectations with it but who knows that many of them might have invested huge amount of money in it? If that's the case then they'll of course support it and promote it with hope to earn good profits from their investment.",
