  "content": "I am welcome back fully to the forum to continue my learning on bitcoin and crypto currencies in the ecosystem. I really missed the forum, because even though as a newbie I came here to busy myself with comments/post (participating) on different board to learn and removed my boring time. Even when I was not here at the initial time, once a while I entered google to check one or two articles about bitcoin. In that process, I also came to learn a little and I believe this forum will do the remaining part base on my seriousness. Reasons why I was away1. I was seriously sick and I spent about two months and I was in hospital in Federal Medical Center (FMC). My leg paralyzed suddenly, which caused by Arthritis , and I could not moved for all these while. The total amount spent in the hospital was $350 because there was a shift of born in my waist which also affect the nervous system in the left leg.2. The second reason was, I also lost my phone on the hospital bed, as I slept off. So I became blindfolded by faith, in the sense that I was blinded because I was not participating in this forum again since there was no device to login. But I was having the faith that one day I will continue my learning on bitcoin here again. And today I am here. I am happy to be here again.Bitcoin Bear MarketI also heard about the bear market in the hospital. There was a male nurse in the hospital that deals on bitcoin so there was a day i heard him discussing with a person on phone about bitcoin. After the discussion, I quietly asked him after the call to if he knows more on bitcoin and he said yes. He is into Investment, and I learned a little from him. There he told me that bitcoin price is low (bear market). He told me most of the team used in the market. He encourage me. FinallyDistance is no longer a barrier in learning. Mobile phone, internet have draw the global space very close in learning. I am here to complete. Most of you think I only came here and ran away. No. There was something behind the scene of my absence. I believed I was trying on my posts and comments before I left the forum for the period.",

During the period of time that you were absent, many, as you put it, did not even notice your absence.There is a thread on the forum that really notices the absence of people who suddenly left the forum.But as you yourself understand, in order to be noticed, you need to make yourself noticeable.I wish you good luck on the forum, to become as popular as those whose names remain in the memory of people despite their absence.",
