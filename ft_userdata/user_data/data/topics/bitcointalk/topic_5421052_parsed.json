  "content": "Sending $400 million worth of Ether to the wrong wallet is not the best way to build consumer confidence when trust in cryptocurrency exchanges is at a post-FTX low. Withdrawals reportedly rose and Crypto.com’s Cronos token fell.News of Crypto.com’s $400 million “oopsie” couldn’t have come at a worse time.While it happened last month, news only broke over the weekend that the high-profile exchange accidentally sent $400 million worth of Ether to competitor Gate.io after mixing up one of its own corporate account wallets on that platform with a new Crypto.com cold wallet.Coming as trust in centralized exchanges has been badly damaged by the collapse into bankruptcy of FTX and FTX US — as shown by the record number of crypto owners finally heeding long-standing industry advice to self-custody their funds in private cold wallets — the error “generated so much FUD & speculation on Twitter,” according to CEO Kris Marszalek, that he was forced to explain what happened.In brief, he said in a Nov. 12 Twitter thread that the 320,000 ETH were sent to a whitelisted address in its custody system — just the wrong one:Quote“Fund movements from Crypto.com custody systems are only possible between approved and whitelisted addresses attached to our cold wallets, our hot wallets and our corporate accounts at 3rd party exchanges […] In this particular case the whitelisted address belonged to one of our corporate accounts in a 3rd party exchange instead of our cold wallet.”(Source: Coinmarketcap)",

      "body": "But if its sent to an exchange then there is chance to recover the funds with the help of legal actions but the centralized exchanges became more lethargic when it comes to managing the funds and of course its not their own money but they due hold the responsibility of keeping it safer so making such silly mistakes can't be given as an excuse. With such mistakes the other exchanges are growing stronger and also started to feel like monopoly.",

LolExchange to exchange can be retrievable better they could write to them it can be reversed back, instead of. But my question is why are such profile exchange make such huge mistake or even sending funds to customers address without making full confirmation of the address.Now what could possibly results to this careless mistake?Could it be errors from keyboard or what is the actual issues that arises and this is not coming common with tie 1 exchange like binance.",

And people need to have critical thinking so that they will not get easily burned out by fuds spreader out by person who want to take advantage on some situations. Manipulation by rivals or not, this incident is worth to be mentioned. Red flags must be risen and investors plus customers must be told what is going on in real time, especially when the exchanges are going shady, doesn't matter if it is on purpose or accidentally. After all, people have thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions invested on platforms like Crypto.com.I can't blame manipulative rivals on this situation. It was Crypto.com's fault to have given reasons to their opponents to launch a red flag campaign against them.",
