Two days ago, the Appeal Court has sacked Labour Party, LP's Olukayode Doherty and declared the All Progressives Congress, APC's Rauf Age-Suleiman as the winner of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Amuwo-Odofin II Constituency election. 1 The Court of Appeal in Abuja sacked Abba Yusuf as governor of Kano State, upholding the decision of the lower election petition tribunal that earlier nullified the governor’s election. A three-member panel of the Court of Appeal led by Moore Adumein, in a unanimous judgement on Friday, declared Nasiru Gawuna of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the 18 March 2The court of appeal in Abuja has sacked Mutfwang Manasseh as governor of Plateau state.The court ordered the commission to issue a fresh certificate of return to the APC candidate.Anyone noticing anything here? The APC government is moving to take over the states. Maybe we may not see this happen but we'll definitely see 99% of the entire Nigerian government being ruled by APC. Personally I don't like them, Nigerians don't like side those who are benefitting and those who are indifferent. What role do you think a regular citizen can play here in governance?

Our spirits are low and it is almost like a if you can't beat them join them situation. Naturally, a citizen has a lot of role to play here by first not selling off votes but these days whether you sell or not, those who dey want to win will win and Im in support of what SAN Femi Falana said about the sack of these governors. For me, I see no reason why they need to be sacked when in actuality the fault is from the INEC officials who did not do their jobs properly, or is it that that they too are untouchable? The judiciary system is warped and it's not as if I'm laying allegations on anyone but the way naija is going, it seems they only want to put in APC faithfuls so they can have the final say and sooner than later, the court won't be the hope of the common man.",

      "body": "I only heard the tribunal cases and I have not heard the appeal court cases. Probably they judge Kano case at Abuja because the last time when the tribunal gave the judgement riot almost happened so at their time they decided to judge it at Abuja to avoid such magnitude of fight again. And I have not heard the appeal court cases of Delta State and Zamfara State. Bayelsa State will also join the line. Op the we have to know that the new method to win election in Nigeria which is very easy is the court. The court has sacked many qualified governors and replaced them with someone who win a election in the 3rd position. How many of you know that Tinubu is not the real winner of the presidential election in this year? Tinubu won 3rd position in the general election. It was PDP that won the election and followed by Labour Party but INEC manover everything to favour APC. Well one thing I know as a citizen, let power shift hand so that the distribution of the national and state wealth will also change to different people. But whereby the people's choice are sacked then the system will collapsed. Today now, Buhari was the worse President in Nigeria but when Tinubu took over. Buhari became a Saint.",

      "body": "QuoteInvest in what you can afford to lose: I have read this line many times inside this forum and outside this forum that are crypto related discussion and what they tell you about crypto investment is to invest with the amount you can afford to lose to avoid had I know and regrets that later.In the last bull run, some people commit suicide when they loss their funds and when some of them where victim of scams. It's advisable to invest in the amount you know it will not hurt you if anything should happen in the end, always consider this before you take that money to any coin.Good point that a lot of people's action is always triggered by what others do not consider their own pocket, and they forget all fingers are not equal so it is better to properly check how self to know what we can actually afford because not everyone has the mind to actually handle whatever bitcoin have installed for them when it comes to the market condition, and of course, people will commit suicide since we all have different ways of handling emotions. but even at that I don't see why it will get to the point of committing suicide is not worth it there will always be enough time to make more money. money should be considered first exactly.QuoteDon't entertain any form of scam: Scam increases when bull run is around but how to you avoid them is simple, just reduce your greed and don't buy into unreleastic ideas. When you see staking reward of 100%, kindly run away, when you doubling schemes, avoid them and don't invest in shitty ideas because you are so passionate to make money, they will make you hate crypto and ignore the good side of it.people want to make more and that is why they always give in to offers of other investments that don't exist at the end of the day they get scammed, just because the majority of them are not paying attention to details. and always desperate for more cash, even with their evidence from the look you should know that it is not true no matter what they are presenting to you known is worth it please let us all keep safe with our money. but it is always good for people to learn the hard way because they will always do their own research before investing in any form of business.",

Our role as citizen is to vote and even the voting don turn to something else. Even if citizens want to protest, protest na one of the risky thing to do for Nigeria, wetin my eyes see for end sars I will never advice any Nigeria citizen to protest for bad government and election matter. Naso naija matter dey anything concerning election na court go still judge the final say, that's why most people have decided not to vote.",

Now going to court which should be the only remedy to fight against this bad government is now controlled by this same people and every thing dey do should work on their. own betterment if not they loose that position, like a person earlier said if you can't beat them you join them and that is what is killing this country bringing extreme poverty to the country.",
