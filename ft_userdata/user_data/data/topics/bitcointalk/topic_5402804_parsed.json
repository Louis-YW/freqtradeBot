Seit über einer Woche ist der Bitcoin Kurs nur noch am sinken. Mittlerweise werden auf Bitmarket.eu schon Bitcoin für 10 € angeboten.Warum passiert das? Ich meine der Mt Gox hack ist doch nun lange her, der Kurs war doch zwischendurch glaub ich auch mal wieder kurz am steigen.Was meint ihr, wie lange wird das jetzt noch so gehen?",

I can understand people selling BTC for a variety of reasons, especially if they have no choice because they need that money for daily needs - but it’s hard for me to understand that people don’t learn from the past and repeat the same mistakes. I have already written several times that from the perspective of profit, which is why most people are interested in Bitcoin, the most important thing is to determine the point of entry and exit.So far, it has proven to be the entry point in situations like this when the market has suffered a severe blow, or for those who want to profit in the short term at the time of halving. ATH will most likely follow in 6-8 months after that and the smart ones will know how to take advantage of this by selling little by little on the way up.Of course, this is not financial advice, but only what can be seen if you look at the brief history of Bitcoin.",

You are right.Both fiat and stable coin are inflationary but with fiat, at least we have governments and central bank back behind. If governments are strong, we can believe in that fiat but of course with inflation, purchasing power will decrease.With stablecoins, lot of things we don't know and any company should have less power than government and central bank so there is more risk. A higher risk is with algorithm stablecoin with Terra UST & LUNA is a good example. TRX and USDD is a latest one.",

But pessimism kicked in and the opportunity is lost.Who can predict the future that the bitcoin price of $20 in 2011 will be $69K in 2021? That's not funny in my opinion, but they have concerns that prices will drop further so buying back post dumps is hard for them to do. Only those lucky enough with good finances who dare to buy in bulk and keep it in the long term, they are the winners.Feeling pessimistic in a highly volatile market seems reasonable while bitcoin is a freely traded asset. This allows the price to rise uncontrollably and fall in the same way as well. But at that time bitcoin didn't seem to be widely known so people were still hesitant to buy and hold it long term even though $20 today looks very cheap for bitcoin. Maybe $20K today will also be considered very cheap if in 10 years the price of bitcoin is trading at $1M.",

Admittedly, that can't be an easy thing to do for holders who just like me can be small and may not be financially stable. As for the big holders and the whales, I think they can do whatever they want and many may continue on holding on waiting for the time when the tide can be reversed...and it will really have its own time again as this is always a question of WHEN and not of IF.

I dontvsee reasons why people might prefer fiat to bitcoin if you ask me. Yeah, some might look at it as a commodity to dispenser and something that could just go off at some point but, the history of today has made us understand that, that's hardly the case with bitcoin.Fiat might save value but, it becomes of no use, swapping your bitcoin for fiat whne the market is at its low already. Doing that at the beginning of the bear market might be a wise choice with the intention of buying from the dip but, not whe the market has formed this dip already.",

Yeah.. It is the human nature to be scared sometimes, and moreover when it comes to life savings, most people are extremely off thinking when they are placed in such pressure, because the fall in the price of BTC above 15% to 20% is enough to put people into panic (especially people buying for the very first time) and has urgent needs for money. So selling a coin because it falls is not a bad idea, but not buying again when you have the chance is the problem",
