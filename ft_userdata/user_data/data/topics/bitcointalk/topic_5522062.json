  "content": "If the powers that be wished to execute Bitcoin off the face of the earth, they effectively could but it got me thinking that this would elevate it to another level of power. In theory I’m thinking that all internet providers could effectively terminate anyone running or executing code relating to Bitcoin and then subsequently this would take it offline. Unless the satellites were to be rocketed up by Tom dick and Harry or however they make the internet possible? Does this make sense?",

I don't see all government coming together for a particular reason as to declare Bitcoin illegal this can only happen if the world is under one power and that is still far fetched. Also Bitcoin has gotten so much adoption that if you want to lock up Bitcoin enthusiast there might not be enough prison facilities to handle that and also top government individuals are already now involved in crypto-currency. In a nutshell those imaginations are impossible.",

It will be hard for sure but even now illegal things are still done discreetly.",

If two nations head into war via nuclear weapons there would be places and nodes that won't be affected And even if the traditional internet shuts downIt would still be almost impossible to stop it because people could still transact through local network, or satellite foe Bitcoin created by Blockstream or through a mesh system.

I think I have engaged in a discussion relating to this before here in the forum; people can't stop thinking about things that matter to them and be thinking about bitcoin transactions and how they can't possibly go through when there are more pressing matters to be worried about, as the majority of the world population will be affected and the world will be in serious chaos.",

Like literally, bitcoin is one of the most expensive assets in the world that has a supply cap of almost 2 trillion dollars which even got exceeded when we crossed $100k. It would be difficult for all the government around the whole world to all of a sudden from nowhere to just pick up the aim to wipe bitcoin off the digital era except there is a master plan to it like some revolution.Some countries have their richest set of citizens as whales wether declared or undeclared and killing bitcoin is like killing the economy of such countries.
