  "content": "Good afternoon.I've just finished my degree in computer engineering and I've come up with the idea of programming a Bitcoin quote simulator (I already programmed one a couple of years ago but it was a bit poor, the new one would be much more ambitious).I have been working on AI for several months and the idea is to take advantage of my new knowledge to improve what I already had. Using several parameters as input to get the trend and maybe some other interesting data as output, it would be through regression.The price is not going to be a direct output because it is statistically intractable, but it can be inferred once I have the trend, mean and variance for certain periods.I am open to suggestions for choosing the input data, both raw data (interest rates, stock market indices, gold prices) and elaborated data (if there is not a library that includes them I can always program them).The development will be done in Python using TensorFlow.The results of the simulator can be seen here (as soon as I have the first models).There is plenty of quotation data, the rest is better if they are publicly available or more or less simple.Thanks in advance to the charitable souls who can contribute with their suggestions.",

While reading the OP's idea I was thinking about the pricing initially. For example, their program would give us updated price data in the current timeline as well as some future predictions or something. Since they have added the term \"raw data\" addition and previous data it supposed to be related to price quotes only?@Op can always fetch the data from price sites like CMC, which has already done great work by adding the bitcoin price data since the beginning. I am pretty sure as you start coding you will have another level of idea's by fetching the data from multiple markets and thus pin poininting towards highly accurate price quote. Strategy is to collect and verify data from hundreds of sources together if its an AI.",

It performed relatively well in bullish markets but struggled to detect changes in trends.The idea is to improve it using AI. I want to be able to predict, at least, the trend and, if possible, the approximate price for the next day or week.Basically, I will try to use price, trading volumes, moving averages, market sentiment indicators, inflation rates, and interest rates.Maybe in future iterations, I can add a news processing system to improve it, but that is not the primary focus for the initial development.First, I want to develop it, and if it proves useful, I could sell it, use it to make money, or make the source freely available.I will work with Python, and if I decide to make it freely available, I'm still unsure whether I will make it open source or use a server.",

It performed relatively well in bullish markets but struggled to detect changes in trends.My personal thesis is that most abrupt trend changes come from more social factors (i.e. not because the numerical trendline crossed the projected SMA line or whatever), and as a result, it is very difficult to predict future trends and price data from a purely quantitative viewpoint. I think the formula that will truly make it will be the one that can incorporate social \"data\" into the mix, which is very difficult to do, but I'd argue not totally impossible. Probably would be rather elementary (in relative terms) using today's capabilities, but you have to build for the future - what is going to exist in 10 years is different from today. Whoever makes a formula or calculation that can somehow quantify and build upon social data, which really should be somewhat possible using todays technology, is on the right path to creating something that will change the world of price prediction calculations.",

They have various options available and plus its always costly when you build up your own server. Hardware server specifically are very rough to manage. You need to have back up servers in a different location than the current location and thus it adds up more cost to the project. Anyways, all of this is only manageable if OP really wants to do this long term and not just for trial purpose as freshman. They will surely need good amount of money to pour into this before perfectly running server can get established. Also, heartiest congratulation to OP. Do get involved with GitHub community and have all your answers easily found.",

And, if the accuracy of such simulator is very well then I think it can be a sellable piece of software, and the whales might pay you for such simulator without rethinking.If you're planning to add the function of trending news, then I think it should be far better to train your AI in a way that if could create better simulative environment and more accurate quotes with the help of news trends. If the AI is able to learn the news and is able to simulate the data and can come up with a high quality quote that's mostly accurate then I'm sure that everyone would love something like this.",

I thought that was what OP meant in the first place, not building his own network and maintaining it on his own. If he wants to do that, I guess it really depends on his budget.

I believe OP is also aware of that, hence why he plans on adding new features in the future. He can definitely ask for a monthly/yearly plan as long as the features are in demand, but I doubt he'd be able to sell the code to other companies that easily. CMIIW.",
