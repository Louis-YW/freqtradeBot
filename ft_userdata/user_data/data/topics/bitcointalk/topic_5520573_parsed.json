For someone of Tony's calibre, having 25 years experience in financial markets should have helped him see that Bitcoin isn't just a Ponzi scheme or what someone created to pass the time but a digital coin with the ability to provide a form of security when conducting your transactions. Bitcoin has been going strong for 16 years and has surpassed expectations and it's okay to admit you were wrong for regarding as something that doesn't have value and won't last long but what step is he taking? Will he join the train or just sit back and regret?",

Its repent time for them because they know how crazy they are for playing fool around and ignore bitcoin before. Now this kind of people would struggle to find how to enter because then again they afraid to find good position to enter since what they think bitcoin is expensive since they only have limited knowledge about it.So this is lesson need to learn by lots of people that they should never act the same as these people did since there would be a time that they would also regret their decision on why they didn't acquire bitcoin at what they think early stage before. For sure there's more room to grow for bitcoin and those entities that continue to doubt about it will remain like that and those people  who believe on bitcoin will experience great growth especially that bitcoin potential doesn't stop there.",

Even though it's doing well now, there's no guarantee it will continue to rise.We can surely say that it will rise, correct itself, and do it again, and again - but when exactly - yeah, that's a volatile nature for it for you.Though in my opinion, we would see the drop in the price after some mark, $100K+, of course.",

After 10 years, many things change and if we take Bitcoin halvings into consideration, 2013 is 1 year after a first halving, and perhaps it takes Michael Saylor one or up to two more Bitcoin halvings in 2016 and 2020, before he changed his mind on Bitcoin and invested money in Bitcoin.With time, Bitcoin becomes stronger and can change many people.Quote from: https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/Past halving event datesThe first halving event occurred on the 28th of November, 2012 (UTC) at block height 210,000The second halving event occurred on the 9th of July, 2016 (UTC) at block height 420,000The third halving event occurred on the 11th of May, 2020 (UTC) at block height 630,000The fourth halving event occurred on the 20th of April, 2024 (UTC) at block height 840,000",
