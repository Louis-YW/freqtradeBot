  "content": "Today I was listening to my junior sibling and a friend of his having a conversation about a Ponzi Scheme that they both have invested in and how the friend to my bro has received his profit after the given number of days you need to wait for your profit to mature for withdrawal, and from the conversation that of my bro is yet to mature for withdrawal. As the conversation was still lingering between their two I had to get closer and joined in the discussion acted like one with an interest to also invest too, from which I started asking them questions about the platform, the name, how it works and from what channel do they get informations about the platform.From what they  said::* The platform name -  KDB* How it works - that after investing you have to wait for 5 working days for your investment to mature and yield profit before you can start making withdrawal, and for each person you bring in to register through your link you have a 10% interest of whatever amount they invested.* Channel of information - telegram group channel.After gathering all those informations from them I wanted to explain to them how what they are into is called a Ponzi Scheme and how it can crash at an instant and they lose their money and that it's a syndicate of scammers that's hiding behind the platform waiting for the right time to elope. I felt like talking to them about bitcoin and how's of guaranteed security than any of those schemes or cryptocurrency.  But when I looked at their countenance about this socalled scheme I was moved to hold my peace and let them learn from the hard way, as it will be more understood by them if they learn that way maybe they will give audience and interest to bitcoin when I'll have to introduce it to them after they must have been stinge by the KDB Ponzi Scheme. Because from their expressions there's nothing I will say at that time negative of the scheme that will sound truthful or make sense and I wasn't ready for argument neither.I do want to know if my idea or decision on this is the right way?And also have you come in contact with people that invests their money in any ponzi scheme and tried talking them out and what was their response ? Meaningful opinions are welcome.",

      "body": "IMHO, you did the right thing. Because if they are into that platform so much that they are trusting it blindly and do not even want to listen to you about something that could teach them something besides the fact that there will be money in it too, Then they are just after money, and such schemes always scam people. In my country, many scams have been committed in the last two years, and billions of dollars have been stolen. You could use past events in which such platforms tried to scam people and looted a hell of a lot of money.But according to your scenario, I think they will not trust you; instead, they will start to doubt you and BTC if you lead them to BTC.I think they have to learn the lesson the hard way. And I have also faced many cases like these, but fortunately, in ponzi schemes, these platforms give rewards to early users, and when they build a fortune, they leave and fly away with all the money gathered, and in that process, the last batch who deposited money on the platform faces a loss. As people near me invested in such ponzi schemes, they were able to make decent profits, but the ones they referred to these platforms lost their assets. The bad side is that such people will never accept the fact that they are wrong. And due to them other have lost money.",

Well, there might be some ponzi scheme that doesn't pay their investors when they invested in the ponzi project. It's better to stay away from it and as you have said, It easy to crash not because of the project failing but because of the one who runs it which is to scam people with their so called project.",

The best decision is to leave them alone and let them learn a painful lesson. But in general, after such a lesson, instead of thinking its right or wrong, people prefer to deny it completely. There is a saying I like very much; free cheese is only in a mousetrap. I say this to everyone who tries to make money from air like ponzi schemes, and if they listen they will lucky and they will rid of it from less loss; but if they will won't listen they will learn in a painful lesson.",

Meaningful opinions are welcome.At times it is good to let people learn from the hard way, but when it comes to speaking the truth, it is one thing we should never shy away from, not minding whether the people we are telling it to will accept it or not, because by keeping silence, we put them at danger of losing far more than what they would have lost if only someone told them the truth earlier on, even though they may be doubting, but might likely trade with caution. So for me, I will advise you to go back to your young bro, and let him know that what is investing his money in, may likely crash someday, and as such should invest an amount he can always afford to lose so that if it crashes one day, he wouldn't get affected that much.",

Meaningful opinions are welcome.Talking to people who are moved by what they hear from others is very difficult because greed will push them to achieve the same thing others have achieved, which always leads to being scammed.Most of these Ponzi schemes have been introduced to them through Telegram channels and sometimes through the influencers they follow on social media, and most of the time these influencers are just doing the ads for their own selfish interests.Ponzi schemes always look attractive because the scammers have done so much research about the previous Ponzi schemes that succeeded that they will further develop their own in a convincing way to make people think that it is legit.

I don’t know but somewhere within our DNA or subconscious, we do hope our family members, relatives or friends that we do do care about don’t walk down the same road we did once or are way too familiar with to lead just no where.I do understand that, when you try to teach a younger person or even an old person of something they feel they know too well about, especially one that has got some evidence to it, they build a wall about what they wish or hope to believe is true. The approach to it, create some relativism with it from what has been before. Let them get the clear picture and where it always ends, should they hope continue the part and you caution them enough to instill in them some level of curiosity and skepticism so they don’t get to invest big.When it goes down, then they would understand and learn to trust in the things you know and experience have got to teach them.",
