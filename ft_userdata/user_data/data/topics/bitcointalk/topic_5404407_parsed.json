Do it for yourself but also your family & friends. Everybody wants to see the best version of you. You can seek professional help to start your journey but a lot of success in recovery is a positive mindset & motivation to succeed.",

      "body": "Reducing addiction can only start when one knows and understand that they have an addiction. Substance disorders must be recognized willingly. In some cases, it is forcefully because of harm that can be done. Harm can be done to family and friends. Seeking professional help can guide one through reducing addiction and hopefully put an end. In some cases, there can be mental or physical illnesses that have been undiagnosed and only a professional can help. Surrounding yourself with those that understand that your addiction does run your life. Going to group therapy sessions and sharing your stories with others. Reflecting, exercises, and even meditation can help reduce addiction.",

I do not believe swapping addiction with another, yes....you remove a possible bad cycle, but you always will have something to come back to. I'm a person looking for other people's attention, so doing my bad habits in public gives me some kind of response if I do something \"wrong\". That may be one underlying factor for not overuse shit",
