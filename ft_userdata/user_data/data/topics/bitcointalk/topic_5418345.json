  "content": "We have recently witnessed firewood and wood stove sales rise dramatically in response to higher electrical bills and natural gas shortages.QuoteRising fuel costs spark rush to buy firewood and stoves for home heatingEarlier this year, National Grid, which supplies natural gas and electricity across much of the Capital Region and upstate New York, predicted that heating bills will rise 31 percent during the five-month winter heating period that starts in November. The average residential customer is expected to pay $651 over the five-month period, or an increase of $155. It’s the biggest increase in more than a decade.Other forms of heating are going up as well.Propane, derived from natural gas and which is popular in rural locations without gas line hookups, was selling for $3.46 a gallon in September, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency, NYSERDA. In 2020 it was $2.46 a gallon.Electricity is up almost 46 percent year over year as of June, according to NYSERDA.With high demand, wood costs are also rising. Some providers like Advantage Tree Service in Delmar, have held prices at $395 per cord delivered (within a five mile radius) for the past two years.But others are charging more this year, although some charged under $300 in past years.A cord is 128 cubic feet of stacked wood, or 4-by-8 feet of 4-foot long split logs.Homeowners also are shopping for more wood stoves.Wood stoves are currently in short supply in part because of tougher EPA emissions rules that took effect in 2020. Stoves made prior to May 2020, when the new regulations took effect, had to be dismantled.The newer stoves are far cleaner and more efficient than their older cousins, but the new regulations took tens of thousands of stoves, that had already been manufactured, off the market.https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Rising-fuel-costs-spark-rush-to-buy-firewood-and-17507751.phpIt appears fire wood and wood burning stoves could be the next bitcoin. These trends emphasize high price volatility which can occur in response to market trends and shifting demand. If it were possible to purchase crypto tokens pegged to the value of firewood and wood stoves, it would be profitable. Although not the most ethical financial move given the profits would come at some expense of negative consumer sentiment. With war in ukraine and other crisis on the horizon. It is possible markets will witness other such fluctuations in the future. While we cannot necessarily prevent these large scale crisis from occurring. We can prepare for the future by investing in things that will be future profitable to reduce negative fallout from inflation and other market losses of efficiency.In the past I covered agriculture and food being one potential market to HODL if food shortages occur. Are there other examples of good HODL content for future market trends?Given how the cost of lumber and wood has increased. Perhaps raw materials are worth looking into. Rising fossil fuel prices could negatively impact offshore sources of raw materials, which might increase demand in local markets. If this occurs, could it be leveraged and invested in for HODL motives.While precious metals are often emphasized as being good recession and inflation performing asets. Due to metals like gold having real world application in electronics and aerospace indutriess in addition to limited supply. There is an angle to precious metals HODL where we lack a sound infrastructure for using precious metals assets as a form of barter or trade. Perhaps this could become a larger issue in the future if rolling blackouts and similar issues intensify.Long story short do we have good buy ins aside from firewood and wood stoves?",

I live in a country where the generator industry is a very big and profitable one. Electricity is an essential need, hence people would always seek for alternative sources of power if the supply is epileptic. Investment in that sector might be very viable.But generators also need fuel to function and the price of fuel is also high. And generators that can power appliance such as heaters should have high capacity which makes them very expensive. The smoke from generators are very dangerous that it can kill an entire household slowly. The noise from these generator sets are also very annoying. Investment in this sector might be very profitable but generators are one of the major contributors of global environmental problems especially in developing nation's. It is a major environmental pollutant.",

Anyways, we always compare every news to the bitcoin world that is little unwelcoming. Imagine the world without bitcoin or crypto currency’s; you had no option but to live with the grim reality of inflation. We don’t have to burden bitcoin all the time if bomb explodes in the Ukraine somewhere. Let us accept that we are into recession, we are having worst leaders around the globe who are not handling the situation correctly post covid and in-war situations. They have missed few bricks along the way while building a wall. It was supposed to collapse. Just save up money, keep bitcoin in HODL position, Stock up supplies and wait for the recession to dilute. That’s what we can do.",

Quote from: Hydrogen on October 25, 2022, 11:47:25 PMIt appears fire wood and wood burning stoves could be the next bitcoin. These trends emphasize high price volatility which can occur in response to market trends and shifting demand. Firewood is not same with bitcoin. The use of wood burning to generate fire may be getting attention and demand for it can be on the increase but not to compare with bitcoin need. Wood burning is already having a limitation because of the global warming and ozone layer that is affected because of the activities of cutting down trees and bush for firewood, building and others. There is a big disadvantage to go back to that time, I don't see the possiblity and there are regulation on that against cutting down trees and bush burning. For woodburning, the world is changing and major reason is cutting down trees. This can cause natural disasters flooding that is happening in the world is part of it. The US is giving help to some countries on flooding disaster already.To compare demand and supply, bitcoin is far more in demand and wood fetching is already in disadvantage for global warming, heat, ozone layer effect.Using of stove to cook is still expensive. You have to use kerosene and that is not cheap. Bitcoin transfer is cheaper, less than $0.1",

I do not think firewood and wood-burning stoves will be the next Bitcoin.  This problem can be easily fixed if someone or some country devotes themselves to planting the sources of these materials.  In just 5 to 10 years, the problem or the supply of firewood will go up in scale.  This commodity has a possible infinite supply, unlike Bitcoin which has a fixed supply.  So I don't think the current increase in firewood demand is comparable to Bitcoin.Quote from: Hydrogen on October 25, 2022, 11:47:25 PMWith war in ukraine and other crisis on the horizon.

It will not remain so and the only alternative for a long time as to it, there are alternatives too, just that some are energy dependent at the moment. One good and ecofriendly alternative to Firewood fireplace for keeping the home warm this period where electricity and gas prices are high and with the energy concerns is the alcoholic gels that do not give out smoke or fumes, and you can form a fireplace for heating your home with them.

The month with the most snow in Copenhagen is February, with an average snowfall of 1.8 inches.vsThe average winter snowfall in New York City is about 25 inchesSecond, stop being so dramatic about everything.We've been through covid where everyone was hoarding bullets and toilet paper, we've been to another grab-everything food rush and the stores are full, we're going to go through this so-called gas shortage and the ones investing in wood will see they've bought a ton of overpriced wood that they will either see decaying or sell for a fraction of the price.Remember what happened to lumber prices in the US?https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs",

Firewood is a good idea to store if you have the space did it. You need large amounts of wood if you want to use it as the main source of heating during winter. People who live in an apartment and not a house will probably have issues finding enough space. Storing value in gold and silver is probably the best idea, as long as its in small amounts that would make it easy to trade. One thing that I have started to store at home more is food. If things are going worse in the world and we are going to see more wars and crisis than food could become a commodity by itself that everybody will accept for trading. I am a huge fan of the climbing/military food that is packaged without any water. It has no real expiration date if stored correctly and it takes up no space and is light to carry. Together with a water purification system that you can always filter and get clean water, this is great to prepare for bad times. This would also help a lot if inflation keeps making food even more expensive next year.",

For someone who is on the other side of the world and lives in tropical conditions, you are pretty sure you know something, but things on the ground are completely different from what you read.Still don't believe it? Here, read what @stompix post -> Eu gas and electricity prices drop 80% to 2021 level, another apocalypse avertedGasoline prices in the USA declined due to strategic petroleum reserves being tapped to -temporarily- boost supply.Whatever fluctuations in natural gas, commodities and power occur. You have to consider microeconomic vs macroeconomic trends. Prices can temporarily increase or decrease. There is no permanence or stability without long term sustainability. Supply versus demand is one of the main indicators used with destruction of gas pipelines being associated with diminished supply and higher demand.NATO and russia are discussing dirty bombs & nuclear war and you're claiming the apocalypse has been averted?I think you have not been paying attention.Quote from: stompix on October 27, 2022, 07:12:40 PMNope:https://resoilfoundation.org/en/environment/eu-forests-growth/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/forest-europe-environment/So, real efforts are not futile, forest in Europe is growing which means it can be done elsewhere too if there is the actual will to do so.Take a good look at the following image.Image link:  https://i.imgur.com/Ve9ta2S.jpgAbove image - 50,000 saplings planted as part of an afforestation project in india in 2010.Less than 2% of trees planted in these massive state sponsored afforestation programs survive long enough to become actual trees.Which leads to claims of forest regrowth being exaggerated.Old growth rain forest in the amazon and around the world are being devastated quickly. With efforts made to grow new trees being poorly structured and designed and generally doomed to failure.Quote from: hugeblack on October 29, 2022, 08:56:57 AMAre all these fears for this winter, or are there expectations that prices will continue to rise for several years to come?Trees are a deflationary asset, being that they're chopped down at a faster rate than they're being regrown.But of course markets can be manipulated through supply in centralized industries. We've seen this in past years with aluminum prices being controlled through artificially created supply shortages and shipping delays. The high volatility price chart for aluminum over the past 2 years makes it appear as a scarce commodity at times, even though it is always in abundant supply.Chart volatility for many commodities and assets has skyrocketed in the past 2 years. Price charts in commodities have shown more volatility than bitcoin and crypto in some instances. Which is extremely strange market behavior. This will stand out more to those who remember when bitcoin's volatility was criticized by banks and others who boasted about the lack of volatility in more traditional markets.",

You need large amounts of wood if you want to use it as the main source of heating during winter. People who live in an apartment and not a house will probably have issues finding enough space. Storing value in gold and silver is probably the best idea, as long as its in small amounts that would make it easy to trade. One thing that I have started to store at home more is food. If things are going worse in the world and we are going to see more wars and crisis than food could become a commodity by itself that everybody will accept for trading. I am a huge fan of the climbing/military food that is packaged without any water. It has no real expiration date if stored correctly and it takes up no space and is light to carry. Together with a water purification system that you can always filter and get clean water, this is great to prepare for bad times. This would also help a lot if inflation keeps making food even more expensive next year. Reverse could be possible as well. You are assuming that people who live houses do have spaces but considering how much wood would be required to heat up a whole house, and do that during all of winter, I do not think that they would have enough space to do it, maybe if they close off their entire backyard (and if they have a backyard to begin with) at the top and put it there, then I do not think that it would be possible. Apartments on the other hand could have good basement for all the people, and also a parking space, combine those two together and then heat the apartment as a whole from within, then you may have that space. We have similar thing, it's heated water running through all the apartments in our building, and water doesn't require space because you can flush it down and get new constantly, but we would have enough space for wood to do the same thing as well.In both cases, a warehouse specialized in this product could definitely be preferred option for everyone. Still substandard method compared to just using electric heating machines.",
