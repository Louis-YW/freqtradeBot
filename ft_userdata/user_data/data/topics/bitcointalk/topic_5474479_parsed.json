It is obvious that unwanted interests would be attracted, not only from criminals but also from simple acquaintances, friends or worse, relatives!I don't think there is a bonus for those who are presented publicly but it is probably in their interest to be able to present and exploit the event to obtain publicity.",

Are gambling platforms paying an extra money for the publicity? It's not wrong to publicize a mega winner but for security and protection, the company is responsible to keep the identity of the winner so his personal identity will not be exposed and become a target of scammers after winning. Just like winning lottery in our country, the winner's name and physical identity is not exposed so that he will continue to stay anonymous after claiming the cash prize.However, it also depends on the agreement between the bettor and the gambling company. But I'd say no one will really want to be publicize if his safety and security will be at risk after that.",

      "body": "Though publicizing a mega win is being done in other for stakers to know that they can actually win big in gambling and their money paid to them directly but I don't feel it's necessary, the betting company can rather publicize it on their website rather than the individual that won the bet to turn up and claim the bet publicly, due to some security reasons i think the identity of the mega winner ought to be kept private. In gambling, no one should be trusted as anything can happen, even the betting company can possibly set the winner up to some hoodlums that will take the money away from the winner so in my own opinion it isn't necessary, though some betting company will want to use that medium to promote their betting site but I feel everything should be done within their site.",

On most occasions, these gamblers that have felt the thrill of winning a large sum amount will accept the offer but still it's on the gamblers discretion whether they'll allow their identity to be publicized or not as the gambling platform or casino can still announced it as a random or mystery winner. Not sure if this apply to other country as well, but this is how it works on my country.",

They do really give out importance about privacy thing because its true thatsomeones life would really be put up in risks if they wont really be that doing so considering that we are talking about huge money on here on which it would really be just that normal that they would be assumingthat announcing the winner publicly would really be putting that someones life at risks knowing that criminal minds would really be that spotting that winner once they do go home.Speaking about denial for exposure then of course they are really that having the rights on now to show themselves on public.Somewhat it is really that a hard part for a lottery or any platform about winning up a certain jackpot or whatever promotion they do have if they wont really show up some winner.You know that people around would really be throwing out those baseless accusations in speaking about legitimacy of a certain thing when they cant be able to see some winneron which i do see the primary reason on why they are really that tending to show off as much as possible for a winner but for huge hits on sports betting sites theni do see that it should really be the same.",

They can reject any public announcement if they will reason out that it can be a life threatening situation for them when they're announced as mega jackpot winner.The gambling foundation or organization that's assigned for that can just release a statement that the winner doesn't want to reveal himself/herself because of such reasons.But the backlash will be on them as if there's really a winner or none.",

And this young man went to the extent of coming with his family members which makes his security situation more complicated.I don't know if these betting firms pay extra money for this display but I would prefer to accept some deductions from the win me to avoid such risky public display. Alternatively, I can put on a face mask if it is compulsory to attend such an event. If they restrict me from covering my identity, then I will go alone and immediately relocate to another country where I am unknown.",

The gambling company do that as a marketing strategy for their business to gain more trust, reputation to increase. So it looks like mandatory for you to get the price back then but with the increase of insecurities, maybe the winner will have to be protected somehow based on their agreement but the gambling company will have to go public that they paid up winning to the winner. This is also like the game shows or reality TV shows, they nevertheless show and announce the winner, 2nd and third runner up at the end of the show .Maybe they can disguise a gambling winner but I'm sure the company will have to announce their winner.",

We cant really be that so sure on what are their terms and if you do win up something on a particular bet then the company would be mandatory for you to be exposed thenwhat you would gonna do? Would you still minding about your identity and wont really be getting the money?If possible if they would really be granting your request for some privacy then it would be not bad to give a try and they might consider it but if not thenyou wont really be having no choice but to deal from it.",

Most setups will allow you to stay anonymous, but it's highly dependent on the laws of the country your in which could restrict the publicity that the company could force upon you, but just out of general decency a company that gives away free prizes of this size will often allow people to hide their identity. However I can see in certain countries where these sums are even more life changing, that it could actually put people at great danger if the poverty line is much lower. There is no single answer to this, because there are so many different configurations around the world and you should look at the particular rules of the game you're playing.",

If someone win big in lotto you won't see his or her face or name in the media. But I not sure why in recent years, even here in our country, you will see in the newspapers or what other social media that we have, the name and the picture of the winner itself. But I guess it will be ok if you requested not to be named and become anonymous as obviously you want to protect yourself from free loaders. Because for sure they will and find you and obviously they want you to give them some free money from your winnings.",

But if not, the site should not force that person to disclose his identity for safety and security reasons.In some cases, they will post the photos in public but the face of the winner is blurred or tampered. In my opinion, it depends on the winner himself, because he is the one who will take care of himself afterwards.But as much as possible, it is better to hide your identity so you don't need to deal with possible fraudsters that may come after you.",

Yes, it might not be on the time of your claiming of price but rather it would really be making up some toll later on as you do go simply with your life routine. So as much as possible then rejecting such set up is recommended.",

Because when compared to other platforms, there are still gambling platforms that behave fraudulently and don't want to lose money by blocking their visitors' accounts because the visitors got a big win.And indeed, if this victory were to be made public to the general public, this would be a big risk for the young man. Apart from his friends and relatives approaching the young man to ask for a share, it is true that the threat of robbery and other crimes will continue to lurk the young man.But apart from that, on the other hand, the gambling platform also doesn't want to lose too much because it provides big wins. So as a substitute, this gambling platform is trying to take advantage of this situation as a promotional event, so that the gambling platform can be more popular and attract more visitors. So like it or not, this gambling platform has to cover big wins. that the young man was involved in his gambling. . And this is done to prove that this platform behaves fairly and responsibly towards each of its visitors.",
