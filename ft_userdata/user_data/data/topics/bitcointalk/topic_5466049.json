For, I am currently using Bybit as they have this amazing user interface and user experience, It is very user-friendly especially their mobile application, and easy to use. Another I am using is Binance.6. I think for this, it is more likely you will use peer-2-peer off the exchange, like not using any crypto exchange platform, like buying/selling to someone like personally or having in contact in social media or any communication just to be able buy and sell crypto.",

What is certain is that the person must be prepared for all the consequences/risks.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM2. Do you only trade Bitcoin or you trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?Broadly speaking, I invest and trade in bitcoin and some altcoins (crypto). But most of my money is invested in bitcoin, which I earmark as my long-term investment asset. And the rest of my money is spread into several altcoins (crypto), which are intended for short-term and medium-term trading.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM3. How many trading strategies do you use and which is your favorite?I personally don't use too many crypto trading techniques. But I only use the DCA technique, which in my opinion is more than enough to make my crypto trading continue to grow.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM4. As a crypto trader, do you focus on technical analysis only, fundamental analysis only or you rely on a combination of both to informed trading decisions?Of course, I use both techniques. Because in my opinion the two techniques are very important and must exist with each other. And not only these two techniques, I also use sentimental analysis to see emotional market movements.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM5. As a crypto trader what is your favorite crypto exchange you use for trading?For now I only use binance. Because binance is the best crypto exchange in the world and also has a huge trading volume. And besides that, binance also has a good reputation.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM6. Are there other ways you trade crypto without using an exchange ?Basically, I definitely can't. Because the exchange is a place for cryptocurrencies to be bought and sold.However, this is possible by using P2P directly, without intermediaries such as exchanges, and by sending crypto from wallet to wallet.",

It can be through arbitrage trading, trading in the spot market, but those that are most regarded as a crypto trader are those that trade in the derivative market. But all those that I have mentioned are all crypto traders as well.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM2. Do you only trade Bitcoin or you trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?I do not have a perfect answer for that. Most of my trading this year are bitcoin trading, but I trade altcoins as well. Altcoins are more volatile and are riskier. I can change from one to another at anytime, which can not make my answer here to be accurate.But I like to let people know, especially the newbie traders, that altcoins are riskier and dangerous. But not that trading is also not risky generally, but bitcoin is less volatile.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM3. How many trading strategies do you use and which is your favorite?This can not be answered because strategies are just strategies. Illustration:You have 0.005 BTC. You are using 0.001 BTC to trade. You use stop lose, take profit. You do not use SL or TP but prefer averaging. You use indicators like BB and RSI. All these that make you complete a successful trades either you gain or lose are the strategies. So you can not ask how many strategies someone use to trade. Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM4. As a crypto trader, do you focus on technical analysis only, fundamental analysis only or you rely on a combination of both to informed trading decisions?I focus on technical and fundamental analysis.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM5. As a crypto trader what is your favorite crypto exchange you use for trading?I use Binance, Bybit, OKX, Huobi global and Kucoin. Recently I am using BitMart but not really.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM6. Are there other ways you trade crypto without using an exchange ?No. Even about exchanging cypto to fiat or fiat to crypto and if I do not use a centralized exchange, decentralized exchanges that I use are still exchanges.",

One thing you could find among traders is that some are technically dependent traders, while some are traders that are fundamentally dependent or make one of the two a subordinate in their market analysis.

Mostly for trading, I like to use the centralized exchange, as I don't prefer that to everyone but seriously it saves a lot of headaches. Decentralized trading is something that i used to prefer but I'm not regular to that, for some reason, But it doesn't matter at all because my traders are mostly on longer time frames so mostly my funds are not on the non-custodial wallet. In CEX I used to prefer the Kucoin exchange.Quote from: alastantiger on September 07, 2023, 08:51:07 PM6.

How many trading strategies do you use and which is your favorite?I like to have more than 3 strategies. One for scalping, one for day trading, and if those fails, I try to use long term strategy to make a profit or close the trade with minimum loss. [Note: I use SL to prevent huge losses.]Quote4. As a crypto trader, do you focus on technical analysis only, fundamental analysis only or you rely on a combination of both to informed trading decisions?Technical analysis is always going to be my first choice. It's based on algorithm and calculation. But with fundamental analysis, it's a bit hard to predict and anything could happen. So I just watch the market when the market is driven by fundamental events and not open any trades. Quote5. As a crypto trader what is your favorite crypto exchange you use for trading? I like to be on the safe side. My personal choice is Binance though it is facing some tough times right now. So I won't recommend it. My next choice is Kucoin. But here's the thing. I keep my assets in them only in times when I really need to. Like open trades. After that, I withdraw my assets to a personal wallet. Not your key, not your coins. Quote6.
