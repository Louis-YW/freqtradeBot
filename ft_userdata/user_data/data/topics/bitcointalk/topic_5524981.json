This will be about how bitcoin is very much needed and required to get the advantage against America's enemies and the biggest enemies mentioned in this article are China, Russia and Iran.I am a bitcoin investor and holder very much similar to all of you in this forum. However, if you are being honest with yourselves, will this new storyline be a real occurrence for our eyes to witness? The skeptical me is thinking this might be another beginning of a bitcoin circle jerk hehehehe.China is waging a multi-decade plan to displace the United States' greatest asset: the dollar. The dollar is critical to the United States' economic and geopolitical power as the global reserve currency. Without it, our influence would weaken, and our debt would become a bigger problem. This is precisely what the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin want.China and Russia have shed billions of dollars worth of U.S. Treasury holdings while growing their stockpiles of gold. Our sanctions, designed to separate countries from the \"Western\" economic system, are no longer enough of a deterrent for those who can control financial activity within their borders and project their power outward.China sees financial technology and cryptocurrency as tools to extend its financial power and surveillance globally. The United States must respond in two ways: export our financial technology and systems worldwide and embrace bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset instead of stifling innovation.Lawmakers and politicians on both sides of the aisle, most notably President-elect Donald Trump, recognize the power of holding bitcoin on the nation’s balance sheet as a hedge against inflation. This direction would also strengthen U.S. resilience against economic challenges posed by China’s financial strategies.Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/30/why-a-u-s-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-is-vital-to-fending-off-china",

      "body": "In the US's dominance over the world, the dollar plays a vital role in its strength, as it is a global currency. At the same time, it has its own native currency, and through it, the US can outcompete many other states financially. However, its rivals are also seeking an alternative financial system that can challenge the US system. For that reason, they created the BRICS system, which aims to sovereignize their financial system and dedollarize that region. Additionally, they established a blockchain-based system known as BTICS Pay, which can facilitate transactions between their members. If the US moves towards cryptocurrency and strengthens its system, then China or Russia will also move towards Bitcoin adoption. Furthermore, the Beijing court has granted people the right to adopt cryptocurrency as their own asset. If both sides fall into the same system, then tensions will escalate, trade costs will increase, and a new type of financial war will take place in the near future.This is what I understand from your post and the surrounding context. Maybe I am wrong, or my post makes no sense, but I am clear about all the things. If you find any mistakes, please mark them,it will help me correct them and increase my precise knowledge.",

The author of that article is clearly trying to create a fake narrative. And I'm afraid in the near future that fake narrative will become a reality if the decision makers in the US believe it and start trying to centralize and weaponize bitcoin. In which case China will change stance and will have to react which is when that narrative becomes true.QuoteWe we only find out if he'll make good his threat when we see what happens to the first country that replaces the US with gold, bitcoin or whatever currency. Dedollarisation started a couple of years ago and countries have been \"replacing\" the dollar. The thing is, dedollarisation is a process not a switch that is flipped overnight. It is also not abandoning the dollar, it is about de-weaponizing it.Take China itself. They are still the biggest \"user\" of the dollar but when you dig deep you can see how they are dedollarising. Like their oil trades with Arabs on the southern shores of The Persian Gulf. They are increasingly using Yuan instead of the dollar there...",

Honestly, I don't think the idea of ​​bitcoin reserves will soon become a reality. I don't think Trump will focus and put all his energy into that idea because it's more complicated than we think and as far as I know, the issue of national reserves belongs to the Federal Reserve and Congress. the president has no authority to decide on this issue. As for China, they have not even lifted the ban on bitcoin, let alone shown interest in hoarding bitcoin and turning it into a national reserve. If you follow the news about the Chinese government, in recent years, especially 2024, they focus on buying gold and gold, nothing more, nothing less. I know there are a lot of rumors going around about the idea of ​​adding bitcoin to countries strategic reserves but I think it's all just hype. This could be the biggest catalyst that puts us into the biggest bull season of the 4-year cycle, and could also be the reason that puts us into the bear season by the end of 2025, IMO.In October 2024 alone, central banks bought 60 tonnes of gold for their reserves, the highest monthly purchase so far this year. This shows that their confidence in gold has never waned as many people think.https://www.jpost.com/business-and-innovation/precious-metals/article-832001",
