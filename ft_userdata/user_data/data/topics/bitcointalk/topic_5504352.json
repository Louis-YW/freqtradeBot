They will be vicious. They will be ruthless. They will do things that you wouldn’t believe.”",

      "body": "Quote NASHVILLE — Former President Donald Trump said that if he were returned to the White House, he would ensure that the federal government never sells off its bitcoin holdings. But he stopped short of proposing a formal federal reserve of digital currency.What did he mean by this? Is he referring to Bitcoin holdings of the United States acquired by seizure, or have they made any Bitcoin acquisitions for the purpose of reserve? If there have been any, I will love to read about it.QuoteOn day one, I will fire Gary Gensler,” Trump said, referencing the Biden-appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who has taken an aggressive approach to crypto regulation.That's a bold statement he made right there. No doubt the SEC chairman has really been against bitcoin, fighting against everything that the currency stands for. He sees it as a big threat, but saying he will fire him on his first day in office is a bold statement, but yet I see it as an unwise one. It's wiser to say that he will be relieved from his duties as he can still remain in the agencies serving without, although earlier before now I read somewhere they said Gary Gensler will either resign or retire from office in ffice on the year 2025.",

I read in the local media that there were about 8 promises that he made. If all is fulfilled, I feel optimistic that Crypto in the future will have more and more room for development. But indeed, I always remember the political year in my country. There will be many promises made to gain the sympathy of many people. But once they got what they wanted, they forgot about the promise he made. Or they give excuses because promises are not fulfilled. I hope that doesn't happen in the US.",

Does anyone believe that Trump alone as acting president (if elected) can make important decisions? The president is just a figurehead, certainly not someone who decides in which direction things will take place. The fact that he is persistently talking now (after 15+ years of Bitcoin's existence) is only for the reason that huge money is involved.At the same time, the US has obviously already adopted some long-term strategy regarding Bitcoin and crypto, regardless of whether the president is Biden or Trump or someone else.",

I will take Trump seriously on his proposed strategic national crypto stockpile if he frees Ross Ulbricht. In a previous statement, Trump mentioned that he would release Ross Ulbricht if elected, but yesterday at the bitcoin conference, he only affirmed his commitment to a reduced sentence, not an immediate release. Regarding the firing of Gary Gensler, he also mentioned this issue at the bitcoin conference today. If he is really as serious about bitcoin as he claims, he will do these things as soon as he takes office. But about turning bitcoin into a reserve asset, I'm really skeptical because I don't think he can decide and approve it easily. Congress and the Fed are the ones who decide this, a president can make proposals but cannot easily pass them himself.https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1817304414807343407",

But I think campaign sentences always have ambiguous meanings. This means that the sentence can later change in time. I did read 8 important points, but it seems that they all point to policies that support the development of Crypto in the United States. This condition certainly makes me happy because the world's crypto episentrum is currently in America. The policies that emerge always have a major effect on crypto movement patterns. So if it is concluded that if Trump is able to become president again, it will be very good. But I also hope that Trump's opponents can also provide good policies later if Trump loses.",

When someone wants office, they make promises left and right to get the most support from the voters. And when the goal is achieved, as time shows, such politicians do not fulfill half of their promises. In order to justify that they have not fulfilled this or that promise, they nod and blame other authorities, which seem to stand in the way and prevent them from making this or that decision. Politicians who have been in politics should report to the public about what they have already done, particularly regarding Bitcoin, which has been around for years and has already survived several presidents. Tell the public what exactly this or that politician tried to do for Bitcoin and what prevented him from doing it. Trump has already been president and I think he should report what exactly he tried to do for cryptocurrencies and bitcoins and why he didn't do it, where he failed, where he got in the way, where he didn't take into account the potential of cryptocurrencies and how does he want to fix it when he becomes president? After all, Bitcoin didn't come into being yesterday and Trump isn't running for office for the first time, he's not new to politics. Of course, you want to believe in the positive and that everything will be fine, time will tell.",
