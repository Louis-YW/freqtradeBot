THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT BITCOIN WAS INTENDED FOR!Where did all of the people go who supported bitcoin as an individual freedom and sovereignty coin?",

Mining rewards have decreased, and now miners will increase the fees somehow as well. Ordinal has made everything difficult right now regarding transaction fees. Due to a lot of ordinals transactions, the Bitcoin network has become congested. Bitcoin developers must find a solution. Otherwise, day by day, Bitcoin will be far from its goal. It would just be treated as an investment asset.",

We need bitcoin developers to make a proposal that will benefit the future of bitcoin in regards to transaction fee. You are correct that the mining reward in Bitcoin will gradually decrease over time, with transaction fees expected to become a more significant portion of miners' income. This transition is built into the Bitcoin protocol as part of its deflationary monetary policy.It may take time for consensus to be reached on specific proposals, but the development community remains committed to improving the scalability and usability of the Bitcoin network while maintaining its core principles.",

I have a feeling that someone wants bitcoin to be a game for the rich, they want to take the poor out of the game. Surely retail investors will not only feel uncomfortable but they will soon look for alternatives and altcoins will be their choice. There have been several threads in the past questioning whether bitcoin like gold and real estate, will become a game for those with a lot of money, and I see that becoming a reality.",

Except if Bitcoin developers can do something to stop these attackers. I really consider them as attackers, not actual users of Bitcoin blockchain.They know that it's more easily to be known if they deploy their inscriptions on Bitcoin blockchains than altcoin blockchains and they see opportunities to make noise, get rich with Bitcoin blockchain. They will not abandon their rich games if the bull market is still here but actual Bitcoin users deserve to use the blockchain in either bull or bear market.",

We have no other choices because of very expensive transaction fee.It is not a good advertisement for Bitcoin because we have keys (private keys), we have coins and we have need to move our bitcoins whenever we want. Can not do it because of expensive transaction fee, is a big barrier to bring more new people to Bitcoin community. It's big fear that you have bitcoin but can not do it, because if you do it, when transaction fee is unrealistic expensive, you will convert your bitcoins to satoshi dust.",
