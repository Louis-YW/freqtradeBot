To make OSCARSWAP stand out among other project it's team need to find a solution to these problems I personally did not get any Arbitrum from that big airdrop, therefore i am not really following all the new projects and stuff that is appearing on the Arbitrum Network. Even i have noticed though, that the Arbitrum chain is very hot at the moment. For me the reason for that is that big airdrop because ten of thousands of people have gotten a significant 500$+ airdrop and a lot of people even got way more. Of course that wealth is now on that chain and therefore those people that were getting the airdrop also want to use that wealth to create even more income from it. That is why the TVL on the Arbitrum chain is so high because everyone is putting their \"free\" money to work.",

People love a good memecoin and shitcouns as long as they are earning from it. Its really hard to grasp the play between these projects but its an easy concept. Who gets early thats profit who get last will have loss on the game.",

ARB have a good hype and attention at this moment, that's why some new project trying to take advantage.It's just same like Polygon, Solana and other at the time they're booming.",

To make OSCARSWAP stand out among other project it's team need to find a solution to these problems The main reason is the airdrop given by the Arbitrum ecosystem. Also, there are a lot of projects built on the Arbitrum ecosystem compared to other ecosystems. I received more than 8000 ARB from the airdrop. Now other ecosystems like starknet and layer zero will follow the arbitrum. Another reason is the big volume of the arbitrum chain.",

But actually in recent days the hype about the meme brings me back to the old feeling, a trick to hit people's greed, I can see many people getting ARBs from the airdrop and also will spend them all on low-quality projects through the guise of greed.",

I completely agree with you that scams and frauds are a major concern for the crypto fraternity, and it's important for projects like Oscar swap to take steps to address these issues.However, I think it's also important to remember that the crypto market is constantly evolving and changing. While yield farming may have led to market saturation in the past, there are always new and innovative ideas that can shake things up and lead to new opportunities.As for the issue of digital marketing, I think you make a valid point. It's crucial to have a strong online presence in order to stand out among other projects. That being said, I believe that the success of a project ultimately comes down to the strength of its team and its ability to execute on its vision.",

To make OSCARSWAP stand out among other project it's team need to find a solution to these problems Why wouldn't they? It's the hottest layer 2 at the moment and people want to try it out so it gets traffic. I would totally launch anything in that right now if i wanted attention to my project. But it will fade after it will get flooded and filled with scams as bep20 did. Best thing about eth high fees was that there wasn't as much scam projects. I mean there was scams but bsc had exponentially more of them as they costed next to nothing. Same thing will happen with ARB sooner or later imho.",

Although there's no exception to it and these are just speculations just as how others are speculating about the projects built through ARB has great future. We will never know if they're going to be like but one thing for sure is that, those who have received profit from the arb airdrop really did well and it's an overall success for them thinking that anything related to arb will become successful.",
