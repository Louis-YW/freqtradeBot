I was expecting a more scientific way to be honest.So you do really like to see something new? Like digital random number generator or something like that rather than with spinning? I do see for it to be considerable as long it would be fair and there's no rigging that would really affect those spins or choosing which it is really much preferred on having that kind of transparency to ensure fairness. Having 20-25 winners on each category or prize poolreally really that something new where usually lotteries do only have 1 winner but since there are some consolations then it might really be getting some attention.",

I believe during a bear market, if there will truly be a bear market, it's debatable until the end of June/end of Q2, a lottery is the most perfect and profitable form of gambling to operate.
