This practice can be most effective to a newbie if he focuses on a single coin trading such as Bitcoin.",

Does copy trading make a profit? Maybe, and that's why asking if it's dream or reality can be kind of confusing since we don't have a clear-cut answer. Even considering outside copy trading, just crypto in general, it's definitely possible imo. I mean I know some people who got off really well when the coin they were invested in popped off, like MATIC in the past. Should you follow them? Well if you're simply here to gamble then yea sure. If you want to last long though, then start setting up plans that you're gonna follow to a T for a long time, since planning for the long term is probably the easiest start a newbie trader can get.",

Do not rely on advice from other people to trade because their advice may not work for you. If you feel that your expertise is in analysis, you should learn more from trusted sources so that you don't depend on other people to analyze. And I suggest not using copy trading because you don't know how someone trades, and it's risky. After all, if you want to use copy trading, you have to find a trader who has good trading skills so that you can also earn like him. And I don't recommend you to try it because it's risky.",

      "body": "It is often said that making money through trading is quite simple, but in reality, it is not as easy as it seems. Many individuals boast about their trading successes, claiming to have earned a significant amount of money through their trades. However, we all know that trading is not consistently effortless. It may be relatively easier to trade during a bullish market since most coins tend to rise in such conditions. However, during a bearish market, it becomes unpredictable as nobody can accurately determine the lowest point. In my opinion, the best strategy is to hold onto high-potential coins and gradually accumulate them during a bear market, rather than investing all at once. It is advisable to make partial purchases at different levels.",

Trading is not a simple thing you can learn from watching videos for a single day or month. The fact itself that there's no certainty with price actions, is already something to remind us that profit won't be earned easily. Not unless there would be someone who's been in this industry to guide you which would fasten your progress in trading. Much better to not be too hopeful especially if you're just new into something in order to manage the risk and avoid betting too much than what you can actually handle. I've been trading for months and I am aware that I still lack knowledge to be fully profitable in trading.",

Unless you are a long term trader who is going to purchase your coins and tokens today and hold until the next bull run, so you can finally sell it for profit. However, if you are talking about a daily trader who is going to take advantage of the small prices fluctuations which happen all day long for daily income, I believe you will be just gambling with your funds, because you can fall for bull or bear traps at any moment, what will inevitably happen at some point.A bull trap happens when you smell the market is going to pump, so you buy, but it's a false alarm and prices fall right after.A bear trap is when you think the market is going down, so you sell, but it suddenly recovers right after and you don't have any more coins left on your portfolio.",
