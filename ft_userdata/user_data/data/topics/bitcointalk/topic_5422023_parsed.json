As mentioned already, cheating may not be totally avoided in gambling but then casino houses have a mechanism that will detect any form of abuse or attempt cheating from players on their platform. And that is the reason, we see a lot of players' accounts getting a ban on locked due to such acts.w",

Although there could be exploits that certain players could see, but I doubt that the casinos won't find it, and worst you can't get all the money including your capital and the supposed \"winnings\".Even in land based casinos it's the same, hard to cheat on them, and those who have tried is not very successful and put to jail.So not taking any risk though. Much better to play fair and that's what makes it more exciting isn't it?",

And if their fraud department detects some red flag, then obviously your account could get ban and your withdrawals halted. Others might take the risk, but if you get caught then that's it for you.",

But you have to think about what if the casino find out what you did, of course the result is an immediate ban. You can create a scam accusations, but I do see it having a bearing and worst thing is, you can't get your money out of that casino as they have every right to confiscate it.",

Usually cheats happen on a bonuses and promotions, I didn’t know if this is also possible during the game. Casinos are prepared for this, they know how to handle this situation and once you get caught, expect for the site to freeze your account.",

That's the only thing I can think of if you mean about cheating in an online casino. Not that I do that but that's what I can say since I participated in bug bounty before which the purpose is different and not to use it for cheating but to prevent it from being exploited by gamblers. Unfortunately, some people did manage to do that but in the end, some of them are caught by the casino and didn't get any funds at all. I suggest to just gamble honestly rather than cheating in gambling.",

How to prevent cheating? People will always take advantage of those loopholes that the casino has even promos they take advantage of it which is considered cheating once you had abused.

Surely if there is a way to cheat the game its the sole responsibility of the gambling casino to patch that bug which allows the gamblers to cheat, in the first place?I am not trying to say that I would cheat, or that cheating is a good thing or that cheating will not get you banned as it goes against the terms of service of almost any online gambling casino that I know of.  I just think its not really up to us, as the gamblers to be the ones who shoulder that responsibility.",

In such games I don't cheat because I don't have anything to win. It doesn't help me in any way to cheat at an online competitive game because if I win, there's no satisfaction because I knew I cheated and if I lose it's even worse because despite cheating I wasn't able to beat the other team, which means I suck at the game. Despite the above, I'd cheat in a casino if I had a way to do it safely. Betting money is different than playing online and if there was a way to beat the house and make some money I'd probably try it out.",
