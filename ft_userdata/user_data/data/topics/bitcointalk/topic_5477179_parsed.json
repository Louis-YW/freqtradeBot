  "content": "Hi All,I'm new to this forum, and investments in general, and have recently received excellent suggestions to get me started, but was wondering how you all diversify your portfolios? To add some context, here is the link to my first post here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5476808.0. I have been browsing through the investment sections on the eToro app and have been looking through the \"copy traders\"  to see what investors that have high percentage of returns are doing, but I don't just want to click buttons and follow blindly, but want to be able to understand not only what I'm doing and why, but, the pro's and con's of each area of investments and the advantages of diversifying with them.The money I have left over each week ranges between 50-70% of my net income, of which I currently allocate 50/50 between the below -Bank Account savings at 4.75% AER/Gross variable interest (paid daily) Purchasing BTC using DCA approachSo far, I've looked at the below options on eToro for diversifying my portfolio -  ETH Various other altcoinsCommodities - Such as SPDR GoldETFs - Such as SPDR S&P 500Sorry if this is has been posted in the wrong section.",

Or a means to get more gold and silver. I'm all for diversification , but some Alts are really worthless with high value... Or really useful to never really take off.Looking at BTC from 4-5 year viewpoints , does your 4-5% apy still matter?",

I don't think I understand your question, but if it relates to the gains of each over the same time frame, then the only reason I'm allocating at 50 / 50 is because I don't intend on withdrawing anything from my BTC investment over the short term and view this as a mid-long term, as opposed to my bank savings which are short-mid term where I will only touch them in emergencies etc, but maybe somewhere down the line I will increase my BTC weekly investment once I'm satisfied with the amount in my savings + I guess I always have an option to purchased in bulk should the price permit.",

In my personal opinion, don't diversify so much that you'll be spreading your capital too thinly, making you have meager profit. We don't need to diversify like a billionaire asset manager because we don't have their billions in capital.Use your limited capital more efficiently, and put them in one or two of your most confident investments. The smaller the capital, your risk acceptance should also go higher.",

For a beginner it's better to just invest on Bitcoin to avoid some stories that are not so good, because it takes extra efforts to know how to invest in other alternative digital currencies, you can still do pretty well in Bitcoin only.The truth is having Bitcoin only is more than enough, you don't have to diversify in anything, I believe that only altcoin investors should take diversification very seriously, because you can't buy one alt and rely on it like Bitcoin, you need more than one, but with Bitcoin, you are good.",

So I imagine it's not a true reflection on their abilities. I sold my alts a few weeks back in which i read about a lot on articles online to turn the money into ETH and later sold that to purchase only BTC, but as luck would have it most of the alts i sold are increasing in value, but I didn't look at that in a result orientated way as they could have just as easily plummeted, and I am confident that my decision to put a nice sum each week into BTC will pay off in the long run. As a beginner, I think I was initially put off purchasing BTC because of the price of a single unit vs the £100 or so each week I'd be investing - I thought it wasn't worthwhile at the time.",

You might be investing in an altcoin that you think might become very profitable in the future, but you can get disappointed and not earn any profit from the token, or you could even run a loss. It's normally possible to diversify your investment by investing in other assets like bonds, gold, and real estate, but when it comes to cryptocurrency investment, I will only advise Bitcoin to be your priority. If you think you have enough money and you just want to try your luck with Altcoin, then you can buy a few and only invest the amount that will not affect you if your fund gets burned.",

This equates to roughly 12000 euros where I live. It makes sense to diversify all other money that is available. In my case that is 55k. Mine is not diversified yet, but I wish to do so.I've heard many economists say how they diversify their portfolio. Stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate.. Most people diversify the majority of their portfolio in 10 different stocks. In my opinion this is not diversification. They just own stocks.Keep in mind that Michael Burry, the man who predicted the 2008 financial crisis and became a billionaire because of it, recently dumped 90% of his stock portfolio because a tsunami worse than 2008 is upon us. It is worse, because debt vs GDP is much worse on a global scale. The growing amount of banks failing, is a warning sign of what Burry predicts. A global economic meltdown.Personally I do not want to own anything that is priced in a debased currency that loses at least 7% of its value each year. My intended investment portfolio is like this:15k euros to cover 7-8 months of living expenses20k euros in bitcoin20k euros in gold10k in silver5k for my wife who is still building a savings accountI feel that I should be going higher in BTC, but I intend to grow that portfolio with DCA.Meanwhile I pay cheap rent. I do not want a mortgage while the cost of living is rising nearly 10% per year.It is so bad that many people I know personally have to default on their mortgage payments, and sell the property at a loss.",
