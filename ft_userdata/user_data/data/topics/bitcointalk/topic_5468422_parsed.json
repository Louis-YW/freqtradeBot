  "content": "Mixin has been in touch with the hacker, directly on the blockchain! They sent a message through the Blockchain and it reads;“Hey, most of the assets you took are our users’s money, so how about giving them back and buy a coffee for yourself for finding a bug on our \"Decentralized system'?” They are offering a $20m bounty to the Lazarus group out of the $200m scammed. No assets has been frozen till now, is the $20m enough to let go $180m? Well update from the Mixin CEOQuote from:  Mixin CEOAfter several days, we have completed most of the asset tally work, and the situation is much more optimistic than expected. The losses are not as significant as estimated. Again, we remind everyone to avoid making transactions, market making, etc., on Mixin Network, for now, to prevent unnecessary losses.",

Yeah, this does look suspicious. Also not clear why they did only announce the hack two days after it actually happened? At this point there are more questions than answers...As to the bug bounty, it could actually work (only if it's not an inside job  ) as the criminals won't need to launder that money and risk being caught.",

It was the Mixin safe I guess. I also don't think that a project like Mixin in the beta stage is capable of raising hundreds of millions of dollars from enthusiastic investors, considering that the missing $200 million is only a small portion of the assets it has. This can be inferred from the review campaign that was launched about two months ago, which included 100 expert members of the forum, who agreed in most of their reviews (if not all) on the complexities of use and the danger of the service on the cloud. I am almost certain that none of them continued to use the service after the review campaign. The unprofessionalism of the project was confirmed after the success of the hack, and was further confirmed by this desperate message they sent to the hackers.",

Now if the hackers return these funds then it will be good for this platform to return the funds to their customers. But if this incident is done on purpose and to get free marketing, then it will be a dirty game, the users of this platform should think about using this platform for the second time, why they are going to use this platform even after this incident.I'm not entirely sure they would willingly shoot themselves in the foot like that. This incident will surely damage their reputation, and if they genuinely had a million users, I can assume that they will lose a significant portion of them as a result. It is hard to see them benefiting from the media attention they have received.Their best-case scenario now is to provide financial compensation to all their users and hope that this incident eventually fades away, unless a similar situation arises in the future.",

I would like to hear the logic behind this. What's more important, if this was indeed an inside job they woulnd't offer reward to their own employee piublically to give back the money because they would know who actually did it.",
