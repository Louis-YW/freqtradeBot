  "content": "Yes people not used correct ways.People are resources and If use it for. Not right ways its waste of resources.For example society put too much focus on education.Instead of education the law enforcement and secret service should start learn from society what talents some people have and use them for the right jobs.Right no dont hope for better or smarter world and better use of tax payers money If so many people learn things what Has no use for really for society.For example bankers: They study so many useless things in School but instead of that they should learn only the things they really need.Also many jobs the uneducated ones are doing better then  the educated ones.For example our political parties that's not issue that they are corrupted but issue IS they cant do logical decisions the decisions they make not Even good for their own.What we need is to put people with real life experinces to leadership positions those ones can really make improvements For example security If you give that to criminals like mobsters they can make it safe.We just dont want to make society to funcion most logical ways becouse the reason Are We have so many rich families of elite and their Kids don't produce nothing real to society If we make society logical and we take smart people to the top to Lead others the most sustaineble ways and using resources time and money smart ways then alot of people who don't produce nothing and dont give any value to society then no place for them.So that's why we dont run our economics logical ways and mess and big confusing situation all around that in the shadows of uncertanity the parazites can live good life.This the reason why the real talents and smart people never cant be the leaders becouse If everthing Will be smart and transparent then those who dont give much value to the society other then doing shopping so that they can survive in the shadows from the wealth of inheritance.But when the older rich generation Will die the younger generation Will slowly lose the inheritance becouse they got no work ethics and no experince only some useless booksmart knowledge.That's why the insurance companies need to cover a lot more losses and companies doing less and less profit.The final outcome is Simple it's very Simple the lazy kids of the rich without right work ethics Will lose their wealth to the smarter ones but poor people.Who Are the rich Nations ? The rich Nations by inheritance Are USA UK canada those Kids have no work ethics no real grinding experince and no Any life experince so If they meet with opponents with the real experinces then money from their pockets slowly Will go the those who got the real life experinces.What we Will see IS this: Canada UK USA rich kids will start slowly loosing their wealth to the foreigns or the people who working hard but Are not rich but they have real experinces in their lifes.The people without real experinces are so useless nowdays that Even Banks have starting to take people to work with crimimal Records.If they did not changed the law then they would be not have people to hire at all so that's why they now need to take people with crimimal Records.Those booksmart people they learn slow and they have no real life experinces.For example If you hiring the ex convited who did fraud or other money involved activity it means he can be very disiplined and with responsebility person and good with calculations and logical thinking it's our society the goverment responsebility to make sure those people don't use their talents wrong places.But those people who are just booksmart and no real experinces no CEO experinces and nothing they only spend tax payers money maximum ways but they produce very little to the society instead of that they should be sent to building Job or cleaning manual laobuoring jobs not give them Nice suits and they walk around with important faces and everybody think they are so smart they are not If you put them in to real situations they cant solve the problems by their own.We have so many useless people with suits becouse rich people in society want to give reason to society why we should feed those kind of people don't produce nothing to our society only waste the resources.When times of Crisis comes then those booksmart people don't really solve any problems.It's not politically correct to talk about this issue becouse the wealthy elite been working hard but they know how useless their Kids Are and slowly slowly they lose all the wealth.If the rich people Kids and all those booksmart people want to succeed they should better find menthors from the circlers of people who got good experinces and not just booksmart ones but they probably have been running few business enterprises and have some failures without back ups from their family wealth.All the rich guys knows and they actually looking For people who's not so rich but they can take good care of their Kids becouse they know that booksmart knowledge is not practical enough becouse in the real world specially times of Crisis the strongest Fittest and most experinced will survive.We have now those who Lost everthing in year 2008 Crisis If they did not fall down start drinking or go homeless so now those will come back stronger and Will use their previous experinces to take all the wealth from the rich kids who got wealth just from their family.Those who got 2008 year experinces they are gifted with big failures and If they still strong they will be the new wealthy ones in this Crisis.We gona see a lot USA canada au and UK and even the EU country rich kids to be homeless and broke If they don't start Taking seriously to train themselfes and learn from the experinced guys.The new wealthy elite are from africa and eastern Europe area Also the asians who Will own all the wealth in the world Also it's fall of emirate oil rich Nations becouse those oil country kids are just rich by their family been selling oil.The smart ones and experinced ones are so tough that they dont support regimes what serves only for the old elite and their BOOKsmart wannabee Kids they Will be financlly so strong and Independent that rich kids cant even compete with them in any ways.If rich kids fall then it's bad for Dubai spain and france economy specially the south france becouse rich kids Will not have that kind of wealth anymore what they use to have and spain Dubai france and Monaco Will be full of asians eastern europeans and africans who have a lot wealth and power those rich kids have no quality those asians and africa and eastern europeans will buy Dubai and Monaco and france spain Property for cheap after the rich kids Will lose all the wealth.What jobs the rich kids can get ? Probably non of the jobs and Even If they get they Will be so lazy that nobody Will not hire them.Also the asians eastern europeans and africans Will use the robots for the many jobs so people are not Even needed for many instances.USA and other Western countries Will fall and assets companies and wealth Will be owned by asians africans and eastern europeans.The best way for the rich kids IS forget about your wealth and go do regular work and try to get as many experinces Even not pleasent experinces to get skills and experinces about Life becouse your opponents will have it all and If you not smart skilled and experinced as they are then prepare foryourself for the broke and homeless life.That's reality how things Will go If wealthy but lazy people don't improve themselfes",

      "body": "Your description is too ambiguous and convoluted even though in essence you are cornering education and several other social aspects that need to be reconsidered. It's a shame that patterns of thought like yours are too exaggerated or simply don't have a complex knowledge base. In conclusion, you are talking about education -> work -> economy -> politics -> social -> society and so on.No one really works according to idealism, they work to meet their own needs even though the political path they take is still the main need or personal interest which is prioritized above all else. Education is still education with the title of humanizing humans, but looking back learning theory is not enough. Today the material in schools is increasingly converging on information and communication technology education.",

      "body": "The state is unable to guarantee that anyone will become richer?Education is also unable to make people richer and more sensitive to social and cultural values.But in living a life, humans need education, work, economic guarantees, political rights and social values, these are basic needs in living the life of a nation. Responsibility for the future of children cannot be separated from the role of parents in educating, preparing, providing guarantees for education and health as a basis. If all problems must always be seen as the government's mistakes in managing the country, then where is the function as parents?Working as the fulfillment of rights and responsibilities, is a job that cannot be separated from every individual who is of sufficient age, because outwardly they themselves have the most role in doing the job.",

They end up wasting money on luxury and other unnecessary pleasures of life. As you rightly pointed out, every child should be allowed to explore and use his gifts and talents to create wealth or a means of survival. Rich parents that want to hand over their businesses to their children must start exposing them to these businesses on time so that they would be very skillful before they inherit them. But some of these wealthy parents make the mistake of just sending their children to renowned schools that just teach theoretical concepts that lack practical experiences. They end up gaining the best degrees without relevant exposure or life experience. They end up with the view that life is all about enjoyment because they have never been exposed to handwork. I was close to a young man in my area his father left behind so much wealth. He ended up selling all the companies and properties. He even sold the house he was living in and moved to a hotel. He died wretchedly in a single room in a public residence by suspected suicide.",

They must have their positive attributes, otherwise they wouldn't be examples of life quality for so long, for several generations already.

Perhaps they do not do the work with their hands, so you think that they will fail in the end. This is not always true.This does not lead to the failure of the economic system as you think, this leads to the division of society into classes, a rich class that uses its money to run businesses and another class that has to do manual work.Since ancient times, all societies needed the existence of these two classes, a class that uses its brains and a class that uses its hands. This is very natural.",

This shows that every child of a rich man is relatively successful in his future. and it is not the least that the children of the rich have a very high level of education making it not possible to lose wealth.Methodology in seeking knowledge from books is one way, we can find out the weaknesses of the world from books and we have agreed that books are the world's bridge.It's okay to read books while still studying/schooling, of course, it will increase the child's intelligence to compete in the world of work or the business world after he graduates.Yes, even though there are some children of rich people who live hedonic or rah-rah without being able to make money which causes bankruptcy.",
