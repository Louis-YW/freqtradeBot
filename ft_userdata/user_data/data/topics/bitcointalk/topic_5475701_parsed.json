I was hoping that the price of BTC will reach $50k before the end of November which remain few days to the end of November but the price is still low in the market and, the way the price was running in the market recently for the price to stop at $38k and, it look like the bull run will not come this year 2023 but it will surely come early next year for those that invested in the bear season to have good opportunity to earn a good profits. Next year will be a good year for me because, I really embraced many opportunities that helped me to buy BTC whenever the price decrease in the market but I know good opportunity will come that will make the price hit above $50k for long hodlers to smile again next year.Hope you have prepared well for the bull run that is about to show up in the market next year? Or you don't believe that there will not be bull run 2024?, If what I observed in the market few weeks ago is real, I think bull run that will make people to make big money will surely show up next year 2024.",

It is going to happen sometime withing the first quarter of the year, and some months following, is the expected bull run as projected.For holders who are just doing this for the first time, it might be too much to handle, but the older HoDLers would recognize this incident will still HoDL till the bull run comes and trade or withdraw or continue to observe the market and HoDL further.",

And from your post, you might actually get other newbies scared just by saying Quote I was hoping that the price of BTC will reach $50k before the end of November which remain few days to the end of November but the price is still low in the market and, the way the price was running in the market recently for the price to stop at $38k and, it look like the bull run will not come this year 2023 but it will surely come early next year for those that invested in the bear season to have good opportunity to earn a good profits. this is the major reason, why it is adviced to invest in Bitcoin for the long term. The halving is going to take place next year and if you noticed, we are already walking into the bull run gradually, so what is there to be scared about. If you had invested in Bitcoin hoping to had make profit in a short time or sooner, then there might just be no difference between you and a short term holders ie, the TRADERS. The price of Bitcoin has being hovering around the 36--38k for weeks now, and might just be able to hit the 40k price before the year runs out. So there nothing to be scared about. Just keep accumulating as many Bitcoin as possible and remain positive.",

If you’ve invested early, even at the current price bitcoin is, you would have earned some profits already. Waiting till 2024 or more will only mean that you want more to what you’ve invested to get plenty profit when cashing out which is a good one to do. Every bitcoin investor hope to get the maximum profit from their investment in bitcoin, so patient will be the best exercise to exert now in order to achieve that in the future.QuoteHope you have prepared well for the bull run that is about to show up in the market next year? Or you don't believe that there will not be bull run 2024?, If what I observed in the market few weeks ago is real, I think bull run that will make people to make big money will surely show up next year 2024.We can’t be very sure that next year will be the year where we can all make a lot of big money in our investments in bitcoin, what is only sure is that; next year will be the year of halving to take place. Getting the big profit we want in this market will only happen after the bull run which we don’t know the exact date for it to take place but we all know it happens after every halving which we are all waiting for. I’m sure you’re not also certain when the bull run will take place, everyone is just holding for now.",

You have to understand that bitcoin is highly unpredictable and subjected to high volatility. For me bitcoin has done perfectly well. I think bitcoin is in the consolidation state currently and anything can happen from here. As a long time investor I will advise you to stop looking at the daily charts of bitcoin prices. Just buy and whenever you can and never bother about the price of bitcoin for the next one year ahead. I think this will save you lots of emotional dramas.  Quotethe price is still low in the market and, the way the price was running in the market recently for the price to stop at $38k The price of bitcoin is still low compared to what is coming after halving, so this is still a good entry point. But if you think the price of bitcoin is low because you expected it in $50k then I think your expectations on bitcoin is too high.QuoteIs like the bull run will not come this year 2023 but it will surely come early next year for those that invested in the bear season to have good opportunity to earn a good profits. Op the bull run was never supposed to start this year. I think you should try and get the right information so that you don't put yourself in unnecessary pressure. The bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024 but no one knows the particular date it will happen. And the bull run is expected to start 6 months after the halving has taken place. So relax and keep accumulating.",

I truly love the optimism in the Bitcoin community and we look forward to a historic year for Bitcoin. I just hope we are all taking advantage of the opportunities this year offered us to buy as much as we can to be able to ride the expected wave of 2024. The recent market condition is an indication that the bulls are already entering the market and as soon as we break the $38k resistance, price may not return to the lower $30k region before the halving.

If you have any free money to invest, just invest it in BTC and you will not regret what you will see when the price hit higher soon.What hodlers went through in this season, I don't think it will repeat itself again because many people quit BTC investment because they thought what happened last two years will still happen this year that made them to borrow money but we that believe that BTC will increase soon ,we are still waiting and the bull run will show up next year 2024, if you like take it or you leave it.",

Definitely the price of bitcoin for the upcoming bull run will surely surpass the last ATH though it's difficult to predict the price range for next year but it's really gonna be a shocker",
