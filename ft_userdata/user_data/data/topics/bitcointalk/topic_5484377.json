Is hard to understand your English, I would advice that as a newbie first focus on your local board where you can use a language you more comfortable with. In the case of an emergency,  What's stopping the person from making transfers? If there's no network, making transfers wouldn't be possible also using Bitcoin. Even if cash is going to be replaced is not going to be by Bitcoin alone.like we have different physical currency So also different digital currency unique to various countries.

Rather than deciding to abandon the first option, it might be better to have both to balance things out and also be able to carry out transactions with various cash and online payment methods. I think as technology becomes more sophisticated, we need to be able to control it, not be controlled. So for Bitcoin to be legal tender, you must have the power of president and decide to ditch fiat. But can the capacity to build solid value be guaranteed if it is still based on the Bitcoin exchange rate against fiat? because you also need to compare values so that people trust and support you completely.",

In cash you don't have to pay fees in order to trade goods but with Bitcoin you'll have to pay some fees in order to get your transaction completed.Cash is also a needed thing for exchange of goods, Bitcoin can be used as a p2p payment system but it can't be a cashless system, in fact it's not possible to shift complete world to accept cashless systems where everything can be purchased digitally instead of carrying physical cash.I'm sure we can have digital money that can be useful for those who are technically good but what about the ones who have no technical knowledge? How would they be able to use cashless system when they don't understand ins and outs of technology they are going to be dealing with? That's why I would say it's not possible to have cashless system anytime soon and I highly believe that Bitcoin isn't suitable for such thing.",

Obviously, most of them do not really know or have not figured out the role Bitcoin was created to play or what is only possible with Bitcoin. I feel we have to make some clarifications so that anyone coming into Bitcoin wouldn't think that a time will come when people will stop using fiat entirely. I don't think we will get to that point because centralized payment systems as well as fiat will always exist side by side with Bitcoin.It is the creation of more innovative way of using Bitcoin that will determine how much Bitcoin will be accepted and used by the ordinary people. If there is a lack of such innovations, I don't see how people will abandon cheaper and faster payment systems to adopt Bitcoin that have become so expensive to send funds from one person to another.",

Bitcoin adoption is increasing but there are still more lands for Bitcoin to gain adoption.

Take, for example, El Salvador, where Bitcoin is made a legal tender. Citizens there are using Bitcoin for transactions, just as in my country. Bitcoin is not a legal tender here, but some people who are familiar with (and also in love) with the technology are still doing some daily transactions with Bitcoin.I run a furniture business, and I accept Bitcoin payments and a few other cryptos too. The first month that I started accepting Bitcoin payments, I was so surprised to see the huge turn-up of Bitcoin users who were willing to pay in Bitcoin. That's to say that already Bitcoin is being used as an electric currency in some countries, apart from those countries where crypto is banned. Bitcoin may not be as popularly used as the normal traditional transaction system, but in the future, we will see more people in the world adopt it.",

So for me, it remain uncertain, I would like to see Bitcoin being recognized around the world, but there are a lot challenges that we need to face in order for it to even grow first and be adopted before we talk about it competing against Visa or Mastercard, in my opinion.

      "body": "I see some people mentioning bitcoin fees being too high. And the OP compared bitcoin tx capacity to Visa and Mastercard.People, you need to realize that bitcoin's blockchain is the BASE layer of a monetary system. It'd be like if we were talking about using fiat only through wire transfers. The way everyone uses digital fiat is nowhere near the base layer of the fiat/banking system. Please stop comparing the two. Nobody in their right mind expects people to be using bitcoin for payments with mass usage using the base layer. That's literally what higher layers are for, like the Lightning Network. Bitcoin IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED FOR DAILY PAYMENTS. It wasn't designed for that. No good monetary system would be designed for that because at the base layer you want security, not capacity.Fees are not a problem for Bitcoin becoming used for daily purchases, because people aren't going to be paying on-chain. That would be absurd. On-chain is for large money transfers / large transactions. Higher layer networks are for regular daily commerce.If we want to compare Bitcoin to the fiat system, you have to compare LN (or possible other future Layer 2's) to Visa, Mastercard, etc.Also someone said we don't have fees in the fiat system, that's not true at all. Credit cards take a roughly 30 cents + 3% fee for every transaction, it's just that the merchant pays that and passes it on to the consumer, rather than the consumer getting the original price with the fee tacked on. If credit card transactions were transparent for the consumer the merchant would print out on the receipt the cost of the item (less than the cost we pay), and then the credit card fee on top of that.Anyway, nobody should ever be under the illusion that Bitcoin is replacing fiat currencies. It is an ALTERNATIVE global currency. It is designed to operate as the alternative option co-existing with national currencies. Govts aren't going to give up their currencies to replace them with something they have no control over. Both fiat and Bitcoin have their uses, and people will use them both. Bitcoin is better for saving money medium to long term and then of course spending the money you have saved, in addition of course to storing your money yourself rather than in a bank, and being able to spend money internationally without having to switch currencies, or sending money across borders cheaply and quickly, etc. Fiat is good for saving/spending in the short to medium term.And I really don't see a cashless society in general happening. At least not in any country where the people have a say. There will always be a need for some physical money, sure it won't be a big need, but it is neccesary. A world with a little bit of physical money usage is very different than a world with no physical money at all.",

If you look at the less developed areas they suffer not only for the lack of knowledge but also they don’t have any network connections in their areas. Without this two the transaction would not be possible. Right now I only see bitcoin as a payment method for large transactions amounts and not smaller ones. Also bitcoin to me fit perfectly well for cross border transactions where you don’t need to worry about the hassle of converting from different currencies to another before sending them.",
