I also don't know whether it is best to give an nft to users as a jackpot or constantly (probably the jackpot system but then you might also have to encode a buyback system - and then users might not want the nft anyway if they can sell it back for higher than they'd get on an exchange for it).Also are you talking about a gambling site that was centralised or not as that'll also have an effect here. Centralised gambling firms offering nfts will probably be considered gimmicky by a lot of people.",

Crypto Gaming: How Cryptocurrency and NFTs Affect Games TodayQuoteOutside of NFTs, cryptocurrency has made a mark on the gaming industry as well. While there hasnâ€™t been a widespread push to add currencies like bitcoin and ethereum into existing titles, there are plenty of games made specifically with crypto in mind. A prime example of this is a game on Steam that has managed to avoid the platformâ€™s NFT and Crypto banâ€¦at least,Maybe here you can also find answer number (1).Topic: Will NFT bring any change in crypto gambling industry?Quote from: Z390 on October 06, 2022, 01:31:24 PM2.

Here Are 4 Utilities That NFTs Can Bring To Their CommunitiesQuoteWith the NFT market becoming more saturated, creators have come to realise that there is a need to reimagine a way that NFTs can be utilized apart from just a picture.Today, NFT holders donâ€™t just hold for the art but the utility, but the array of benefits they get from it. From a range of exclusive memberships to access to future whitelists, NFT project teams have been creative in coming up with ways for individuals to purchase NFTs.Maybe, further questions you can also find below.Topic: What is NFT?Quote from: bitbollo on November 08, 2020, 05:55:32 PMI love to have a look on opensea.io since there are a lot of nice NTF including some digital art works.

But if you want an on-chain coexistence then your probably looking on web3 casinos since they decentralized.2.) I think NFT only usefulness for gamblers are being collectible.

I'm not sure if they're the first crypto casino company that integrated NFTs to their casino, specifically on their VIP programs, but currently NFT coexist with their casino. The casino is Rollbit. And the NFT was their own creation named Rollbot. As what I've mentioned, Rollbot acts as one of VIP membership of their casino. Of course it comes with various rewards.",

What usefulness do you think ðŸ¤” could make NFTs useful for crypto gamblers?I think the answer is yes, but ultimately it's up to the casino industry as a whole to decide whether or not they want to embrace this form of blockchain technology. Gambling markets are constantly growing, and casinos will have to find ways to keep up with demand. With NFT's, casinos have a powerful tool at their disposal, and they can use this technology to attract more customers and reward their regulars. The ability to use these tokens for a variety of purposes, such as rewards or status symbols, is a way of adding value to the player experience. But again, the casino industry is constantly changing, and trends like this take some time to develop. It may be a little while before we see widespread adoption of NFT's.Quote from: Z390 on October 06, 2022, 01:31:24 PM3.

Actually, I've already seen this concept some time ago in another forum thread being introduced by a crypto casino. You could be rewarded with common to rare NFTs while gambling and depending the NFT you received you would have access to different benefits' tiers. It could be even possible to receive shares of the casino's profit by being a NFT holder.Quote from: Z390 on October 06, 2022, 01:31:24 PM3.

But that NFT would preferably be a truly rare and limited edition item from that casino.The usefulness of the NFT will be like a collection that, if sold, will provide a profit for the owner.

Is there any real-time ( LIVE ) crypto gambling platform where friends from around the world can come together either through web3 kinda like or just live video to gamble on the platform? Actually there was a guy around some some weeks ago talking to us about his project on gambling NFT's. Those 777 NFT's were supposed to be auctioned and those who bought them were to have access to an exclusive Discord server about gambling and gambling service providers.I tried to explain to him that was not an appealing enough idea because NFTs are decentralized and it does not make sense to try to tie them to a centralized service like Discord, which could single handedlyÂ  delete the chat and its members.I believe it is possible NFTS to be part of the gambling ecosystem, that is my personal opinion.I think NFTs could be implemented in some sort of second-layer decentralized casino, were those who hold specific NFTs minted by the casino itself would enjoy special perks, VIP access to tournaments, etc. Addionally, the NFT's could be used as colateral to gamble within the platform, since they would have some monetary vale themselves. I am not aware myself of a crypto gambling platform like the one your describe, I am afraid. I assume casinos are having so much profit with their games and webpages as they are, in consequence they do not find necessary to push towards NFT's implementation.",
