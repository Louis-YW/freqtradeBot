There has been a lot of FUD around it last few months with the founders being against each other which saw the price fall all the way down to $0.013 in October.I bought a bit at the bottom but feel I missed an opportunity not buying more as it has now gone up over 100% in the last month. Many sold due to the FUD but I have carried on holding and bought a bit at the bottom which helped reduce my average at least.I am just wondering what we can expect from Gala in the next few years. The current price is $0.03 and I am hoping it can get back to $0.50 in the bull run is that realistic?",

Like we have some bad news regarding Gala token. But it's team is trying much to improve the token and they are struggling to make it more perfect for the users. I think you should hold. Or you can even book profit now and can wait for a dip again. By the way this is you personal decision which you will make but I will suggest that you should hold more till the Bitcoin ETF if Bitcoin will grow so Gala will also go up. So you can wait for it.

I don't think I would take the risk of being associated with any project when it's founders don't get along as there is always a risk of one of them fleeing or dumping the tokens and pull another FTX like scenario. I would suggest to be extra cautious and have a stop loss placed at 20% dump.",

Main while altcoin you to be vigilant since falling is inevitable.  Yes, I was about to point that out for the ops, because at that point anything can happen to the project and as long as the crisis lasts it will keep affecting the value and usability of that token,  if I were to be an investor in this project,  I will look out for an exit opportunities to secure my capital instead of buying more. Alot of time,  most of these tokens are just gambling and at that, we should not take them too seriously and if there is any crack in the management,  it may lead to the collapse of the project eventually. Let expect Assume that the 100% price recovery was as a result of some positive progress in settling the team issues,  or a trap just to pump the price and dump it on the investor's face,  holding a token since 2022 is a long enough time.",

For now, it is trading at a price of $0.029 and I think you will gain a substantial amount of profit if you continue to hold. Bitcoin has been going upwards and after halving it will break its own ATH in 2021. That will also impact the altcoin market as it is impacting now, it is risky according to me to accumulate more of this coin.

To me, GALA has its own special things, but it also comes with a fair amount of hype. Looking back at the previous price increase, the ATH level is a threshold where I don't expect similar things to repeat, but with this market, anything can happen. And all speculation is just a hypothesis until everything happens. Sometimes that trust is only based on unclear buying behavior, ask yourself,  What made you buy it since the beginning of 2022? And in fact, you have gone through a long period of market decline. In this market, patience is always rewarded, but that does not mean that rule will make you satisfied",

With 50billion what of coin and the demand for is is not high.  Though the market cap is huge but it still needs to increase more, because high demand of coin increases the potential or value of the coin.",

I used to have fun playing their free game Townstar but when bots/scripts started to conquer the game, that's when I stopped. Then, it's a long wait for their next game Mirandus and I think that was one of the mistakes their developers made. It's too long and could be a reason for their investors to start to find new projects that would make their investments grow faster. I sold my Gala coins back when it was at their peak at $0.5 (I think $0.8 was the highest) and after that, I never went back again. I am still joined in their Discord group but I cannot find a reason to go back to investing with them. If there's a dispute with their developers then you might want to think about selling but this is a big project that has been running for a long time and I think you are also at a loss if you sell now. It's up to you brother and I hope you can find some reasons to continue on keeping that asset.",

DYOR.You are absolutely right that it is very challenging to predict the future price of any crypto currency including Bitcoin. However, in the bull run of 2021 GALA was one of the leading coins in gaming sector, reaching all time high (ATH) at $0.84, but unfortunately ever since it has been in bearish phase, and even now when market is in mini bull it didn't demonstrate any impressive performance and trading around $0.029.The future performance of GALA coin in the next bull run will entirely depend on overall trend in gaming sector, and there is a possibility that it could break its previous ATH, provided its team continues making efforts to introduce new features that can attract investors in this coin.",

Gala is still doing partnership with many big gaming platforms..  I view some tweet that Gala is going to bring GTA6; Don't know it is true or not but at current price I think it is still a worthy investment. 0.5$ is not big but we have to lower the target.. I think 0.3$ is best target for selling and securing profit.",
