  "content": "Alik BakhshiTsap-tsarap (steal) as Russian folk staple   In his speeches, Russian President Putin will not miss an opportunity not to use savory expressions from gangster jargon such as “wet in the toilet” (about Chechens) or “strangle the reptile” (about Chechnya), knowing in advance that the Russian people like it and here is a new one:\"We'll wait for the Americans to spend money on new technologies, and then - tsap-tsarap (steal).\" https://youtu.be/I_ZMmJcjsjoTo which the hall burst into enthusiastic applause. And how could it be otherwise, because Putin announced another popular bond, which is firmly seated in his mentality. It can be said, the quintessence of folk wisdom, traceable throughout the historical path. There is nothing to prove here. They drag anything and everything.   Everything that is in Russia is licked from the West. American suckers could not even keep the atomic bomb a secret, putting the world before the threat of nuclear war. If not for the West, Russians would still write with goose quills on birch bark. I'm exaggerating, of course, but it's the absolute truth. And what is interesting, and this is already a tradition, in Russia, to great chagrin, only what concerns the war is successfully copied, all other achievements of civilization in Russia are not produced, and if they are, then chickens are laughing. In short, so that in Russia they would not undertake to manufacture, it turns out only one Kalashnikov.   In Putin's Russia, there are no plans to spend money on new technologies. Putin and the gangster environment he created would rather invest the money stolen from their own people in Western banks and real estate, where their children live, and technology, if necessary, is a tsap-tsarap. 11/25/19",

      "body": "The Prosecutor's Office for Combating Organized Crime and Special Cases sent the case of two citizens of Azerbaijan to court. According to investigators, last summer the defendants extorted 10 thousand euros from a man from Balti. The organizer of the blackmail was a 39-year-old prisoner on remand for murder and robbery. The victim managed to give the extortionists 60,000 lei. The court sentenced both foreigners to 8 years in prison and ordered each to pay a fine of 100,000 lei. After serving their sentence in Moldova, the citizens will be extradited to Azerbaijan.Source: https://aif.md/v-moldove-dvoih-inostrancev-prigovorili-k-8-godam-tjurmy-za-shantazh/© aif.md",
