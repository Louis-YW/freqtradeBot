If it lost does it add any value to bitcoin price?It goes to the address where you mistakenly sent it! it's not exactly \"lost\" as well as it has just moved to an address where you don't hold the private key hence is inaccessible to you. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so it's up to the person on the other end whether they wanna give it back which in most cases, they don't. But fear not because prevention is better than cure.",

If it lost does it add any value to bitcoin price?It's rare to see transactions go wrong because most users are careful enough to know the addresses they are sending to. Transaction fees are what miners do benefits from, the fees are the sole profits of miners or should I say that is what is being mined. It very hard to recover bitcoins sent to wrong addresses because you may not know who it has been sent to, tho when it occurs with high influencer the exchange might give out details of the holder (sent to) but when it happens on a p2p/decentralized platform it may not be found. Seen it's just a transaction it has the same value your norm transactions will have.

Â We have all had to put in the work as newbies. Â Search engines and forum archives are your friends - use them before asking others to explain everything. Â I dont mean to be harsh. Â But taking some initiative to educate yourself shows you respect people's time and Â post thoughtful, specific questions after doing your own research. Â That is the best way to get helpful answers from this community of experienced people. Â We have all been where you are.

The scarcity could theoretically drive the value up: fewer Bitcoins in the market mean a higher price, assuming demand is constant.",

Although the best way to learn very fast is to be active in the forum, every board has it's uniqueness, you open one and choose a discussion that can be helpful to you as a learner. Don't expect to understand everything in a day or a month, it's a gradual process, before you know it you'll be using the terminologies too. Most of us has passed through that stage of learning, in fact I'm still learning everyday, so be active in the forum and it'll happen naturally.",
