  "content": "I'm just one of the crypto gamblers who often play and although I often always lose and have never experienced winning a large amount, my only question is that I have a gambling platform that I entered to play with predictions while having fun and just in case Good luck, I noticed that when it comes to the withdrawal transaction using USDT, the transaction is 19$ while the minimum withdrawal is 15$ The arrival seems silly, which in fact for an ordinary gambler is too high or too expensive for me. For example, if I want to withdraw the minimum amount of this gambling platform, it will appear that I have to add 4$ and it will also appear that I have not withdrawn anything.But for other cryptocurrencies that you buy here on this platform such as dogecoin, the transaction fee is only 5 doge deducted, my question is, are most of the cryptocurrency gambling platforms when it comes to usdt withdrawal, are they this expensive is deducted from the transactionas you can see in the picture?",

Change network to TRC-20 and you'll see a lot less fee. I'm guessing it's around $1 or less.....I checked etherscan's estimate for USDT transfers and the highest priority is only $1.17. That means the platform currently charging you $15 more. Gas price on Ethereum fluctuates like crazy so the casino's wallet provider must have overestimated it for good measure. I guess it's what you get for using centralized platforms.",

God bless you and have a nice day. It is because ERC20 transactions are super expensive + I guess the casino keeps a small fees during withdrawal. We need to wait for ETH 2.0 and then the sharding which will reduce the costs of transactions.TRC20 transactions are cheap like others said, but they should have also mentioned that its a different network. So make sure wherever you are withdrawing it does support TRC20 network and tokens or your coins are going to be lost forever. If you send a TRC20 token to a ERC20 network, highly likely you will loose your funds.",

God bless you and have a nice day. Hehe no worries. I do overlook it sometimes since the symbol is almost identical to each other. But I still wonder why casino still accepts ERC20 tokens while thereâ€™s a counterpart token on different blockchain that offer much lower transaction fee. Using ERC20 is useless for gambling purposes except for whales that has huge amount of bankroll that can do it in one transaction.But for the record. All gambling site charge flat rate for ERC20 mate. Make sure to always double check the network before you withdraw.",

It's faster and cheaper this way, and you can just convert it on an exchange afterwards if you really need USDT or an ERC-20 token for whatever purpose it might serve. Personally, I'd go XRP or Doge to withdraw as these two usually have less transaction fees and faster confirm times. Never use ERC-20 tokens for withdrawals no matter the service/platform.",

Withdrawals are free on Sportsbet and on Fortunejack (only that they do have minimum amounts, and the latter is pretty high, $150) and they do seem in my experience to use appropriate gas payments.

This usdt-trc20 is really good for us crypto gamblers and I'm glad that my favorite bookies offered this just recently.",

Or used casinos that don't charge withdrawals.Yeah, it's always a must to check things and to asked things but for Ethereum transactions I think it will be just for the last time considering they are transitioning to PoS. To be honest, there are plenty of L1 out there that cost cheap to process things, it just really takes time for Ethereum to be that one. As far as I know most casinos nowadays integrate more L1s on their platform considering that it attracts user too to check or play on their site and I'm one of that folks to love it such feature for a casino.",

I used to have the same problem back then, mostly because I didn't know jack about networks and stuff so I momentarily stopped doing anything about gambling.
