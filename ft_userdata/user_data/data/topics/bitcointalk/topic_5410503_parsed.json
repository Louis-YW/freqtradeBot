  "content": "I just purchased a used S9 14T antminer and upon inspection found the aftmost of three 1000uF capacitors under the pci-e sockets broken off with a screw hole in it. The hole lines up with the fan screw, so it appears a too long screw was installed.I've order a capacitor matching the labelling (Aluminum polymer 1000U 16V) and will attempt to replace.I was reading of others with capacitor issues and still run the miner. Given proximity of the cap to the power inputs, I'm guessing these smooth the input voltage..Any thoughts? Do I risk further damage to the board if I try running it? Should I start my testing with just the other 2 blades connected?Thx.",

      "body": "If you see those caps are broken then you must replace it.I don't know what you mean exactly about the miner still running even if it has busted caps but I believe without those caps I'm sure it will kill other components so it's recommended to replace them.",

      "body": "You must remove the broken capacitor and replace it. And replace the fan screw with the appropriate length. Electrolytic capacitors need to be soldered with a soldering iron, and when soldering, pay attention to the correct installation of the positive and negative electrodes of the capacitor.",

      "body": "Soldering to the ground plane of a hashboard With a soldering iron is a difficult operation, you may just find your crown plane is dissipating more Watts than the soldering iron is supplying. This is going to lead to a pseudo-solderÂ  or cold solder joint. Mitigate this issue by bringing your board up to solder melt temperature with hot air first.",
