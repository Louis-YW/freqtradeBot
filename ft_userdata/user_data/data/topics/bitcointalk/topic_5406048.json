      "body": "It seems as if there is no real safe place to store wealth in this day and age. Most are being hit hard no matter where they store their wealth.Stablecoins pegged to the dollar have shown some promise as a hedge against inflation. Unfortunately, shifting negative market conditions and regulatory crackdowns have put pressure some stablecoins to depeg. Bitfinex and tether have been investigated since 2017. It hasn't been the easiest 5 years for them to beat all of the accusations, lawsuits and investigations thrown at them. Foreign markets could benefit the most from stablecoin hedges against inflation, as their prices and inflation do not track with the US cost of goods and services. For americans we need something that can appreciate closer to our rise in inflation. Which is a tough ask in this day and age. I've thought about HODL'ing scrap metal as a entry level commodities play to beat inflation. That could still be a viable candidate which is accessible for most. Plants and agriculture could also be viable investments if food shortages materialize and the cost of fruits and vegetables continue to rise. Plants and trees also carry an advantage of generally appreciating in value.",

Chinese banks mentioned were under investigation due to fraud in health security that made them decide to halt withdrawals, doesn't really sound like a bank run.But this is China, its not surprising anymore because they always do this whenever solving a tiny issue such as locking down the entire city for few people infected by a virus.",

Another problem with stablecoins is that their value is pegged on fiat and fiat is fast losing value. So stablecoins are a double whammy. 2. Binance is never the replacement to banks. For one, it is centralized. Second, it was already hacked. Its customers' data was also leaked. It also halted withdrawal. Binance is far from a better alternative to banks. Poloniex is no better.3. Banks may run out of liquidity but so are exchanges. Read the recent crypto news and you'll see how a good number of crypto companies are losing liquidity. If there's a bank run, there's also an exchange run. The problem with the latter is that there's no government that will bail them out.",

Crypto runs, like when bitcoin plummets to 30% of its all time high, would increase the popularity of reliable and stable banking systems. Using China as an example for anything is laughable because they run such a centralised and authoritarian system which are prone to runaway mistakes. Besides that, bitcoin is still effectively illegal in China or comes with heavy risk, that even those Chinese users suffering collapsed banks don't have this option available to them.",
