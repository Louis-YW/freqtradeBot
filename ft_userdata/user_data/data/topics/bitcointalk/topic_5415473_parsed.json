  "content": "We're merely plebs, many of us. Although there are also casino whales in the forum, I believe it's the best advice for everyone, especially plebs, to play only the casino games with the lowest house edge available. BlackJack and Craps.I tried both of them, and my favorite is Craps. For a beginner, just bet on 6 and 8, then if the dice roll is a 7, you lose, if it's 6 or 8 you win. There are other betting strategies to use to increase your bets called \"press and collect\", but that's for another topic. The reasoning on why \"just place on 6 and 8\" is the lower house edge = 1.52%, definitely lower if compared to playing your favorite slot machines. Plus there are bets with lower house edge in craps, like Pass Line/Come Bet = 1.41%, Donâ€™t Pass/Come = 1.40%.Pass Line/Come Bets = You win if the dice roll 7 or 11, lose if it's 2, 3, or 12.Don't Pass/Don't Come Bets = You win if the dice roll 2, 3, 12, lose if it's 7 or 11.But there's more in the game when it's any roll that's not a 2, 3, 7, 11 or 12. This is a short introduction about the basics of Craps, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsSpNm_iCwThis is a longer version about the basics of Craps, and how to play Craps, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6i5SkIn2VYAlthough, a warning. The house edge may be low, BUT there's still a house edge! Managing your capital is MORE IMPORTANT than the favorite game to play.QuoteJay Bean, a Caesar's floor manager, agreed to sit down with us and talk about the games with the best odds.He said many people don't realize that table games have much better odds than slots. They are intimidated by thoughts of card sharks taking their money, with images of an intense Texas Hold 'Em tournament in their minds, and so they stick with the safe games: the slots.But they are doing themselves a disservice, he said.Bean's advice?1. BlackjackBlackjack has the best odds of winning, with a house edge of just 1 percent in most casinos, Bean said.Plus, you are playing against only the dealer, not hooded poker champions.\"Blackjack is one of our easiest games to play,\" Bean said. \"You're just looking for a number that beats the dealer's number without going over 21.\"If you're a novice, Bean said to sit down during a less busy time, such as the afternoon, and the dealer will walk you through the game.But the same is not true with poker: You should practice the game with your friends first, at home, Bean said, until you are comfortable with it. Bean said novices are best off passing on the poker tables, where yes, the competition can be tough.2. CrapsSo from the Blackjack table, he suggests moving on to the dice game Craps, the game with the second best odds, also nearly 50-50.The Craps table can be a bit intimidating for the beginner with all the boxes on the table, Bean admitted. But it's really not tough, and it has one of your best chances of winning. In the end, all you are really doing is betting on a dice roll.https://www.news5cleveland.com/before-you-go-gambling-the-best-and-worst-casino-game-odds",

I love playing Blackjack and always to to play by those charts as that in the long run gives you the best chance of being a consistent winnr. It's really hard to play what is considered \"by the book\" at a table where other players are playing terribly though, so you have to be aware of the players around you and decide if you want to stay at that table or try to find a better group to play with. Most casinos online and live usually have multiple table. Your view on poker I 100% agree with. You control your fate more in poker.",

Although not very good at guessing because getting 21 points against the house we will always be played with. It's just that when I think about it, I get a higher win rate in Blackjack. For that some games like Roulette and Craps I still don't like fully. In Blackjack when we have been getting 21 points continuously the ambition is to double the bet. The higher the multiple, the bigger we are toyed with. Now, what I often do is fix the win, which is every 3 or 4 times I get 21 points, which means I cash out, even if I lose 3 - 4 times.",

Low house edge games provides 1:1 or lesser/a little bit high reward and itâ€™s perfect for players that want a play safe strategy while most of the high house edge games provides high risk high reward and perfect gamblers that wants one time big time win.In gambling, playing faster to win big is the best to eliminate human error such as impatience that usually trigger the common mistakes of gambler to lose all there bank roll no matter how low the house edge is.",

You named a betting strategy there but I am pretty sure you already know by now that these strategies are worthless. When you play a luck based game these strategies/algos only make you lose for sure because the house edge becomes more and more effective as long as you keep playing. The only and the best way to avoid getting caught by the house edge is playing less and wagering all your bankroll.If the house edge is 1.5%, that means on a x2 game, you'll have 48.5% chance to win that bet. That chance is definitely not small. You can fool math if you play once as 48.5% and 51.5% are pretty damn close but if you don't stop and keep playing that you'll lose.",

Very few live casinos are offering this game actually, because I think it's a little bit complicated to quickly understand all the rules for a beginner. Regarding the house edge it isn't the lowest among live games if your figures are correct. Blackjack house edge is almost 3 times lower than that, and Baccarat house edge is also lower than 1.5% even without commission and still lower than those figures if you bet on player.Moreover you can find few slots claiming they have a RTP of 99%, which is hard to check though.https://www.tangamsystems.com/post/north-america-its-time-to-adopt-no-commission-baccarat",

Once we try some games we can make a judgment if we like them and if we will continue playing on them so it's fine if you don't like the three games offered by the op. Just continue playing with your slots.",

Although there are also casino whales in the forum, I believe it's the best advice for everyone, especially plebs, to play only the casino games with the lowest house edge available. BlackJack and Craps.I tried both of them, and my favorite is Craps. For a beginner, just bet on 6 and 8, then if the dice roll is a 7, you lose, if it's 6 or 8 you win. There are other betting strategies to use to increase your bets called \"press and collect\", but that's for another topic. The reasoning on why \"just place on 6 and 8\" is the lower house edge = 1.52%, definitely lower if compared to playing your favorite slot machines. So the game don't really matter in the end. It is all about the house edge. If some other casino provides a lower house edge than 1.52% then it will be a better game than craps. You named a betting strategy there but I am pretty sure you already know by now that these strategies are worthless. When you play a luck based game these strategies/algos only make you lose for sure because the house edge becomes more and more effective as long as you keep playing. As far as my experience tell me, any luck based game will give us random result.Â  No matter how high the house edge is, especially in slots.Â  House edge is countered by RTP, wherein after several losses, a script where you can get a huge winning bet will appear.Â  Though how to trigger that RTP is somehow alien to meÂ  Quote from: mindrust on October 01, 2022, 10:20:17 AMThe only and the best way to avoid getting caught by the house edge is playing less and wagering all your bankroll.If we do this kind of strategy, it may evade the house edge but we are also missing the RTP, besided since it is a game of chance, there is a huge possibility that we can get busted even before any of the two triggered.Quote from: mindrust on October 01, 2022, 10:20:17 AMIf the house edge is 1.5%, that means on a x2 game, you'll have 48.5% chance to win that bet. That chance is definitely not small. You can fool math if you play once as 48.5% and 51.5% are pretty damn close but if you don't stop and keep playing that you'll lose.I agree, the difference between the percentage will come visible in the long run.Â  If we are used to playing in Dice with 98.5% of winning, we can see that in a long time playing, the red streak become obvious and continue to become frequent the longer we spend time rolling.",
