You don’t need to be scared to actually invest in at any price except maybe you’re putting an amount that could get in to trouble when it falls. Invest what is losable at any price and for a lesser risk it is advisable to use the DCA strategy.30k is just 47% of the ATH so there’s no need to look at this price thinking it is that high who knows we might be seeing a new ATH closer to 100k or even higher and that will be 3x what you will be investing now.",

I would like to know your feelings on this matter.   After the price of Bitcoin cleared $25k many predicted that the price of Bitcoin would dump higher again and Bitcoin could fall to $10-12k.  However, Bitcoin broke through that barrier to $30K today, indicating that the possibility of a Bitcoin dump is now very low. Those who invested when the price of Bitcoin was low were very lucky.  They are now in good profit. Bitcoin prices are likely to reach their previous ATH this year.  But it could happen by the end of the year. But its sampling has already started. Many people, including myself, are very happy and excited to see such a positive side of Bitcoin",

Also all my crypto holdings that I purchased since January is growing on insane percentage without noticing it until now after opening my hardware wallet for long time.Breaking and staying at 30K is an important milestone for Bitcoin to reach for more high. But we should not celebrate prematurely because the price can dump very quickly once Bitcoin failed hold on this important level. E",

The attention of everyone is now focused on Bitcoin which is a clear indication of its current growth. The trend is in favor of Bitcoin this time and if it continues then we will be left astonished by the Bitcoin price in the coming days.Let's suppose that if the Bitcoin price crosses its all-time high in the coming months. It will bring  a significant change in the crypto market. That change will attract thousands of new investors towards Bitcoin and crypto world which will ultimately cause a massive Bull market in altcoins.",

I even have Bitcoin Bottom mentioned in my \"about me\".It's not going down anytime soon and you should be willing to normalize the $30k as it might stay here for a much longer time rather than pumping crazy.Also fun fact, Saylor is now out of loss with his 5 billion dollar bet on Bitcoin. They weren't able to rekt him this time. Maybe next time, who knows?I have also realized one thing that you DCA and forget and wait for 2025 November and that will be the time when you should come back and book profit. Not booking your profit is also a serious mistake. Those who could have sold at $69k sold at $50k and lost $19k per Bitcoin despite being in profit.",

It is all happening gradually this shows that next bull run bitcoin price will hit above $100k. You shouldn't feel bad,because if bitcoin price goes below what you bought it,just relax and take away your mind from your investment before you know it,the price will rise up again. I hope that you didn't invest in a short term investment or borrowed money to invest. Patient is the key to a successful investment.

I will also tell you not to be so afraid, if you want,  learned yourself for doing analyze  and then start investing for long-term by perfect DCA management.
