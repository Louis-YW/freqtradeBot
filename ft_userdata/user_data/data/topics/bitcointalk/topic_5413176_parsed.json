Russia is the only country which did not go through the procedure of being admitted into the UN, according to Article 4.  According to Article 23 of the UN charter, Russia is not a permanent member of the UN Security Council! The UN’s current charter says that the Soviet Union still exists, while Russia is not mentioned altogether.We demand that Antonio Guterres and the UN DGACM exhibit documents certifying the Russian Federation’s membership in the UN. If such documents are absent — we demand an end of Russia’s fictitious membership in the UN.Russia should be barred from the UN, as according to Article 4 of the UN charter, only peace loving nations can be part of the UN. Russia must stop waging an agressive war in Ukraine and return to its internationally recognized borders!Such a course of action would remove Russia's UN veto power, which blocks many peaceful resolutions, and restore peace and order to the international community.\"",

      "body": "The UN is a do-nothing organization. If member nations don't want to back what the UN says, the UN saying goes down the drain.Russia doesn't care if they are kicked out. Through the sanctions, they are already out in any practical way. And with BRICS having already been formed, it is a second UN already, even though it isn't called such.On top of that, before the sanctions, Russia was winning the trade war. That's why the US pushed the sanctions... to stop Russia winning in friendly trade.I don't necessarily favor Russia, but the US has already conquered the American people through banking and taxes, and the US has conquered Europe in a similar way, and right now Russia is the only thing that is keeping the world free from US conquest. Note that there is a difference between the US and the USA/America. The US is the government, and the USA/America is the people.",

      "body": "What Russia is doing today in clear violation of the provisions of the United Nations, in that a country belonging to the United Nations invades another country that is a member of the United Nations, is not new. America did that when it invaded Iraq in 2003 despite the General Assembly condemning the invasion resolution, as well as the Security Council, but America did not listen to anyone.It is the same as what Iraq did when it invaded Kuwait in the early nineties, but at that time the United Nations supported a resolution condemning Iraq and issuing resolutions to form a joint international force to deter it. Of course, what is happening against Iraq cannot happen against Mama America or any other great country, in particular those who have permanent seats in the Security Council.",

If member nations don't want to back what the UN says, the UN saying goes down the drain.Pretty much this. Further, much of the UN is in \"bed\" with China, and looks after China's interests, even if doing so means violating large groups of people's human rights. Quote from: xenon131 on September 11, 2022, 01:50:12 PMhttps://www.change.org/p/kick-russia-out-of-the-un?signed=true\"With the current UN Membership, Russia is neither a part of the Security Council or a UN member.

Russia is in fact a prominent member of the UN security council (source). Sure, it may be possible that some of the paperwork was not completed properly, however, if this is the case, this is the first I have heard of it. Regardless, I would refer to you BADecker's quote at the beginning of my post.",

And it's not even petition as you don't verify your identity while signing it. You have to enter your full name and email. If someone would want, he would be able to sign it thousands times from different emails",

      "body": "Why not a petition to kick the US out of the UN? Russia is only protecting herself against the US using the Ukraine to try to harm her. But really, it goes way beyond this one little skirmish. Check out what is happening in China.Pray for Ukraine?Quote from: http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2022/september/09/pray-for-ukraine/I suppose that it is supposed to mean that we should pray for the people of Ukraine who are suffering because of the unjustified Russian invasion of their country. If only things were that simple.Some observations are in order.This appeal is based on the overly simplistic yet false and evil notion of Ukraine, good; Russia, bad.This trite expression in the form of a prayer request is virtue signaling at its worst.I think we are at the point now where someone saying \"Pray for Ukraine\" is the verbal equivalent of someone wearing a face mask.If U.S. soldiers are heroes for following their government's orders, then why aren't Russian soldiers heroes for doing the same?The Ukrainian nationalists (and the Christians who hang on their every word) who compare Putin to Hitler are gravely insulting Jews.How come I have never heard any Christians say that we should pray for the ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine who were shelled for the past eight years by the Ukrainian military?...",
