      "body": "Generally, you want to create Shamir Shares in a secure environment and that would automatically rule out doing so remotely because that is an entire path for the attacker to exploit. You would first need to ensure that your remote environment is sanitized and your connection is secured.Afterwards, you would probably want to stick to a known standard, SLIP39 is one that I would recommend. Here's a Python tool that Trezor uses: https://github.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic/. You should try your best to find one that is more refined rather than this but I can't find any other reputable code myself.",

      "body": "I have seen Shamir secret sharing to be an option to protect seed phrase, it is true that it has shares (let me regard it as M) part of secret (let me regard the secret as N) that can be used to reconstruct the seed phrase, private key or anything it is used to encrypt, but I do not like the fact that what supposed to be words (seed phrase) encryption is converted to characters like the private key which is difficult to backup. I prefer multisig wallet instead.Quote from: NotATether on August 08, 2022, 05:19:18 AMMay I ask what is the name of the wallet software that is giving you the backups in the form of Shamir shares? Note that the more parts of the whole you have scattered, the more risk there is that you lose one of them.Assuming you have 7 secrets scattered, but you make it to require just 3 secrets to be used to reconstruct the whole words. If 4 are lost, the remaining 3 can reconstruct the word. So it depends. If it is 7-of-7, you are correct, because the whole 7 secrets would be needed.",

I wouldn't do that. You should use any tool solely in an offline and disposable environment.I use TAILS for this and don't allow a TOR connection to be active rendering TAILS to be completely offline. After shutdown TAILS has forgotten everything. Import/export of safe scripts and data can be done with an additional USB stick before shutdown of TAILS.As tools you can have a look at the provided three scripts here: https://iancoleman.io/ (download the scripts, verify, use only the offline versions!)Or you choose some other verified tools. Electrum e.g. can import SLIP-39 but not create it.You should thoroughly test your recovery! To my knowledge SLIP-39 is not commonly adopted by other wallets. Trezor T can create and import it, Electrum can only import it. I'm not aware of other wallets to use it.With 10of10-shares you have no redundancy whatsoever. That makes no sense to me, except that none of the shares reveals any details as a normal non-SSS split-setup would do. You loose any single 10of10 share, you loose all data as you can't recover anymore.Do you mind to explain your 10-of-10 setup?",
