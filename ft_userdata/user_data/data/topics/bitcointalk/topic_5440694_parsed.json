  "content": "For those who do not know the FSBThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. It was established after the G20 London summit in April 2009 What's happening:International regulations framing the cryptocurrencies industry are expected to be significantly strengthened by this summer.FSB has published the outcomes of its recommandations about the regulation of the industry.https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160223.pdfProblem: - the financial system faces a risk of destabilisation.It's a WOW white paper. They even invented a new word: \"cryptoisation\", the transition from existing established currencies to digital assets (= the dedollarisation)Geez, LeGaulois is cryptoized- risks of interconnections between traditional and decentralised finance. For exemple, this case of interconnection (related to FTX):Quote\"That's why I warned about the dangers of allowing crypto-currencies to become intertwined with the banking system,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). \"Under no circumstances should taxpayers be left to bear the brunt of the collapses in the crypto industry - a market rife with fraud, money laundering and illicit financing.\"Borrowings at Signature - a commercial bank best known for its multi-family home loans before jumping into the cryptocurrency craze - have more than doubled from the highest amount it has seen in several years. Silvergate, meanwhile, had no bank loans for home loans a year earlier.The $1.1 trillion Home Loan Bank system provides low-cost financing to its more than 6,500 members, which include commercial lenders, savings banks, credit unions and insurers. Comprised of 11 state-licensed cooperatives, the Federal Home Loan Banks, also known as the FHLBs, were created to support housing finance during the Great Depression. Today, they inject liquidity into the banking system, using implicit government support to borrow money cheaply.While helping banks build liquidity is part of the FHLBs' mission, some observers say that supporting spinoffs from the crypto industry is a far cry from the original intent.Good job, you asked for regulations claiming it will help the mass adoption? While it does the opposite...MICA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) et TFR (Transfer of Funds Regulation) will be worldwide very soon",

It said it was for a diversification of its activities but look like they're just anticipating...As for the bridges between CBDCs, not so surprising since they were the ones making bridges for- the economic and monetary union in Europe. With the euro currency and even with ECU (probably the 1st euro)- long before, to assist in the settlement of the reparations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after the world war #1- and many other bridges. If I'm correct it started to be here after the crisis in 1929.Too many internationnal agencies now lurking at the cryptocurrencies industry. That doesn't smell good to be honest",

      "body": "im simply sticking with legacy transactions. and not going to store value in other tx formats with trojan backdoor opcodes and bloated miscounted weight that fictionalises how much data is actually being sent into blocks and around the networkit is noticeable how some of the prime players that promote segwit and TR are themselves still storing their real value on legacy too. which shows they dont fully trust their new schemes they put into the code. (sipa and luke JR are prime candidates of pushing for segwit and TR yet both have their main stashes on legacy)but yea all the corporate sponsorship of devs to promote the silly \"extras\" which have not helped bitcoin grow its transaction count per block. but just done to allow gateway tx formats to be used to push people towards using other networks for payments. either with deceptive promises of better features/cost on other networks or by causing certain things on the bitcoin network that have resulted in a reduction in tx count utility of blockspace.alot of these new tx formats have caused alot of new cludgy code whereby these new formats are not even finalised \"features\" so if bitcoin core devs were to be replaced(yep humans retire) and a new team were to improve bitcoin and remove the cludge and bad code of unfinalised crap. id rather stick to the simple operations and formats that just do what they have always done. that dont need bug fixing. thus avoid any risk of issues when they try to bug fix the new formats which could break those formats operationallyas for the macro economics of the businesses involved. yes the \"mass adoption\" lobbying of declaring bitcoin a currency then a asset currency then a commodity has allowed alot of the old institutional invaders to treat bitcoin differently, we should have instead persisted with treating bitcoin as a property thus protecting people via many laws such as property law, did you know that a legacy TX cannot be \"locked\" to peg value to another network token. thus legacy cannot be treated as a commodity when traded, thus the CFTC cant really put controls and regulatory policy on people only handling legacy payments(commodity =  base product used to create other products)yep we can lobby that legacy gets treated different than segwit. much like a dollar received by a employer(income) is treated differently than a dollar received via a stocks/share portfolio(capital)this can evolve into certain situations where exchanges that handle commodity coins(btc on segwit) have to be licenced by both SEC and CFTC, whereby we can lobby exchanges that only allow deposits and withdrawals of legacy become only regulated by at most SECEG legacy swaps treated like merchant sales/auctions of private propertyand if done right if we can re categorise legacy as private value property. then even the SEC cant touch people and businesses that only handle legacy utxos,, but hey chances of moral people wanting to support this is low. as you say, there are too many wolves in the hen house",

While it does the opposite...MICA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) et TFR (Transfer of Funds Regulation) will be worldwide very soonHehe I very much agree! This is certainly because much of the people in the community are using the coins in the cryptospace for speculation. They think regulations will make it much easier for more people buy and pump their coins to all time high. They also think that regulation will bring validity that they made the correct decision on their investment.Regulations will only bring more control on the how much liquidity can go in the cryptospace market. This implies that with less liquidity there will be less pumps. It will also bring more restrictions on how to use the cryptospace. This implies that it will be less attractive to use for moneylaundering, tax evasion and other forms of criminality. This will also certainly make the price dump.",

Bitcoin has never needed governments and their laws to evolve. For example, there were no laws for years, yet Bitcoin grew.Nowadays, they bother me with KYC, they bother me with taxs and accounting, they bother me because when I pay for something the merchant can ask my ID.
