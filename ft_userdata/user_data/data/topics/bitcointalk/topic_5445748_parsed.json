  "content": "I created this topic for users that may not be using the email used to register on OKX to be receiving messages, although I did not get any notification, but according to the news I saw this from, I think only OKX users that are located in Canada are the ones sent this message, but for those that have funds on the OKX, but not active on the exchange and not receiving email message from the exchange, this post is for you. You need to move your coins out of OKX due to new regulatory rules:Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/okx-to-cease-operations-in-canada-by-june-22-2023angeOn March 20, cryptocurrency exchange OKX informed Canadian users via email the firm “will no longer provide services or allow users to open new accounts in Canada starting on Mar. 24, 2023, 12:00 AM EST,” citing “new regulations.” According to OKX, existing Canadian customers must close open options, margins, perpetual and futures positions by June 22. Fiat or tokens must also be withdrawn by that date.Quote“Your funds will remain safe in your account until you withdraw them. You will be able to withdraw dollars to your linked bank account and cryptocurrency to your self-custody wallet or your cryptocurrency account on another exchange. “We should always know that we should never leave coins on any exchange, this is another good reason not to leave coins on any exchange, because if the users do not transfer their coins before the said date, maybe they will not be able to transfer their coins again, or it may take a very annoying process that can frustrate the person. Also exchanges can be hacked, another reason not to leave your coins on any exchange.",

I'm not sure when they changed this, but it went from 10 BTC to ~3.6 BTC (the equivalent of 100k USD per day) which is still plenty but with the news you mentioned, it makes me think that they're going the same route as Binance and will eventually make KYC mandatory for everyone.",

According to what I am reading online, it is believed that OKX want to temporary and stop providing services to Canadians because of this: Quotea prohibition on the part of the CTP in respect of clients buying or depositing Value Referenced Crypto Assets (commonly referred to as stablecoins) through crypto contracts without the prior written consent of the CSAI do not the exact reason, but I know OKX was not able to comply with one or some of the commitments above. @OmegaStarScream. Maybe it is related to KYC, I do not know. Is it KYC related, or that is not the reason?",

The required information is name, nationality, card or passport data without you sending pictures to them.I filled in random data and the account came back with the same old withdrawal limits but it is a sign that something is going on with this platform and therefore it is not just about users from Canada.",
