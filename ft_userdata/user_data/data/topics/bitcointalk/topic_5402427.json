I told them several time I do not have dokumentation that old, but they keep asking. Does anyone have similar problem with Bitstamp? Speak with them about proving ownership with a common IP or notice them to your local court, to prove you are the owner. If you can't find the documentation that old, ask the banks formally to send to you, if not get a court order for them to proceed with it. In 2013, KYC was not mandatory on Bitstamp",

You can try to convince them that it is from you doing mining way back or any kind of doing you did those days, send them screenshots of the transaction, the address you used on the transfer to bitstamp. I hope those are still available to you.",

I cannot even rember how I got them.You could basically say whatever they want to hear. You could simply say you bought the bitcoin from XXXXX. What they don't want to hear is something like \"hey, I hacked a website long ago\" or \"I was selling drugs and I bet all the profits on a gambling site and I won a lot\"If you can't even remember how you got the bitcoins, it's going to be hard. Can't you be sure you didn't just buy them on the platform with a bank transfer? Because you could know where to look at (your bank statements).The bad news for you is that Bistamp is well known to be silly to verify the customers. They have the habit to ask for deep information like your job etc... Quotethey have frozen my account asking for payment slip etc. for 2013What else do they ask for? Did they at least ask you for a copy of your ID card and proof of residence?7BTC is a lot of money!",

Start a fight with them and ask clearly what they need. Start writing their social media and try to find an exchange owner. If everything fails then do a press release.
