  "content": "This happened to me 2 weeks ago when I'm trying to convert my USDT to my local currency using the Bybit P2P exchange.The scammer lists his buying order on Bybit at an average price and not the typical scammer that uses too good to be true price. His profile trust rating has a 100% success rate but with only 10 transactions. I'm worried about the low transaction count but his trust rating convince me to give this buyer a shot. At first he was very active saying he is online when I place my order. Until he messages that he already sent the payment. As shown on the image below.I also received a message coming from a Gcash number that I indeed received the payment. I'm not sure how this happened that time but as reading in our local discussion about this subject. I find out that this is an SMS spoofing and they can fake a text message as if they are a real wallet message.But because I'm not 100% convinced about this user since the start and I'm always checking my wallet balance to verify, I find out that there's no balance entered on my wallet. This time I asked him to provide a screenshot in the Bybit chat which he become inactive already. I immediately request an appeal to make sure that the scammer will not get my crypto. This is very hassle because I submit documents of my transaction history for that day and a screen record of my wallet showing that I didn't receive the money.I get my crypto back after a total of 5hrs of waiting which is a totally chaotic experience because I was supposed to use the money to purchase an important item that was on sale at that time which I missed due to this shitty scammer.Lesson learned: Always check your balance directly on the wallet you are using and never trust an SMS notification. Avoid dealing with a user that has a low completed transaction despite they have a high trust rating because some of them are just farming trust through completing small orders until they have an established trust score",

      "body": "Had a very similar experience In binance last week. The buyer showed me a transaction receipt from his end but I am always such person that checks his account balance first before confirming payment. Infact the buyer insisted the there was network issue from my bank and when I requested for my bank transaction history nothing of such transaction was initiated or even left pending on my account so I had to report to binance support and it took me more than 24 hours luckily I didn’t release my coins throughout the entire time so the buyer had to cancel my order.First thing his not to look just at the rating of the buyer but Also his purchasing power. The number of transactions he has involved in Plays a big role. And do not be swayed to believe just any of them.",

      "body": "It was obvious that at the time the user went offline, he or she was actually looking for fabricated evidence to convince you that payment was sent. The vendor was never aware that you are smarter than he thinks. Even users with higher rating and successful number of trade can still scammers. They can trade within them self just to increase successful trade number. Most of the P2P exchanges have those scammers lined up looking for victims; I usually use Binance. That's why we are always advised to login to our mobile banking apps and confirm our payment if what the sender claims to have sent is the same as what is on your account. If not, proof of payment is not enough to convince anyone that payment was actually made.",

Most people would simply buy that item on sale using the rest of their cryptocurrency, or of they were really in need, fiat money. Was the transaction so big and the item so expensive that you missed the purchase because of that little scam attempt, or were you rather more preoccupied and worried and forgot to buy that thing that you wanted?

Avoid dealing with a user that has a low completed transaction despite they have a high trust rating because some of them are just farming trust through completing small orders until they have an established trust score That's also true in the fiat world where people send you fake paypal messages, or try to be the middle man for a transaction to steal the money before it's received by the seller. First red flag is usually the thing you knew - the offer was too good to be true, but still went on with it. That's how people fall into these traps.",

I'm not sure how this happened that time but as reading in our local discussion about this subject. I find out that this is an SMS spoofing and they can fake a text message as if they are a real wallet message.They probably used application to person messaging services which allows you to edit the sender ID to whatever you want. Since the phishing text also has the same \"GCash\" sender ID, it will be nestled along legitimate messages from actual GCash which can be a bit tricky for unsuspecting users. Same thing happened with singapore postal service years ago, see: https://mothership.sg/2019/03/scammers-phishing-links-singpost/But good job on making it a habit to check your balance on your app!

Never trust anyone no matter how good they talk or how good their score are. After experiencing this kind of scam method, I stop trading on people who doesn't convince me with their ratings eben if they offer higher exchange offer to those rating who really stands out. This is avoidable even if you noticed it late as long as you haven't sent the money. Appeal button is always be your friend. Though it's a hassle given that there is some process to it. It's just better to avoid it and just sacrifice few penny gains than a big hassle.",

When I receive money in my Mobile banking account, I get an SMS and a notification from my mobile banking app. If I get an SMS but don't get a notification from my mobile banking app, I always check the app balance to ensure I receive the transaction. This is how I caught scammers twice. I was able to report that scam to the platform, and it didn't take a long time like yours. It took me 30 minutes. Both times the buyer was banned. I suggest always trying to make deals with verified profiles and see how many trades they have completed and their success rate. Scare the scammer buyer by sending messages. Both times the buyer canceled the order from his side. So I asked the platform and pointed it out. I told them the buyer marked the order as paid and sent me fake SMS. If they paid, why did they cancel the order? Both times the platform heard me and banned those scammers.",

      "body": "I have the same experienced with the OP and I share it in our local boards: {Babala}: Mag-ingat sa P2P trading. In my case, I didn't get any SMS that I already got the money in my account. But the buyer insisted that she has send it already on my account and as if I'm the own who has problems and pressuring me to released the funds right away. And the thing is that she has the audacity to ask for the support because I didn't released any. But in the end she didn't give any proof that she sent me the funds so my order was cancelled and my funds back to my account in less than 24 hours. So yes, be very very careful dealing with anyone in P2P not just in Bybit, but also in Binance because I know someone who has been victimized as well. And as you can see, the message that you got is almost the same from what I got, maybe the same people?Might as well be good if you can go to our local boards and post your experienced @OP?* Another lesson learned is that if the buyer is offering too high, as compare to others, then most likely it's too good to be true.* Also you can check the history as well to see how many trades that individual has done in the past, if it is less than 10, then the account is fairly new (which happens to me), so most likely going to pull a scam.",
