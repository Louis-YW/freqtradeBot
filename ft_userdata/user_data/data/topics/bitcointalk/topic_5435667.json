  "content": "I opened up an account with Sportsbet.io and deposited about 250 dollars worth of bitcoin, after I had won my bet I tried to withdraw and it did not let me. Eventually the team wanted me to KYC which I did successfully. After a couple of days, they replied that I had used a double spent on my bitcoin and took my winnings and my deposit. I tried emailing them again because this was 100 percent not true but they have not been responding to me. The day I deposited my bitcoin there was a backlog on the blockchain. Eventually I sent the same transaction again so that it could be confirmed quicker. But this ended up getting my money taken. I have only heard good things about sportsbet.io and it sucks that this happened to me. Most of my friends and even my girlfriend had an account with them that works fine. Of course it?s me that got the crap end of the stick. My username is jumpy192",

      "body": "Took your winning from my perspective is wrong.First of all, I also have some experience \"double-spending\" to make the transaction getting fast because the fee it's to small. The casino is \"Roobet\", however the system Roobet it's self cannot handle double spending.Make the first transaction still on their log-record deposit since they accepted balance can be credited with 0 confirmation and to be withdraw the transaction must have 1 confirmation. It's also make a problem for me.But they handle is good, manually remove the first one and I can withdraw my money without KYC or anything. I think \"Sportbet\" should try to look first the case, for what-case user do the double spending.",

That's why i dont understand why they have just closed my account and wont answer my emails. This happened around christmas so I have given them ample time to respond. It sucks that they just claim that I double spent and get to keep the money.",

My wallet sent it with a low fee and I sent it again after 4 hours of waiting for a confirmation.So, you bumped transaction fee using RBF feature. Right?When you bump the fee, the original transaction is replaced with a new one paying more transaction fee. Sportsbet probably credited your balance once they saw your unconfirmed transaction. When you bumped the fee, that transaction became invalid and they thought that you are trying to cheat them. Since the replacing transaction was made to sportsbet, you didn't cheat them. You should contact their support and explain this to them. Maybe for increasing the transaction fee, your wallet decreased the output value and this caused the amount received by sportsbet to be lower than the amount they credited to your account. Did you send exactly the same amount as the original transaction to sportsbet in your second transaction?",

Not that it seems to be the case here, but sometimes if you're from a certain region then unfortunately you can get caught up in more stringent checks due to other people who are taking advantage in the same region. In fact it is often a legal requirement for these companies, if they are operating from stronger jurisdictions, that they gather such information for the financial regulators. They may have lots of different triggers that cause them to ask for such validation but eventually it is likely to happen.",

But double spending should have no problem for them. So, they will not/ they cant stuck your fund for double-spending. But if you reject your deposit/try to reject your deposit by double spending fee then they can disable all access to their site. And also, you have not provided any evidence about your accusation. Would you like to provide further information about the accusation? I become surprised when I see a new account creates this type of accusation without providing any evidence. The incident happened like> search on google>get the link of the forum>post accusation on the forum. And these types seem to me like a fake accusation.",

That doesn't make a lot of sense. I have read your new post regarding this issue and it seems that they are no longer responding to your concerns. I guess the only thing that you can do now is wait since you already notified one of their reps here in the forum, and hopefully get an answer that is fair and just to you. Sending them a flurry of messages would likely just annoy them, so maybe just wait before you send another one.",
