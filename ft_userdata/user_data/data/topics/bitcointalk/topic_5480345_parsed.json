  "content": "I follow the carnivore diet for years now. It basically involves eating only meat and animal products for various health reasons from weight loss, reducing inflammation, longevity, etc etc. While this post is not too much of a dietary advert, I stumbled upon an interesting Vice article which claims the way I'm eating is very much related to bitcoin  https://www.vice.com/en/article/ne74nw/inside-the-world-of-the-bitcoin-carnivoresWTF - I thought.The term \"bitcoin carnivore\", possibly coined by Ammous, the author of the best-selling book The Bitcoin Standard, also promoted by Goldstein from the Nakamoto Institute and various bitcoin maxis, in fact exists. Allegedly, there's an only-meat organized dinner every BTC conference in Miami. Well, I didn't know.So the puzzles I didn't know even exist suddenly click together.I'm now a cultist, a rebel against both the fiat system and the food system.Welcome me as the newest member of Bitcoin Carnivores",

This is probably just something that they've thought so they can be more cooler I think. I don't know if this is something that's really rebelling against the current status quo of our society because it's just food, I don't think it's going to be a big support to what bitcoin's already been doing.",

Many are allergic to certain substances in vegetables without knowing, this is the ultimate elimination diet. Moreover, with lots of attention even the micronutrients can be completely fine on the carnivore - so basically no point of needing greens if you know what's inside which food. Replying also to a previous comment I'm not choosing this because of \"being cool\", it's obviously one of the hardest diets to follow, and you basically can't eat out with friends etc. I managed to improve serious health conditions. I go to doctor way less frequently now, and when I do my bloodwork I always tell them to not get shocked by the cholesterol etc. The normal ranges are for SAD (the standard American diet) and they make no sense without context. Many dont know unfortunately. I always double-check the authenticity of the information (even proofread the medical studies), because everything and its opposite is already out there. And many dietary facts (what the general public knows about cholesterol and diseases, saturated fats, vegetable oils, etc) are already debunked, yet engraved into the public minds. We've come to the point where you can't really even trust the studies, because of incorrect methodologies (questionnaires) or p-hacking. And referring to incorrect studies makes an avalanche.In this regard, - dont trust, verify -, I think there actually might be some connection.",

Well now that balanced diet I think isn't somewhat true, there's a lot of scientists/nutritionists out there that's going to be outraged by that statement because there's a science behind those balance diet system and it would be weird of us to disregard scientists trying to tell us something. Yes, we are spectators but that don't mean that we can't give our opinion or judgment to what they're doing.",

So, here I am, unknowingly stumbling into a world where what people connects with rebellion against the fiat system haha So many things new to me",

If we only needed meat to survive, there wouldn't be a plethora of another categories of food available and disponible for us to ingest. We don't need only proteins (which meat is abundant in), but also carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, lipids. Each kind of food is rich in one of those nutrients, so why not taking advantage of all of them? For fad reasons? To look cool, eccentric, different from everyone else? Or to feel part of a group of idiots who don't even know who you are?It's up to you do decide what to eat, how to live, and so on...
