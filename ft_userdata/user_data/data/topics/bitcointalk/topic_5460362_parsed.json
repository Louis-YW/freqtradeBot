  "content": "Hi.I just received my new Full Node Package Unit from FutureBit. It was delivered overnight by FedEx, and the box was un-damaged and looked really nice.I carefully opened and removed the unit, careful not to touch any of the underside components. (i also checked the SD and M2 drive, like instructed)I am a little bit more educated with mining then a newbie, although all my experience is just with GPU's (RTX 3090, 4070, etc...)I opted out for the 200w power supply from FutureBit, cause I have a few 1000w lying around. Anyhow I plugged everything in and followed the quick start guide carefully. NO POWERI have tried another power supply (corsair 1000w modular) the first was a older Silverstone (also modular)I grabbed a typical 6 pin PCIe cable from previous custom computer builds. this is just a 1 GPU pcie cable that's used to power a high end Graphics Card ((is this where i went wrong??? do i need something different for these asic units???)))am i missing the obvious, lol  please help..also i relize that some power supplies need the motherboard connection to work, I have also tried this, by just setting the asic unit next to a PC and unplugging the 2 cables from 2 RTX 3090 GPUS in one of my rigs. Still NO POWER!!!Confused!, lol.....thank you in advance.",
