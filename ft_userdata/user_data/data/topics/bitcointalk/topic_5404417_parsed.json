Its like you are just wasting your money because for sure what you promote their will most like not be seen by your target audiences.",

This post promoting others on behalf of you.And why it doesn't make any sense? There are actually earning opportunities like that. Its called paid to click but usually the rate for those type of jobs are not 1 dollar per a few click but can be lower than that however I don't think this is the one the op is offering here but it must be a paid or premium groups as what his title says.Maybe after you pay 1 dollar as an entrance fee, you can access a group where you can find recommendations if what coin can pump high. And what is that solid idea you are looking about? This is already his idea and there's nothing wrong if he is promoting the project of someone else because maybe he is being paid to do it.",

This post promoting others on behalf of you.I don't think this was ad of earning 1$ by clicking, I think he wanted us to join a group for 1$ where he or someone is sharing the list of coins. Whatever is the case, it is not useful and also when I checked the site, it is not loading. You can understand what would be the quality of the group who is making for a dollar. We should better stop searching the internet for such scam programs and try to earn online through genuine online works.",
