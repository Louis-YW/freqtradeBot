  "content": "As the title say.RPC returned \"Éxécution...\" and then nothing. After ten minutes I reopened the backup wallet.Wallet has no name (I put \"\" in the parameter). I gave it a name when I first used Bitcoin Core in 2016 but somehow it got lost along the way with new versions. Passphrase and interface are French.Should I wait it gets fixed or it could be done now? I want to migrate from Berkeley DB to sqlite. Not sure if it's legacy or descriptors.",

I haven't tried to import scripts or pubkeys, but in the last days I tried to install the Berkeley DB dependencies to run bitcoind from the terminal (on a Ubuntu PC). bitcoind still couldn't load my wallet. Everything worked fine with bitcoin-qt UI.NEW: I reloaded my backup wallet. I saw my transactions and balance again but I did not send nor receive. I shut down bitcoin-qt. When I started it again, it started with some bitcoin-25.99* version, and no wallet was loadable. It was only a node with peers, nothing else. I resinstalled bitcoin-25.0 and finally I could access my wallet again. I successfully made a new transaction with it. It says \"*.legacy.bak\". Migration apparently didn't work.At that point I'm just too afraid to try migratewallet again. I don't want to end up with a corrupted wallet file. I'd really want to use bitcoind though but it doesn't seem possible with a legacy wallet.",

You probably didn't have the wallet dependencies installed in a way that the build could find them, so it didn't build the wallet component.if you want to use bitcoind, it should already come with the bitcoin-qt that you already have. They are released together. Regardless, there is no difference between the functionality of bitcoind and bitcoin-qt, except that bitcoin-qt has a GUI. The RPCs all behave the same way.What happens if you just wait longer for the migration to finish?",

This time, I loaded it from the same folder as bitcoin-qt and gave it the same permission:cd '/(localpath)/bitcoin-25.0/bin'chmod +x bitcoind./bitcoindIn another terminal I tried: bitcoin-cli getbalanceIt returned a different error:error code: -19error message:Wallet file not specified (must request wallet RPC through /wallet/<filename> uri-path).Try adding \"-rpcwallet=<filename>\" option to bitcoin-cli command line.So I did as instructed: bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"\" getbalanceIt worked. I will write bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"\" from now on I guess.I think I'm going to wait for more bugs get fixed and a migration button to be added to the UI before I do it. Thanks.",

But you should keep the backup of the original legacy wallet just in case you later find out something went wrong.",
