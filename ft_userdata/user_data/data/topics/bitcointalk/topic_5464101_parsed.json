      "body": "This really appears to be serious, as a lot of wallets are in danger if this happens to be the case. There might be a lot of funds already lost that are yet to be accounted for. Just take a look at the time at which the exploit was said to take place: \"July 12.\" This has been going on for more than a month now, and it's just coming up. If this has been going on without anyone's notice, then the said 900,000 dollars might just be a little figure compared to what has been stolen so far.About the statement quoted below: do most of the wallets that are popularly used make use of BX or Libbitcoin?Quote I have been informed by the folks at http://distrust.co that they have filed a CVE against Libbitcoin. Apparently, a wallet product used a BX command in a manner explicitly warned against. This is not a bug in BX or Libbitcoin; it is reckless wallet development.   Source If yes, then anyone using a wallet that is in any way related to or connected to BX or Libbitcoin and is yet to be affected should make a move and transfer any funds they have into a safe wallet without waiting to confirm how vulnerable this has been and who is affected or who is not. It's better to act now than regret later.",

Due to the interference of various hackers usually the access to one's wallet goes into the hands of the hackers due to which the hackers transfer all the funds from their wallet without their knowledge.  Sometimes it can happen due to our mistakes. Many times different fraudsters lure a member with different amounts of money due to which when a member who is lured by money connects his wallet to the website of the hackers, the access to the wallet is automatically transferred to the hands of the hackers due to which the hackers take all the money from the wallet to their own wallet. We should always choose secure wallets to keep BTC. By choosing a secure wallet and not sharing any information about your wallet with anyone else, you can protect your BTC from all these unwanted events.",

Actually you advice is very nice, and secondly hackers are the elements of this, because they desperate of penetrating to our wallet, but what I want to say in nutshell is that this particular issue of disappearing coin in the wallet we can seen it for long time ago, I don't know maybe newbie have come across to it and that is while op created another thread related to it. But since I notice what's bitcoin I have not seen anyone complained of the bitcoin been lost or disappear from it's wallet.

There's no perfect system or situation anywhere in this world. When people canvass for open source wallets as if those are the next best thing discovered after Bitcoin, I'm quick to remind them of uncertainties that can also happen with such wallets too. I'm sure you came across the I've been hacked (Electrum 4.3.2) sad story of julerz12. To even say it happened with Electrum means there's no wallet that's safe. If you haven't read that story, here's an opportunity to do so. In a manner of speaking, I can pointedly tell you that our safety (the security of our funds online) greatly depends on us, not on a random fellow online who sits in a remote place developing some concepts or apps. The first in this line of safety is to never chase every new concepts and apps we find online just so we can sound woke. I, for one, won't subscribe to such wallets or apps not so much talked about; to start with. The stuff OP is talking about is relatively unknown. Why would anyone fancy their chances with it.",
