Since this does not happen often, there is no requirement of clarifications. I believe, that too many people pressing the post button simultaneously may result in this database error.",

You are right and this is exactly what I wanted to point out to op after reading the post.I've had this same experience on several other platforms where so many users trying to use a feature at the same time,  and because the database could or can not handle that amount of request at the same time,  it causes that part of the platform, and sometimes,  the entire platform to crash.So I believe ops experience is not possibly a database error per say since it was only a one time thing,  and he seems to be the only one that experienced this, this confirms the fact that it is possible that there were several other users clicking the \"post\" button when op click the button to publish his post.",

Although the title says \"Database error\", it has got nothing to do with a database error of the forum. It's an error message the user Nekeni experienced when he was trying to open his Armory wallet.Quote from: Nekeni on November 30, 2017, 01:44:44 AMHello,I got a database error message when trying to launch Armory\"The DB has returned the following error : command checksum failure. Armory will now shut down.\"",

Especially, when you're doing things quickly, it seems to happen a little more frequently, or taking actions which take a lot longer, like deleting a lot of replies at once. I never contacted anyone about it, since I suspected that every staff user runs into the error, as I'm not doing anything particularly out of the ordinary. I don't think I've ever run into it outside of that though, except when maybe the old statistics were available to view, but they've been long disabled now.",
