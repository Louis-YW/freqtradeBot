As far as I know that Coinbase have that feature and most exchange platform have that kind of feature. I think that's what you can do to trade without canceling your order. I don't know any other solution to do what you wanted to do or maybe there are other ways that I don't know that could work without canceling an order.",

Once you've clicked \"Cancel,\" you're effectively closing the trade, which means you won't make or lose any money from it. If you're looking to secure your profits, you'll have to go ahead and close the trade. Remember, taking profits is always a good thing, even if it means saying goodbye to potential future gains.

What you're doing is canceling the trade, so you don't make a loss or profit because you canceled the trade. If what you mean is take profit, you can close your trade and later you will be able to get profit if your trade is successful. You must be able to distinguish between canceling a trade and closing a trade because they are different. Canceling means you withdraw yourself from the trade, while closing means you finish the trade.",

If coinbase is your favourite there are many tutorials on how to use the exchange perfectly for trading, you can find tutorials about this on Youtube, make a search about Coinbase trading and you will get numbers of results.This was how someone lost money trading on Kucoin because he has no idea what he is doing, he mistakenly sold some Bitcoin for way lesser price than the present selling price, crypto is not a place where a clue works, if all you have is a clue, you will make mistakes.

You didn't bought Bitcoin from Coinbase but placed a limit buy order to buy Bitcoin and that order was not filled I guess. When an order isn't filled then that means you haven't got any Bitcoin from the Coinbase exchange and your own trade wasn't filled. Even if Bitcoin price goes up you won't have any profit from that because your buy limit order wasn't executed in the first place. The trade was open because the limit price was never reached and that's why the order was not filled at all. And, when you clicked on the cancel button you simply canceled the non filled order and you got your initial crypto back that you place as buy order.That's the main reason for you getting out of the trade and not losing or making any profit. I recommend you to learn the difference between market order and limit order. When you place a buy market order then that order gets filled within seconds, but when you place buy limit order then the order will only get filled if the limit that is set is reached out. In your case I believe that you have placed a limit buy order but the limit range wasn't reached and the order wasn't filled, and that's why when you canceled the order you didn't make any profit or loss from that order.",

Look at your account's dashboard and see how much you've got there and look at the history of your trades if you're able to cancel it as what you've said.Then, when you see those amounts that you've got as your balance in your account and you already want to get out then the last thing you'll have to do is withdraw it. If ever you still got funds there on your Coinbase account.And before committing your next trade, study first the platform itself so that you're aware of those buttons and what you'll do whether you'll proceed or cancel a trade.",

You are probably trying to sell at a price above the current market price and that's why only the cancel option appears. Try changing the price and be careful not to rush it. If it reaches the price you want, you can convert it to USDT or anything else you want. As far as I understand, the reason why it says cancel is because the operation you want to do has not taken place yet. Please watch a few videos about trading and make no mistake.",

First of all learn the theory of trading before trading on exchanges, and if possible, ask for help if you know anyone who has used crypto exchanges before. If you do not know about trading and want to trade alone you are about to lose your balance absolutely. You either open a trade at the level you want or open a trade at the market price for purchase.If you press cancel you will have canceled your transaction. Set a buy level for Bitcoin and buy it, then set the level you want to profit from and sell it from there. Sometimes things don't go the way you want and you may lose. Remember canceling means throwing away profit or loss. When applying the advice you get here in practice, do not forget to get help from your friends who have traded in the stock market before.",

If the trade is still open that means he never bought it, it wasn't on his account, he opened a trade to buy it, but the price went up before he could, so he never did. So that means he used his money to buy something, put up an order, never bought it, in order to buy something you need to click market price, that guarantees that you buy it.That's what OP should do, he didn't even come to sell option, he wasn't selling anything he had, he was failing to buy, when he cancels he cancels the buy order, and that's the issue. I know it's a simple think for all of us here because we are so used to it, but the reality is that we are not really shocked about newbies who does these, they are learning.",
