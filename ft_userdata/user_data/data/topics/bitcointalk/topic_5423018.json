  "content": "Hello,Today is one of the worst days of my life. I cannot believe what Wintomato.com have done to me today. The simply took away my balance of 1.791 BTC (about 29K USD worth) with some rediculous reason mentioned. Let me explain the situation:I decided to join Wintomato.com in December 2021. I liked their design and their many livebetting options and started to bet live on my favourite sport NBA. I did not go quite well as I was losing way more than winning, but okay that is simply how it can go in sports betting. I continued betting on NBA during winter and spring, and then also started betting a lot on MLB during the summer. All in all, from December 2021 till this week I have probably placed about about 2000 bets (all on NBA and MLB, never on any shady leagues or sports) and lost a shitload. I remember I was down about 80K in USD at some point back in the summer. Then, in the last couple months it slowly went a bit better and especially the last 2 weeks I was on a roll, winning a lot of bets on NBA. So right now I was at the point of being \"only\" about 30K USD in the minus and I was quite happy that finally I was getting out of the hole I was in before. So since my balance got a little high (1.791 BTC) I decided to request a withdrawal of 0.4 BTC on Tuesday. Business as usual I was expecting, because the previous deposits and withdrawals (about 50 in total)  all went smooth and fairly fast, but this time the next day I saw it was rejected and then I saw a message saying I needed to do KYC and send in a selfie with my passport and a note with some text next to my head. Okay, fine, so I sent it. And then they kept silent for 2 days. The new withdrawal I submitted kept pending and was never processed and then today I log in to my account and suddenly my balance is set to all zero's......I was shocked and first I thought it must have been hacked or some kind of mistake and then I read the text they write saying they cancelled several bets because of some rediculous rule that I am \"value betting\"? So I check my betting history and see all kind of bets that are now suddenly cancelled in retrospect. Surprise, surprise, only winning bets are cancelled and never losing bets....It is completely rediculous that they think they can just randomly decide to cancel bets in hindsight. If this is fair then they can basically do anything they want to any customer whenever they like.....this is a totally unfair unethical practice!As I said, I have been an active customer there for 11 months and always used the same betting style. I am not doing value betting, whatever that may be. I simply watch the NBA and MLB games and when I feel like a team is going to win I place the bet, just like any other gambler would do. And why was my betting style never a problem when I was losing so much? And now one good run is suddenly not acceptable for them? Even when I am in a big minus altogether over the lifetime of my account, they simply decide to steal my own money. If I am doing \"value betting\" for 11 months over a sample of about 2000 bets in total, how can it be that I am not even in the plus? How much bigger proof do they need that this is not \"value betting\"?I am FLABBERGASTED by this decision. I knew Wintomato does not have a great reputation but because they treated me well for the past 11 months I thought they would be fair. Obviously I will never bet with them anymore and I would strongly advice anyone reading this not to open an account there.They only welcome people who keep on losing forever, if you go on even a small run they will simply confiscate your funds.And as rediculous as their rule is, it is not even listed in their general T&C: https://wintomato.com/en/terms-and-conditionsAfter a lot of looking around I eventually found out it's sneakily hidden somewhere in their Sports Rules right in between rules about weather abandonments etc, which is very shady and not a place where you can expect customers to look for such a rule. But that is not even the point, the point is that this is a very widely interpretable rule and basically gives them freedom to take away any winnings they like in hindsight for the full period of a month.IF they're gonna void bets then they have to void ALL my bets. Not just the winnings ones and not just the recent ones. Then please void all of my bets since I joined and in that case I would be getting even a lot more back than my balance was because I was still in minus. But ofcourse.....they decide that when I was losing I was placing normal bets and when I go on a small winning run, then those are suddenly \"value bets\". And of that recent period, of course the losers were fair losers, only the winning bets were the value bets! Haha, if I was not hurting so much right now, it would even be laughable!In hindsight, there was one alarming thing that happened to me back in September, when I was betting on an MLB game and won a bet with odds of 8 and they decided to randomly take away 9K USD worth of winnings because \"the odd was too high\" even though their sports betting provider settled the bet as normally won and all other books had completely comparable odds. But after a few days of discussion they decided to give me back this 9K they took away so I assumed they were reasonable people after all.But now, 2 months later, this happened.....I hope Wintomato can still come to their senses and realize that this is completely bullshit and unethical.Wintomato, I promise you it's better in the long run to be ethical and fair and build up a good reputation, like for example Sportsbet or Stake have done. This pays off much more in the long run than short term stealing will bring you. Now if you do not fix this issue you will have lasting reputation damage. Think hard about this!Here are the screenshots of my account:Confiscation:Randomly cancelled bets in hindsight:A screenshot of my account balance 2 days ago before the confiscation:And here proof that I was already betting at Wintomato from December 2021:",

But however, this is still an allegation until proven otherwise, and luckily we have representatives of \" Wintomato\" on this forum, of which I will like to ask what does \"Wintomato\" has to say about this allegations.? Because with all due respect, O.P has done nothing wrong from explanation given above, and should be given back his/her money in full @  $29,000,  i.e if Wintomato care about its reputation",

That's an obvious scam they only made their Casino to scam.Don't ever play again at a non-reputable Casino just like this.

Remove any sensitive and identifiable data, especially names, addresses etc.? Also, when were you warned about the activities? Was it during the period while the player was losing or did the warning arrive when he started winning a bit?I know what value bets are. Other bookies ban and limit players who partake in such activities, so they aren't exactly \"bet for fun\" type of activities. They could be considered a professional way of betting that isn't welcome at casinos. However, value betting is profitable long-term. If it's true that this particular player has a loss of $30k overall, how can he be value betting? Where is the logic in that? Are you saying that he was value betting even when he was losing? If he is now in a minus of $30k, he was probably down over $50k at one point in time since he mentioned that he started a positive streak.  Regarding your Sports Terms and Conditions, I saw the link you posted, but that link is nowhere to be found on the main page of your casino.
