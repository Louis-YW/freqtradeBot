It's not new, and I believe countries have been building portfolios of foreign currencies for more than 10 years ago. But each country has its own problem, and the dollar is still considered the most stable, about 60%.Schiff has been preaching this issue for decades and nothing happens. This is because no country or alliance is stable enough, or more stable than the US. Even now when Russia, China, and India want to build their own currency, many are skeptical about the lifespan of the currency (if it's really realized). As the wise man said, \"Partnership is bullshit.\" So the term \"de-dollarisation\" may not have the same meaning as Schiff said, well, he's a gold bug  It's kind of the same as the centralization issue on BTC. It's beneficial to have more than one strong party and the goal is to have multiple strong parties competing against each other.For now, don't get rid of your USD in exchange for gold (or whatever) because of Peter Schiff. It should come from the realization of there's a better alternative (which is currently none).",

Countries will have their time on the economic limelight for a time being and then all of those will die down eventually, leaving nothing for a country but some profits and change but no foothold on the world stage in terms of stability that the US has for a long time. I think part of it also comes from the idea that a lot of countries have looked up to the US and that they cannot really sever their ties with the superpower. So even if other countries have better offers and can come up with better products for a better price, they'd still regard the US in a high value albeit the latter not really doing anything from them apart from just being their ally.

You can trade other foreign currencies on the side but never dump your USD just yet.",

      "body": "I don't think it matters that de-dollarization will serve as a warning to the superpowers themselves. The reason is that the BRICS did oil transactions for the sake of leaving the US Dollar, based on GDP data of more than 26% in the world. This means that in other words the demand for US Dollars can fall by up to 26%, so the value of the Dollar will also fall.Furthermore, looking at it from the point of view of the crisis experienced by the US some time ago which resulted in the collapse of banks. Even though the US government tries to convince its customers that their savings are still guaranteed from a bank rush or bank out. It's just that the guarantee is only short-term. Maybe 10 to 15 years of US Dollars will be left behind if the client's large assets are not provided with long-term collateral.Therefore having anticipation is an action that needs to be taken. With the record of not completely releasing dollars but having investments in assets whose supply is limited. Whether it's gold, silver, land property, or even Bitcoin for the sake of having an exchange rate that can be switched at any time.",

Peter Schiff may have a valid point about the future of the US economy and the dollar, but we gotta think about all the crazy impacts of Dedollarisation. If we just drop the dollar like it's hot, the whole world could go down the drain, especially since it's the reserve currency and all that jazz.So here's the dealio, we gotta tread real careful when it comes to Dedollarisation, ya dig? But hey, let's not be afraid to take a walk on the wild side and check out other payment currencies, yo. The USD is pretty shaky, so it's about time we diversify our dough to avoid getting caught in the crossfire, you feel me? And hey, who knows, maybe this Dedollarisation thing could be the start of something big for countries out there, leading to some serious moolah.",

Here you just need to approach this issue from the point of view of who benefits from it.This is beneficial primarily to Russia and China, because tensions are growing sharply between these countries and the United States. After the Russian attack on Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions against it, Russia was removed from the dollar and the euro. Of course, she is forced to look for an alternative to these currencies and therefore is more inclined to use the Chinese yuan.China has long been conducting a covert economic and political struggle from the United States, and the use of currency in international transactions is of great importance.I personally do not see any reason to abandon the dollar.

Part of the things he is saying are true, there are countries and economies which are trying to ditch the American Dollar as reserve currency and fundamental bridge to do business, but it is rather very early to say how it is gonna go for those markets.There is always a good chance those new projects do not go anywhere an people stay holding and using the USD. Has it lost some of its value and trust? Yes, it is true, but obviously, Schiff and people like him which have always exalted gold over other assets are seizing this opportunity to push their own narrative and underestimate their own government, tagging the treasury of US as idiots that would leave the USD to sink into irrelevance.Again, it is too early for panic in America.",
