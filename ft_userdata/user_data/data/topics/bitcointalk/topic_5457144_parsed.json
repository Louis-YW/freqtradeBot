I believe this belongs more to the beginners & help section, maybe you can move it there. (bottom left corner, \"move topic\")About your question, put in a little effort, you just arrived and you're already prioritizing offers. Get to know the forum, and discussions, and learn something, the offers will come by themselves.These restrictions, which you see as a problem, were made in order to reduce the possibility of cheating to a minimum. It often happens that a reward or offer is overloaded with newly created accounts, probably by one or two people. Discouraging the creation of new accounts just to participate in the \"offer\" is a matter of maintaining fair conditions.",

      "body": "What kind of offers is that, if I may ask? If you are referring to signature campaigns, there's a reason for that and the reason is that the design of the BB code is more eye catching if your rank is higher (Of course the quality of the post matters too) but the design for higher ranks is way more visible than lower ranks.Regarding other offers, for instance, creating a website service or other services. It doesn't matter if you are newbie or high rank member, as long as you can prove that you have a background on that service and should be backed up by portfolio and experiences, you won't be hiring or offering work to newly created account without knowing anything about it, right?Anyone can easily create new account that's why people here trust high rank members than newbie account.",

And I'm not even Member/Legendary user.. all good to you, and thanks for answers  For signature campaigns, of course, you not only need higher ranks but good post history with merits in order to apply and participate in campaigns but this does not mean that there is nothing for a newbie or Jr member. There is a lot of opportunity in the bounties section where you can participate in social media campaigns plus there are some contests here too which accepts low ranks.Quote from: DisabledAF on June 21, 2023, 10:07:14 PMMaybe PM to me, and i can delete this for not spamming.. This is a valid question and is surely not a spam",

And over time, other members will notice your contribution, which will allow you to progress and achieve a higher forum rank. But if you're just looking for a place to work, I suggest you look elsewhere.That's very true the forum is basically devoted towards Bitcoin and anyone who has enough information about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are many newbies who are doing very well on the forum because they are somehow knowledgeable about Bitcoin and are contributing to the forum with some very informative posts, and they have been receiving merits from the reputed members of the forum. The merits are given to those posts which are made in high quality and can help others as a solution to well known problems. The merit system was basically introduced to stop spamming and account farming and so far the system has been working very well. The new users who have proper knowledge about Bitcoin, and at the same time they can share that knowledge and contribute on the forum will get merits, and those users can rank up very fast. OP if you are truly knowledgeable about Bitcoin then you'll rank up to a Jr member or member rank within few weeks. After that you can earn some money by taking part in bounty campaigns, and once you rank up to full member then you can take part in signature campaigns. You should also keep in mind that signature campaigns only accept those applicants who make very high quality and informative posts or replies. If a member contribute good materials to the forum and is active in most of the threads then only those members are preferable for signature campaigns.The service board is also open for newbie members, and if someone has mastered a skill fully then that user can also create their own service offering, and within days they get good clients if their service is unique. Look, the forum is not meant to earn money, but to discuss about Bitcoin and the things related to it. But, the service board is open for any type of skill and the ones who offer the services can directly work with the users of the forum. There are also some contests on the forum where anyone can take part as a participant, and most of those contests aren't limited to high rank members.",
