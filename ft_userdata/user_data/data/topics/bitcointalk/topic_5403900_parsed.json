  "content": "MARVEL.CASH is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart Chain. The game’s object is to hire your favorite MARVEL HEROES which in turn help you earn more BNB. These Marvel Heroes will work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of up to 7% upon your investments. The daily percentage return depends on your hero’s actions taken within the platform that impacts the hero’s efficiency rate.Once Heroes are bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, the Heroes will not stop their action of producing yield.The Contract has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the project’s longevity. These measures include maximum deposits, a cutoff time, and a cooldown time for withdrawals.The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your “cart” to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you’ve taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time and remove the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once.The withdrawal cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before one can make another withdrawal. The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded. This feature, in essence, will ensure the longevity and stability of the project.To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily hero’s earnings instead of selling them. The bonus is 5%. This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the Contract’s efficiency rate in the long run.For the Players who choose not to play the game and only sell, there will be a 10% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract.HIGHLIGHTED BENEFITS OF THE SMART CONTRACTThe “www.marvel.cash\" is a Decentralized Finance built on the Binance Smart Chain which provides the following benefitsHigh Returns of 7% Daily and 2555% APR5% Compound Bonus5% Referrals Bonus (1 level)12 Hours Compound Timer24 Hours Withdraw Cooldown48 Hours Rewards Accumulation Cut-OffAnti Whale ProtectionAnti Bot ProtectionDifferent Investment PlansThis Smart Contract has 4 unique plans which are differentiated by the term of the plan and the returns they provide.Captain America Plan — This smart contract plan offers members a Daily ROI of 3%.
