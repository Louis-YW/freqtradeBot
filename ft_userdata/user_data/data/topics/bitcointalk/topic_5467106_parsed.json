  "content": "I mined multiple whole Bitcoins using nullama's guide by now, and am about to start the rig back up, after some infrastructure changes.Therefore, anyone who needs a certain (potentially large) amount of Testnet BTC, do feel free to post a request in here and I will lend them out as long as I feel your explanation / reason for needing that amount makes sense.This is intended for development / testing use. In my personal experience, it can make sense to test the Bitcoin software you are developing one last time in a 'almost mainnet' configuration, e.g. being able to interact with it from a popular wallet, hardware wallet, and so on, which don't have a signet option, for instance.I strongly agree with the popular opinion that you should be able to test everything with even very small amounts, but I'm deliberately choosing not to set a hard cap, and will decide on a case-by-case basis.Address (also for returns): tb1qm068f6x09x2tyswpatvmen25kz2g6f7zexc9gvCurrent balance: 8.98512319 tBTCI think it goes without saying that the funds are meant to be returned after use, as is usual in every other faucet.. If you're a Newbie user or I otherwise suspect of not getting the coins (minus fees / whatever got lost in experimentation, say up to 10% loss) back, I may ask for a collateral in BTC or deny access to my faucet.Please post your request as follows:Code:Amount: <Value in BTC>Address: <Your Address>Project: <Short description and / or link to your project thread on Bitcointalk>",

There is just not a good place to install fans for cooling mining sticks. Something DIY or 3D-printed may help, but for a single or 2 sticks, that's a lot of time & money again.",

There is no reason to need even 1 whole tBTC for testing stuff, which is what it's actually made for.Let's keep this on-topic, please.",
