  "content": "Hi,I have some PYUSD (less than $2,000) and want to convert them to real decentralized crypto, e.g. BTC, ETH, DASH, etc. Can anyone recommend a marketplace for that? I would prefer a DEX, but after some search I could not find one supporting PYUSD, so I guess a CEX without KYC will do as well. After a bit of searching I found that Huobi supports PYUSD and does not require KYC, i.e. it supports KYC but it's not mandatory. I am not sure if there are other suitable CEXes.Any advice or pointers to suitable DEXes or CEXes will be greatly appreciated!",

Uniswap was the first DEX that I checked but somehow I managed to miss those pairs  And indeed keeping an eye on the spread is imporant.I haven't used Curve.fi before but will definitely check it.",
