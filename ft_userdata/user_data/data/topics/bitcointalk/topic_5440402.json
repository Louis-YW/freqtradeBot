  "content": "Investing in cryptocurrency can be thrilling, but many inexperienced investors make basic errors because they are so excited about the profit people make from trading cryptocurrencies that they believe they can ignore the small precautions and guidelines, resulting in the loss of some or all of their assets. So this post aims to increase knowledge among crypto novices so as to prepare and prevent them from repeating the same errors that have been made previously. The mistakes are as follows:-Lack of Basic Crypto Knowledge: Some people are drawn to cryptocurrency because of the excitement and profits associated with it. As a result, people become obsessed with making money and fail to understand how it works. Without the proper understanding, you run the risk of losing your assets quickly.-Inadequate password and seed phrase storage: A backup phrase known as the seed phrase is necessary to gain access to digital wallets where cryptocurrency is stored. These backup phrases must be correctly maintained since if they are lost or forgotten, you will be unable to access your assets or recover your bitcoin. To prevent asset theft, keep them in a location that only you have access to and that is not too hidden so that you can readily find them. You can preserve your seed phrase physically so you don't lose it or forget where it is.-Ignoring Fees: Many people who are new to using crypto exchanges have no understanding how the gas fee works, they simply purchase it and end up losing a significant amount of money over time. You can save money by discovering the lowest-cost exchange and selecting the most effective method of purchasing cryptocurrency. While looking for exchange that offers low fees it is also important to consider the reputation of the exchange. Sometimes itâ€™s better to use exchange with good reputation even when fee is high.-Keeping Crypto in Online Wallets: Keeping your cryptocurrency in exchanges or online wallets does not provide complete protection and is easily compromised. Because online wallets do not provide the same level of security as offline wallets, it is preferable to keep your valuables in an offline wallet.-Getting Scammed:  Cryptocurrency users have now become a target for cyber criminals and scammers, the rate at which people are conned online is getting out of hand. These criminals employ a variety of strategies, so I urge everyone especially newcomers to use caution when interacting with others online and avoid falling for their cunning tricks and fake promises. Never share any personal information and never connect your crypto wallet to any untrusted applications.Finally, I advise my fellow newbies to never overlook minor details that they may believe are insignificant, as they may be the deciding factor in their crypto adventure's success or failure.",

It would be carelessness and an expensive mistake for any adult to venture into something new without fully being aware of it. In money-related dealing like crypto, many had learned the hard way, you don't rush in, one must first verify the genuity, safety and mode of operation to avoid mistakes and being scammed.But about your points on wallets, one should not primarily trust the centralised exchange and any custodial wallets. The non-custodial wallets with open source are the best for true ownership of one's coin. The idea of totally condemning online wallets is not cool to me, some are safe to a high degree, except offline wallets are safer. Only people with a reasonable number of coins and long-term holders would opt for that.",

Seriously many new investors see cryptocurrencies as a quick get rich scheme and I sometimes blame it more on the orientation they receive. In my locality after the massive bull run in 2018 where many early holders gain huge profit. And With the emergence of new coins and airdrops where they were cashouts people see it as place where they could just earn lots. Some went ahead to invest their entire saving and later regretted it. It is even a norm now that when you tell people youâ€™re into cryptocurrency they label you as some one rich. When we educate people about crypto we should inform them that does gaining massive profits now were long time holders or people who gamble with shitcoins which is a huge risk",

When beginners only know about crypto but do not understand what basic crypto knowledge actually is, they will only assume crypto does not have a big risk and only capitalize on their instincts can get a lot of profit. But that is the beginning of all the losses that will be experienced. People store passwords or phrases carelessly and carelessly because they don't know how to keep phrases properly to prevent them from being stolen by others.Ignoring fees without any research will give a large fee when making transactions.About wallet security needs basic knowledge of how to avoid malware etc. to avoid being hacked and deceived because there is no research on the new project to be followed. It all depends on how much knowledge you have about crypto and others. Learning from scratch and understanding basic knowledge will be very influential for a beginner's journey in crypto. I have even experienced all these mistakes.",

Without the proper understanding, you run the risk of losing your assets quickly.Most newbies entering into cryptocurrency currently don't really have any knowledge about bitcoin, most of them do hear from their friends and family that they are making money from bitcoin and they will also decide to join, Bitcoin is always over hyped to them which at the end if they don't get what they were expecting they are always getting discouraged, and some might endup falling for ponzi scheme thinking it's also crypto.

If you are storing your private key, make sure it is stored in a place where their is no internet connection and it will be better if you can carve your private key on a steal.

Because online wallets do not provide the same level of security as offline wallets, it is preferable to keep your valuables in an offline wallet.One of the greatest mistake that can happen is leaving your coin on exchange, if your coin is in exchange, just assume that the coin those not belong to you, incase if anything happen to the exchange then your money is gone already. Newbies think leaving coin on exchange is really better because it can easily be accessible, but most of them those not really know the risk associated with it. If you leave a coin in exchange, then you don't have full control over the money, it's the exchange that's securing your money for you.

However, when not actively trading, withdrawing money from the wallet must also be considered.
