  "content": "Nearly two years ago we announced the release of the KOIN token on Bitcointalk. Since then we have made a lot of progress on Koinos which we shared in a recent update. Now that the evolution of testnet into mainnet is nearly complete, we felt that the time was right to deliver one whitepaper to rule them all which would serve as a single source of truth for anyone looking to understand Koinos at the most fundamental level. Koinos Group is excited to announce the release of that new, unified whitepaper, today!Read the whitepaper / Download the pdfOur StoryAfter leaving Steemit, our goal was to build a company that would empower developers to build dApps like Steem and Hive, but on a truly decentralized and fee-less blockchain. However, when we analyzed the different blockchains available, we found that none had the properties we needed. The “fee-less” blockchains were not truly fee-less, requiring that users pay for RAM and/or accounts. They were also not truly decentralized as a result of their launch (ICOs) or their consensus algorithm, and often both.Ultimately, we didn’t just want to support the kind of fee-less dApps that already existed, we wanted to take blockchain accessibility to the extreme by enabling, for the first time ever, free-to-use dApps which would require not only fee-less transactions, but free accounts, free smart contract execution, and network resource delegation. Delivering these capabilities required building an entirely new blockchain from the ground up.Previous WhitepapersWe started by releasing the whitepaper for the Koinos blockchain framework; the first blockchain capable of evolution. The Koinos framework would serve as the evolving “backbone” at the heart of mainnet that would enable it to improve at a more rapid rate than any other blockchain out there. This same property enabled testnet to evolve, and as it did we released more whitepapers to describe how it was getting more advanced. Those whitepapers (framework, mana, proof-of-burn) addressed each component as if they were in a vacuum, but their entire purpose is to power the most accessible blockchain ever: Koinos mainnet.This whitepaper doesn’t just unify all of those previous whitepapers, it describes how they all work together to create a general purpose blockchain that is more than just another Ethereum competitor; it’s the first genuine alternative to Ethereum that is more inline with the Bitcoin ethos. We hope the bitcointalk community enjoys this whitepaper!Read the whitepaper / Download the pdf",

      "body": "The new whitepaper looks promising. I just read all the bitcointalk threads and posts about Koinos (KoinOs?). I wish more people would talk about it. It's maybe at the moment not a ETH killer, but it seems to be a very useful chain. Eth feels broken somehow.Koinos has some fresh ideas and can enable a lot because of the free fees feature.",
