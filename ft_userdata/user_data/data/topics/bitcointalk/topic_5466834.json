Bitcoin can not be totally restricted in a country. Let us take gambling as an example. Did you know that people in the countries that gambling is banned are still gambling? Take cryptocurrencies like that.There are some countries that did not totally ban bitcoin. Let me use Ghana for example:QuoteThe Ghanaian government has reiterated its ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in all financial transactions, stressing that all financial institutions in the country have been instructed to avoid engaging in any crypto-related activities.But individual can trade bitcoin and other crypto.

Why cryptocurrency or the emergence and use of BTC is gaining customers, is due to the fact the government is doing well in doing nothing to ease the inflationary taxes and purchasing power.",

That's why you see the division of many countries because they believe to their only policies which they think is enough to compete against the other nations. But let us just put it this way, while many countries are very optimistic with the adoption of Bitcoin, making it as a legal tender or they have nothing against it so people are free to use it. We can't just change the fact that even with the positive progress in many countries that have adopted it, there will always go with the traditional believe and likely remain to be just as the hermit kingdom and not open on it.",

They fear that this could serve as a threat to their economy. This is wrong prediction from government, and teams can you be organised to understand the goodness. Bangladesh have gone one step above to ban and arrest people if they're found to hold cryptocurrencies. Beyond this people continue to use reaching India. Amidst all the good about bitcoin, the usage continues through some means. However the legal adoption and regulated usage could let users have a better usage access.",

The biggest fear of politicians or rulers is losing power to the people, including losing a grip of the financial control, so they end up scaring people to stay away from using Bitcoin, which gives financial power back to the people.With good laws, I have very high faith that even in the most remote or less developed Country, people will still find away of learning how to use Bitcoin and perhaps teach others too without having fear about the repercussions of getting caught.",

There are a lot of crypto enthusiasts both here in the forum and outside the forum who are secretly making a living through crypto trading and other crypto activities. If they don't tell you, you will never know. They have studied the market and learned the importance of getting involved in trading. Just like a member pointed out above, the problem is not entirely on the citizen, but how the citizen shows their concern or reacts towards crypto depends on the kind of response they might get from their country's government and regulatory bodies. If it's an entirely crypto-friendly country, then their crypto adoption number will be shown, and most people will publicly showcase their involvement in it. If the government can also render some level of support for those who are willing to learn, then the number will also extensively increase, and that could do a lot of good in terms of empowering those that might benefit from it.",

No discrimination but it is fact around the world and geopolitical issues contribute a lot for poor developments in those nations.Education can help a lot as with better knowledge, they can find better jobs and exit those locations but to change a whole nation, it needs more resources and inputs from local citizens. Most important is a society, in which politics is important, to give citizens a good environment to contribute. To have it, at least people must have laws to respect and protect basic human rights. Without it, it's very hard to see big changes in those nations.",

More work is needed. What are your thoughts?Are you trying to say that those bans are there because people don't understand the benefits of trading crypto? I doubt that's the case. I believe governments know to some extent how crypto trading works. If you take a look at those regulations, the key reason is because of volatility and how it can undermine fiat as a national currency. Telling them that people can make 50% or 10x more wealth by selling BTC is not gonna help if 90% of traders lose their money. I don't think you should push that narrative if what you aim for is adoption to begin with. It is not sustainable and will likely make crypto being associated with scams or ponzi even if those are nonsense.",

I am not as optimistic as you, but what I do think is that as bitcoin continues to become normalised around the world, these countries will be forced to legalise it. At the end of the day, buying bitcoin is like buying shares and it is not so dangerous for local currencies because if they are weak, people who can already save in other currencies, such as the dollar, bitcoin is just an extra option.",

For the economies of many poor countries, the truth is that they are not ready to prepare for these new things, economic problems leave them without enough opportunities, humanitarian organizations or economic support... still working, small actions from individuals I think are commendable to help others.",
