It is not good to leave coins on a gambling site because they are centralized gambling sites. If you need to deposit more coins, it is not hard to do at all.The gambling sites are just like centralized exchanges, you have no full control over your coins and any site can be hacked at anytime.But people will be people, once they do not have a problem on a site, they will become lazy and leaving their coins on the site.",

And as for the savings, I usually don’t keep much in my account. I’m of the opinion that if I keep all the money that I have won in my account sooner or later I’ll use all of them to place a best most especially when I experience some losing streaks, that urge to just keep betting until I win something tangible might take over and I’ll end up with nothing so as don as I have something that I think it’s worth keeping I’ll withdraw and keep playing with what’s left in my account and when that one gets finished I’ll call it a day for that day. After all my gambling account is not meant to save my money so why should I keep more than I can afford to lose in it?",

      "body": "Crypto users always withdraw their coins from the casinos and only leave a few they are willing to lose.  With users who show off their balance with huge amounts, I guess they are comfortable storing their money in the casino. And most probably that huge amount is nothing to them which they also can afford to lose. As for me, the only funds I can leave are less than $300. Anything more than that, I send it out. Turn it into BTC if I don't plan to spend it.",

Obviously it's for showing off and flexing how big their win on that casino. I don't think storing money on a online casino is a good thing to do given that you don't have a full control of your money and there's a chance that something bad can happen like casino obstructing you from withdrawing and being hacked. Another way to be a hackers target is to flex your casino funds and revealing the casino you are playing on. I believe that it's a good practice to not leave any money on casinos or any platforms like exchange especially for a long time.",

People who do this are basically promoting their channel and looking for customers. Some of them even use that to lure people so they can scam them. I have also seen a lot of them who added photoshop and not their actual winning and wallet balance. I will advice you to be careful with anything you see online before you fall into scams.

They have separate wallet for their money. Their bankroll is just the fraction of their total assets. If you watch popular gambling streamer like Adin Ross, You will notice that he keep depositing whenever he lose or he needs additional funds on his current bet like double down on blackjack then he withdraw immediately his additional funds once he manage to recover.Those balance that you are seeing is really big but that doesn’t it’s their total bankroll. No one does all-in deposit on a casino.",

My way to manage my gambling is to make deposits of the amount of money I want to use to gamble when I want to gamble, and for sports betting, I send the money for gambling when the weekend is getting close because I use the money I can spare for gambling when I gamble and I do not always know the exact amount of money I will be able to spare until it is time for gambling.",

Obviously this is what is worried about, so I think it's better for you to make a withdrawal as soon as possible.Quote from: coin-investor on September 16, 2023, 03:00:36 PMQuoteI always withdraw all my winnings and only deposit the right amount I want to use to gamble whenever I want to play a game.

So I also don't know the reason why they keep their money there for so long. Yes it's better that way my friend, it's better that you make a withdrawal as soon as possible and if you still want to play then you can leave a little money there, so when the money runs out then you already have a little money from the withdrawal that you have done before, that's better.",

It's literally just to flex his money or maybe to scam people like saying he won that huge amount by playing such gambling games, cause in Telegram mostly where the scammers are roaming, everyday there's a newbie wanting to earn and have fun so seeing those kinds if screenshots would just easily bait them. But from the topic in how to manage your money on gambling sites, some has a limited cashout so they can't just easily convert all of it, why? Of course to keep gambling that's the technique of most of the gambling sites. But if you can control yourself to not gambling despite the money, that would helps you to save cause havign your money in digital savings would help you to not buy and use the money on unncessary things cause you the thinking you don't have fiat money for payments.",

If those are streamers or somone that gets paid for reviewing/playing in the casino, it is most likely because they aren't allowed to withdraw the money. The money belongs to the casino. They are only allowed to play with the money and then return it to the casino later. As far as I know, they are only paid fixed amount for streaming and they can't take anything from the profit or don't have to pay anything if they lose the money. Why do you think those streamers gamble with \"any fear of losing\" any money. Never noticed they don't feel anything when they lose the money? It's because they aren't risking their money.But yeah, if it is your own money, withdraw as soon as you are done gambling.",
