Surely this is influenced by the recent fiasco of FTX and others, which have prompted the authorities to regulations that are more focused on control than on favoring a favorable environment for business to flourish.Regarding the specific case, although I like Coinbase, I do like the counterattack against the SEC, although I don't know to what extent it could be counterproductive. This business of ending up in court, one suing the other does not seem to me that it will result in much productivity, which could be achieved if they would devote their efforts to collaborate.",

      "body": "The SEC seems to be more worried about crypto platforms operating in its jurisdiction since the FTX case which was quite shocking some time ago. That's not surprising given that the SEC is responsible for Americans investing in crypto and there's nothing wrong with that. But it's getting ridiculous, they seem to be trying to disrupt the adoption of cryptocurrency and try to regulate it. They think that they are a superior institution that can regulate the circulation of cryptocurrencies and that is very sickening. They call themselves a democracy, but they restrict their citizens from adopting the payment system that is best for them, even manipulating that crypto is not good for them. Very annoying",

I will only advise that we should sit back and relax as things unfold. Frankly, the overbearing nature of the US regulators is much, they were the reason why Ripple was delisted by Coinbase in 2021, and a lot of issues have risen afterwards which ties the hands of crypto companies in the country.They are following the path of traditional market trading, which later backfires as most of the trading companies that started in the US moved elsewhere at the time regulators started their unfavourable dramas almost 2 decades ago. They are safeguarding the same occurrence now, but still with unfavourable conditions.",

Like any other crypto exchange Coinbase also added some crypto products for the traders, and that doesn't make them wrong because as an exchange they will have to take such steps in order to survive in the competitive market. I'm sure that after the collapse of FTX exchange, US government is kind of against all cryptocurrencies as well as crypto exchanges. I may be wrong, but from recent news things are shady in that space. They're directly attacking exchanges one by one, by propagating claims against the exchanges without providing proper proofs.The counterattack by Coinbase makes sense because why should they get scared of such warnings or threats if they are clean, and the products they are offering on their exchange are safe and doesn't involve any criminal or illegal activity. They aren't manipulating anything or any crypto products not even other exchanges, but this time crypto world has to face this disaster together. SEC has some internal fears regarding rise of Crypto-currencies and they will take every action against the centralized exchanges if the fear continues. They want complete regulation this time, and they want all the exchanges to work under them. If things continue like this than unfortunately many exchanges will stop their services in US.",

For example, right now Binance has SEC watch about VGX token listing which seems to be security as per the SEC and thus allegation is on the binance for its listing. Though they have broken the deal with founding company it’s still gonna take some time for SEC and authorities to let go Binance. Anyways, this is just one example but there could be hundreds of tokens or coins like that which Binance will has to let go from their USA domain and get rid of offices in the country. It’s but obvious that every country has their own legislation and way of work around a matter. It would be interesting to see how US work with these crypto companies and what would be “let them go” policy in the near future.",

But for me, if Coinbase passes all SEC requirements, then they are good. Remember that the SEC also works to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices in the securities markets and takes enforcement actions against individuals and companies that engage in such practices. It also considers the SEC regulates securities brokers, dealers, and investment advisers to ensure that they are acting in the best interests of their clients. I am not in favor of them but I think this seems good to us that there is someone agency regulating centralized exchange to avoid abusing their clients.",
