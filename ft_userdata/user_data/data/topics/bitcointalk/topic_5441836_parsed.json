When you are posting things like this when they have been discussed time and time again can make some people wonder if BTC / crypto is really secure.

      "body": "I had added the OP to ignore so I have missed some of the things he said but1) He started this ludicrous thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=54691072) In this post where his primary user is posting he comes in with his alt account https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472485.msg63186029#msg63186029https://loyce.club/archive/posts/6139/61399318.htmlWhich although not prohibited just makes you wonder why.3) As others have pointed out seems to be engaging in some form of trust feedback abuse, not that I care that much about it.4) He also seems to be a fan of CSW: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5475439.msg63218133#msg63218133 / https://loyce.club/archive/topics/547/5475439.htmlSo either he is really a BSV supporter OR a troll. 5) Not particularity relevant but as I mentioned to him trust is somewhat based on opinion, and as we all know opinions are like assholes everyone has one and most of them stink. This is just my opinion. Form your own about the OP.6) As of now I'm DT2 so it should not be Earth Shattering deal to him 7) If you have not seen it: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470847.0 I mentioned to the OP when they PMd me to post in a public thread, remembering this one. So either they didn't remember, there are multiple people using the account, it was sold - traded AFTER that post, or??? Although they did sign a message, we have all see the account sales threads that come with private keys. Either way, my neg stays and the OP is now fully ignored unless someone else points it out. Should probably take a look at his alt account and also make sure there are no others out there that need tagging. *I keep referring to the OP as him / his but have no real idea of their sex so if they are a she / her no offense intended. -Dave",

I wish I had the skills of GB to gather everything on someone and expose them. üòâPlease don't mind me, this is for public view/reference. ~dig the troll. üòèPrevious post :https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419242.msg63242550#msg63242550Before this recent development, I thought you are actually a worthy adversary, but it turns out you are the same as other cut throats who'd close their eyes and take anything no matter what.I guess now we know what a stand up guy and trustworthy you are. Posting your last post count to get paid for your sig campaign even if it means it's stolen money, funny you have linked the press release where it says the funds are considered as stolen money and having them is against the law.Let us all support this trustworthy DT, after all we are here for the same as he is, right?If no, should we now express our concerns on his trust page? And remove him from our trust list? Whatever you decide, shows your own character, whether you remain in support of such people or not. Your call, but after this if you keep supporting such people, you'll lose any credibility you have. @DT supporters of DaveF.But of course, who cares, right? Well people care and I love to have a laugh in such moments of truth.By all means, wait for no one to take action, if you can't understand what is good or bad, better to stay off DT since such people can't really contribute but rather milk this forum.Edit: doc I can't hear you, someone will have to quote you so I can see you. Lol he can't even say my name correctly.1) Actually (not that it's any of your or anyone's business) I have not kept ANY significant (I have used *some*) funds from ANY campaign in over 18 months https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1935179.msg60018674#msg60018674 still holds true although the addresses have changed several times. And yes I posted my last post count and if you look I think the funds are still there since I don't have access to that wallet.1a) The post # was more of a reference for me with a time & date stamp too as to when I pulled it then for Royce777 once we all saw that address was on a 'list' most participants knew they were not getting paid.2) Feel free to do whatever you want to my trust page and anyone else can too. It's not going to change what I and everyone else have left on yours: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=806776 so are you saying that they are all wrong?3) You do you and leave your opinions on whosoever feedback page you want and I'll do me and leave my opinions. That's the way it works. Since I left my negative for you seem to have gotten 2 more negatives and 2 neutrals. Perhaps you need to take a look in the mirror. 4) I am not going to waste the time & effort to trace your alts. Have better things to do with my time.-Dave",

Sometimes feedback isn't used properly so when opinionated ppl express feelings they're accused of abusing it.
