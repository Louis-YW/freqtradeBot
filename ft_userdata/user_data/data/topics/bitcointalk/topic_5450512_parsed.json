  "content": "Hi, I just want to share this with you. I hope this will match to this because of talking about another altcoin. Venom is another layer 0 blockchain fully controlled by Abu dhabi financial authorities. Venom architecture is based on Threaded Virtual Machine aka TVM. Also, venom is joined with Iceberg Capital with 1 billion Doller investment. So right now, they have testnet. So, there is a very good potential that they will reward to their early testnet users. Also, venom is already listed on CMC. To do the TestNet tasks you need to download the venom wallet to your browser and complete some tasks. If you complete each task correctly at the end you can mint free NFT. So, they have 8 Tasks right now and there will be more few tasks coming asap. Note in bridging task you will need some bnb or ftm. I recommend you to choose ftm cuz fees around 0.1$ in ftm chain. I wrote an medium article about every steps clearly, you can read it from here https://medium.com/@devikasaran36/venom-testnet-potential-airdrop-guide-2023-18d956133856",

I see the big potential that owned by this token. The testnet bridge task already ended. Im still trying so hard to do another task. It's also very difficult to get venom test net token caused by so many people are also working on it right now.",

Have you completed this quest? If \"Yes\", how did you solve this problem?Permission to tell you, I just got all the work done and it was pretty easy unlike what many testers say about failed transactions. So basically just needed to increase the NFT bid, that's all that made me finish everything in 1 hour. no problem whatsoever, and some tricks like finish all the tasks first, after all, done then confirm each task so that it will shorten the time even more. Since most of the complaints on the Discord channel come in, they have been on the verge of solving them for hours. What's more, the update regarding the current NFT price has a maximum of the highest 5 Venoms, I even tested the effectiveness of buying and selling NFTs 3 times.",

Is it controlled or regulated? And how is it controlled and who exactly are these \"financial authorities\"? Because that's really shady and vague concept.As to my knowledge UAE has several several different financial authorities, like countries do. So if i google about it, or ask about them, who is going to back your story up and admit that they are controlling your layer 0 blockchain?And thanks for the potential airdrop tip . I am just a little skeptical as your post was a little vague.",

I think venom can be the next generation of top trend after SUI, APTOS. Enthusiastic people who follow the development of venom very fast like social media. after tesnet maybe more big hype. if their token is listed in big market like binance",

So far, I have successfully minted 2 NFTs already and still got long ways to go though. Although this is time consuming but kinda fun thing to do whether if you're a newbie or a seasoned beta tester because of the potential rewards when their mainnet launches.",
