      "body": "Most of the volume is in USDT, USDC and other stablecoins because that’s how traders usually work. It’s much riskier to trade against other alts. So the live chart is mostly the most recent USDT transaction. Whether that was a sell or a buy, it’s that price.Otherwise, if we include all pairs, the algorithm is much more complex. It’s not impossible nor is it necessarily hard to calculate, but I don’t see the point really unless the coin has a very low volume. Big exchanges have huge volume so it’s pointless to make complex calculations. Moreover, it’s a kinda risky business too. If you include all pairs in the calculation process, then you’re about to include pairs with extremely low volume too - which may temporarily significantly influence the calculation at some point.Anyway, if there’s a high volume BTC-USD pair and a low volume BTC-LTC pair, even then the difference between the USD valuation of both pairs can’t be significant for too long either due to traders quickly finding out about the difference and eliminating it through trades for profit.",

But another thing you need to understand that the value of Bitcoin in fiat is determined by the value of that fiat currency to the US dollar, which is always controlled by the government of that nation with respect to its economic stability or instability.Example: We all know the price of Bitcoin have been around $30k for the past 1 months now, right?2 weeks ago the value of Nigerian naira to dollar was #750 per $1But today, the value of Naira have fallen, and $1 is now #850So, 2 weeks ago when $1 was #750, for you to buy 1BTC, you needed to have #750 x $30,000 = #22,500,000But today, for you to afford 1BTC now, you need #850 x $30,000 = #25,500,000Note: which means that the value of BTC didn't increase, but the value of my fiat currency dropped, which is another factor that determines value of currencies",

For example, Binance does not have such a pair, so Binance influences the BTC price solely through the USDT and USD arbitrage on Bitfinex.BTC/USD pair has some exchanges: Coinbase, Bitfinex, Kraken, LMAX, Bitstamp, Gemini... maybe 2 or 3 smaller axchanges and that's all folks. External market makers or market makers affiliated with the exchange conduct inter-exchange arbitrage. For instance, if Bitcoin becomes slightly cheaper on Bitfinex compared to Coinbase, they buy Bitcoin on Bitfinex and sell it on Coinbase and vice versa.",

This is because the US Dollar is the world’s reserve currency. As far as how the exchanges calculate the price, they just use the last trade on their exchange. It’s good that each exchange can carry a different price as it allows for arbitrage and price divergence can also foretell potential issues.",

Let us say a very small exchange, since the trading volume is small and maybe the sell orders are higher than the buy orders,the seller can lower his price if he wants to execute his order fast. And that price may be different from the selling price in binance or coinbase.This is why a lot are interested in trading with binance or other top exchanges because they can get a very good deal and quite faster.So yes, the supply and demand concept greatly contributes to the price movement of the currency on every trading platform.",
