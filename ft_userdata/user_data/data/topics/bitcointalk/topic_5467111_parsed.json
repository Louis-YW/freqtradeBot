If it is bitcoin. 1 BTC equals 1 BTC and any loss will only be an unrealized loss. Just be patient, the unrealized loss will become profit as bitcoin will increase in price later. If you go through bitcoin price history, you will see how bitcoin has been increasing to all-time-high.If it is altcoin. There are over 25000 altcoins. Many of the altcoins are shitcoins. Before you invest on altcoin, make sure you make research about it. But know that altcoin can fail at anytime. Nobody knows that the old Luna and UST will become a failed project that are trying to revive themselves. I do not even think UST will ever become $1 again. Consider altcoins as gambling and many of them will not get to all-time-high.",

Not everyone might like to talk on emotions  but let's  know that both investment and trading  get emotions to deal with There is a saying that where your money is, your mind will be there. This mean that so long as your money is committed to it, be it trading or investment,  your emotion will be involved. So, it is not bad when your emotion is activated whenever you place a trade or make an investment.  The art of managing these emotions is what shows how psyologically prepared you are. Quote from: promise444c5 on September 17, 2023, 03:48:19 PMSo the question is are we to worry about emotions not in trading now but in investment because  investment could get to some point and we will......... you understand. You are not expected to be worried that emotions is involved in trading and investment because poor emotional deposition is itself a form of worry. What I usually advice is that while seeking trading and investment skills, also seek psychological skills because trading and investment is 30% skills and 70% psychology. This is the unwritten rules that every success trader and investor follows.As a guide, the following steps will help:1. Only invest what you can afford to lose 2. Before investing or opening the trade, determine your risk exposure and your profit target3. You must have a trading or investment plan because planning eliminates a lot of mistakes 4. Be open minded and keep room for alternative possibilities so that you don't hold on to a bad trade or bad investment beyond when you should. There are more but I believe you should have gotten an idea of the point I'm making.",

      "body": "OP, since you are talking about emotions in investment, this is a normal thing, and this is the reason why you must have a concrete knowledge on what you want to invest in so that this can help you control your emotion. When it comes to bitcoin investment, if you invest in a long term, this will help you control your emotion if bitcoin price is dumping or pumping because you are already prepared for it. Because you are not expecting profit so soon. If you invest in a short term this is when you will be worried about any slight change in the price because you are allowing the price to have effect on your emotion and before you know it, if bitcoin price goes lower than the price that you bought it, you might panic and sell due to FOMO. That is why the forum will advise to only use money that you can afford to lose when you want to invest.",

I had my experience  investing in XML (stellar) promising then now it's down to the extent that all my funds are just gone . I never did research  and I fell in for it although, that was my first investment ,funny enough have checked last it's been over a year on Hotbit but I still check the prices rise and falls it funny though not even to 0.0 lol. Then I had a friend who invested into Shiba when it was still a shirtcoin van say now though , he made some cash from it due to the pump and there I was struggling with stellar lumen drawing backwards  like a car at the peak of a slopes road without break .So I dea hers is research,if I've made research then it wouldn't have been a loss",

There are some altcoins that get pumped once and are never pumped again, but instead will keep reducing in price. If you are unlucky to invest in such an asset, then you have to risk your asset. But if your investment is in Bitcoin alone, just hold on to your investment until the bull market has come. During the bear market, investors have the opportunity to even accumulate more, so if you have more funds, you can still accumulate more Bitcoin. If you are also trading, you already know that trading is about profit and loss, so while trading, you don't need to attach emotions.",
