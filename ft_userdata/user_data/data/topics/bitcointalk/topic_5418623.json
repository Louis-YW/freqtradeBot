      "body": "Inflation compared with bitcoin over the last year would be nearing 100%. It's easy enough to say it'll act as a hedge in these situations but what if it doesn't? Most of the inflation now is because people are forced to pay those higher prices and fairly willing to do it to not change their lifestyle (you did include the Netherlands in your list). Inflation can make people panic spend in cases where they expect it to go higher too, which would drive down the price of bitcoin quite dramatically if it were implemented as a full fiat currency and the only method of exchange (I don't think governments or people are going to leave fiat alone for a long time because they have some levels of protection and value as determined by those trading in it). Governments are \"helping\" by throwing more money at the problem imo instead of doing as some are going to do with electricity and offering loans to suppliers if their costs go higher (as a pay as you normally do and we'll cover the rest - which is what should really be done in these circumstances and wouldn't be too expensive to do).",

According to statistics, a total of 95 countries are battling this scourge and with government policies not helping and the fiat failing woefully, it would be common sense to turn to Bitcoin.Bitcoin might be helpful during inflation or currency depreciation when it is seen as a form of investment. Hodling bitcoin until the bullish market emerges wouldn't be a bad investment in this global world economic crisis. But currently most people are not considering investments or alternative currencies, their main focus is survival. People are faced with high prices or goods and services which is reducing their purchasing power. Only few people that have extra cash can afford to invest in bitcoin  Quote from: jackg on October 28, 2022, 10:16:15 AMInflation compared with bitcoin over the last year would be nearing 100%. It's easy enough to say it'll act as a hedge in these situations but what if it doesn't?  Bitcoin can be considered a viable hedge against inflation in most developing countries. Most of these nations suffer from hyperinflation that makes their currency worthless. Bitcoin might have lost some good grounds but there is still hope that the price would soon rise. But most of these nations never recover from the inflation they suffer.",

This is primarily because for the past recent months or even years, its correlation with the traditional market like the S&P500 and Nasdaq has not only risen but even hit an all-time high. Below are a couple of charts I recycled from one of my older posts. Apparently, while there is fluctuation in terms of Bitcoin's correlation with these markets, it is high during the time when the inflation rate has gone through the roof.Bitcoin-S&P 500 Correlationhttps://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-correlation-stock-market-new-all-time-high/Bitcoin-Nasdaq Correlationhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-11/bitcoin-s-correlation-with-big-tech-increases-to-record-chartAnyway, I don't agree with Business Insider that \"digital assets will replace govt issued currencies.\" That's next to impossible.",

The simple truth is that they should not be trusted because they will always fail. You only trust something that cannot fail or wrong you. Fiat currencies would have to be perfect in order not to fail you but they are not perfect hence must not be trusted  Their collapse is a proof why they should not be trusted.",

People are trading goods in fiat currency, which means everything you need for day to day living is regulated by this - no matter if you hold money in crypto which at some point you need to gauge against a fiat currency and convert it back to a comparative value that the majority of people are using in the world today. Inflation can infect cryptocurrency in just the same way, where traded prices will end up pushed out with many more decimal points instead.",

I can hardly imagine that there will ever come a time when a country's currency is issued by somebody else private, completely replacing the one issued by the central bank. That's too much power and control being let go by the government. Of course, there is El Salvador and the Central African Republic that are using Bitcoin as a legal tender, but even in their case Bitcoin isn't replacing fiat.",
