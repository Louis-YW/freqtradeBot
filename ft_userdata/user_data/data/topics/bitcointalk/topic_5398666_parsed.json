  "content": "I think that is foolishness because the whole body will die.   The problem is that a bad foreign body wants to hijack the whole body but the Head has refused to be hijacked while other parts of the body have either been hijacked or about to be fully hijacked. The other parts of the body have been reprogrammed to do the bidding of the foreign body (which include starving the stubborn Head off nutrients) and they are even violating the rules that make the body work properly. The head is trying to get them to work properly and obey the rules again but it's seems the corruption has gone too deep, so the head may be left with no other choice than to launch a coup and send his soldiers to take over roles of the body parts until the whole system is purified.",
