      "body": "Another brand new casino on the block, welcome to the forum first of all, and like Little Mouse said, if you have a previous topic or thread, you could edit that or maybe lock it if it's still open for discussion, it is a rule that a service on the forum should not have two active threads, as that can cause confusion.And yeah, 200 free spin is a tempting bonus, and I feel like grabbing that right away, but unfortunately, information on this is not complete, asking the same question Little Mouse asked, what is the minimum deposit required to get this bonus, and what is the amount of wager required to make a withdrawal of wins from this bonus?Casino looks good too, I saw metamask as a registeration option, does the casino offer decentralized betting?",

Let's say I deposit 0.0005 BTC equivalent to $13 USDT right now will I still get the bonus with 100 spins?BTW... This casino looks different what I see the interface is very elegant different from other casino interfaces,, well I will try to register first.",

You are absolutely right about success and longevity being dependent on the relationship with our customers. We have been (and still are) in the affiliate game for 19 years prior to this, and have had 200k clients for whom we have delivered back $150m+ in cash/promos. We hope that we'll reach that number way faster with this brand We do have a manager I believe who is helping us with our signature program etc.  We're looking forward to hanging out here a lot going forward!Thanks again CC",

Let me say, for instance, that if you wager up to $1,000 on the casino and you lose all on the game that you wager, you have the chance to claim back 5–15% of that total spent amount. If it's 5%, it will be $50, and if it's 15%, it will be $150. It all depends on their T&C applied to the wager cash back. And this cash back can be claimed every day after you have played the game.",

Regard bonuses, it's early days for us. But we are already discussing 2nd and 3rd deposit bonuses. But we are confident that if you compare our rewards to other sites, nobody has as much fixed stuff as us. We have Spins, 5-15% cashback, Bonus and $10,000 in loyalty rewards for every player!Regards the manager - i believe our marketing manager has that all sorted out. Have a good weekend!CC",

Also I will like to ask ops,  if the free spin is the only bonus available on the casinos and if no,  what are the other bonuses that await players and what conditions will they be subjected to to meet those bonus demands?",
