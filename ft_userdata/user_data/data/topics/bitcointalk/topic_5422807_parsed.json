Â Telegram: Code:@Dangle_dingleyPancakeswap (Fake Token) : https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?hook=bnb&outputCurrency=0xAd38632d21128695C289F506678ae1B8fd410619After Binance announced their new Launchpad project, scammers took advantage of this opportunity to create fake Hook tokens to fool crypto users and scam them. I received such a message on Telegram a while ago, because I joined the official chat group of the Hook project. Beware crypto users and investors, avoid falling into this trap of chasing a project in hopes of a quick profit. Because scammers have already created various traps using your interest. Keep in mind there is no option to buy Hooked tokens now, you can only buy from binance launchpad.",

Companies anticipating scam attemps are always alerted everywhere about random offers during exclusive sales programs.There are many chasers in the crypto market, who always try to catch the next train first. And as a result these scams are created by scammers. Still getting more messages like this in my Telegram DM, that means they want to take it to a bigger level. It's easy to call these activities scams, but it's not that easy for everyone to identify whether they're scams or real. So these scams should be exposed as soon as they are seen.",

Even a legit exchange or swap site could be one of the site or platform that many people will fall into getting scammed just because we know it's a legit swap but the crypto that is said to be accepted their is a scam. As many of us know that there are people who chase an unknown train for a chance to earn good profit but in the end some are getting scammed just because of catching a train that is not explored first.",

For information, anyone can create a token and list it in PancakeSwap in less than 10 minutes and for less than $5, so everyone should be careful.",

A lot of things happen in crypto, until they are caught, as many recent incidents have taught us that no one should be blindly trusted. It is really worrying that a project with 3 million active users has so few Telegram users. Even they have only 55k Twitter followers.However, there may be more discussion about this project in other ways. This thread is opened here because scammers have created fake tokens using the name of this project, and continue to promote it.",

So this type of pump will be made with the hacked twitter account with huge followers like 500-600k and crypto based account.So people who don't have knowledge try with the minimum deposit.When consider with the minimum deposit,it will be big amount after some days of sale.

There are some bad people waiting to use all good things in bad ways. Scammers use this opportunity to create fake tokens trying to scam crypto users with tempting offers. Those who greedily bought these tokens lost all their funds. They probably got a lot of crypto users who bought these fake tokens, because the hype of this project was huge in the crypto market.And projects that have a lot of hype, scammers target that project to come to the market with their next scam idea and implement it.",

Due to fake tokens being listed on Dex it is important for a trader to be extra careful when using Dex. When a new trend comes in the market, scammers use that trend to find ways to scam crypto users. And when scammers use the Binance Launchpad project, it's not difficult for new crypto users to get confused and fall into the scammers' trap. Scammers created a lot of hype by creating these fake tokens, and they may even be successful in scamming crypto users.",
