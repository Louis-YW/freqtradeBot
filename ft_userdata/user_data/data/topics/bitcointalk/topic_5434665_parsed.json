ROTFLMAO How does one connect miners which are supposed to be connected via an ethernet cable to internet router but through a VPN (and/or TOR)?Get a new router that is programmed to only connect via a VPN and use that for mining?Or use a SBC or other computer (connected to VPN) and plug the ethernet into that?",

The question is, what will happen if you find a block with your miner. Do you have the proper connection to get it fast enough to the nodes, so the block will not be orphaned?This only applies to solo mining, correct?I obviously have much more to learn about mining and networking etc. To how many other nodes do I need to send a found block if I were solo mining?Assuming I only have to send it once, and a block size of 1Mb , while measuring my upload speed as 11Mbps, does that mean it would take less than 100ms to upload one block?And if so, then I figure that I would have to be rather unlucky for someone else to find a block during this 1/10th of a second.1 block every 10min on average would mean the chance is about 10min * 60s * 10deciseconds => a 1 in 6000 chance that my block will get orphaned.The above math may be entirely wrong, happy to be told how badly wrong I understand it all!",
