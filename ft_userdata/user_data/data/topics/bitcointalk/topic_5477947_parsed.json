But of course, those who have a deeper level of understanding and knowledge about the game or bet they are going to wager, theoretically increase the chance of placing an accurate guess, especially in sociopolitical events, where the gambler has to know the subject of sociopolitics, while having sensibility to feel in what direction the thermometer of society is pointing out. I consider these elements inherent to an intelligent person.On the other hand, regards most gambling games, intelligence will be mainly useful when managing the bankroll and controlling emotions, as we also have the so called emotional intelligence, which consists in the capacity of dealing and managing your personal emotions rationally, what means you are less likely to take impulse measures in uneasy and apprehensive situations.",

As for games which don’t require you to do any calculation and your winning is dependent upon luck such games does not prove how intelligent someone is and their is no special skills needed for them to be played since the outcome of the game are always gotten from random generated results.",

Even games which require a bit of strategy like poker or blackjack don't mean their players are more intelligent than those who play dice and slots, unless perhaps if you're specifically choosing blackjack, for example, because you are a math savant and that you intend to win by counting cards.",

For example, in roulette, if you pick a single number, there could be reasons like it could be your favorite numbers or other reasons. So there's no level of intelligence there and it doesn't shows how intelligent you are.But perhaps in poker, it could be different though, and we have seen books usually by the players themselves regarding the strategies. Like how to read your opponents body movement and call their bluff.And same with sports betting, some level of analysis should play a big role on what teams are you going to bet, also as a big fans of the sports as well as it taps on the passion of that particular sports.",

Yes, because you can't play efficiently in a gambling game like blackjack, poker, or baccarat because this game requires critical thinking and skill because you need to think about whether you will use the cards or not. No, because in some games like slots and roulette, even if you still need to think before playing or betting on slots games, it depends on the probability, so if you have the probability to win, then you win, or it could be a yes if a person or gambler can calculate the probability of winning in a slot machine. In short, it depends on the person who gambles, because there are gamblers who win by using their mind and skills, but there are also gamblers who win because they have luck, so we can't determine if the person is smart or intelligent; maybe he or she is smart and intelligent but not in gambling.",

Just try and participate to win or get lucky playing gambling. And then they were lucky; did they use intelligence so they hit the jackpot in the casino?This means that winning at the casino can be achieved no matter what kind of gambler you are. If you are really lucky, you will win no matter what game you play.",

IMO, poker doesn't rely too much on luck, although there's still a part of it that needs that luck, especially with the flop. Then, there are sports gamblers. Being a fan of a sport means you memorized a lot of things. Players, teams, statistics, winning rates, trades, and more. You need to keep yourself updated with every movement that will happen because that could increase or decrease your chance of winning the bet. There are those who just rely on the heavy favorite and that's also okay. A lot of different strategies can be used in sports betting and that's why I think it's also for those who put effort into what they do or intelligent ones with high accuracy at predicting the results of the game.Casino games like dice don't require that. Keno too. It's purely based on luck.",

What I mean is that a mathematics professor might be playing slots when you consider that as a low-IQ gambling or a conventional definition of a dumbass is playing poker. Another problem with using games as a measure of intelligence is that some people that are considered by the society as a low-IQ are really good with the games that they're playing so when you consider those factors, you're going to end up with a lot of inaccuracies and inconsistencies which also wastes your time and will just make you look like an asshole because you're judging someone's intelligence based on what they're playing in a casino.",

Some persons learn the more difficult games from the gambling father in the house, so whether they are intelligent or not won't matter because they have had the first hand learning process of the game from the home and that may turn out to be the persons most loved game as it is easier for him to understand against his friends who are even far intelligent more than him.Another thing is interest and what game entertain you more. This is important because such game that entertain you tend attract you to learn it more. And in fact every game has it own ability to increase someone's intelligence.

The game that I'm exposed to is really, if you look at the risk/opportunity ratio, making appropriate decisions shows intelligence. But it's clear that the boundary between intelligence and gambling is often only a small one, because in the end, the people who create the product are always smarter than the players, just like we work for a company to get paid, and the boss is still the one who gives us that job.With gambling, sometimes the confusion between finding fun and making money (some) is very complicated, and seeing many people become addicted and fail, I am aware that even if I learn a lot, No matter how far I go in this field, I still know that I am a fool. So it only brings a taste of joy to life, and I also don't want to taste the pain of gambling, and the fault still belongs to the individual first.",
