The reason why most folks feel like such news could dumb their holding is because they haven't seen the beauty of Bitcoin yet , so I don't think Satoshi identity been reveal is a bitcoin true enemy , Satoshi been a anonymous hero made things more cooler .",

Bitcoin decentralization has nothing to be scared of if Satoshi is reveal today because he himself cannot control the the entire network again. Bitcoin is build on consensus proof of work where multiple nodes would have to agree to Make a change to the network and not only Satoshi would make decisions Like this, so even if he is revealed and wants to make a change the node runners or developers which is everyone doing that will have to get a consensus for that to be implemented The only thing i would say Satoshi appearance would cause is if he decides to move the millions of bitcoin he locked then it will affect the Market price same way if he Makes a public statement of either buying or selling this will shape the market condition as many will follow the trend, aside this he can’t definitely have a change on the network like other Altcoins does",

He created bitcoin and gave control to the community, any changes to bitcoin require the consensus of the entire community, no individual can decide on behalf of the entire community. If he wants to change anything related to bitcoin, he needs to propose it and it needs a community vote, so his reappearance won't change what's going on. People are afraid of his identity being revealed, mostly out of concern for his safety rather than fear that bitcoin will be in trouble if his identity is revealed.

Fortunately, the founder designed Bitcoin protocol to be open-sourced and to be decentralized from development contributions to network operations, block findings and transaction confirmations. With this genius ultimate design for Bitcoin protocol, with time, more developers joined, more people run Bitcoin full nodes, more Bitcoin miners set up their mining rigs to increase hashrates. Together they make Bitcoin project more decentralized and more secured so that in 2024, identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is actually no longer important for Bitcoin existence, development and security.QuoteReal bitcoiners don't have that time to go for a search to know who Satoshi is.I disagree. As true Bitcoiners, people must do their due diligent research on Bitcoin, including the Bitcoin founder, before making their important decisions to say No with fiat currencies and choose Bitcoin. If they don't have time for searching, they are not true Bitcoiners.Bitcoin is not for lazy people and people who are blindly believing without own research for fact checks. People who are like this are more matched with scam altcoins.The complete Satoshi from Satoshi Nakamoto Institute.",

I mean they can investigate, dig deeper in the past, and make documentaries anytime they wanted to, but the reality is, nobody will ever know who Satoshi is. Okay let's have a situation where for some reasons, Satoshi's identity has been revealed and it's confirmed that it's Satoshi. So what? We might see either a big dip or a big dump depending on the sentiments of the investors at that time, but nothing will change. Bitcoin will remain as Bitcoin, and even though the identity of Satoshi has been revealed, nothing will change... or at least we will not see a significant change on what Bitcoin is right now. It's decentralized and I don't think there's any reason for Satoshi to come back or worse, reveal his/her/their identity.I'm into Bitcoin for years already. Can I call myself a \"real Bitcoiner\" already, but I'm not lazy.  As for the gain of revealing Satoshi's identity, nothing. Not even the one who will reveal who Satoshi is has something to gain.
