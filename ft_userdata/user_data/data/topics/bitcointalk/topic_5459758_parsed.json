Its prone to many issues.I am personally not very fighting/arguing type of guy but if someone doesn't pay my money back in such gambling game I would definitely fight. You should never consider such money as lost, its basically stolen by something that exploits you. Thief should feel bad, abused. I have zero tolerance for thiefs.",

First and foremost, I am not physically suited to engage in fights with anyone. I don't think I'll ever be so desperate for gambling that I'll have to use someone else's gambling account to place a bet, and even if I do, I don't think I'll have any problem sharing the money with my friends because we've done things together before and had no problem sharing the profits, so this won't be any different.I have to agree with the statement above mine; if you ever need to gamble and don't have access to your account, it's best to find a gambling agent and place a wager with them if you don't trust your friend.",

      "body": "The reason for a fight is stupid. If the bet was made with their joint money, then then they have to share profit proportionally. In other case, the one who owns money should take all the profit and it would be his decision to reward the other person or not (a person who probably made a decision to place a correct bet). If I was one of them, I would not fight for the money and would try to solve the situation in calm and verbal way. But, I would fight a friend, only if I know he cheated or lied to me and that caused me loosing money. And even then, I would think twice before I would start a fight; instead I would better \"lose\" such \"friend\".",

Money saves a person and greed for money does not stop a person from committing evil deeds. Here if the gambler loses then the entire loss would be on the person who invested the money. Greed for money is a very serious thing that gets people into a lot of trouble and even leads to death.  And the fight that happened in your story is absolutely right and normal",

And would you agree at anytime to double cash with your fellow gambler to place a bet using his account, on the notion of increasing the potential win. People can do anything for the sake of money nowadays and it's not surprising when things like this happen. They ought to have enter into an agreement before placing the bet and not when the game have won. A gambler should not be too lazy to fund their own account to the extent of using their fellow gambler's account to bet. If you have high hopes on the game then you should visit agent shops near to your location instead and place the bet. Sadly, the latter is handicap already because the former has access to the account and fight will not change that. Now, to answer your question, I will no engage in fighting with anyone for the sake of gambling. I will accept the sharing formula if he refuses to agree with equal sharing formula since half loaf is better than none, consider the remaining money as lost ticket and forfeit it. Lesson learnt and that's the most important thing in this whole case.Note: I will not merge money with anyone using their account to place a bet",

The other person can say that he used is phone for the gambling and that he has to pay for it and tell him that he will take more share of the money won. Although, if it is me, I will not count that kind of person as my friend again. But that is just the one I have hear about before, we even discussed one in this forum, that the other person run away with the money and it is not a small amount of money. It is good to be independent, place bet for yourself and not to depend on somebody to do it for you.",

If one party is cheating on the other by stealing the games of the other and when it gets to his turn to give out his own game for the bet he hides away. I have seen this causing problem where friends can decide to share analysis and combine games but on the other party's turn he refuse to allow the friend to see his game and went to bet and win. It led the other cheated partner to complain and they fought and separated from being friends.Quote from: letteredhub on July 14, 2023, 08:02:59 AMAnd would you agree at anytime to double cash with your fellow gambler to place a bet using his account, on the notion of increasing the potential win. I agree that when you stake higher then the cash out will be higher, that may be the basis for those joining resource to do that but aside from that, people can play differently to avoid those kinds of problems. On the whole I think it is greed that will make people only think of possibilities of bigger win from bonus or increased potential winning if they join resources together without considering issues that may arise from that, or without having a proper agreement.To have agreement before the stake is more problem solving than to allow problem to arise because of proper arrangements.",

Its kinda foolish for someone to actually place a bet with another regardless even if its your friend or brother because I'd to think that online gambling is personal and why place a bet in another person's when you can do same in your account. Money has spirit and it can cause havoc even for the best of friend like it did in this story of yours maybe before they placed the bet they never actually discussed how the sharing formula is going to be maybe they didn't actually think they would win the bet.Well for me, I like doing my things private and don't feel I would ever get into a fight over gamble issues even if its concerns winning.",

Nothing as I only place mutual bets with people I trust to death and no one else.Therefore nothing would make me fight with a fellow gambler if we placed this kind of bet because we both would set the limits before placing the bet and when the bet would be a win no matter at which account it is the money is shared in equal amounts.I have done this several times during big events like Euro or World Cup with a few colleagues and we never had a problem when we won this type of bet,the money was shared equally among each of the participants of such bet.",

To avoid this issue they would have played the same game but on their different accounts to avoid this mess. Also they would have made clear on how to share it if they finally won, instead of waiting on first to win the money. The friend who is demanding more simply because it was on his account that the bet was placed is a very greedy individual, because the only basis where you can demand more money from what you both won is when the amount that you added to make the bet is greater than the other person's own. This is something involving money and it is enough to cause a fight especially when it is a huge amount.",

If you are using shared funds to make bets that will create a mess. Especially when your partner makes a bet which you wouldn't approve and lose it... Let's say we have a $50k shared bankroll but we only make bets if both of us agree with it. Then your partner wagers $5k on some stupid game and loses it... Wouldn't you be angry about it? That would violate the ToS of this partnership.Luckily, since I only use my own funds to make bets, this is never going to happen to me.",
