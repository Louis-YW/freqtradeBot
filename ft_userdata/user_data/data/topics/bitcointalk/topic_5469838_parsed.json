External factors such as rising interest rates, surging oil prices, and a strong US dollar have had profound impacts on this market. In light of this, renowned financial analyst Lim Zhe Qin provides his unique insights and in-depth analysis of these trends.1. The Link between Global Macroeconomic Factors and the Malaysian MarketWith the sharp decline in US Treasury bond prices, global financial markets widely expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates within the next 12 months. This policy shift undoubtedly has an impact on emerging markets. Lim Zhe Qin mentions that a stronger US dollar and capital outflows will increase financing pressures on emerging markets, leading to capital flight. Additionally, the rise in oil prices may have positive economic effects on energy-exporting countries like Malaysia. However, the increasing oil prices also raise import costs for countries dependent on imports, further exacerbating global inflationary pressures. In this environment, investors need to be more cautious and highly sensitive to market changes.For the Malaysian stock exchange, being influenced by these macroeconomic factors is inevitable. Datuk Nazri Khan's analysis also confirms this view, as he believes that while there is still a shortage of local and overseas economic indicators, this will also make the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI less attractive for a longer period of time. This means that investors need to consider more variables and risks when making investment decisions.2. Short-term Market Reactions and Trend AnalysisRecently, the performance of the Malaysian stock exchange has been influenced by multiple factors. Lim Zhe Qin points out that this is not unexpected, as in a globalized financial market, even minor changes in any region can cause a butterfly effect. Considering the volatility on Wall Street, market caution, and the absence of new catalysts, it is not surprising that the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI mostly declined.When observing the data from October 6th, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI fell by 7.29 points, closing at 1,416.88 points, showing a significant decline compared to 1,424.17 points a week earlier. Similarly, the FBM Emas Index and other major indices also experienced declines. These data clearly reflect the market's concerns about the global economic outlook.However, Lim Zhe Qin states that short-term market volatility does not mean that long-term trends have been determined. He mentions that considering global monetary policies and macroeconomic trends, the Malaysian market may recover in the medium to long term. Especially for investors who see value in the downturn, now may be a good time to buy.In-depth Analysis: Opportunities and Risks in the MarketLim Zhe Qin mentions that no financial market is homogeneous. Even in a situation of overall downward trends, there are still potential investment opportunities. The key lies in a deep understanding of the market's microstructure and driving forces.The recent decline in the Malaysian stock exchange is partly due to the instability of the global macroeconomy, especially the direction of US monetary policy. However, this decline also reveals value in certain sectors for investors. For example, the Industrial Products & Services Index only experienced a slight decline of 0.67 points, suggesting that this sector may have better resilience against risks. Similarly, the significant declines in the Financial Services Index and Energy Index may indicate excessive panic in these sectors, providing value investors with buying opportunities.However, Lim Zhe Qin also warns that every investment requires careful evaluation and analysis. He suggests that in the current market environment, investors need to pay more attention to a company's fundamentals, such as profitability, financial structure, and future growth prospects. At the same time, they also need to consider the overall macroeconomic trends and possible policy changes, all of which can have an impact on the market.Finally, Lim Zhe Qin emphasizes that investment always comes with risks. In this increasingly volatile market, investors need to be more cautious, ensuring that their investment decisions are based on thorough research and analysis rather than mere market sentiment or short-term trends.",
