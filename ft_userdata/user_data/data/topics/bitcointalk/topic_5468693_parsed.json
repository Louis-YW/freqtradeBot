      "body": "I used Pyypl way before they started asking for serious KYC verification. Initially, they just wanted names and emails address and then after several months, they asked for ID verification. Again, after a number of months, they wanted my proof of address but one thing I noticed is the KYC isn't that strict, or they do it just for formality.- But I liked the service due to very low fees and no stupid card creation fees or monthly charges like I see with some services- You can fund the account using crypto. I have used the virtual creditcard to subscribe to a number of services and purchase a number of items from different online stores without any difficulties so far.",

But why you just said you stop using them after asking serious KYC.Sorry, maybe I didn't phrase it well.What I meant is that in the verification process, it's like they never even checked what I had submitted. The documents I used get rejected by most platforms after a manual review, but this did not happen to me when I sent them over to pyypl. For example, the proof of address document which I used which was a bank statement which has a different address from that in my old Government issued National IDQuote from: PX-Z on September 30, 2023, 10:56:53 PMIf there'a no huge risk of them except of getting hacked, I guess they deserved to get bookmarked with just smaller amount, i guess.The risk is always there.

You can create as many cards as you need. The card's name will be yours and you can use it without hassle instantly. You can freeze and unfreeze your cards at any time. I just enabled 2FA, and when I make any transactions through the card, the apps will ask for authorization. Their website doesn't have much information. You must download their apps if you like using their service.It seems they have been using an auto-verification service. Not too strict like Binance or other exchanges. Regarding risk, it's everywhere online. So you need to secure your wallet, as always.",

The I found a few days ago that the apps were not working after an update. I have seen some users already write about it on the Google Play Store. To be honest, I am not happy with their support system and app interface. I am just using it for what I need. It does help send funds into my bank account as remittances where the government doesn't ask any questions. Because it does consider freelancer earnings. So I cash out my crypto legally from there. Also, I can use the card virtually anywhere and keep it frozen when I don't need it. Anytime, I can unfreeze and make another payment.",

Though it does require KYC, it could use crypto to create a virtual master card and be used everywhere.Yes I have been using it for quite a long time now and posted many topic here about it. Our local banks don't offer any working cards for online shopping or transactions and anything related to crypto is prohibited, So Pyypl has been the only solution for me. But I can't say it's the best solution since it has also high fees and serval other issues with zero support. In 2023 it seems that the United Arab Emirates government is pressuring this financial services company to verify accounts and take other measures which led to even worse experience. I have had to submit my documents and go through the KYC process more than four times in one year.Recently they faced even more issues where Abu Dhabi Global Market required Pyypl to pay $486,000 due to a lack of Anti Money Laundering measures and unauthorized activities as they were accused. And because of this, last week they temporarily stopped all the cards but they were reactivated fortunately.Â Personally, I prefer to withdraw all the funds inside and be cautious during this period for any scenario.",

If I recall properly, they do have a 4.5 rating on App Store, but yeah, their KYC requests were so annoying. They keep asking from different details periodically and while they ask for those details they first freeze the accounts that remain unusable at all. This can definitely annoy customers who think they are already fully verified.",

I passed KYC and made numerous deposits on Pyypl, and I subscribed to many services using my virtual card, like Telegram, Discord, and so on. I was withdrawing my remaining funds smoothly and quickly and with negligible fees. However, one day, I found that they had updated their KYC policy, and they froze my virtual card without prior notice, which contained some funds. They requested more documents and other complex verifications, but after contacting their support, they managed to unfreeze my virtual card, and I withdrew my funds... My virtual card has remained frozen until now because I haven't bothered to provide further documents for their new policy. But, honestly, what happened I found unprofessional on their part, and it made me delete their application and no longer use it again.",

So you can't withdraw your funds at all before you submit a ticket? I can understand if they block any payment before the user does another KYC, but they should've allowed people to withdraw imo. I guess they can deflect it by saying that their ToS covers that.Quote from: GxSTxV on October 05, 2023, 04:32:45 PMI have had to submit my documents and go through the KYC process more than four times in one year.Recently they faced even more issues where Abu Dhabi Global Market required Pyypl to pay $486,000 due to a lack of Anti Money Laundering measures and unauthorized activities as they were accused. What do they mean by lack of AML measures? That sounds really weird considering how often you need to KYC. Do they never use those data or are they using it for other purposes? Looks like it is not an ideal solution for me if I want to use a virtual card.",

You will see a drop-down menu of the different country codes they support for registration.I believe very few Countries miss out of the list like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, North Korea, Myanmar etcThe other link (https://www.pyypl.com/send-money) is completely different. It's a list of countries that one can make an international transfer to if they are using pyypl and that list is smaller.Quote from: blckhawk on November 03, 2023, 08:18:46 AMI can understand why some people haven't heard of it, it's a goofy name and that kind of name isn't really giving the vibe that it's a legitimate service.Yep name seems weird at first sight, but it's pronounced as \"People\"",

If only OP added a way to pronounce the service I wouldn't have commented such a dumb opinion that it's a goofy name. Now that I know how to read the service, I would say that it's such a fitting name for the service because of how you say it and how it's in a way parodies Paypal, it's a clever name \"A Paypal for the people\" at least that's what I think is the reason behind the name of the service.

Nothing to worry about, actually. For a few days, they have been notifying users about their system upgrade. So the card is not working properly, but other services are working fine. I made international transactions two days ago, and it went smoothly, though there were notices about system upgrades. Their support system is very poor right now. It shouldn't take too long to upgrade the system. A lot of users use this card for various subscriptions, and they might face problems due to their upgrades.
