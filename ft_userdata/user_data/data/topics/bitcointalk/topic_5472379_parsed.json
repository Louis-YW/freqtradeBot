  "content": "So I saw this topic about succesfully returned accidental transaction and it provoked some thoughts.Those that send money generally want to have an option to reverse the transaction if there's a mistake or if they didn't receive what they wanted. Those that receive money want transactions be irreversible to not get scammed by chargebacks.In our world a lot more people are senders rather than receivers. An average person receives money once or typically a few times per month and then does dozens or hundreds of payments. And since they receive money from an employer, it's unlikely they will get scammed.So why should the people who almost always send money praise Bitcoin's irreversibility if they personally don't directly benefit from it? Should they hope that merchants will lower the prices because they won't have to deal with chargebacks?P. S. - this is not a topic about whether Bitcoin's irreversibility is objectively good or bad; it's about the perspective of average person today and what they need from their payment system in their life.",

At the same time I don't see another choice, if we want bitcoin to be completely independent and decentralized no one should decide if and when reverse a transaction. Of course for the average person it could be a big problem and I know people who don't feel confortable with that and they prefer not to use bitcoin.",

Reverse is like chargeback that benefits scammers more than solid users. We can not make reversibility to benefit minority of users because of their carelessness. The majority are carefully with their transaction broadcast, double check and more so they don't actually need to have reversibility.",

Easy and convenient way of payment. Feeless transaction.The digital payment system that heavily enforced here is that it’s a qr-based address where the payer just scan it to receive the address and the amounts need to be payed, enter a pin to confirm the transaction, and voila they receive the goods. While of course a payment system like that requires fee in one way or another, and in this case it is the payee who pays it or hiddenly included the bill to the payer.Beside, that options is widely available across many merchants. I do not know the systemic fraud rate, but the most common fraud is happening beyond the reach of the systemic problem. For example, displayed a fraudulent qr or the cashier using their own qr, bypassing the store payment system.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on October 31, 2023, 11:41:36 PMSo why should the people who almost always send money praise Bitcoin's irreversibility if they personally don't directly benefit from it?There’s a saying that tells someone praises irreversibility, but hoping it would be non existent when themselves is the one who need to get their money back.",

It's not like we can, or should do anything about that feature, as permissionless & immutable transactions is one of the main reasons that makes the bitcoin valuable and is needed in the first place.Ability to reverse transactions would make it highly centralized. In fact it wouldn't be bitcoin at all after that.",

Should they hope that merchants will lower the prices because they won't have to deal with chargebacks?From the perspective of somebody who regularly pays for services with BTC, I don't really think about irreversibility that much in the sense that it gives me benefits. I think the flexibility and lower fees are probably the main reason why I use BTC instead. On the other hand, due to the nature of irreversible transactions, I'd make sure that my transaction is right before I publish it to the network.That being said, from somebody who wants better privacy and doesn't want to rely on fiat too much, I don't mind the irreversibility of the network. It is not such a big deal and at most gives a bit of a headache if my transaction is pending. Not to mention most merchants allow users to send a ticket if something goes wrong with their purchases. If that is the problem, I'd suggest they use other platforms instead of removing BTC irreversibility.",

As a matter of fact, it's generally a good thing. Once a transaction is settled, I won't have to worry about it because what already happened can't be reversed. But I can see how it is also a bad thing from the perspective of another. Erroneous transaction is just one reason. What I have in mind, however, is the giant yet still growing e-commerce industry. It's a common problem here in my country that the goods sold online aren't exactly the ones that are sent to the buyer. That a payment system is irreversible might make it all worse. Because it means transactions shall be processed manually and it will certainly take a lot of time.",

If we look at it, bitcoin itself according to satoshi us primarily a means of payment and then the other use of it is secondary. As a payment mechanism I go with the idea of it not been irreversible, because merchants will suffer more should the irreversibility not been there, than a random person that makes a costly mistake of sending to an address which is wrong. Reversing an already established transaction would make many merchants to be wary of using bitcoin for their payment purpose and will reduce its adoption and transparency. But If you’re the one sending and you it’s irreversible you would be extra cautious to make a mistake and should it happen then you take your cross which is fair enough. The use of QR codes can be used by merchants ant it’s likes to avoid occasional errors by its customers from sending into wrong addresses. This way everything is fair enough for everyone. So for an average person the first security is for him not to get scam and this outweighs the risk of him making mistake which the irreversibility solves",
