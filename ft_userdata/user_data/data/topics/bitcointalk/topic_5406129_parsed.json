Looking at the market, I see instability.I wish to get the needed guide on how and when to start trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inorder to make some profits to settle some of my needs. I appreciate you all for your kind response in advance.Crypto and its trading aspect have gone far from anything basic to a highly professionalised field. It becomes a play of experience for which most beginners don't have but there is a catch.You could always buy bitcoin and hold. The point or pice at which you buy could determine the more profit you can get but that is based on how long for which you are ready to hold. We are currently in a bearish market although, its had to say if the market have actually made a dip as no one could clearly ascertain but, you can but at any point, hold and keep buying more when opportuned while, you continue to hold until you get desired profit.Note: Always use spare cash and this is far from an investment advice. DYOR.Be careful when it comes to altcoins, trading on signals and arbitrage trading.My advice for you at this phase would be that you try gaining knowledge on the forum and while demo trading if your interested in trading.",

Give it time to learn the basics about it and haven't gotten some experience, you could proceed to live trading on your own developed strategy. Speaking of earnings, you could earn where ever you could render a needed service. On the forum, there are a few services and contest that goes on periodically. Perhaps you could code a signature, design an ANN thread, you could manage a project, make accurate predictions on games and rounds, your good with arts and more. These are some of the opportunities available on the forum and earning in cryptos really means your medium of payment.Most of all, you could just invest in bitcoin for a long term by buying and hodling.",

I will be honest, you cant expect to start trading a newbie without any prior trading experience in stocks or commodities and then hope to be able to cash out with a decent stash of money in order to pay bills. This is the type of unrealistic expectation that most people come in with and that eagerness to make quick money lands them up in the wrong place.Above users did some good searching for you, so use those articles to gain knowledge on trading but do not try open handed trading right away, you will make the mistake of buying at the wrong price. Try dummy trading for at least six months before starting real life trading.In the meantime try to get a side earning to pay off your bills. Dont try to use a speculative market earning for that.

Most newbies make mistakes in setting up a wallet or give their private keys to some scammer on the internet claiming something out-worldly.Then there are those who want quick returns and like the OP has been wishing to pay back bills and that being the reason to join crypto trading means that they have a deadline on their head. When this happens, patience leaves the scene and the trader is forced to buy shitcoin trying to pay off their bill from the profit - which never happens and the vicious cycle continues.",

This is a slow process that shouldn't be rushed, so that we can learn properly and we won't miss any of the important areas in trading. Other than trading you mentioned gaming and bounties.Well, we can incorporate the two to increase our earning potential since there are lots of play to earn projects now. Bounties are also newbie friendly and a lot of us started on it when we are still a newbie. Can't say that the first thing that we will work on is our emotion when we want to get involved in trading but this can come later on after engaging on the real thing.",

Basically when you trade fake money you will learn the wrong strategies. Solution: Take a cheap altcoin and trade with 10% of what you normally do. Now you will feel the real stress of dealing with real money.And you won't be making careless decisions.To start I suggest to earn money from bounty campaigns and signatures and only trade with that.

It is of importance that you don't venture head on into what you know nothing off or have no idea off. It's the reason why most people fail because, one thing to a business or success in a field is management and once this is lacking, the business could crumble.Coming to crypto, crypto has so advanced over the space of 11years, that newbies in the field have to spend a great deal of time to match up with users who has been around for almost as long as bitcoin has. The most any beginner could do now is to focus his or her energy on learning and practicing on the demo trade until they are able to come up with a strategy. That goes for trading. When it comes to investment, you buy and hold and other times, you render services and get paid in bitcoin. Gradually, your aims are being archived.",
