  "content": "Bitcoin spot ETF launch could drive $155 billion in fresh money into BTC market \" A researcher has predicted up to $155 billion in fresh money injection into the BTC market should the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approve the launch of a spot BTC ETF. In his opinion, the capital inflow would signify a new wave of institutional adoption in the flagship crypto’s market. \" \" Setting the timeframe for March 2024 at, the latest, the researcher says the probability of approval continues to increase as time goes by, with the Grayscale and Ripple (XRP) court wins in their respective legal battles providing strong hindwings.\" I think we are in for a good ride, if Grayscale can pull this off.... so make sure you are buying some cheap coins... before this happens. The recovery of the Bitcoin price to above $30 000 ..is a good sign and the Halving is around the corner.  Edited : Fck... forgot to post the source.

The market cap for 6-month+ old BTC takes 52% now. It was 13% at the cyclic top. Unlikely to hit the previous low($28k) as the newbies will wait for other newbies in the next cycle.Note that the price was 42k when the \"accumulation\" started by their research.",

I was just Googling the latest news and I saw a article on the influence that the approval of the ETF might have on the future price and I posted it. Thank you #stompix for filling in the gap there.. much appreciated. I edited the post and added the source. (looks like the one I found with Google)",

Juicy times ahead (well, most likely). Unless we face one or more black-swan events within the next 12 months or so, mid-end of 2024 could become very exciting for Bitcoin. Fingers crossed.Also, if this ETF is approved it could have a cascading effect for more ETFs and big-corp money flowing into the market. Lot of ifs, though, lets see... It will come eventually, question is more of a when than if.",

Investors all over need to think about protecting themselves from inflation and authoritarians.   The combination will rob people of their wealth even if it is \"only\" 2-5% per year.  Global chaos and rampant printing money to fund insane schemes and military conflicts would only make it worse.  PMs and bitcoin are two way to help protect oneself.  And ETF holding \"physical\" bitcoin vs futures will make it easy for a lot of people to protect some of their money.  Even if on average they only choose to protect a few percent, the numbers are huge.",
