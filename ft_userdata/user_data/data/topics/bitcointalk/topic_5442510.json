How could you have not known about this on time like from the start it was a scam.Private keys from it's name should be known by you and for you only.

So have you changed the wallet or do you use that same wallet till date? cause last I recall, you can't change your private key. You just have to get a new wallet. What wallet did he open for you?",

Exactly, but then this guy's none the wiser years ago (I presume) and is directly and blatantly exploited by his so-called friend in exchange for a few bucks. In any case, I hope this becomes a lesson to OP that no person in this industry is truly trustworthy and you have to always be on the lookout regardless of how trusted the person you are transacting with. And NEVER EVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS. They are called private for a reason. You don't share it with anyone, not even your spouse or whoever the fuck you hold dear to your heart. You keep your money to yourself and you keep your investments that way. Also, be careful with clicking links on the internet, every link nowadays from a dubious site is an invitation to getting your wallet drained nowadays.",

      "body": "$200 for a wallet address dag it!!! That's a clear evidence that he does not have you in heart he is nuts looking for ways to benefit himself through you. If he truly wanted you to learn about Bitcoin/ crypto then the first thing he should have taught you was supposed to be about security and privacy, like how to keep your wallet safe, what type of wallet should your use, what secret phrase and private keys are and what to do with them and preferably teach you some of the basics on how to identify a scam. Now that you have learned the lesson although it was costly I'm sure you'll never fall for something like that and if you still know those under his mentorship I'll love you to talk to them about this because I think he's a con artist and he might also be trying to trick those ones as well, make sure you try your possible best to prevent them from experiencing what you once experienced.",

It is also said that you should not just trust people but also try to always verify what they say even if this persons are very close to us, in your case, you trusted without verifying, and it is why you have learnt this very big lesson. Trust less, verify more. I hope that other people will be able to learn from this your experience.",

I myself as an example; I've been in this industry in general for 8 years and I am still learning things. Experts are simply individuals who has absolute knowledge of something and we are mostly not at that state. But I agree, taking advantage of these so called individuals would be much better but atleast never rely into them.Learning it to yourself would be more advisable given that resources are their and there are people who could be your guide on your actions.",

He is willing to deceive you for a small money. Maybe the money can only be enjoyed for a few days, while the friendly relationship will disappear forever. But don't make him an enemy, maybe because of its existence you already know about Crypto investment. So just take the wisdom behind what happened.Quote from: GodlovesyouLesson: No matter who taught you in schools research is the best knowledge. Education is me telling you something but knowledge is you observing by yourself.If someone says something, it would be nice for us to analyze first, do not immediately believe it. Someone conveys the truth about Bitcoin investment, but behind it has the evil intention he wants to do. The truth and crime goes in line, and it depends on who will control it. If the one who controls the good person, then the truth is winning, if the one who controls the bad person is of course the evil that wins. Maybe we say that at school is our teacher, or certain people. Without us knowing that in this forum there have been a lot of our teachers, because they convey something to us indirectly. They write something important information, without limiting who the person to go to that information is.",

But however, I'm happy you finally got to know about this forum, an encyclopedia of all you need to know about Bitcoin, it's history and a community of experts who are always ready to give professionals advise to any challenges as you may face as you journey through your Bitcoin career. But in addition to what you have just known (I.e Don't ever share your Bitcoin wallet password with anyone), I will like to add that, Bitcoin is also the best option for long term investment, I.e instead of keeping your money in the bank, I rather prefer you invest in Bitcoin, as it has the potential to double in profit with respect to bull in the market price.",

Education is me telling you something but knowledge is you observing by yourself.Sorry to hear this, but frankly speaking there have been lots of big red fat warnings signs that you should have noticed when you were talking to your friend. The amount of $2000 you invested is not insignificant and when someone says that he has control over the password and the keys and you have no choice but to agree, haven't you been suspicious about that? Don't the words password and keys make you feel uncomfortable when somebody else wants them from you? Anyway, I don't know how good of a friend he was for you so I guess that might also play a role when you trusted him. One way or another, $2000 is a lot of money but you can probably be happy that you didn't put even more into that wallet. This is what these forums are good for. When a situation like that happens, a good advice would be to go to the most popular forum and ask a simple question and you will have many many people wiling to answer you in order to immediately protect you from losing money. I am sure if you had posted even the simplest question like whether it is ok or not to give someone that data, lots of people here would have screamed at you with a big fat NO!",

You gotta be super cautious of fraudsters and risks when youre throwin your hard-earned cash into the mix. I'd suggest you research differnt cryptos and their history before you plunk down any more dough.
