  "content": "I opened an account at https://moonbet.io and placed bets between the 10th and 16th of October. I won some and got limited and when I wanted to make a withdrawal of 3500 usdt my account got closed. I didn’t really knew why since I played fair.When I try to login through metamask: I reached out to their customer service and they refused to communicate with me and completely ignored me. I gave my email address so they could get back to me, but no one did.Chats with their customer service:After this event is when I created this account on bitcointalk so I can write about my issue. I wrote in their moonbet thread in the gambling forum and there were some users there who advised me to contact the people in charge at moonbet on telegram so I did. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5392518.180I spoke with Jason Poprawa in their telegram group. He is the founder and CEO of Moonbet. I asked him why my account was suspended and he told me that all of the trading and player management on Moonbet is offered through Owl.Games and that Moonbet did receive a heads up from the team at Owl that somebody who won a lot on player props from their site created an account at Moonbet and they were going to block that account. He said that he will speak with the team immediately and get to the bottom of this and that if I placed the bets and won - I deserved my funds.Chatlogs with Jason:I did got a good first impression of Jason as he seemed reasonable and understanding. However, he did not keep his word and didn’t get back to me and unfortunately he has not responded to me at all even though I repeatedly tried to contact him.  He has been very active in the telegram group, when someone wants to make a deposit he will gladly help.I think this whole situation is very unnecessary and time wasting. You don't take someone's money because they had an account somewhere else. They didn't just take all my winnings, they also took what I had deposited. I really don’t have a problem with getting limited since thats a part of the game, it happens. But when you take all my funds because I had an account at Owl.games it doesn’t make sense. It's like William Hill would take all my funds because I have an account with Unibet. I’m doing this because I feel helpless and like I don’t have any choice. I just want my funds that I actually earn so I can move on from this nonsense they are putting me through.",

Confiscating funds that were won fair and square is stealing.

All this is assuming you are an honest gambler and not a cheater in any way.I will write in their ANN thread and ask them to take a look at this accusation. Their forum admin hasn't been online since 18 October. If he ignores my post after coming online, I will send him a PM asking the same thing.

Nothing strange happened to my account at owl.games. I just got limited so I withdrew my funds and got them. I wasn’t accused of anything at all. I agree with you. They should also inform me immediately why my account has been suspended. When you suspend a customers account, you have to inform them about it.Me as a customer shouldn't have to run around on all these different platsforms just to get a hold of these guys so I can get to know why my account got closed. It's ridiculous.At first I didn't want to accuse Moonbet of scam because they seemed to have a good reputation so I wanted us to come to a solution together. As you can see it is impossible as they refuse to communicate with me. They are literally stealing from me because I 100% won my bets fair and square. I am a full-time sports bettor and have been doing this for years.Thank you, I appreciate that you want to help.",

The link for their flag would be this oneMy suggestion would be just like others had said, to wait one or two days to give time to respond.  As others has notified them through PM, I'll try to take one step further by going to chat both the CEO and their group on telegram. Meanwhile, I'd suggest you to edit your opening post to match the accusation format guidelines so they'll understand the situation easier when --or if-- they visit this thread.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 26, 2022, 10:03:35 AMLet me send them a PM and wait for their response. If they are checking the email with the forum account, it will notify then in their email inbox. After few days if they do not response then create the flag as suggested.[..]Quote from: Pmalek on October 26, 2022, 10:58:04 AM[...] They have not been online yet. [...]  They were, about an hour ago, not sure if they're still addressing other problems and other threads --and PMs-- or ignoring this thread, hopefully the earlier. As a precaution, I'll track and notify them through telegram as well, there is a slightly higher chance they'll be aware of this thread's existence through it. And if they blocked me... well, it's also an answer to our situation.Update 1:Here's their response:Now, if I may freely intepret the situation here based on OP's chat with the CEO and his answer here and his answer to my chat on their channel, the one blocking your account is owl.games, the... provider of the... game? Huh? I am not familiar with betting platform here so I might be wrong, but let me ask this first, is it normal for a business entity to be a third party that's merely hosting an \"interface\" for a gambling service while the entire service and operations is handled by another business entity? If the answer is yes, then there's your answer: their silence is because they still tried to get in touch with the... service provider.update 2: my apologies that this post turned into a very long and messy post with lots of screenshot and editsA reply from their CEO. lesliegray, go check your telegram.",

      "body": "Hello LeslieGray,Thank you for your patience in regards to the matter. Just so everyone in the forum knows, we reached out to the user immediately after becoming aware of this issue via Telegram yesterday.We have only just received the player information (wallet address) as the player did not have his username. Our team is investigating the matter and will ensure that any bets which have been won are paid out.Due to our partnership with OwlDAO, some elements of the administrative side of Moonbet, most notably sportsbook trading, are simply out of our control. While we are still investigating exactly what has taken place, it looks like an overzealous trader may have banned this account without providing us the full details, which was obviously the wrong move.As previously stated and Jason stated in the Telegram messages, any bets that were placed and won at Moonbet.io by the player will be paid in full. While placing limitations on certain players or markets is a standard practice in sports betting, outright banning somebody is not.This is the first and only accusation that has been brought against Moonbet in over 14 months of operation and we pride ourselves on fairness to all players, being crypto betting enthusiasts ourselves.Both the player and forum will be updated as soon as we have a complete understanding of what has occurred and what steps we are taking to make sure it is fully resolved.",
