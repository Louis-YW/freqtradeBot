In the first place, you already cannot recover the account because the account conditions are not being verified.- USA are being restricted, you can check their term & condition.Doesn't matter if you contact them using IP from Asia, Japan, Europe or other Nation. Your document are from USA, that's the only things. The L are from you mate, based the situation.P.S: You are mention user who using signature roobet are gonna to type propaganda for your thread. Well, my signature are from Freebitco (I guess, I'm free right?)",

Streamers aren't going to be able to help you. It's you vs the site and only the site. If you reside in the US you will not win as it has already been said, US residents are prohibited from playing on the site. It sucks and I don't agree, but it's not my site. My personal opinion is it's my money, I should be able to spend it where I want. Unfortunately, governments are greedy and disagree.",

Why not go directly to them and ask for another chance to get help since if you really violate their rules then they have rights to ban your account. You must know that there are rules that need to follow so any of those got violated then expect that you experience this so next time choose to read the TOS so that you can avoid huge trouble on your account and also don't play on a casino that restrict your country since you will get an issue accessing it or the same thing will happen to you.This issue may serve a lesson to you that never try to take advantage on anything promising what you see and always obey the rules of the casino so that you can save yourself for getting any troubles in a casino. Also no people here can help your case so maybe ask for a mercy to the casino representative so maybe they can help if you are been so nice asking for your issue to be resolve by them. Posting this cannot do anything since many people see that you are the one commit a mistake here.",

Styx is not wrong on his statement they accept your USA ID for verification. They verified your account and find put your breaking the ToS by playing in their casino which US citizen is not allowed. I understood the honesty on your part but you should think wisely that no casino will allow you to play if you are restricted since they are breaking the law by doing that. I think you are the only person to blame here by submitting your US ID without reading the ToS. What exactly do you want to expect by submitting US ID to verify your account while you knew that US citizen is not allowed to play?",

Unless there's something you left out from your story, I think this probably is a case of misunderstanding from someone that's jumping too quick to a conclusion. Rollbit does deny their service to US resident [see image below], but given you're an expat, you're technically a Costa Rica resident, and accessing from outside USA. Let me try to get in touch with Razer regarding this matter, see if he could retry this case and give it another look, or, at the very least, give his opinion on this case.It might took a while for Razer to come online and noticed my PM.

Please have a bit of patience for the time being.Thanks for the heads up on this one.OP contacted us to remove 2FA from their account after being locked out. Part of the recovery process involves them verifying their identity with us.OP went on to submit US identity documents. After carrying out further checks, we were confident the player account was being accessed from the US.As other members on this forum have correctly identified, we're not licensed to offer our service to anyone connecting from the US.One of the data points we assessed during our review was the IP addresses utilised by the user.From our logs, we see 50 unique IP addresses interacting with our service from OP's account.29/50 of these are US IP addresses, all appearing to be residential addresses. Only 4/50 are Costa Rican, which appear to be related to a private hosting service (often associated with VPN addresses).Further, I would suggest that this was posted in the incorrect section as there's no claim of loss here. The account was locked during a period where the user had no access to it and there was no balances on the account.Thanks,Razer",
