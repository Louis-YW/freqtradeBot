Since, there's plenty of things users could run into that could give them a problem, regardless of the wallet. Ideally, they'd be coming into Bitcoin with some sort of base line knowledge, but that isn't the reality, since most are eager to use it, which means they'll likely make mistakes.Hell, I've made mistakes. Definitely, have learned from them, and luckily it didn't result in loss of coins. I basically came into Bitcoin to give it a try, and potentially earn some money on the side. I don't think I appreciated the actual capability of Bitcoin before using it. I learned that gradually over the first few months, and years.  Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on June 16, 2022, 05:52:35 PMThe only answer to give to newbies is to suggest to do their own researches. There is literature everywhereThat's true, although its often broken up into multiple sources or doesn't cover every problem that someone could run into, it's usually the most common, which is decent enough. However, not exactly fail safe. If I had a criticism of Bitcoin, would be lack of simplicity. However, I don't see a easy way around it, so it's a pretty weak criticism. I guess it's more of observation then. I actually believe it's one of the reasons we haven't achieved more adoption, than we have. Bitcoin isn't easy, and to use Bitcoin safely you need to do research. You don't have to do that with cash. Over time, it has become to simple, and dumb downed, that they teach children at a young age about money now.",

Which is OK, since they can benefit of lower fees and LN too.If you don't want to have multiple sets of seed words, you can generate a seed with a different tool and then import it into Electrum, just don't forget to check the Bip39 checkbox.One tool at hand is IanColeman's, just you have to use it safely offline and you have to acknowledge that some consider the entropy of web-based apps not good enough for the best safety of the seed.",

What type of address you derive from those keys is optional but some suggested standards exist (some BIPs like 44 and 84).The problem is that when you have a BIP39 mnemonic it doesn't have any information to tell the wallet what derivation path to use and what type of addresses to derive so these information have to be entered manually which is not newbie friendly at all.This is solved in Electrum by including a version number that carries this information. This is why you can't automatically derive another type of address at a different derivation path using an Electrum mnemonic (the wallet decides it automatically). But technically nothing is stopping you from using one of your keys to get a different type of address manually.Quote from: Cookdata on June 17, 2022, 07:19:39 AMEither m/44'/0'/0'/0 for my legacy address and m/84'/0'/0'/0 for segwitBut the problem with Electrum wallet is that, it doesn't work like that, any seed phrase you generate to create a segwit address, you cannot use the same seed phrase to generate a legacy address, and it will be much work to have two seed phrase as storage.Not automatically since as I said the goal is to make things easy for all users.You can manually derive a key at m/44'/0'/0'/0 and use it for your SegWit address and another at m/12'/34'/5'/6 and use that for your legacy address.

I've been trapped in ch05.asciidoc, struggling to finish the derivation path, but you helped me out.Quote from: pooya87 on June 17, 2022, 08:17:04 AMThis is solved in Electrum by including a version number that carries this information. I think this is where the problem lies and I have done more investigation on it. You can manually generate the derivation path in any way that you prefer but most often, each wallet has its default settings, however, the Electrum wallet does not produce BIP39 seed words due to the inherent version number. To verify this statement, I tried to create a new legacy wallet using the seed word I generated earlier, but it always detected it as segwit, and when I changed the option to BIP39 seed, the checksum was invalid, which proves the electrum seed phrase is not BIP39.I blur some part of the seed phrase, it is for test For further satisfaction, I used https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ to verify the same seed phrase, it says invalid Mnemonic, which means that it is the seed phrase generated from electrum wallet and not derivation path.I played with the Iancoleman converter to flip between BIP44 and BIP84, and I discovered how versatile a seed phrase can be when creating segwit and legacy addresses. The cool thing is that when you produce a seed phrase with https://iancoleman.io/bip39/, it gives you a default derivation path for segwit as m/84'/0'/0'/0 and m/44'/0'/0'/0 for legacy, but the structures and addresses changes when I modify the values of each level.",

After 5 years, there shouldn't be any place that doesn't recognize SegWit addresses and I'd argue that any service that doesn't should be avoided because they may not be secure either.But yes, creating 2 separate seed phrases is the easiest way to go. But any special case may need a special solution. For example maybe you are running a service that needs to receive payments and you need to also generate legacy addresses, in which case a modified code could be used to generate child keys from the same seed at different derivation paths.",
