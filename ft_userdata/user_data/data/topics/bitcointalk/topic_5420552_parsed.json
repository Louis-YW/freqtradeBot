If I were you, I won't broadcast it yet to the public that I can make that much from that project if it's no twist at all.And with that, I'll be set for life without anything to think about and without bothering other people. That's how it should be, before you share the trade secrets, make sure that you're able to make rich from it and only you.",

      "body": "Quote from: jaamsevan on November 12, 2022, 12:06:27 PMthank you for your comment. If I propose this exchange it is for certain reasons that the people who will accept will understand. I know there are investors who like this kind of investment because the cryptocurrency business is a game where you have to know how to take risks to win big! Today I need 130 ethereum and in exchange the person will receive powerful access to wealth that can be limitless when the project will be known around the world.You're welcome!And I thought that you've made that actually but not. You've just made it look like that you made it but in reality, that's the deal that you want to make. Well, NFTs are not a thing today but they're a thing in the past and it's very unlikely that you'll see someone who will grab that deal to trade their precious Ethereum for an unknown NFT or earning opportunity that has been told many times already by marketers.",
