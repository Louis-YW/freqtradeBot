      "body": "There is still a lot of time for this tournament to start, something like more than 5 months so I highly doubt that there is much to discuss, this is because in addition to there still being a lot of time for the tournament to start, in my opinion Argentina or Brazil Uruguay will be the winners of this tournament . They are the only teams that have won the most in this tournament and currently looking at the squad of each team I would say only Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay have strong squads. I don't see them being able to win this competition. Now one thing I see that in my opinion will not be so good for this competition, is that this competition will take place in June to July, so far I don't see any problem, but the problem starts when they put it on the same date as the euro. 2024euro 2024 will take place in June to July, and because it is European football in which all the best European players will be playing, so the attention of news channels will be focused on euro 2024, many countries people prefer to follow European football, that's why that in my opinion the euro will be the competition that will have the most importance while the Copa América will not have much attention, I wonder if the Copa América organizers will be able to make a profit from this event since most people will travel to watch it the euro, TV channels will prefer to pay royalties to broadcast the euro",

      "body": "The results of the draw, the most awaited match is the Argentina vs Chile match. Why not, Argentina has the opportunity to avenge their defeat against Chile in the 2015 and 2016 Copa America finals. In fact, as a result of losing twice to Chile, Messi once announced his retirement from the national team, although Messi later reversed his decision.For Argentina, the Copa this time clearly means a lot to them because their status as defending champions is of course Argentina's ambition to defend their title. Moreover, the squad that Argentina has is very good.",

Well, actually, being organized by CONMEBOL, which corresponds to South America, is the reason, perhaps they exaggerated with the name.Anyway, now each edition looks more like a true America's Cup, including more countries, so it is the complete opposite of what you mention, little information or even remembering primary school. Well, what is worth saying, in 2016 it turned 100 years old, being the event organized for the oldest soccer teams.The favorites! : Brazil and Argentina are always there, although it is true that Argentina is the last winner, They hadn't won it since 1993, which tells you how difficult it is to win an American Cup, even having Messi, unlike Brazil who since that same date has won it five times.https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Américahttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores_de_América",

I don't like the idea of adding countries from different regions but I get why they do it. They need the money and the awareness. My only worry is what if a country from a different region wins it. I like how all the invited countries are from North America, that way the name Copa America still holds. One thing I'll miss in this Copa is Neymar. I like watching him when he's serious and means business, but it's sad that he's injured and won't be available. I'd also like to see if Messi can lead his Argentine team to back-to-back Copa America wins. The legend's career seems to get better as he's ageing. The real definition of ageing is like a fine win. Brazil is in good shape too with Vinicius showing that he can lead a team, but can he lead Brazil? We'll see.The difference between Brazil and Argentina is that Argentina is more balanced. The defence, midfield and Attack of Argentina are balanced, so even if they don't have as many stars as Brazil, they're still one of the best national teams in the world which makes the favourites for this tournament too. Let's patiently wait for the 21st, but I think I'll put my money on Argentina.",

Brazil won't be the winning team in this edition of the Copa America, I actually think the Brazilian team is very bad, one of the worst in recent times, and without Neymar... it's really complicated.And I really liked the fact that North American teams participated, after all, America is three continents.",

For me though, I feel like it's going to be an Argentinian cup this time, that's my belief in this one, the team is solid with Messi in the forward, I think that means something.",

Actually is difference level interested when comparing between Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024 because most of fans will priority for watching Euro 2024. but difference hours of kick off I think make its interested because fans can watching Euro 2024 and Copa America by only in Television and waiting every match for Copa America 2024 will full of fans in stadium or only big matches play by Argentina and Brazil. In Copa America Brazil become my favorite teams, have bad issues with Lucas Paquetá will be in Brazil squad or not after FA investigating with his problem with potential long term suspended.",

Seeing this good track record that Argentina has against Peru, I predict Argentina will win when they play against Peru.There hasn't been a game involving Argentina against Canada since 2015 until today, it seems like they haven't played against each other in the last 10 years. But I also predict Argentina's victory because Canada did poorly in games against teams like Jamaica and Uruguay, but Canada cannot be underestimated. I also predict a victory for Argentina when they play against Chile, but Chile is a team that in the last 3 games has done well against Argentina. Since in the last 3 games in which Argentina played against Chile, they won in just 1 game and drew in 2 games, I predict a difficult game for Argentina when they play against Chilesource: https://livescores.biz/h2h/argentina-cf-vs-chile-cf",
