  "content": "As the whole world is facing a serious economic difficulties. There is surging inflation in almost all part of the world.Unemployment rate keep increasing in some part of the world as businesses are collapsing. This tend to increase the level of poverty around the world. During this period, for middle and upper classes, commodity price increases might sting a little. But this seriously affect the poor as they struggle betweenðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰feeding their families and medicines.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰having a roof over their heads or food in their bellies.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Paying school fee or learning a handwork.During rising inflation, more poor will be pushed into more worse situations. Although everyone is being affected by inflation but some are more affected. Helping the most affected ones (the poor) can help to save their life, our country and the whole world.ConclusionLet's all try our best to help someone during this rising inflation. Bringing someone out of poverty may serve the chance of him/her helping another thousands of people. This can thereby help indirectly to eradicate poverty to certain level within the society. Helping someone may come in the following ways: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰By giving money, foods, clothes etc.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Teaching them what to do to earn little more money.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰By giving reasonable advice.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰By creating more jobs....and many more.Let's all join hand together for the growth of our country and for the betterment of the world.",

Rich people need the services of workers from people who need jobs. and the poor need a helping hand from the rich as in the form of job vacancies. and mutual help is needed so that there is no conflict between them.if rich people don't care about people who are in need and need help then there will not be a good relationship in it and this is the reason and trigger for the increasing rate of crimes such as theft and robbery. because this is the impact of the lack of good relations between the rich and the poor. if the crime rate in an area increases. then it will affect the economic sector there. such as property prices will decline. because a good and healthy and harmonious environment also has an effect on increasing the selling value of a property such as housing and the like.",

It may not really improve the economy, but it somehow eases the burden of the country. Near my place is a government agency which provides small assistance to the poor who are unable to pay for their hospital bills, burial fees, medicine, and so on. They will only receive a few tens of dollars after complying various requirements and falling in line for hours. Some have even travelled from afar only for this.

It's quite true. Some people tend to appreciate when you teach them to fish rather than giving them the fish because in that way you have helped solve a problem of dependency and poverty.Â Â It's like a case of the talents in biblical times. One who was given 5 talents, let me use trade instead to help push my point home, went ahead to grow it, and surely, when you grow a business, you employ labour, ( which would be majorly the poor masses), it would solve a big problem.",

Sometimes it's not their fault and it's still shared. I understand the problem of karma, but maybe changing things for the better at this time will be very difficult. Raising awareness for all is like having everyone work together towards the same thing, but if it's not appealing enough to all, it's unlikely to happen. As I know, so far, the period of human development has always been clearly divided, but today's stronger connection, the spread of the message, is a new problem. We all unite and love each other more. Not only between humans and humans, but all species need harmony. I know of a friend who left his homeland with a happy life to come to provide support and economic development for some poor indigenous areas of Africa. So I think let's love each other and be willing to help and share with all. Equality and not losing against each other will take us through all difficulties.",
