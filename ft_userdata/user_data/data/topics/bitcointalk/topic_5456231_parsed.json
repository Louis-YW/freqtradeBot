I'm open to learning from your opinions.The term \"newbie\" should be clarified first. Someone can be a newbie here on the forum, but that doesn't mean that he is a complete beginner when we talk about Bitcoin things. It is not a rare case that someone, although he registered later on the forum, has more knowledge in a certain area than some natives.Also, there is no universal rule here about which part of the forum can be more attractive for you (or anyone else). The advantage is that we have a fairly large volume of different topics, so everyone can find a part that suits their interests.",

But as a newbie that seeks knowledge,I will advice that you should stick to bitcoin discussion and this board Beginners and Help. If you are really here to learn bitcoin those two boards will help you a lot. If you want to learn more on the technical side of bitcoin,there is also a board on that as so on. You can also do research on your own because this forum is too cumbersome for you to be able to navigate through various boards daily. Gambling section is like a must for gamblers and sports lovers to discuss on sports and gambling.",

As a newbie, it's always a good idea to take some time to get familiar with the community and learn the basics specific to this forum. This way, you can avoid repeatedly asking the same questions that have already been covered. This forum has a lot to offer, so I suggest focusing on the areas that truly interest you. It really depends on the discussions that capture your attention and where you feel you can contribute or learn the most. Of course, don't limit yourself to just one board. Feel free to explore all the different boards and engage in discussions that catch your interest. Remember, this is an open space for your discussions, so don't hesitate to jump in and share your thoughts when you have something to say. Enjoy your time here!",

I'm open to learning from your opinions.First the three boards you mentioned are clear and not bitcoin related. In case of bitcoin related discussions there various boards and for newbies in the forum it is kind of confusing to know where to place some threads or ask some questions. So for simplicity I would say before you get acquainted with the forum boards just restrict your threads to the beginners and help Board. Most of bitcoin related threads for newbies are treated here. If you’re looking for a particular discussion then I would suggest you use the search button to make it easy for you. You can learn how to use the search button here",

The newbies who are knowledgeable or considerably knowledgeable about crypto-currency first should start with the meta board https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0Because they may not be new to crypto but they are new to the forum and would need a better understanding about Crypto-currency, they should read pin post especially but also other post, they can ask questions about the forum and get guidance and after having some knowledge they can pick the boards the like and continue in a responsible manner.But those who are newbies in the forum and also newbies in Crypto-currency should start on Meta because they actually need to also understanding the forum first especially the rules and regulations, frequently asked questions and then they should spend some time here on this particular board Beginners and help and after that they too can set out.",

I'm open to learning from your opinions.I remember that when I was entered in the forum I didn't know anything about forums. The situation was such that I did not know what is topic, how to post it. After some time, with exploring the forum, I learned to create a topic and post. Then most of the posts were my questions mainly to know the things that I don't know.-In that case I used to follow Beginners & Help board most of the time. So I will suggest you first to follow Beginners & Help board. Moreover,  the same things you can do in your local community, i.e. local board cz local community are awesome.-Then I after knowing the basics of this forum explore the forum staring should be with the Meta & its child boards, Project Development and if you have some skills then you can offer your service on the service board. And then there is no alternative to explore. If you start with these few, I think it will help you to explore later.",

Because here you can discuss, can ask and also can learn a lot about crypto from experienced users. Here everyone is helpful. And the second best board is in my opinion that your local board. Because there you can discuss in your native language, also can ask for help to others. But always remember your discussion topic should be on the right board. If you ask for help then try to use this board Beginners & Help or if you want to discuss about altcoins then use Altcoin Discussion board. And for trading related questions there is Trading Discussion board. So in this forum has a lot of boards which should be known by you and discuss or ask only on related boards.",

If you're a total newbie, begin from the obvious one. Beginners & Help.Contrary to the advise that many people will give to Op, I think I will defer greatly in suggesting any board for Op as a newbie. I believe in the principle of self satisfaction and the people I have seen with similar ideology are LoyceV and Lovesmayfamilis.This is a discussion forum and Op should discover the area of interest to them and join the discussion there. Unless the Op is indirectly asking about the boards that can hand s/he merits. Otherwise, they should contribute where they derive joy.When I started in this forum,  I was an altcoin man and later I found joy in gambling discussion mega threads. I could be in those threads for hours and will not get tired of scrolling, reading and replying. Recently, I discovered fun in reputation board where so many drama happens. I now frequent reputation board.By this, I use this forum as a forum and gets full satisfaction and fun using forum and yet still get weekly bucks. This is pure joy and I will suggest that to anyone anytime.",

Since you've found fun in the gambling boards it's fine to stick around there, but these two boards will facilitate your learning journey in the forum. If you're fine with the level of bitcoin knowledge you possess, the economics board is always a good place to learn about the real world and business. I bet as a newbie you'll enjoy chatting with members in that section, they exist in the board, economics, premium responses generally about how people live life in the world and society. Meta section is also great as a newbie to learn what's happening in the forum; updates and new observations. In a nutshell, while building activities in any board that fits you, endeavor to create threads about your views and questions relating to the board.",

I'm open to learning from your opinions.What's your purpose of joining the forum, that's should determine the board you become more active at. I doubt you joined the forum because of politics so in my opinion that board should get less attention from you (I'm not saying you should ignore the board totally) but concentrate on the board that'll add more knowledge to what you already know instead of arguing about politicians that don't care about your existence. Gambling is another board that you can get lost in. If you put all your energy engaging there, you might realize it too late that you have gained nothing while been on the forum. I write in gambling board but I have my threads of concentrations. Economy is a great board to write on, Bitcoin discussion as well as that's the main focus of the forum and the reason many of us joined the forum (to learn about Bitcoin). Although the topics there are usually off topic but you can filter out the topics that are generic and focused only on those that you can learn from. Ignored all the Bitcoin got me that or this bullshit and write on those that actually adds some knowledge that you didn't have about Bitcoin. Finally I see you have participated in your local board on the forum, stay active there more as it'll help you to get familiarize with people from your country and they'll be in the best position to guide you through your journey here.",
