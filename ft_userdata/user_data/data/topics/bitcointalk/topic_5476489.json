The basis is the difference between prices for futures and the spot price of the underlying asset.The strategy involves taking a long position in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures when futures are trading at a premium to the spot price. Setting opposing positions helps traders collect a fixed return as the premium evaporates over time and converges with the spot price on the futures contractâ€™s expiry date, irrespective of the spot market trend.https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/04/bitcoin-market-neutral-bets-offer-10-return-as-btc-tops-41k-analysts-say",
