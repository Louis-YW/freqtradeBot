      "body": "It depends on the price of your order and the price being traded. If the price of your order is lower than the price being traded, then of course you need to wait a while for your order to be filled. For example, the current price of bitcoin is $25,300, but you place an order at $22,000, so you only need to hope for the next few months for your order to be filled.It is easier to buy on market orders because your orders will be filled instantly. But if you set a limit order closer to the price being traded, then your order will likely be filled more quickly as well. No need to wait up to 30 minutes.",

I hope this answers your question and provides a guide to help you get your order excited.",

You might decide to buy a coin at the current market value, but in the process of inputting the amounts you are planning to purchase before you click on buy, the price might have dropped, but if their is any seller that's available at the price which you are planning to buy, then your order will be filled immediately.",

So I canceled the order.How long does it take for an order to be filled?If you want you order to be filled immediately, you can change the 'limit order' to 'market order'. If you want your order to be filled at a specific price, you can use the limit order. If you buy, the market price must be lower than the order price before your order would be filled. If you sell, the market price have to get higher than the order price before your order would be filled.If you want your limit order to be filled immediately, you will buy at higher price to the market price, and sell at lower price to the market order.Quote from: Issa56 on June 15, 2023, 08:56:32 PM...assume you are trying to purchase bitcoin and you placed your order at $25200, and bitcoin price dropped to $25190, your order won't be filled till bitcoin bounces back to $25200 or above.Bitcoin at $25190 and you buy bitcoin at $25200. That is a higher price, which means the order would be filled immediately because you are buying at a higher price if compared to the market price.For illustration:Quote from: Oshosondy on June 07, 2023, 01:09:10 PMBitcoin at $25000For long/buyYou open a limit order at $25010 (above $25000). The order will be filled immediatelyYou open a limit order at $24990 (below $25000). The order will not be filled. If the market price of bitcoin gets to or drop below below $24990, your order will be filled. For short/sellYou open a limit order at $24990. Bitcoin at market price of $25000. The order will be filled immediatelyYou open a limit order at $25010. Bitcoin price at $25000. The order will not be filled. If bitcoin increase above $25010, your order will be filled.I hope you will understand it better this way.It is even harder to explain than using it while trading, once you start to trade you will notice how simple it is.I will advice you to be careful of trading derivatives, because leveraging is very risky. Trading itself is very risky, not to talk of future trading which is far riskier.",

In general, market orders are typically filled immediately at the current market price, while limit orders are executed when the market reaches a specific price point set by you. If your order has not been filled, it is possible that there were not enough buyers or sellers at the specific price you set.It is difficult to give you a more specific answer without having all the deets. If you can, snap a screenshot of the order you are placing so we can break it down and explain things in more detail.

Not something out of the ordinary but really, something you could think out or even reason upon glance and how it's executed.Trading platforms are designed in such a way that it allows for some flexibility and gives users the freedom to set what gives them comfort so as not yo get cheated upon. It doesn't require you working within a range but a range defined by you.If you want your order to be filled in no time, placing it at the market price or slightly higher might result in it being picked but, having yo set order for price higher could result in delays. I suppose that's the case with your trade at OP.",

It is generally a good practice to monitor the market and consider adjusting your order if it has not been filled within the reasonable time frame that you expected.Probably I think if you have any specific concerns or questions about a particular order on Coinbase, I recommend reaching out to their customer support for more accurate and up-to-date information regarding your specific situation.",

In this case, there is no specific deadline when your purchase order will be executed. Obviously, instead of a limit order, you had to make a purchase at the market price.",

If it is a limit order and you have a buy order price higher than the market price of the asset, the order would be filled immediately because it is still filled at the market price instantaneously. I mean that is still a market taker. 2. If it is still a limit order and you have a sell order price lower than the market price of the asset, the order would be filled immediately because it is still filled at the market price instantaneously. I mean that is still a market taker. But if it is otherwise to 1 and 2 in a way that the order price is lower than the market price for buy and higher for sell order, the order will not be filled immediately and that is a market maker. On exchanges, market taker fee is higher than market maker fee.",

Those are the price that other people are wanting to buy at. So when the trade price matches their existing order, it will get filled. You also need to consider that buyer's total amount should be more than your amount. Otherwise, the whole order will not get filled but a portion of it which matches the buyer's amount. Vice versa for buy orders. Pick red one and those are the people willing to sell at that price. So once their order matches your buy order, it will be filled.
