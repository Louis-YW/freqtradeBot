  "content": "I have read a few posts where web designers and developers are struggling to get clients. So, I thought it would be a good idea to create a thread where anyone with a web design or development firm or portfolio can go ahead and post the URL to either of which. I am sure that it will help those looking to hire and also helping those looking for work. You can post A bitcointalk link to your service thread or a link to your website. You may not promote anything unrelated or offer services without either of these. Adding a URL to your portfolio is a plus, so that I can easily add it to the thread.I will keep the main post updated with the users and the links that they posted. If you use a service provided by anyone in this thread and want to leave them a rating out of 5, I will keep an average rating for the user and their firm/service. List of web design/development services posted in this thread:bitmover|Front-end Web Development|Website|No ANN provided|PM|No reviews yet!Reviews will be added by clients who have posted in this thread. If you are adding a review, please add a star rating out of 5 (e.g 4.95/5) to rate your experience.",

The thread is also exclusively about the services they offer. They could attract more clients that way. Why would you think promoting their services in a mega-thread will end their struggle to get clients? If you are trying to create a list of services offered, I guess there's already one in existence. If there's none, you can make use of the threads in the services board.",

If there's none, you can make use of the threads in the services board. While the thread is empty it might seem like a questionable idea... Though if/when it is full, it will be a one-stop reference for those employers...instead of having to search through all of the boards you just mentioned. I don't think I said that it will put an end of anyone struggling for clients either. It might help those who are actually doing good work and may be going unnoticed right now though. If they get good reviews in this thread from their employers, this will help more for them over time if the thread becomes a staple reference for the board.",

If it were kept up to date then I suppose this thread would be a bit redundant. It seems as though it isn't. I won't keep as detailed of a list as tranthidung did, though I will keep a list with a similar, simplified format. I've added the first entry below from bitmover's post below.Quote from: bitmover on February 02, 2023, 01:30:18 PMQuote from: PX-Z on February 02, 2023, 11:08:33 AMQuote from: Darker45 on February 01, 2023, 01:25:47 AMThis specific section is for service discussions.

If you have an ANN here on bitcointalk, post it or send me a PM and I will add it. If you have any clients willing to post a review, let me know and I will link their review in the OP.",

I think what OP is trying to do is to create a list of those offering web designing/developing services with a service rating from past clients to make the decision of choosing the best one for other potential clients easier. There is nothing wrong in that, and it will surely benefit both sellers and buyers of the services if this thread stays active.Unfortunately these days I am not seeing any service provider keep pumping their service topics for years or in other words, no one is staying active for years. Probably bitcoin makes everyone which is the reason people are not focusing on providing services. For same reason, I guess people are not focusing on maximizing their chances by including list of previous clients.",

I am hoping that this thread will help to keep active services easy to reference. I think that the services board is just flooded too quickly with other topics so a lot of people give up on the daily bumping, I don't think there is a lack of people offering services due to Bitcoin though. Also if any services become inactive and they're listed, I'll be sure to make a note of it.",
