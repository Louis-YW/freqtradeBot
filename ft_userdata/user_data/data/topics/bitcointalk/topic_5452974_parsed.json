There is absolutely no shortage of transactions to be mined.Quote from: BitMaxz on May 16, 2023, 06:27:22 PMor all pending transactions already taken by other poolsThat's not how mining works at all. Every miner can include the same transactions in their candidate blocks, and almost all do since they all want to include the highest fee paying transactions. Candidate blocks between pools will usually contain around 98-99% of the same transactions.The reason the block is empty is as I explained in the thread linked above:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452042.msg62217245#msg62217245When a node receives a block from somewhere else, it has to spend a little bit of time verifying that block, checking every transaction in the block is correct and accurate, and then updating its set of unconfirmed outputs to remove all the outputs which have just been spent and add all the new outputs which have just been created. This doesn't take long - usually in the order of a few seconds depending on your hardware - but it isn't instant.While this is happening, a miner cannot create a new block filled with transactions to work on, because it doesn't know which transactions it can and cannot include until it verifies which transactions have just been mined in the block it just received. So for these few seconds, the miner's options are either to have their mining equipment sit idle and do nothing, or attempt to mine an empty block until they have fully verified the last block. Since having their equipment sit idle would be a waste of money, most miners attempt to mine an empty block for a few seconds until they create a normal block filled with transactions and then switched to trying to mine that instead. Very occasionally a miner will be successful in these few seconds and will mine an empty block.",

Or wrong?https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/789996Some miners willingly mine empty blocks so that they can compete others in mining of next block to earn the mining rewards. That's mostly the case with miners and that can be helpful for them sometimes because they earn the revenue with the next block that they left with low fee transactions.It's also a possibility that a miner would mine empty blocks when the network is highly congested. With a congested network miners might face delays in getting new transactions, and in that case the miners also mine empty blocks of blocks with very few transactions. As we all know that miners are mostly adding transaction in the block due to the fees that they earn, and if sometimes there aren't transactions with satisfiable fees, the miners would definitely choose to mine empty blocks instead of adding the transactions with very low fees.",

When the network is congested, miners have so many transactions in their mempool and they always try to include as many transactions as possible to maximize their profit. You would see empty blocks when there is no new transaction (which is almost impossible nowadays) or the block is mined in a very short time after the previous block.",

You would see empty blocks when there is no new transaction (which is almost impossible nowadays) or the block is mined in a very short time after the previous block. Thanks for correcting me! Although, your point is valid because in such cases most miners would certainly include as many transactions in a block as they possibly can, but sometimes when the miners have so many transactions in queue then they might prefer to go with the ones with higher transaction fees. If they can't include the transactions with high fees for some uncertain reasons in their blocks, in such cases some miners would go with mining of empty blocks to compete for next block to earn the block rewards. If we check the block that was empty in the post then the above scenarios are also not valid for such empty blocks because currently there are many transactions awaiting to be added in the next block and even in this case the block was mined without any transactions. Sometime only the miner knows better tat why they are mining empty blocks.",

I didn't say the block was empty because there was no transaction.As I already said, that block was mined only 11 seconds after its previous block and that's why it was empty. The miner didn't have enough time to remove outputs from UTXO set and add transactions to the candidate block.",
