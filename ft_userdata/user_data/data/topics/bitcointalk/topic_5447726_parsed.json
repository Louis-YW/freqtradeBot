People were saying the same about inflation, and how did that play out? It seems like a negative investment climate in traditional markets also affects Bitcoin, This can be explained by Bitcoin being a high risk asset, and during hard times investors try to minimize risks and hold safe assets like cash and gold. Also, in one year there will be the next halvening, and that can be far more important than collapse of a few small banks.",

He said that he just follows the big guys right now and has been doing great. He also mentioned that crypto is verrrrry interesting right now, and a lot of what is going on w/ gold right now reminds him of the beginning of Sep 2010 when gold spiked 100+%. Also noteworthy, he told me his secret from evading the IRS tax code to the fullest is to follow code 429 or just search Trader Tax Status or TTS to pay the absolute least to the IRS if you're a US Citizen.

It may also have the power to de-throne USD from the world's leading money to junk money. I don't care what Jemie says but the current banking failures seem like a classic banking 101 fail which is usually taught in B schools. You get money at a certain interest rate, and you lend that money to the businesses and commoners like us and earn the spread. So when you cost of raising funds increases, banks must not invest that money into low-ticket treasury bonds. You don't earn spreads. The situation worsens because FEB kept on increasing interest rates without thinking about the consequences. Now when these CEOs are crying foul and saying that the crisis is not over yet, ask US to Step in and provide support to the banks so that they can revive.

Well, I have a little bit of physical gold, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to have a large percentage. Basically I believe, like many, that Bitcoin is an enhanced digital gold, meaning that as a store of value it is going to eat gold in a few years. The only reason I believe that it will maintain some value and will not be defeated 100% by Bitcoin is because it is used for jewelry, as well as in industry and electronics.Let's look at the performance of Bitcoin and gold since 2009 and we will see that as a store of value Bitcoin has been much better. Going forward I don't think the difference will be so exaggerated but it is clear to me that Bitcoin will continue to win.",

Money printing and Quantitative Easing (QEs) are how global economy boosted by inflation created by governments and central banks.QuoteYou get money at a certain interest rate, and you lend that money to the businesses and commoners like us and earn the spread.

The situation worsens because FEB kept on increasing interest rates without thinking about the consequences.You can earn interest with traditional low interest rate but when the rate is overheated, it leads to Inverted Yield Curve which is a main cause of bank collapse. SvB, Signature and other banks' collapses recently are latest examples for impacts from Inverted Yield Curve.I believe those CEOs, CFOs do know about Inverted Yield Curve and its impacts but they were fooled by FED months ago as in many press conferences, they stated that interest rate won't be increased.Fed holds interest rates steady near zero, says economy is still well below pre-pandemic levels (Nov 2020).",

Nothing is certain about this yet, like what hatshepsut93 said, I don't think the bank collapse is good for bitcoin. Bitcoin is unlikely to benefit if the world economy continues to deteriorate, let's not forget what happened in 2022. Bitcoin has not yet been able to fulfill its role as a hedge against inflation when it is also heavily affected by inflation as well as the Fed's interest rate hikes. Another thing is that the Fed has no intention of stopping rate hikes, and interest rates are still high, so bitcoin is unlikely to benefit in all situations.",

We've seen similar things happen before. For example, as the pandemic was announced in March 2020, Bitcoin quickly lost a huge portion of its value, even though the pandemic didn't disrupt online operations at all. Bitcoin recovered fairly quickly (over several months), but still. Another case was more recent with the panic regarding high inflation rates of EURO, the GBP, and the USD at the end of last year, and it took months, once again, for Bitcoin to get to its previous level. So if there's a banking crisis, it can easily trigger a significant fall of the price that can last for 2-5 months.",

In fact, this bank showed no support to the crypto industry as far as I know. No doubt indirectly we can buy BTC but not directly. Overall, the bankruptcy of these small banks will increase the BTC demand and the supply is less as 1,40000 BTC are acquired by MicroStrategy till now Like i do not think they will leave anything behind. The increasing demand for BTC will boost it up like a nitro at the last second of race wins the cars. So these signals plus jp morgan's words in favor of crypto take it to next hypes.

What is clear is that they always fall back on those assets when the fiat crisis happens, and I don't think it will change since the system is not changing either.

This does not include the fact that he gave a shit about Bitcoin. He has many reasons to regret the many negative statements he made and the decision to refrain from it for too long. But as a banker he knows his thing. JP Morgen Chase did very well during the 2007 financial crisis and they are once again well positioned with their general risk exposure to cope with the currently existing liquidity problems. If I was him I would also publish such a paper stating that many players are at risk when you know that your own bank is not. Their wealth management division is making business with cryptoassets as wealthy clients pushed for getting access to it. I don't know if JP Morgan Chase themselves hold any? It should probably be public I guess, but I haven't looked it up now. He has also talked positively about it such that it has a lot of upside potential. It is not that long ago. But I think his stance still is that he himself wouldn't touch it. But to be honest we wouldn't find out anyway ever and he isn't important enough to make an impact anymore with such a disclosure.",
