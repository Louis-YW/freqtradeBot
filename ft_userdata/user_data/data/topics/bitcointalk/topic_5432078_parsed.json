  "content": "QuoteA US jury has returned a US$1.7 billion verdict against Ford Motor Co. involving a car crash that claimed the lives of a Georgia couple, their lawyers confirmed.Jurors in Gwinnett County, just northeast of Atlanta, Georgia, returned the verdict late last week in the years-long civil case involving what the plaintiffs' lawyers called dangerously defective roofs on Ford pickup trucks, lawyer James Butler Jr confirmed today.Melvin and Voncile Hill were killed in April 2014 in the rollover wreck of their 2002 Ford F-250. Their children Kim and Adam Hill were the plaintiffs in the wrongful death case.\"I used to buy Ford trucks,\" Butler said on Sunday local time.\"I thought nobody would sell a truck with a roof this weak. The damn thing is useless in a wreck. You might as well drive a convertible.\"Ford did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in closing arguments, lawyers hired by the company defended the actions of Ford and its engineers.The Michigan-based automaker sought to defend the company against accusations \"that Ford and its engineers acted willfully and wantonly, with a conscious indifference for the safety of the people who ride in their cars when they made these decisions about roof strength,\" defense lawyer William Withrow Jr said in his closing arguments, according to a court transcript.The allegation that Ford was irresponsible and willfully made decisions that put customers at risk is \"simply not the case,\" another defence lawyer, Paul Malek, said in the same closing argument.Lawyers for the plaintiffs had submitted evidence of nearly 80 similar rollover wrecks that involved truck roofs being crushed that injured or killed motorists, Butler's law firm, Butler Prather LLP, said in a statement.\"More deaths and severe injuries are certain because millions of these trucks are on the road,\" Butler's co-counsel, Gerald Davidson, said in the statement.\"An award of punitive damages to hopefully warn people riding around in the millions of those trucks Ford sold was the reason the Hill family insisted on a verdict,\" Butler said.https://www.9news.com.au/world/ford-ordered-to-pay-over-1-billion-us-dollars-after-truck-crash-court/4b391438-8ca7-4af1-9a3b-96ff37dbfedc....$1.7 billion?! Is this what they refer to as a landmark case? Or are multi billion dollar fines becoming normalized?There is a saying that says: \"complete amateurs built noah's ark, while professionals designed and built the titanic\". Depending upon declining standards, and tasks completed by the lowest bidder. There is a point where amateurs will do a job better than pros. Has the task of constructing strong truck roofing become virtual rocket science in this day and age, given manufacturing and market conditions? Have automotive manufacturers sought ways to cut corners and reduce the weight of vehicles, reducing in thinner A pillars and roof support in order to extend MPG stats? Have massive increases in horsepower ratings contributed towards crashes becoming more deadly? Perhaps the interior ergonomics of indoor roll cages are not aesthetically pleasing enough for automakers to standardize them?What is happening here?",

Or are multi billion dollar fines becoming normalized?It is indeed a landmark case because winning a legal battle against a multinational has a way of inspiring people globally to seek legal action if they feel these firms acted wrongly. If firms can be held responsible for their actions, I think they would be more careful and give more attention to their products. The legal team of the plaintiff deserve all the praise because they were able to defeat Ford's expensive defense team.

Cars, electronics, clothing, etc, are not as strong or durable like it used to be. Companies are beginning to seek for ways or techniques to reduce the amount of raw materials they use for production. Most companies want to reduce the cost of production in a bid to maximize more profit. It is not strange to see some CEOs of some production firm doubling their wealth within few years. Most cars involved in accidents currently a usually totally destroyed because of the kind or quality of materials used.",

Will it be a case of reference for all similar incidents?Personally, in my country I have not heard any case against ford due to manufacturing defects, whether it was due to accidents or others, and these cars are often imported from Ford. Will this case be the basis for trials outside the United States?As for the value of the payments, I believe that they were deliberate even after they knew that such errors would increase the probability of accidents.",

      "body": "Juries are emotionally driven and near worthless. You show them pictures of dead children and then they pull out a random compensatory figure combined with another figure for punitive damages.Are these juries able to explain how they came to such figures? Absolutely not, and the parties involved in litigation are entitled to no explanation as to how a jury renders its verdict. Usually the law has a cap on how much can be compensated in these matters but the point is the same. We expect 12 random, untrained, citizens to create a legal algorithm to determine damages and out comes these wild figures. Alex Jones is on the hook for over a billion over his mere words.Quote from: hugeblack on December 28, 2022, 11:42:24 AMThe most important thing is to whom were these sums paid? $1.7 billion is a large amount, so will it go to the couple only? Will it be a case of reference for all similar incidents?It won't hold precedential value for future courts. But I'm sure there's many lawyers that are looking at the figure knowing they can get a pay day if they have a case with similar fact patterns.",

The courts use the cases in which his conviction directly occurred as the basis for similar courts, and thus, whenever the case is similar, the verdict is passed quickly.Of course, the amount of the fine will not be the same, but the conviction will not take long.",

People can drive more recklessly when they feel secured in the vehicle they are driving. The road accidents cases are increasing by my assumptions, vehicle manufacturers need to be reminded that they still have a responsibility to make their vehicles strong enough to reduce the number of persons that die from road accidents.",

But if ford gets multi billion dollar fines, imagine how big those would be against Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos in order to make them feel fined.However when you make cars with paper roofs, and sell those as secure cars you are going to get in trouble for it.",
