  "content": "Accumulator bonusAccumulator bonus (or 'acca bonus' or bonus accumulator) is a form of promotion that allows you to receive an extra bonus on top of your winnings depending on the number of selections you include in your bet.Bonus is calculated when all outcome results are known, these outcomes must be WON or in some cases VOID.In case the ticket is a winning one, the winnings are increased with the bonus won, i.e. percentage predefined for that ticket depends on the number of bets played.In order for the ticket to be liable for the accumulator bonus, it must fulfill the predefined conditions:It is a combo or a system ticketMinimal number of bets on combo tickets (with odds fulfilling the bonus conditions) is equal or higher than 4Minimal individual odd on each of the bets is equal to or higher than 1.30 (for system tickets: minimal individual odd on a combination is equal to or higher than 1.30)For system tickets, the bonus is applied to each combination and the total bonus is equal to the sum of individual bonuses on all the combinations that fulfill the condition (minimal number of bets on one combination must be equal or higher than 4)NOTE: In case some of the bets are void (odd 1), they are not calculated.Example 1:Based on the setup from the table below, 4 bets tickets, from which one is VOID and 3 are WON, is not going to get the bonus as it does not have 4 guessed bets with odds equal or higher than 1.30.Example 2:Based on the setup from the table below, the system ticket that would be liable for the bonus, must have 4 bets with odds equal to or higher than 1.30 in the combination. For example, system 4 out of 6 without bankers and odds higher than 1.30 gets the bonus, because it has 4 bets with odd 1.30 or higher, and system 3 out of 6, without bankers, does not get the bonus as it doesn't have 4 bets with an odd 1.30 or higher. If a system ticket has bankers, then they are calculated to, as they are on every combination. For example, 2 bankers + 2 out of 4 will be liable for bonus (4 bets per combination), and 1 banker + 2 out of 4 will not be liable for a bonus (only 3 bets per combination).Rules4 matches adds a 2% bonus to winning5 matches adds a 3% bonus to winning6 matches adds a 4% bonus to winning7 matches adds a 5% bonus to winning8 matches adds a 6% bonus to winning9 matches adds a 8% bonus to winning11-14 matches adds a 15% bonus to winning15-18 matches adds a 20% bonus to winning19 matches adds a 25% bonus to winning20 matches adds a 40% bonus to winningMore Info: https://blackjack.fun/campaign/sports-betting-acca-bonus",

I think it will inspire more players to play multi-bet though for multi bet chance of losing is high but if win then the winning amount will be high too. For more info I have visited the link and saw the same info which you have posted on this thread.",
