I made the mistake of buying 5 BTC from someone because I had confidence that mtgox wasn’t being run by incompetent idiots. The joke was on me. Not only did I lose the BTC I paid, but they reversed the credit before the final database… So instead of 5 BTC I ended up with nothing. I should have just sold what I had on the exchange as my 15 BTC will probably be closer to 2 BTC when all is said and done with the payouts.",

For me personally though, I am just looking forward to getting something back.For sure before this reimbursement situation where people had already moved on that they coins is totally lost but hope totally shines or glimpse back when they do know that there's a chance that those coins would be given back.Even though it might be that lesser that they are expecting but at least they do really get something which they arent expecting for it to happen.@OPhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/mt-gox-trustee-sets-registration-deadline-of-jan-10-for-repayment-selectionMt. Gox trustee sets registration deadline of Jan. 10 for repayment selectionIt would be still on next year.Hopefully!",
