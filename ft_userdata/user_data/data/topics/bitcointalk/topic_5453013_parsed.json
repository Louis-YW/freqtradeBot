  "content": "Hello world,   In our endeavor to constantly improve seed safety and provable fairness of our games, we will shortly be updating our crash,roulette,baccarat and keno with a new salted hash. The purpose of this post is for full transparency of this process. We will get the hash from pre-selected Bitcoin block 790,100 as the salt of crash,roulette,baccarat and keno.This block has not been mined yet as of this post, proving that we have not deliberately selected a mined block with a hash that could be favorable to the house. Once block 790,100 has been mined, the results will be posted to this thread as a reply.",
