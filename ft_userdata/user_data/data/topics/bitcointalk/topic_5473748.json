  "content": "Hi everyoneHopefully this is of some use/interest to someone. I wrote a small article on Key Tweaking. I know many people here will be very familiar with this( having wrote the code implementing Taproot) but maybe useful to some others who never knew about the concept.. I've included links to a repo where you can render Taproot addresses with various conditions.Hope everyone is having a great weekend so far! https://medium.com/@jamie.brian.gilchrist/deterministic-nature-of-bitcoin-addresses-the-existence-of-condition-specific-wallets-9dc1ee2efb9a",
