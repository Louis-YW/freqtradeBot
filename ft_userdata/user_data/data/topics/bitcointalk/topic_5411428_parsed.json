Can you provide the link to the faucet that you want to share to check if it's legit or not. This offer is really shady unless they just give a very small reward that is just a fraction of the captcha profit because that will seems reasonable at all.",

Anyway, there are various code base about faucet that might suit your needs, but you need to integrate it with your own coin daemon/node and set up the claim limit system according to your own. Refer to https://github.com/search?q=faucet.With that in mind, you should have knowledge about web development to make that kind of faucet, there is no one-click solution. If you didn't have any, you might want to reach out to the community in case someone interested to develop it.",

Then if you prefer a faucet, you can just search for those faucets that might available on those faucet lists that you can find through searching on the web. Upon looking at, contact the owner and have a conversation of what you're up to and what you plan to do.",

Ive been into faucets before and almost some that i did were just dust and not cant be monetize. Its better to do an actual mining using desktop and mine major coims such as btc and others.",

He isn't the one that looks for it but in fact he is going to build a faucet that are like that. All what he wants is to share his coins and he doesn't plan to make a profit so there is no need for him to place ads on that faucet site.Haven't seen a faucet like this so far except to those who will send you coins directly to your wallet (any types) not those micro payments wallets like faucethub. That's a hassle since you will still need to reach a certain amount before you can send the coins to your main wallet. Faucet without ads aren't shady not unless if they really do some shady stuffs like they are using your cpu to mine coins.",

One of the most common forms of scam is a faucet wallet.In this scheme, the site or organizer will invite you to create a wallet and deposit coins.After you deposit coins and perform some tasks, you are asked to make a withdrawal.At first glance nothing strange. Until finally you did not succeed in making a withdrawal even though you had clicked the withdraw button many times. That means, your coins have disappeared from being taken by the provider's site.",

I think you don't need to create a google form to collect information. If you feel the answers above have given you a conclusion, or information for you, it is sufficient for you to carry out what they are conveyed.Because more or less Google forms will store information, that is, it will detect the email of the person who filled out the form.",
