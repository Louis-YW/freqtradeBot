Probably need to snag at least one or two of them, will send you a dm soon, probably today or tomorrow.I have a deep love for fractional silver bars myself. These are beautiful bars. They are in my top 5 favorite pieces out of all physical bitcoin pieces. Unfortunately for you, I have 10g silver bars and rounds on the drawing board.   Will have a small amount of gold bars available by years end. They are made from Caribbean gold \"treasure\" jewelry refined to pure 999 shot. Then turned into 14k gold for better durability over the years for trade.",

Those are around 48mm I believe.",

I normally ship priority in the US and it cost 10.40. So you could take 10.40 off the price. I offered free shipping on this post if 2 where purchased.",
