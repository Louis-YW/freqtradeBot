Because, most of the sufferings and negative things about bitcoin gets due to the involvement into bitcoin investment without proper understanding. They just find it an easy way of turning rich or fulfilling dreams within specific time period. When things weren't the same, it turns to be disappointed. So, we should we'll understand the market the time period and more other connective factors.",

      "body": "Yeah, investing in Bitcoin might offer a chance to grow one's wealth over time due to its potential for price appreciation in the long run. And like you said, if someone keeps buying small amounts of Bitcoin consistently (even a little every week), they could eventually see their investment grow after few years. The $10 that they invested today, might become $50 if he keeps on holding it. But one shouldn't forget that investing in any crypto currencies, including Bitcoin, comes with risks. The price can never be predicted. The $10 you invest today, might also become $1 after few years (very highly unlikely though). So one should do their own research before investing in any crypto currencies.",

However, I must caution you to not give a messianic status to bitcoin.I would say that it is one of the biggest means to fulfilling our childhood dreams.Speaking about childhood dreams, I have often fantasized that we get to continuously run our generators that provides electricity for our farm using milisatoshis that it instead of fossil fuel. The idea is that whenever, we start getting low on it, we generate a code and input it on the device and then it can generate electricity for another 7 days, 2 weeks, one month or whatever duration we may have paid for.Please do not come for me, it is still a crazy idea in progress.",

If you study bitcoin cyclic movement, you will hold on till after the halving and sell at ATH.

Whenever you makes the right plan then you will understand your condition is not a barrier, you can start with as little as you think of not necessarily getting a whole lot of bitcoin but can start your investment with fractions. As matter of facts holding your salary in fiat makes it even worst for you but whenever you are being paid and you convert to btc, here there are two major things involved since bitcoin is on a faster rise this period you could make additional profits, but if it happens to be dip then you could lose some cents in $.",

It's certainly wrong to make it appear as though Bitcoin is the manna sent down from heaven, the one every hopeless person on earth has been waiting for all his/her life. Develop your skill. Master it. It will bring you great success. Bitcoin? Yes, it's a good way to store your money, that is, if you have the money. But know that it, too, might one day perish.",

Like half of it should be left in fiat for daily expenses. Selling off bitcoin anytime when one needs fund for daily expenses could make one run into lose when the market is in bearish period.",
