Have any of you written a book? What strategies worked for you to successfully write and publish your book?Better to be moved to write before writing... By \"to be moved\" i means it has to pour into your heart to the extent of having a strong/uncontrollable desire to write it down at that particular moment. I was actually moved to write my books and they are faultless because it comes from the ONE moving me. Focus on what you understand really well that it feels like it comes out of you naturally without you thinking too much about it... that also should help convince your readers that you know what you are writing about.I used unconventional means to publish mine to reduce time and cost as I intended to give the books for free to those who can't afford them for money.",

What strategies worked for you to successfully write and publish your book?I think that's more of a cliché. With Hemingway you probably think more of a glass of whiskey:)There are two types of writers. Some write straight out without much planning, the second group needs an exact plan, has to prepare consistently and researches a lot in advance. You have to see which group you belong to. If you already have experience, you stick to it. But first you have to find out which type you belong to. It's relatively rare that you sit down and write your first book and then want to publish it right away. It also takes a lot of practice.Of course, it can be a dream and will probably also become a goal one day, but putting pressure on yourself right away can also inhibit you.You have to be aware that it takes a lot of practice. You never stop learning and must continue to develop. You need to know whether you are already at the point of publishing your own book. What experiences have you already made? Have you already written stories or is it really your first novel? What topic should it be about?",

As for sharing with readers, I'm nowhere near there yet. I'm only writing for myself at the moment, after all, it's about my dream. I wouldn't let anyone read it until I'm mostly satisfied with it.

If you consider writing as a hobby, then it can be a good release from stressful everyday life. Some people do sports and achieve the same result. Therefore, one can also have the need to write, just like sports.Quote from: schupp on August 18, 2022, 03:46:37 PMI wouldn't let anyone read it until I'm mostly satisfied with it. Feedback from other authors can help, too. If you're still learning, I wouldn't pass it up. Or go to writing classes and learn. Then go to professional writers who offer such courses. Look at offers from publishers who offer courses for writers (Novum publishing,...) read blog articles, look at tutorials on Youtube,.... There are many possibilities.

You're right, it's damn hard to write in a way that creates the same image in the reader's mind as it does for the author. That's why I think it's important to find beta readers every now and then who can give you honest feedback. Of course, this is no substitute for professional editing by the publisher before the book is published. People who deal with it on a daily basis know best what details they need to pay attention to and what can and should be improved.",

I think the knowledge and skills could also be well honed in a workshop. To see what my chances are, I contacted Novum Publishing with a sample of my book. I got feedback from the service publisher that they could see potential and that I should keep at it. I can contact them again when I am finished with my work and then they will see how they can support me on the way to publishing my book. However, I'm sure it will be some time before that happens. I've made good progress, but there's no end in sight yet. And when I'm done, I want to give the book to a few beta readers first and get feedback, and then start editing it myself. I think that will be a good piece of work again. But I'm looking forward to when the story is ready to be polished before handing the project over to professionals.",

Having a target group in front of your eyes is already important, I think... but that's just my personal assessment. You would have to ask around for experiences, for example from publishers. If you are interested in such workshops, then such questions will certainly be clarified there. As you say, having beta readers would certainly be helpful to get constructive and broad feedback... of course you can also do this with friends and relatives - but it is important that \"professional\" people take a look at it so that you get really broad (and honest!) feedback.
