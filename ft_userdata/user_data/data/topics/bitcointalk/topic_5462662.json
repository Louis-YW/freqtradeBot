Bitcoin aims to address issues like centralized control, inflation, and financial freedom. However, understanding these problems and potential solutions may require a deeper exploration of technology.",

      "body": "I would like to contradict the point \"Bitcoin will give us financial freedom\", concept of Bitcoin offering financial freedom means individuals can have direct control over their funds without relying on intermediaries. With Bitcoin, you can transact and store value without requiring permission from centralized authorities. This means the person who controls the money has the authority over how their financial status is going to be which can be a better version or the complete opposite of it so it is important to remove the view that Bitcoin will make people rich and is good for the future of bitcoin itself.But there is no decline to the fact most people don't understand the monetary system at all so if they don't then they will not understand Bitcoin either that is why educating about the system is important but not sure the governments wants in the same way.",

Because in crypto i understand the real problem with Monetary system and i made a topic on this too -->To Understand the Potential of BTC, What we Must Know? The thing is, some people get to know about monetary problems in the learning phase of crypto but some get to know about it before getting into crypto. And in both cases it is good. Because, the more early one being get to know about risks, and problems in Fiat system the more early they will adopt an alternative which is BTC.Your topic has the same meaning and feeling too because one will get to know the potential of BTC once they will learn about its uses cases then they will compare the use cases of BTC with Fiat one and there processors (minds) will tell them which one is best. But still, half of that numbers of people who know the alternative is BTC will still not to chose it because of the reputation. which has been built in there mind from a long ago. But, that reputation is now keep getting better as more and more companies, and governments started to adopt it.",

Some people may realize how bad, unreliable and corrupt are the banks handling their money. But far too few understand how bad is the monetary system at its core. It requires reading/information and understanding/digesting that.Few understand Bitcoin fully. We are still at the stage we use a cannon for shooting a sparrow. Let's be honest, the most attractive selling point for Bitcoin remains its increasing price (i.e. investment/speculation).",

This is not possible even if those issues are taught in academic universities.It is true that the global financial system suffers from chronic crises, and that countries have become involved in this system in a way that they can no longer take individual measures due to the interdependence of the systems with each other. At the same time, there are countries whose financial system does not suffer from anything, and it can be said that they do not need to search for alternatives, given that most people do not care about the principle of privacy.",

Come on, who runs away from a safe heaven? Of course, when more people realise how cool it is to acquire some Bitcoin, they will even prefer it to fiat. Another problem that some people are facing is the ban on Bitcoin in their country. Some people also live in countries where the government has made Bitcoin look like something that can just liquidate their funds because of its volatility. Mate, there's this saying that \"if you are not informed, then you are misinformed.\" Some people in some countries have really had the wrong information about Bitcoin, and they are still living with those misconceptions, and that's what keeps them from not Investing in Bitcoin.I happen to ask a friend around me; she's a female. I asked her, How about if I give her 1 Bitcoin or 1 million in my local currency? She said she would choose 1 million in my local currency. I asked her why, and she said because that's the one she is sure of and that's the one she knows very well for now. Her answer to me explains it all; she doesn't even have an idea of what Bitcoin is, and there are many people like her. Common, who rejects 1 Bitcoin over $1000. Lack of knowledge is just what's limiting some people, but I believe that gradually, it will get to a point where many people will still embrace Bitcoin more than the population that has already embraced it today.",

Who uses bitcoin as an alternative to fiat to begin with? Practically no one. It is hardly even used in El Salvador. Nor in this forum itself will reach 10% of regular users who use it as an alternative, paying their petrol, supermarket, etc. with current satoshis without previously converting to fiat.As for understanding the financial system, I would say that the percentage is higher because people realise that fiat is devalued due to monetary policies, while bitcoin is limited but there are many people who buy bitcoin like they buy fashionable stocks and the shitcoin of the moment, and this does not stem from a deep understanding of how the monetary system works. I would say that maybe you even yourself do not have a deep understanding of how the monetary system works. Can you tell me what M3 is without looking it up on the internet?
