  "content": "Hello everyone here in this forum, If you remember I made a topic here about the plan to teach Bitcoin in my Subdivision area. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404886.0It took quite a few weeks before I was able to give you updates, and finally some of my neighbors who told me and showed interest in what Bitcoin is all about and how it can help them, they agreed to arrange their schedule so that I could teach them and here it is and it happened and it was held in my own little home. And the funny thing here is that they are all young people, and currently studying, they showed interest in what I am doing with bitcoin, what it really is. These are just some of the pictures that I will show you that I myself was really happy with them that's why I didn't regret to give them time and even it was conducted in my house in this regard. This is the first step topic that I taught them first, it's really basic and I explained to them slowly and properly in our language, the funny thing is that they came to my house with a small notebook and a ballpen to jot down the important points I will make. According to the image you see above, these young people told me that they got interested because it was their parents who encouraged them to come for me to teach them about what I was doing with bitcoins and their parents said that even though I am not employed or unemployed, I can still pay my monthly billings, rental house, internet bill, electricity, and water bill within 6 years. And the rest of them are already 27yrs old, 22, 18, and 17 years old. And they are all inspired by what I do. after the first session, they had questions about what I taught them about bitcoin, and they were completely satisfied with the answer they like to hear from me. The beauty of it is that before the end of our bitcoin session, the five of them agreed that every twice a month there will be a small home party session here at my house. I said no problem and I will give it to them for free. One of the young people even said that he gradually understood bitcoin and plans to make it a secondary payment option in their small sari-sari store here in our subdivision. But for now, he will study for now. That's why the basic usages and benefits was the one I tackled in the first place.So my only request to the other members here in this forum is to teach me what can be taught to them that I may not know at the moment, although I am not an expert here but only basic thing about bitcoin that I share with my acquaintances here in the community I'm in. So you are free to provide additional knowledge on this matter and I am willing to accept it because I am also one of those who are still learning about bitcoin.Thank you very much for taking the time to read this topic I made, and I will continue to give you updates on my next teaching to these young people. God bless you all",

You'd have to work or give out a service and be paid in bitcoin, then use bitcoin to pay your bills, so as people understand bitcoin, they should also develop a skill they can give out and be paid in the coin, or they have to work, and use their salaries to buy it (note that buying that way is for speculation and not spending), it is a crucial information, so people avoid building castles in the air with the thought that knowing bitcoin without working will be a panacea to poverty.",

There are many ways to teach people about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. But not everything goes well, depending on how you implement it by making the terms as simple as possible. Adjust to the cognitive level of age, it definitely sounds more complicated to you. One of them is understanding what they need and what is the main reason they are interested in Bitcoin.",

Anyway, I'm glad to see you've invited people into the crypto family.Thanks for your advice friend, don't worry in our next session that's one of the things I'll do with them, for now, we'll just do it little by little, I don't want to rush them, it's good to go slow, but they'll understand what I'm saying very well.QuoteTeaching people about bitcoin is great, but i will not let people into my home for that purpose, that is too risky for a bitcoin user like me, even if they are neighbors, i may just be exposing myself to attacks in the future, people think every bitcoin user is rich you know.  A change of venue may be necessary, a group on any social media app may be even better, anything to maintain your privacy and anonymity and to protect yourself. You get an idea of what i am saying from this snippet from your postFirst of all, I understand what you mean Sir, but we have different attitudes when it comes to dealing with neighbors, because for me they're my friends too, not just neighbors, secondly those young people in the picture, I know their parents well and they are my friends too, we also treat each other as a family, even their other small children also come and go to my house to play with my son. They also know that I'm not a rich person, I don't have four wheels, I only have a single motorcycle, the parents of the young people in the picture they have all cars. So, I think you are thinking wrong about them. In fact, I often ask for help from the parents of those young people, as if their parents just want me to teach their eldest children what I do. And if they need a hand with me I will also give as long as I can give a hand to them. QuoteNow on that snippet, i do not know how you manage to do all that without a job, you probably get bitcoin for providing a service, there is something many do not understand, bitcoin is money, just like £ for example, you have to do something to get it, it can't help you pay your bills without working for it, it is not bitcoin of itself that pays your bills, it is your skill you give out.

And You don't have to worry about this thing Sir, Because I already explained to them in simplest explanation that they would understand it clearly in our own local language. Like paying bills from Bitcoin-usdt- local currency going to coinsph or gcash wallet. Just simple as that.",

Other things on the board seem right.It's cool that parents are encouraging their young adults to learn about Bitcoin, I'm quite surprised about that.I think it's important to teach these people about the safety of holding Bitcoins (importance of using a non-custodial wallet) and of keeping the keys safe but also somewhere one won't forget to look.Also, have these people consented to the photos being published? If so, it's great, but otherwise it's a violation of their privacy and the faces, at least, should be blurred.",

I reckon with og absolutely, as disappointing as it may sound, it is difficult for a newbie to buy or rather, invest in crypto right now and not expect to get rich over night, most especially the middle class and lower since they are always in need of money to solve one problem or the other, it is easier for the upper class and higher to understand that investing in bitcoin is a long term thing, and since they have world class businesses and companies that yield so much profit for them, it is easily possible for them to look away from the money they invested in crypto even for many years.But the above is not the same with the poor guy out there, it is almost impossible for a poor guy to invest in crypto and look away from it for at least, two years, except he or she for one or two reasons forgot in invested in crypto, like it is with one of my friend.BTW.... , Congratulations to you @op on your new Bitcoin teaching initiative, keep playing your part in the quest for bitcoin adoption.",
