  "content": "I saw a similar post in the bitcoin discussion board and decided to do the same thing but with gambling. I played around with ChatGPT and asked it to explain what gambling is, like I am a 5 year old, 15 year old, 25 year old, and 50 year old. See the responses below: \"Explain gambling to me like I am a 5 year old\"QuoteGambling is when you play a game to try to win something, like money or toys. It's a little bit like playing a game of luck, like rolling dice or flipping a coin. If you guess right, you might win something, but if you guess wrong, you might not get anything. Just like in any game, it's important to remember to only play with things you can afford to lose, and never to gamble more than you can afford.Explain gambling to me like I am a 15 year oldQuoteGambling is the act of betting or wagering on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning extra money or material goods. It can take many forms, such as playing the stock market, betting on sports, playing casino games like poker or slot machines, or buying lottery tickets. However, it's important to keep in mind that there is always a risk involved in gambling and it's possible to lose money. Additionally, it's crucial to make sure that you only gamble what you can afford to lose and to never let it become a harmful addiction.Explain gambling to me like I am a 25 year oldQuoteGambling refers to the act of betting or wagering on an event or game with an uncertain outcome, usually with the intention of winning additional money or material goods. Gambling activities can range from traditional casino games like blackjack and roulette to sports betting and online games like poker. It's important to understand that gambling always involves some degree of risk, and it's possible to lose money. Additionally, it's important to be responsible and only gamble within one's means, and to never let it negatively impact one's life. It's also crucial to be aware of and understand the laws and regulations surrounding gambling in your jurisdiction.Explain gambling to me like I am a 50 year oldQuoteGambling refers to the act of risking money or something of value on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the expectation of winning more money or material goods. It can take many forms, including casino games, sports betting, online gaming, and lotteries. While gambling can be a source of entertainment for some, it's important to understand that it also involves risk and there is a potential for losing money. It's important to be responsible and only gamble within one's means, and to be aware of and understand the laws and regulations surrounding gambling in your jurisdiction. Additionally, it's important to recognize when gambling may become a problem and to seek help if necessary.The main message for me is gamble with what you can afford to lose and seek help if you think it is affecting you negatively.Reference to chat: https://chat.openai.com/chat/220b7e99-9d18-4c6e-8a72-664fee4e256d",

Basing up on simple understanding then gambling is something that that you do risks up money for earning money.Gambling is something for fun and at the same time you are really that risking something.Of course you should really be that accepting that you should only spend the amount that you can afford to lose.",

ChatGPT's response is not different from the standard definition of gambling you can easily find in dictionaries. So the interesting part here is how ChatGPT adjusts its definition a bit to suit the age provided. It's amusing how it uses the keyword \"toys\" when asked to define gambling to a 5-year old, or \"rolling dice\" or \"flipping a coin\" in lieu of blackjack and roulette and lotteries it mentioned in the definitions for older ages. We can also notice how it includes laws and regulations in the definition as the age indicated belongs to adults.",

And with a lot of research going on in the last few years about gambling, it can't be surprising that ChatGPT knows a general information about gambling addiction.[1] https://gist.github.com/veekaybee/6f8885e9906aa9c5408ebe5c7e870698#training-data",

Without looking further at the web search result regarding that to verify if it's true, I prefer to debunk that idea.Gambling addiction for me started with the environment, then it depends on the person if they will allow addiction to shut their ability to be a responsible gambler. I don't want to blame any other things leading to addiction but only ourselves. Just my own point of view.",

      "body": "I guess the answer to the 15-50 year old ones was generally the same, the 5-year-old one was the one that most differed from the rest (still the same for the most part, but dumbed down to the level where risks aren't portrayed as serious as the rest). Nothing new or unique, though I did consider adding gacha-type of games for the 5-year-old description initially, but not for the rest.

But on the other cases, it didn't make difference when explaining to a 15, 25 and 50 years old person, with the exception the AI changed one word or another in each answer. And the AI is actually right, because individuals from all those ages can understand a same explanation with excellency. Only when we are talking to children the terms and definitions used must be different: clearer, simpler, and making reference to elements of their infant world as examples.",
