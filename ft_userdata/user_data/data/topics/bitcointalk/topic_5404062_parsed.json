This is a sad thing of course for everyone that is interested or invested in cryptos. The bright side of this though is that now you have a chance to buy good and established crypto project for a fraction of the price that you would have paid a year ago or so.The meme-coin hype is over and the tweets of Elon Musk have little or even no effect anymore because people are used to it. I think that meme-coins will sloly but surely die out. The biggest ones will maybe remain in the top 50 but that is it. So i would definitely not invest into shit-coins.",

I'm not entirely sure about the recent \"doge\" meme coin price hike caused by Elonmusk's tweet, I think it's just a minor correction, on the one hand you can see the current market chart shows that several other cryptocurrencies are also experiencing correction 24 hours last.also regarding the new project you mentioned I don't know, can't advise, the decision is yours.",

I also share you website and website linkAre you a high-risk take and have known how the concept of shit projects works?if not, and if you are new to it, I will never suggest you buy this kind of new token from new projects. The risk is very high. Losing money on this project is very high to happen. That is why this is high risk. Although there may be a few chances that this token or coin can be listed in certain DEX (as usual probably) will have a very high pump when listing, in fact, the price may be dropped again. For, one of the characteristics of this kind of hype project are in the pumped and dumped market price. that is why I called this high risk. Unfortunately, if this project never lists their token or coin, your money will be lost directly",

The market is dropping a lot of good coins with great discounts why don't you choose one of them. Potential old coins will have a chance to recover strongly and reach new ATH instead of investing in a new project with too much risk when investing at this stage.",

However, even to say that Elon Musk promoted another project again, I'm not sure of this will gain more attention anymore after he does to Dogecoin and much more for meme coins. I'd just to remind you OP the risk of investing in unreliable projects especially if it is only built with hype as it was very close to a sad end, probably an exit scam. We don't have to get hooked up with such a promising look of the project but rather consider the purpose of its creation as this will help to measure the capability to stay longer.",
