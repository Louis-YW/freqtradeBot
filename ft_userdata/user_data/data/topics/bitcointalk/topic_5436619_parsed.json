I have only 85 topics started and I'm here since 2014. If one doesn't have new/important/very explanatory things to say, maybe he has to focus on something else.Maybe you should not be so keen to create topics. Read, learn, answer questions, give advises. Be careful to not repeat what others said, where possible.And some day you will know what to write for new topics when it's the case. Why rush it?Oh, creating new topics make it easier for your campaign's quota? That's a more unpleasant story. If you don't know what to write, you better don't write, else you'll end up - sooner or later - spamming. And I think that it's better if you leave a campaign for not meeting a quota now, as Full Member, then learn more and someday start joining campaigns again, maybe even as a higher ranks, but surely with more experience and more information to tell/share. How about this?",

Try doing more reading and maybe contributing in other people's thread and just join in the conversation and before you know it you have learnt alot more than trying to crack your brains into creating topics that would draw attentions. I personally believe that you cant offer what you don't know so i will advise you to just keep reading and the knowledge of writing will come naturally.",

If you don't have much to contribute through creating a thread, then simply don't. At least until you think of something actually worth discussing.That's exactly right. To add to this, life has taught me that when you try really hard to do something that is not natural, it becomes harder and quickly impossible. The reason is simply that you are going against nature. Sure this may not apply correctly to everything but it does apply to most things and it definitely applies here. The answer to your problem? Stop trying to go do something that is against nature. Like everyone else have said, don't force yourself to try and create topics, instead participate in meaningful discussion. Naturally you will learn more and eventually you will have questions or discussions that you naturally would like to discuss with the forum.",

He is not obliged to create topics, though this topic says that he certainly feels obliged. This might be because of his signature campaign, desire to rank up his merit, or gain account activity. If these were not his missions, he would not feel obliged! Unless he really does just desperately wants to contribute to the forum out of his good heart and passion for supporting bitcoin or the bitcointalk forum, but you tell me how likely that is that against the former",

The driving force for which the above post was made to address was signature motivated but in this case, we've got merits, rank, impression and a later times, signature to contend with.In essence what am saying is; If you don't already have it in you or feel a concern about a subject or information that needs to be put out, there isn't a need to force a post on yourself. When it eventually comes, the content becomes a distinguishing factor of what might have been posted before or not.",
