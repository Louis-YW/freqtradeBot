It's not easy to initiate this event but you made it, not just because of your strong initiative only, but also your great attitude towards everyone. People can feel it and we enjoy this event together. Thanks to icopress, betnomi, and theymos for the support. Well seems we gonna need a Bitcointalk's calendar where all of important events in this forum could be written there, such as this pie contest, pizza, and pumping carving.Btw sorry for not joining the vote, as I had so many favorites in my mind. It would be just useless if I kept putting multiple votes because it wouldn't be counted lol. Damn I really want to taste all of those pies. Cheers guys!",
