Do you think this is the end for Bitcoin or we’ll reach a new ATH after this downsize?The feeling is called - panic! I am not an investment advisor but I am also seeing red since yesterday. Today the entire day I am only seeing a great slide from 28k to 23k. Am I worried - Yes I am! Am I panicking - nope! Am I buying - certainly! It's a great opportunity period. Take it or leave it!",

IMOShould you hold to zero, only if you never needed that money.(Odds are the network will crash long before the price drops to zero.)If that money is needed anytime in a few years, well better get it while you can.Especially considering exchanges are locking up and stopping withdrawals as we speak.Let this be a lesson to all that claim btc is a store of value.Store of Value don't fall off a cliff like btc.",

This isn't the first time that I've seen someone thinking about this question and putting it up for bitcoin's price going to zero. If you're in doubt now, you better sell/cut at losses. Mental health is much more important than the portfolio that you've got.If it's going to give you a relief to sell/cut at losses, you think of it before you do because you can go back to the market anytime. But if you can endure looking at the market then you need to be patient and just look at the whole market from years ago up to now.Quote from: Rotas World on June 13, 2022, 03:54:34 PMDo you think this is the end for Bitcoin or we’ll reach a new ATH after this downsize?It's not the end. Bitcoin is here to stay.The same thought was seen on 2018 and even before that, you can picture out what the people were thinking when bitcoin has crashed and was not yet on mainstream and it's not yet massively adopted.",

We already surpassed the hard days of pandemic period.And yet, why are we going down to 20k range again? And so most of us thought, btc won't go down to this level again. But if you have been in this market long enough, you will think that it is only a matter of time before it will start going up.So better hold off because btc's lifespan is not yet over. Just another hurdle to overcome. Quote from: LegendaryK on June 13, 2022, 04:28:10 PMGold has lost only ~$44 right now and is already heading back up.BTC lost ~$38000, in ~1 year and still heading down.Little Suzie's college fund is still there if it were stored in gold, Little Suzie's college fund is hurting if it were in btc. This is why this market is for people who are not afraid to take high risk because of this volatility factor.Once you got in, you should know you are susceptible to uncertainty of this market.  But I bet, if someone bought btc to hold, for sure, he is hoping that one day, he will get his rewards.",

Sitting still/Doing nothingIts up to someone on how they would really be treating up these kind of scenarioand since its your money or investment then its your decision whether you do panic sell or holdbut talking or speaking with common sense then its not really sensible to panic sell.",

Its heartbreaking because I never though this could happen based on the recent stability of Bitcoin. But I am willing to take the risk. I am not selling and I would buy more. I just have this conviction that Bitcoin will bounds back. The world economy is going through a lot and almost every form of investment is affected. But I have also made up my mind that if Bitcoin doesn't bounds back, which is very unlikely, no problem at-least I invested in something I have always cherished.",

(money that will be gone and never seen again next week anyway) could be worth it for a punt, to invest that, after all its not going to be in your bank account next week anyway...dont think about throwing large life changing amounts in on a guess or whim.for now. just think about how much money you dont mind investing because alternatively it will just be a few toilet flushes after a a evening meal or a few photos of a vacation you cant get backand just use that \"disposable income\" you wont regret being without for a few months..next week if the price goes lower. think about ONLY that next weeks \"disposable income\". and add more coins even cheaper.. \"averaging down\"  your overall hoard if you already had coins at higher prices from a few months/couple years ago.if the price goes up this week.. alteast you got something out of it and didnt miss the chance",

It's yours and it still has the same utility that it had back then. You felt fine because other people were also buying at that price so you felt a part of the crowd, like if they're doing it everything must be OK. Then some of them started selling at a loss, but you didn't and now you feel like you're doing something wrong because more people are selling than buying. Think about it for a while, you don't have to follow other people all the time, you have your own brain. I held Bitcoin when it was worth $500 and $5k and then $20k and then $10k and back to $3k, back to $10k and to $3k again... It's still the same bitcoin and it's not going away.",
