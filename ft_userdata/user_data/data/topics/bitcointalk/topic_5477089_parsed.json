I have already accepted that it is very unpredictable and the best I can do is make a calculated guess based on the information available to me and hope for a positive outcome.Some gambling websites are more difficult to find your way around than others. I stick to those with clear navigation and more game options to choose from. More generous odds also play a role.- Jay -",

But sometimes, I can gamble with friends, but that is just for fun and nothing more, no friend has taught me how to play a game and I have not taught any friend before about how to play a game. Sport betting is also simple.",

      "body": "Since I first began playing games like dices, mines and then eventually tried plinko and crash, one of the first things I did not understand was how it was possible to adjust the multiplier by our own so we would go for small and safer multipliers. I was a newbie and I thought I was possible to beat the house/casino by going by rolling multiple dices at x1,01 until reaching a significant sum of money. Though, I took me a while and trial and error to realize that the risk will be always proportional to the reward one is trying to get out the session.I only took some sessions of a couple of hours before I lost my wager to that strategy, since then I have tried to limit myself to use such approach for entertainment purposes and never to assume I will get lucky enough to defeat the mathematical law of chances by playing the safest as possible.  I know it sounds dumb and something anyone here takes as obvious knowledge. It was several years ago when I realized it.",

You would find it hard to believe that I concentrated on straight win, draws  in the first six months of my sports bet gambling, at most I could go was both team score  (GG). And it went on like this not until a friend saw my ticket and ask why I didn't play other better options, due to my ego of not letting him know I was yet to understand about those other options  I had to tell him I prefer these options and am sure of my predictions.  This mainly was the reason I made a lot of losses in my first phase of starting sport bet gambling so I couldn't help it and decided to be open to my friend and he started putting me through on many options and their meanings. Today I am masterpiece with different options. @rdluffy, There's no need to be ashamed, anyone can laugh if they want to, one thing for sure is that we were all beginners at different point.",

      "body": "Playing slots has always been a challenge, tried it with my girlfriend and figured she is quite good in slot games. Her numerous wins in demo modes, helped me to try out slot games. Although in different forms, not exactly the one she played. Moving further, I read a book on slot games, and how slot machines can be manipulated to eat up the gambler's money without returning any win, how gamblers can take advantage of a bad slot machine and the house edge. These factors helped to reduce the challenges I had in gambling. Never was good in sports gambling, due to the odds. And I prefer watching matches with a free mind. While trying to master Roulette games, choosing the right number indeed posed a threat to me, I normally skipped them and went for a slot with a higher winning chance. Picking the red and black sides of the table helped me to stay winning in roulette games. Card games like Joker posed a threat because I feel people at the same table as me play better than myself. But, sooner I started winning, even to the championship stage, where I'd have to compete with the last man standing in the tournament. At the initial stage, every single game, normally, posed a threat, but continuing and trying again helped us to pose a threat to the game. While we try again, we must be conscious of our money or bankroll.",

Sports betting is not that simple at first but the moment you understand its concept and how it works, I’m sure you can easily do it the next time you place a bet. Initial challenge also is looking for the best betting site, you have to search for the best and choose the best platform for your betting activities.",

I did it the safe way though. My first online gambling experience was through bitcointalk where casinos were giving free money to try out their games.

That above was the major challenge I face, I could also add understanding the interface of the casino that I was using… the first one I used was a bit difficult for me to understand since I was still learning about sports, what I’m allowed to bet on, things that are not allowed in betting, and so on… there are still some certain games that I’ve never placed a bet on since I started gambling although I have heard people discussing about it but I’ve never been curios enough to check it out.",

Losing bet is a normal and acceptable outcome but if it is due to fixed matches without my awareness, then it would be hard to accept a single one. It'll probably question me with regrets. Fortunately, I haven't encountered one yet. The only challenge I experienced is delay and holding of funds to some gambling sites which are somehow bearable and understood.I hope there is always room for improvements in this field in general to lessen the worries of some gamblers.",
