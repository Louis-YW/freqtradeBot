  "content": "Hello,I have 3 wallet.dat files from 2018 and 2020 and I'm at least 50% sure there's between 1-3 BTC located on one of them. Given that even 0.25 BTC would be life changing for me right now, it would be incredible if I could access these wallets.I've tried every password I can think of to no avail. This morning I've been looking into BTCRecover and finally got it running, but it's going to take a ridiculous amount of time to brute-force even a 6 character password with the hardware I have, because there's a good chance I used a combination including numbers and special characters in the original password.Bearing the above in mind, is there someway I can extract the public wallet addresses from these wallet.dat files to know if this is something worth perusing or not? If I could at least find out what the situation was, I could then make an informed decision on the best way to proceed.I'm 90% sure these are wallet.dat files created by Electrum Bitcoin Wallet. All are password protected (encrypted).Thank you for timeSincerely, badape25",

I got confused because I renamed one of them to .dat to try on BTCRecover. They are indeed just standard files without any extension",

It happens a lot, and is a waste of everyone's time.If you're unsure about the balance, unsure about what software you used, and don't know the password, it sounds like something isn't right.QuoteThey're 100% mine and were on an old USB I was sorting through. I simply cannot remember the password I used.It would help if you're sure about what software you used. If you used Electrum, it told you to write down 12 seed words when you created the wallet. Find those words and you don't need your password.",

      "body": "You cannot extract addresses or public keys from a password protected Electrum wallet without knowing the password. The entire wallet file and all the data it contains is encrypted, which you can see if you open the wallet file with a text editor. If the wallet did not have a password, then all the data is stored in plain text and this is easily possible, but that doesn't help you here.Quote from: badape25 on January 04, 2023, 06:03:02 AMYes my mistake. I got confused because I renamed one of them to .dat to try on BTCRecover. They are indeed just standard files without any extensionThis is not how btcrecover works. You should not be renaming Electrum files to .dat files. Simply make a copy of the Electrum wallet file and specify its location to btcrecover in the command line using --wallet PATH.Bruteforcing from scratch with absolutely no knowledge of your password will almost certainly be unsuccessful unless you used a very weak password. You will need to have some idea of what the password could be to create a tokenfile for btcrecover to work from.",
