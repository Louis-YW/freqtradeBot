It's a weird question, but usually passwords are things people like or feel attached to, like their child's name, date of birth, a wedding date or a place where they met their spouse...For a long time I used the same password, just by adding numbers to the back of it, or starting with a capital letter and felt pretty safe with it. If your father took his investment seriously he used a password that would be impossible to forget and possible to recall even if he was sick with a fever. Chances are it's hidden somewhere on his computer, if you have access to it, or written somewhere, like inside of one of his books. Also, check for seed phrases around the house. It's something people don't remember but often hold in a safe place. How do you know how much bitcoin he owned? Do you know the address? Did your father leave last will?",

I want to do it myself without sending the file to anyoneI think you don't need to send the backup file to wallet recovery services you can just give the password hash of your wallet.dat file and send it to them and let them crack it for you once they crack it they will send the cracked password to you that you can use to open this wallet.You can find the official thread here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=240779.0",

If someone didn't leave a password to be found, then we can assume that they didn't want someone to get access to what they locked. Furthermore, if you don't have the slightest idea of what the password might look like, the chances of someone brute forcing a password that consists of random letters, numbers and special characters and is longer than 10 characters are almost zero.",

I hope I find it one day...Let's hope that you can find it but if you can't then you need to hire a professional to recover the lost password of that wallet.dat like we mention above. Or do it with yourself hashcat and John the ripper are not the tools we are using to recover the wallet password maybe you haven't heard of the BTCrecovery tool yet?If not try this tool you can find the tool here https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TUTORIAL/Take note without idea about the password (Characters long, only numbers or big/small characters only or etc...)it would take decades to recover the password but still depends on the device specs you use and how long your father's password is.",

There's no way on cracking on this one i should say.OP already said that he has no idea what the password is and I think that would be a challenge to the ones who will get the password. Since OP is willing to pay then I would also suggest to contact what OmegaStarScream recommended since there are others who offer the same service but not s legit one and should be careful contacting other services like it. I checked the image and it seems the balance is more than 6 btc so if it's recovered and have that balance in it then the amount to paid to the service or the person who recovered it will surely get paid unless there's no balance in it.",
