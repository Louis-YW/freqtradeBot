Since I am a newbie , I would love to share this with my other newbies because I firmly feel that we are the ones who fall prey to ignorance the majority of the time.Please let us be cautious when choosing which coins or tokens to buy. I've found that most of us newbies simply buy because others are doing so, believing that the coin or token will continue to have more value as it was introduced by someone we  love so much until they discovered it end up in nothing but only scam. Always keep in mind that anyone can generate cryptocurrency coins or tokens as long as they have the funding to do so. Use of celebrities to mislead us. After creating coins or tokens, their goal is to recover and double the money they invested. To do this, they use various strategies to make it appealing to people and promote it on various social media platforms, likely using celebrities.Celebrities are sometimes used by new initiatives to draw attention by giving the impression that they invested a certain sum of money and received a return on it, but this is a lie—the celebrities actually work for the projects because he/she have been paid bfor it. Please resist the urge to buy any token or coin because of your passion for a particular celebrity. Before you purchase any of these tokens, do further research. Always remember that even celebrities are after money. Allow yourself to be guided to avoid scam projects.Source : https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63116235",

The entire Social media isnt even advice to rely on, we could see how Terra Luna and DOGE where hype and later failed. Senior members of this great forum have even warn of investing in a coin even if a forum member preaches its potential. The best advice to any newbie trying to invest is to Do your Research or rather just limit it to investing in Bitcoin only",

They also knew that those influencers are paid and have bag of what they are posting. They just riding the potential gain which sucks for newbies who will bought late. Cause what would happened is simply they will become the liquidity of those guys and got stuxk at the bottom and will end up with a lower price of their entry. Soon turn to rug or drained liquidty.",

Facts. Actually celebrity that promoting scam crypto and NFT are now being chased by the authorities since this illegal. Kim Kardashian is one of them that get the taste of his own medicine for promoting scam NFT. Most of the celebrity doesn't think about the welfare of there fans that will purchased tokens due to there influence. Celebrities ain't crypto or financial expert so they are not a good source of financial advice.Is there still any newbie keeps buying random shit just because celebs promotes it? If you are still doing this kind of shit then you need to grow up.",

      "body": "One thing that newbie should always remember \"crypto investing doesn't always offer profits\", there are always two sides to it, losses and advantages. Shitcoin has a greater risk of loss, especially since the coin has very weak fundamentals in the market. We've seen some celebrity launched coins are unreliable, more risk than profit. Most of them (celebrities) just want to accumulate wealth by exploiting the ignorance of investors in the crypto field. After accumulating enough money, they would immediately leave it without caring about the future of the coin it worked with.Bitcoin is a good investment medium for newbie, I highly recommend Bitcoin for you and other newbie.",

This is common for most projects, they think that they can attract more investors just because they've hired a celebrity that would Tweet or post the project that they have. But technicality, these celebrities are ignorants because usually they just advertise it without knowing if the project is legit or a scam, it's proven because it happened in the past so many times with different celebrities. But it's an increasing number for celebrities that are starting to know more about crypto and crowd funding.",

And a reason why most newbies fall into scam projects and make them say that crypto is a scam. Knowledge is very important here, though losing is avoidable due to high volatility but choosing potential coins seems to minimize it and could somewhat assure something in the future like if you are investing in Bitcoin.",

Some people still mistake investing in other Altcoins like investing in Bitcoin. There is an above 80% that your investment in Bitcoin is going to give you more profit that investing in any other Altcoin for a long time. Yes, there might be a risk with every investment, and not that it could not happen in Bitcoin investment too but it is safer everything being equal cos I believe that we can all agree that the day Bitcoin fall, so is every other Alt.",

If you think Bitcoin is still questionable to hold for long time, then name me the coin that would make you confident to hold for long time. I think we should bet the coin that you're think it's better than Bitcoin for long term holding, you should spend all of your money to that coins and I spend all of my money to Bitcoin. When the time happen, we should compare which one is the winner and which one is the loser Are you dare?",

No, not just in recent times, during the crypto boom in 2017 and some in 2018, there are a a lot of celebrities who jump in the bandwagon, like Floyd Mayweather and promoted some shtcoin.And so this has been practice already and it just so happen that SEC is coming hard on those celebrities like Kim Kardashian right now and then let the public know what they have been doing, thus promoting them. On the contrary for us crypto enthusiast, we should used our common sense and not just invest because our favorite celebrity says so.",
