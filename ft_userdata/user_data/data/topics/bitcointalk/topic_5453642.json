People use Bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services every day. There isn't any reason for these transactions to be publicized in the media/forums like the Bitcoin pizza transaction because that event was the first time that Bitcoin was traded for something in the real world. Investopedia recognizes use-cases of Bitcoin for goods and services, listing car dealerships, and stores such as jewelers, tech providers, e-commerce and more. It's no longer a question as to whether Bitcoin can be used to buy real-world items or not. It's already established.",

But for some reason, even the person who did this didnt actually regretting it. Well its because its one of the early success of bitcoin as peer to peer transaction in the real world and its been used to purchase a pizza. Its worth before snt that much but the thought of using this. If Satoshi might be alive he could definitely give it back to Laszlo for doing that as a gift or commemoration . Just a thought",

The value of BTC before is not the same as of now and you can say that 10000 BTC at that time is around $40 and it only reach high value when BTC reach its new ATH. You can read it online that he himself did not regret of doing it and if someone bought pizza with BTC then it would only be a commemorate to the event.",

Thank you for letting us know about this. Bitcoin pizza day had been one of the remarkable celebration of Bitcoin which had cut the international attention and making people to be aware of the event that happens many years ago. This celebration is making a lot of us to be wise and not make such a mistake that was made few years ago and I know some other persons would have made this same mistake too because they never believe in the future price of Bitcoin. This same thing will happen in 10 to 15 years coming when we all might be blaming ourselves why we never hold our Bitcoin for as long as many years.",

Actually if you listen to his interviews he has said that he didn't regret it because at that time he was asking if someone could help him to buy two pizzas for which he offered 10k bitcoins so he could feed his family.We are making it big scenario because now the prices are too high which would have make him millionaire but at that time it was not worth much and also the sender of two pizzas sold the coins for much less value as already posted above.They are not in regret at all and we also should not think in that way.What if the opposite has happened and price would have dropped significantly or even not in use by now so would we have remembered him?
