  "content": "I think that x-to-earn can be what we need in some day. Advances in office automation and technology based on artificial intelligence can undoubtedly create new jobs.But many existing jobs can be eliminated. (the concept of a basic income began to be discussed these days.)  In this situation, you need to think about how to get a little money by several ways in the future. (through our daily life.) So I think x-to-earn projects could be the way to the future.Below are some x-to-earn models available today.First of all, there is such a thing as honeygain, which is already known to some extent (which earns money by providing data with the internet turned on).Going one step further, some of the famous P2E projects are said to have earned quite a lot of money.(Of course, it is a matter to think about whether the profits can be maintained for a long time in the long term.)Sandbox 👑The Sandbox 3D is a voxel gaming platform similar to Minecraft and Roblox, but with blockchain-backed collectible assets and currency. It is currently in development, and players can build gaming experiences on their land while testing them out.This game is the current leader in metaverse related crypto games. The ability to build your own experience next to other huge brands like Atari, Snoop Dogg and more!Stepn 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️STEPN is the first Web3 NFT game that requires you to literally move from place to place for any progression(M2E). The more you move, the more tokens you earn.App(Stepn)'s users may earn tokens by running, walking, or jogging outdoors. Pacer, a new app in the wellness area, is taking shape.EarnTube 🎞📱EarnTube is a blockchain-based View-to-Earn(V2E) NFT that integrates with YouTube.It introduces decentralization and Web3.0 principle to youtube by compensating viewers for their attention and input.EarnTube builds a collaborative viewer community and an enriched viewing experience What is clear is that more will be earned through actions that are more closely related to our daily life, and we need to take advantage of this.",
