  "content": "Good evening allI don't know how you people are feeling for me to report this here or it does not reach up to the level of making this thread but some how it has been fake results or do I call it fake counts on merits records.For some days or weeks now I have been seeing merits notification on the bots giving me inaccurate scores, for instance my merits profile is 508 but the telegram notification bot is giving me 509 this made me started wondering if actually my merits got missing but when I looked at my bitcointalk profile I noticed it was common error from the bot. This is to show that those that are using bot for trading are into big risk because one day they might fall into trouble of their bot having a technical issues causing it to malfunction and this could lead for a total damage and lost for the trader.For beginners I will encourage you do not rely on bot for trading because this shows me as a lessen not to put hope on a bot for trading or for anything else as they might malfunction at any time causing a huge lost whereby you would lived to regret it. Please is there any thing I could do to reflect to my current merits count now, currently now I am having 508 on my profile and I would like the next toping of my merits to corelate with the current instead of giving me higher figure than my current merit counts.The image below shows what I meantThank you all.Please do not be mad at me for creating this topic.",

I only noticed that I couldn't receive some notifications today on my telegram bot. But maybe it was a cause of bad network. As regards your issue, I would advice you to reset or rather delete your bot and add it up again as a fresh start. This might help solve your issue.",

      "body": "I think there was a glitch a few days ago, which I noticed on the 27th of this month, where a previous merit notification I received from someone on a particular thread had the same amount of merit. The notification was repeated the next day, adding an additional number to my merit count, but when I checked my profile, that merit did not reflect, and when I clicked on the link, it took me to the old merit that I received. That was the only time I noticed this, and after this exact error occurred, I have not seen anyone of such again. But this one error has affected the whole merit counting because that one that happened has been recorded on the system, and the system has your total number of merits counted, so when you receive a new merit, it will immediately be counted upon from the previous number, which was the last record on the bot. I think this post is best to be reported under the btt bot thread and not meta, as it has nothing directly to do with the forum in particular.",

Then talking about Metamask, Hey I am very careful about wallets and the rest.. You know I don't joke with my money so I won't click on any link that could lead to hack or compromise of my wallets, besides I don't install unnecessary things in my system and my Phone, after reading about security warning over here I wouldn't wait for me to fall victim before I could learn from people's mistakes.",
