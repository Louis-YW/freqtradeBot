  "content": "For newbies in trading, you need to understand that the crypto market is a speculative and not stagnant. It moves up and down known as bull and bear respectively. Incase you don't know, now, how trade happens is when one buyer is speculating up another can speculate down and the exchange happens on the trading platform. For example when the price of btc is $28,000, someone is speculating it further to buy to $29,500 and another can speculate it to sell to $26,000. So depending on your chart and analysis, that determines your winning strength if you speculate rightly. Trading is speculative based on your technical analysis, indicators and fundamentals (news). What do you think?",

      "body": "Yes, it's true that the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative, and prices can fluctuate rapidly, making it a volatile market. Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are two popular ways traders use to predict price movements in the market. Technical analysis involves studying the charts and patterns to identify trends and predict future price movements. On the other hand, fundamental analysis involves examining the underlying factors that affect the value of the cryptocurrency, such as news, adoption rate, and regulatory changes. Both types of analysis have their advantages and disadvantages, and traders often use a combination of both to make informed decisions. It's essential to have a good understanding of the market and the risks involved before getting involved in cryptocurrency trading",

Most newbies know this, but what they cannot and they do not want to understand is that they believe this market somehow can go against the rules of common sense and allow someone which knows nothing about this market to make huge profits in a short amount of time, and this not true, the markets reward the skilled and the experienced, and since they do not have any of those two characteristics then it is to be expected they are punished by it and they lose their money instead of making any.",

But that's not really surprising because I think the average trader and investment know how the market works. Market volatility is expected, traders and investors and observers can always speculate on what will happen in the next 24 hours, next 1 week, next 1 month, 1 year or in several years. But I don't think about the price can guarantee, so speculative of course.Price trends can change at any time, even someone will realize that there is always a possibility that the trend will break their trading and investment plans even though they have done their analysis. Price volatility is expected for the short term and long term profits generated by traders and investors, so this is common with the crypto market.",

Usually when I see people rounding around in groups to pay for signal on telegram I just laugh, not that I said it is wrong but it dependance by newbies baffles me. Trading is risky but still experience, skilled and knowledgeable traders are earning profits from them but this doesn’t comes easily as it needs one to understand and continue to study the fundamentals of trading. The other thing is we only speculate the profit but there should also be some set back speculation which experience traders usually have in mind but newbies only speculate the profits and therefore invest Almost everything on it",

Making profits in trading comes from volatility and those speculation and if the market is not rising/dipping, I doubt if traders would even be making profits. The market is never stagnant! Like you said. That's what they always know before getting on with it. Even for some common investors who want to just carry out some play with their Bitcoin, they could, for example, buy Bitcoin at, let's say, $27,600, and when they see that the price has gone to $28,800, they sell and wait for it to fall to $27k again. unless for some stable coins, which are not useful for carrying out crypto trading.",

      "body": "Yes, it is widely recognized that markets can be speculative. Speculation refers to the act of buying or selling an asset with the expectation of making a profit from fluctuations in its price, rather than from the underlying value of the asset. In a speculative market, prices may rise or fall rapidly due to investor sentiment, news events, or other factors, even if those changes in price are not fully justified by changes in the fundamental value of the asset.Speculation can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can provide liquidity and help markets to function efficiently by allowing investors to express their opinions on the future direction of an asset's price. On the other hand, excessive speculation can lead to market bubbles and crashes, where prices become detached from their underlying value, causing significant losses for investors and disrupting the wider economy.Overall, while speculation is a natural part of any market, it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved and to exercise caution and discipline when making investment decisions.",
