Currently they have to handle 999xxx customer complaints.It seems that they deliberately let customer complaints pile up unhandled and this is enough reason for them not to rush the refunds they confiscate which makes customers give up.",

The representative of freewallet in bitcoin debate like they're trying to solve the things but all they were doing is letting people to withdraw small amounts until they find big fishes and the cycle keep repeating.Also I can see some of the impersonators as well who is trying to use the scammers name to scam more randoms.",

Lock customers' assets.2. Politely string them along with KYC requests.3. Sell your customers' assets when the market pumps.4. Buy back your customers' assets when the market dumps.5. Profit.",

Only a patient seeks medical attention and that can only explain this situation better. Most times one thinks everything is fine with sites one is visiting only to find out that's not the case after one has made financial commitments. In 2017/18, I can't say Freewallet had any of such issues. It was among the top and easy to use wallets then. I also had and used it. In fact, till date I still have some cryptos (nothing major, anyway) in it which I haven't bothered to check back on for a few years now. If I lose those cryptos I won't be bothered much because they aren't worth much. Nonetheless, 60,000 units of Dogecoin is something to be worried about.",

I don't know how you fall into their trap, but it will be difficult to get out of this trap. Because they have no interest in increasing their reputation, their main purpose is to withhold their customer's funds and not return the customer's funds using various excuses. So wait and see what the result is, if you are lucky you can get the funds back.",
