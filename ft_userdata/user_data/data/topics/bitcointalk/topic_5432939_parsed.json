  "content": "Hi everyone!  I have been looking for a long time for a scanner that will send alerts in real time in a wide variety of intervals with types of indicators such as ma 50/100/200 in combination with rsi just like the tradingview scanner is really excellent!!!  The problem with it is that it won't send notifications in real time and it requires me to check most of the day, which doesn't save me time... There is the altfine scanner, the problem is that it fakes and gives false signals of conditions that don't really exist, I would love to receive your recommendations on scanners, of course, for a fee!  Thank you very much and have a great day",

Anyway, check any of these scanners that I found if they can notify or give alerts.- Simple Crypto Scanner- Cryptolume- Algory- CryptoAlerts",

      "body": "I tried some of those services and i finally got to program my own alerts using Python and Binance API.That way i can activate them when i'm available to trade and forget about them when i'm not.I sent those alerts in real time to my Telegram and i can even react to them, selling or buying when i want.It worked so well with crypto that i adapted what i developed to use the Alpaca API to get the same alerts from Nasdaq stocks.And that way i can have several types of alerts depending on several indicators with the timeframe i need. I usually scalp BTC in Binance in 1min timeframe, because now there are 0 fees when using BUSD, so i can make a lot of small margin trades.I also created one of those alerts for a friend that asked me a simple question \"alert me on telegram whenever a Nasdaq stock goes below X RSI\", so he can maintain a list of stocks that are in his \"buying zone\".",

Is it not an accurate app to use?It is not only about price alert, it is about indicators alerts.An example is an indicator alert for RSI when it reached 20, 30 or the number set for oversold market, and that will also alert the traders if RSI is at 70, 80 or any number set for overbought market. Another is an alert set if the upper, middle or lower band of the Bollinger bands is reached for the time ranged chosen.I do not know about these alerts as I am even moving closer to swing trading because scalping and day trading are not profitable for me.",

Their premium plan said they have real-time alerts compared to the pro and basic plans.Read them here https://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?solution=43000520149#compare I suggest try to contact tradingview support because only tradingview has lots of features and like you said all you need is already in tradingview they can maybe guide you in the right direction.",
