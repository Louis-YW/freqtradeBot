  "content": "Spearheaded by Goldentrust Group: A successful real-estate and investment company managing over 200 projects and over $100m of assets from Toronto, Ontario, Canada! Our investment tenet is not only to provide investors and partners with financial guarantees of safety, but also to create regulation, participation, win-win situations, and sustainable development to preserve and grow their assets. This level of success will be directly applied to JDC and the Aurumverse. The primary use of JDC will be to entitle holders with the opportunity for fractional to full ownership in many of our developments and renovations! Some of which you can view here: https://goldentrust.ca/projects-en/The ICO for JDC is currently running and all token sales will be legitimized through a sales contract with the Goldentrust office. If you'd like to participate please join us in our Token Sale discord: https://discord.gg/mfrZqJn6yzAn IDO for JDC will run from October 9th, 2022 to December 9th, 2022 and with the end of the IDO will come the release of our mobile app, Aurumverse: Origins! Immediately providing a secondary use-case for JDC.Aurumverse: Origins will feature NFT Deposit Miners that can be obtained through the typical loot boxes we know and love that will be priced in JDC. Miners will be limited to one per players which will prevent early investors from hoarding and allow for the community to grow organically. The NFT Deposit Miners will require 10,000 JDC to activate and once they reach a value of $5,000 USDT, they will be returned to the network marketplace as to create a stable value for the miners.Referral programs will also be available for players to create value by earning 50% of any mined JDC from their referrals. This will be an incentive for players to begin creating their communities in preparation for the release of the Aurumverse Map!The last and most exciting feature of the mobile app, Aurumverse: Origins, will feature a mini-game where players will be able to buy personal Guard NFTs that will be used to assemble a team. These teams of Guard NFTs can be leveled up and trained to protect your resources (other in-game currencies) and allow you to raid others' resources as well!Since JDC's primary use will be to disrupt the Canadian real-estate industry by allowing holders to take fractional to full ownership and profit from real-estate developments and renovations as they come to fruition – this is where the Aurumverse comes in!Not only will you be able to take ownership in these developments, we understand that the crypto world demands transparency. The Aurumverse will, at first, primarily serve as a way for our customers to not only view, but immerse themselves in our developments allowing investors to get a feel of the properties they are investing in!It doesn't stop there!Goldentrust's position in the Aurumverse will simply be to showcase our real-estate developments but we will also be allowing investors to take part in the development of the Aurumverse itself! As the development progresses, A DAO will be created for JDC stakers to vote on the future decisions of the Aurumverse including release of new continents and rulesets.As we create the map and continents, holders will be able to purchase land with JDC and completely customize and govern these spaces to their liking. Here, you will be able to not only access SIMS-like customization of your land, but also provide goods and services to the players in your space. Most importantly, investors will also be able to allow their communities to take fractional ownership of their own virtual or real-life assets through tokenization!If you'd like to learn more, please stop by the discord where we are allowing serious inquirers to review our whitepaper! – https://discord.gg/mfrZqJn6yz",
