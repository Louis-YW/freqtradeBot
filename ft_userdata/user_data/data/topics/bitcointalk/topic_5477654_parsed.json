How can you be snapping when assistance is needed. Tender the help first then consequently you can snap for identification from friends and family. This act is peculiar with the feminine.

It's abnormal to wait for the emergency unit. I think the best thing to do is to lift the car away from them first",

Some may avoid helping because they fear getting into trouble. They worry about being blamed for the accident or getting involved in a dangerous situation, like being attacked by the family of those involved in the accident. Others may be influenced by the bystander effect, where they act similarly to those around them.",

Mobile phones are very useful for quick and effective communication but people are more concerned about social media activities in their phones than physical communication and saving lives, you'd see people in need of urgent help, perhaps in accident or distressed about something, most people around will rather video or snap than help.",

      "body": "I am not interested in helping someone in an accident nor am I interested in snapping pictures. Helping someone will not benefit me at all, and it will subject me to risk, so I refuse to help people. If you want me to help people, then you need to begin with yourself and act virtuously. If I do not expect the person who needs help to be virtuous, then I will not want to help that person. And since most people are completely and utterly devoid of virtue, I will not help people in the least bit.Don't save people's lives. Don't help people with things. Don't tip. Don't donate money. Don't donate your time. Don't donate to the church. Don't vote unless you are purposely voting for the worst possible candidates out of revenge. Don't give your kids gifts. Don't give anyone else gifts. Don't help people move. Don't support any causes. If you do something for others, they will never appreciate you. People are sick and evil. Treat them accordingly.Regards,-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.If you want to be virtuous, the first step is to stop f@#$ing pretending that you have any virtue whatsoever. I can teach you how to be virtuous. Please send me a message, so that we can set up sessions that will teach you how to be virtuous. I personally know of a way to save lives, but I will not do anything to implement this method until I get lots of sex (but seriously, I don't want your STDs), but since I am not getting enough sex (oh, and the sex must result in a few bastard kids), I am not going to do a da@# thing to make sure that this method gets implemented. This method when implemented may save humanity from extinction, but there are more important things like my own pride.",
