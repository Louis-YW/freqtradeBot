In a few days we might find out some large player like Elon bought some ETH.Normally when it breaks this hard it usually goes back down but it stayed up so far. And when is the last time we had a 5% candle in a 5M time frame. Seems the bull is back.",

      "body": "I think, this is a sign that bullish season is about to take place this week because the price of Bitcoin has hit $30,671 few hours ago to alert long term traders that the time to sell to achieve something good is very close. It was a great celebration in the community, when the price of Ethereum increased to $2000 yesterday because many traders have been waiting for the price to increase higher so that they can start releasing their altcoins to make a good profits. Now that Bitcoin price has affected other cryptocurrencies price positively, I think the price of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin will increase higher before the end of this week to allow traders to experience steady bullish market.",
