If there are bonuses in the form of a referral program, then it is better to ask a friend to make an account and receive deductions and bonuses on it this does not violate the rules. The best strategy is to be honest from the very beginning, then no blockages are scary.",

But what I have noticed is that all the casinos that I have read their TOS only allow one account.Some people can be dubious and want to get more deposit bonus and register many accounts. If such person is known, the account can be banned. And in some cases that the user may not know about it and if he do not do anything dubious, the gambling site will merge both accounts into a single account.",

You are right, for the most of casinos out there on the internet and those which are properly registered. However, it mostly depends on the Terms of Service of the Casino. I have personally checked the ToS of some shady casino, which is quite infamous here on the forum, and for some reason, they allow people (or rather victims) to have multiple accounts in the casino.Since most of the reputable casinos only allow one account per users, I would consider casinos which allow more than account to be slightly suspicious, in my opinion. If one want to have more than a an account is better just to check out with customer service and ask whether it is allowed or not. Better safe than sorry.",

If you look at the scam accusations or at least some of them. The first problem that the casino might throw into your face is that you might be suspected of cheating by having multiple accounts.So for me, it's better not to try this, it's like in land based casino's wherein you have a lot of ids when you join them to have some perks. So it's better to just have one and have one real account.",

I believe one account should be okay and I can't think of a valid reason to create two accounts for gambling tbh.The only scenario I can see where multiple accounts could be created is if a casino accepts only fiat and requires no KYC verification. However, if the casino exclusively deals only with fiat then you cant' do that. There might be some rare situations where someone considers creating multiple accounts for selling purposes but that would indeed be so strange IMO.",

In your previous thread I pointed out the same thing, you are fond of creating a thread in which the title will have a question but when it’s opened and we start reading we’ll discover that you have already provided the answer. You really should learn how to create thread title and stop misleading people with the title of your threads. Now back to your post, the ToS of all casinos are not the same they’re are some that forbid people to have more than one account due to the fact that they can use it to abuse bonuses that are given out to new accounts while they are some that do tolerate it (it’s not common to find such casino tho).. it all depends on the terms of the casino.",

Some casinos look away from that,  but then you still stand the risk of losing your accounts ad all the money in them,  I am sure there is no other reason to have multiple accounts on a casino unless to abuse welcome bonuses so casinos already are aware of this and that is why,  those casinos that look away from multiple accounting doesn't offer any form of bonus to the new client's. And more also if the casino is KYC it will not be allowed or impossible to operate multiple accounts since you may not be able to verify all of them with the same documents.",

If you check the Service board you will see that in MegaPari review, one of the reviews who already had an account created a new one and the manager told him that, he cannot have more than one account because it is against the terms and conditions of the casino.

I don't think there is any reason to have multiple accounts in a casino and betting platforms because first, it's against there rules and regulations, I don't think there is really a casino out there that suppurt such behavior, it's like hiding behind two face to make money from the companies, often times that accounts were suspended here is as a result of the multiple accounts that's why they banned or restricted the accounts and when they can't verify or withdraw, they cry for help that they have been scammed by the casino.Another reason why it's bad to use two accounts is KYC, most of the casinos request for KYC if they see that your account is suspicious or related with other account in activity, such thing can make them request for KYC but they will first suspend the account and if you don't verify the account, you will lose everything both in the accounts, it's better to risk everything you have in one account.",

Indeed, there are some gambling platforms that only allow one account for one user. And indeed there are platforms that allow this, but in my opinion, why should we have multiple accounts on the same gambling platform where this is pointless. And I've never seen anyone do anything as ridiculous as this. Meanwhile, for those who have many gambling accounts, their accounts are registered on various gambling platforms, not just one platform. And they do this to seek their luck to find out which gambling sites can give them big wins when gambling. And as for other reasons, they do this to find which gambling platform they feel is the safest and most comfortable, which behaves in a sporting manner and does not delay balance withdrawals when we get big profits from gambling and the bets we win.",

Can you breathe on planet Earth?It is an ambiguous question, although its answer seems elementary, if you are human, it is directly yes.Any casino player, that is, a human knows that it is not allowed to have two accounts, no.Unless you are a fish, and literally for what it means in the world of betting and you do it in a casino that allows it, which must be equivalent to what it means to live in the water, that is, only fish go there. If you want to understand me more, look up what \"fish\" means in betting jargon.",

There is no advantage to have more than 1 account in 1 casino site. I think it only leads us to spend excessive money on the casino sites. Anyway, it is not only about our personal data, the casino can know our IP address. When they detect we use the same IP in more than 1 account, our accounts can be banned. It will be very bad when we leave some money on the casino account, we probably can't withdraw it if we can't access it anymore. So, it is better to avoid making more than 1 account. It just harms us!",
