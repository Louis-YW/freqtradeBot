Thank you all.I know some of the first place winners woudn't accept the physical items they've won for privacy reasons, it is what it is, and as Bitcoiners it is completely understandable, but it is great there's a Bitcoin reward, and of course no problem about privacy violation on that one (part of the reason we love Bitcoin eh ).
