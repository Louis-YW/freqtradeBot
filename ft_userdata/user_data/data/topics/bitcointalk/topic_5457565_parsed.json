And I was wondering if what he said was right or wrong but could it be that this thing still may be right in some countries in Africa today,  that for me in my little understanding slave trading does not boost the economic system, I will say it only boost some greed politicians pocket the government can not just fold there hands and watch populace has been sold out, and still call it economic growth.But on my little search, I saw this.........QuoteBy 1840, the South grew 60 percent of the world's cotton and provided some 70 percent of the cotton consumed by the British textile industry. Thus slavery paid for a substantial share amount of the capital, iron, and manufactured goods that laid the basic needs for American economic growth But on second thought could this have helped build some country's economic growth because the market of slave trading has a lot to offer, with some small little research I got to know about the price of slaves I was sock to hear the price was mind-blowing think it was about $5,0000 that was around last year Share your thoughts........",

Those who sold them out were paid for doing that; it cost them nothing, but at the end they got rewarded and money was added to their pockets. To those who bought those humans under the slave trade, they are now automatically their own; those slaves are now being owned, which means they are being commanded to do any kind of work without complaining; they are being used to work like animals because they own them, and as such, those people can't say anything or resist. What do you think will be the result of a manufacturing company where workers are doing 3–10 time's what they are initially supposed to be doing? The end result will always be massive production, and aside from the fact that those slaves are not being paid for the work that they are doing, if there is any form of payment that's to be made to them, it's only the slave owners who will receive this money. Mass productivity helps in economic growth because there will be a lot of products to be exported, which in turn will bring more money into the country's reserve. But those were the times of old; now that everyone has far gone through those eras technology and all of that, anyone still considering slave trading as a means of boasting its economy is to be considered a century outdated. They are not really thinking straight and are not being productive considering the level of exposure this century is blessed with.",

      "body": "Quote from: Black susano on June 25, 2023, 08:00:29 PMBut on second thought could this have helped build some country's economic growth My answer to this is yes, it built the economy of those enslaving others because if you buy someone over you are definitely going to use them for among other things labour. They will add to your labour force and your production and manufacturing level will increase like you made the example of the cotton industry that increased to commercial quantity and that led to export which in return increased the GDP and revenue of the developed countries at that time.So to answer your question, yes it helps to increase the economic growth because it is additional labour. But at present time, I can't say if there is still the kind of slave trade that existed in the past around 1800, that involved capturing people by force or selling of human beings to another country. However, I believe there is a new kind of slavery which is modern way where people exit their country to another country because of bad governance and that causes brain drain to the home country while the migrants contribute immensely to the economy of the recipient country.",

We are all humans that deserve to live freely, no human should be captured outside their freewill and sold to live their life as slaves to another.",

Sure, there was once a time wherein slavery boosted some countries economic growth by means of its outputs and also the profits that they had on the slave trade, but that doesn't make it okay at all. The humans they are selling as slaves also have rights that they can exercise, and gone are the days wherein you can pay for someone else's life and keep them as yours forever, or until a certain period of time. The world no longer works like that, and thank the heavens it no longer does.",

      "body": "This kind of trade is already obsolete and is illegal. Although in the early civilization, slave trading is a way or form of gaining manpower for the buyer and income for the seller, it helps boost economic growth because there is more manpower to build infrastructure and other task such as agricultural farming, entertainment and other manual labors.  They even use slaves for conquest to expand their domain while getting more slaves to sell.In the present time, slave trading does not boost economic growth anymore since most people that practice this kind of activity often keep the benefits for themselves and the country does not benefit from it since this kind of activity does not generate tax since it is illegal.Anyway, this is one good articlehow slave trading boost one economy : https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/how-slavery-helped-build-a-world-economyQuoteHow Slavery Helped Build a World EconomyThe slavery system in the United States was a national system that touched the very core of its economic and political life.",

      "body": "I was astonished to see the price of a slave so close to last year. Does this mean that slave trading is still permitted in some parts of the world, and that the price for them is so high because they are scarce compared to before? What I now know is that the slave trade is illegal and has long since been defunct.  Any country involved in the slave trade today is still underdeveloped and knows nothing about what is going on in the world. The Africans who have engaged in all of these acts in the past have done so out of greed and a desire to make a lot of money by selling their compatriots whom they are wealthier than instead of keeping them and finding them work here to help grow the country. Those who were able to brainwash them used this opportunity to develop their country, and they visit for tourism and vacations. Slave trade can undoubtedly help the economy. When one gets individuals to work for them without grumbling and they do the task at a faster rate, the same work that would have been done by more men can enhance productivity and give room to hire more people to do more work for better productivity.",

      "body": "The slave trade, does it still exist today? I think it doesn't exist anymore because it's like human trafficking and many countries prohibit it, so I'm not sure the slave trade still exists.What is currently happening is immigrants who go to other countries to get a job with a better salary than what they get in their country, they can do it legally or illegally because going to developed countries to earn more income is more tempting than the punishment they will get if they are caught because being an illegal worker is legally wrong in the country they come to.Is their arrival beneficial for these countries? For now there are a number of countries that do have a shortage of manpower so of course it will be profitable, as long as they are all official workers so that they are properly recorded because illegal workers can bring new problems to the country. Yes, improve the economy for working countries because they will send money to their families and also improve the economy of the country they go to because the shortage of workers will certainly affect production, so actually it improves the economy of both parties.",

What in the actual fuck this is depraved. I mean why in the hell are we even considering the economic implications of the slave trading era. Of course they experienced a boost in it considering you don’t have to treat your workers like humans. Nowadays that shouldn’t be the case anymore nor should anyone think about using slaves for their enterprise cause we have technology on one hand to help us out with solving our issues with productivity and efficiency which is the main driver why slaves are being used in the first place, but of course because slaves are illegal and if you think the moral implications of this type of pressing issue is not that important compared to the fucking economic boost this could provide then you might wanna get yourself checked in the head bro",

As for the opinion of the slave trade in improving the economy, it must be reviewed from several causes and effects. But my big question is, what is the contribution of companies that employ slaves to improving the economy? I mean, obviously slavery in that country signifies social and economic inequality.In my country there is no slavery system (afaik), meaning that every citizen is free and obliged to pay taxes which then the tax funds will be returned to the people in beneficial ways to boost the economy.",
