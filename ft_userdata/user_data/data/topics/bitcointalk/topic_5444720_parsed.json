I know Serbia is more famous for their national team than for their football league. Let's see if this thread catches up. If not, it will die out and won't bother anyone There are 16 clubs competing in the league and Crvena Zvezda is sitting in the first place. Many of you that are not from Serbia probably haven't heard of clubs other than Crvena Zvezda, PartizanBack to the league. The 16 teams that are competing in this league are:1. Crvena Zvezda2. Partizan3. Čukarički4. TSC Bačka Topola5. Vojvodina6. Novi Pazar7. FK Voždovac8. Radnički 19239.Kolubara10. Napredak11. Javor12. Spartak Subotica13. Radnički Niš14. Mladost15. Mladost GAT16. Radnik SurdulicaInteresting fact:    FK Crvena Zvezda football club became the champion of Europe in 1991 in Bari.As for the teams, Crvena Zvezda is currently sitting on top and has finished on top for the last 8 years. I'm sure that they plan to continue their streak of winning the championship this year too.They have been dominating the Serbian champions for the past 9 years, and I'm sure that the rest of the world got to know the Red Star team when they beat the then European champions Liverpool in the Champions League. On November 6, 2018, Red Star players beat Liverpool 2:0 in front of more than 55,000 fans at the \"Rajko Mitić\" stadium.When is Partizan going to win back a title,I have been following this league as one of my secret of winning lots of parlays as of late is to bet on less well known leagues,like Serbia,Montenegro,Greece,Romania and Bulgaria.However based on my betting in Serbian league a lot of surprise results have hit me especially from Partizan,they have gone and lost 0-4 against some weak team and I lost a lot of money on them,I never experienced such thing with Crvena as when they play at home they usually win and I never have lost money on them when betting on them playing at home,of course the odd was ridiculously low but that is a risk I am willing to take.From what I have seen even in this season is not exciting as Crvena is dominating again.",

      "body": "Quote from: Zele365 on March 13, 2023, 03:04:13 PMNo one in Serbia knows the reason for Partizan's bad form and their results, they didn't have such a bad start but they made some results that shocked all the fans and that has never happened since the club was founded. A month ago, they were defeated at home by a team that is fighting for survival. Mladost GAT beat them at home with a score of 0:4 and that is one of the biggest shames and embarrassments of the Partizan FC team.As for Red Star, they have been constant for the last 8 years, dominating the Serbian championship, and soon they will lift the cup for the ninth time in a row. This year they left all the clubs behind, the second place is Partizan with 21 points less than Crvena Zvezda.Zvezda has great fans on the European stage, let's go back to 2018 and 2019 when they played in the group stage of the Champions League, each match was attended by over 50,000 fans and that is an additional motivation and a wind at the back of the players.maybe you should give a clearer explanation of this league, for those outside the local speaking area. here I will help you.the league is one of the most corrupt. The winning streak of Red Star is the result of the influence of one person. a person who enjoys the greatest power in the state and happily abuses it. (of course, he is a big fan of Red Star).if we are talking about the fans who follow CZ at the Euro matches, it is common knowledge that a part receives a salary for it, and everything is financed from illegal sources and there are certain links that come from the drug trade. Even if this club comes from a big city with more than 2mil. citizens, at regular matches (non-Euro competitions or derby against Partizan), they have a visit of only a few thousand spectators.already at the beginning of the season, you know who should win the league and who should be relegated, and the football results themselves are not decisive. the best evidence is the current elections for the leadership of the league and the federation, where people like Nemanja Vidic and Nemanja Matic are vilified in order to keep control of Serbian football by people with criminal records.this league is the playground of an autocrat and a group of very greedy and corrupt people. it's a wonder how much tolerance UEFA has there.",

My friend played for them when they were in second league and told me all best things about them.",

It's reality of many leagues in Balkans and Eastern Europe that there is lot of dirty things done behind the curtains. My impression about Serbian league from aside - in general there is just 2 games in whole season that really matters - it's Zvezda - Partizan and rest of league probably isn't very interesting even for locals. Zvezda have decent results in UEFA cups, Partizan also playing in group stages on regular basis, but rest of teams getting eliminated in early rounds of qualification. It says something about level of league. I saw a bit of last CZ - Partizan and it was played in completely empty stadium, not the best image for such derby.",

Years ago, the most common result is 0:0 or 1:1, sometimes Zvezda wins 1:0 with a lot of questionable referee decisions. It's really not interesting to watch and one of the reasons why the stands are empty.",
