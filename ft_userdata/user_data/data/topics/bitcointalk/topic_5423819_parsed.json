Ive seen a lot failed many times and this is not a perfect scheme we can always trust.Hi, I wrote this article on medium.You are right, this strategy does not guarantee stable profit and it will go down if the amount of users grows. But there few important points to consider. Any DeFi protocol while increasing liquidity providers' user base decreasing APY, it is normal. It is why you need to search for new protocols when the old is growing too much. This rule work with any DeFi strategy. In this exact case, we were explaining one such strategy, which will work with any Compound-like protocol. When it stops producing good APY on ApeSwap, you can move your money to the next protocol.We researched it for our yield farm, in the position where we will continuously research new protocols for users who deposited tokens in our dApp, but you can do the same work by yourself. If you do it by yourself, you just need to monitor protocol APY, and you will get a successful profit.",

My view is not negative but I am thinking about various factors at the same time whole thinking about the staking based method of earning profits that too in the bearish market. You correctly pointed to the main disadvantage of this strategy. I can say only that when I tested this strategy at the end of summer, BANANA token was falling the whole time, but it still generated high rewards. I deposited USDT in August and then claimed and sold BANANA only in October. I expected APY to be around 10% in the best conditions, but it generated 2.69% in two months. That in a year can be 2.69% * 6 = 16.14%. Previous profits, of course not a guarantee of future profits, but it still looks like a good strategy even in these conditions.",

Imagine if it heavily devaluates during your investment. It would be the end.Thank you for the feedback! For me, the author of this article is very pleasant to hear it  The platforms are mainly not doing such a strategy by themselves because this strategy slowly declines the price of the token. if ApeSwap does it by itself, it will require them to sell their own token continuously while minting it. Of course, it is not in their interest.You are right about risk, but I wouldn't name it a serious risk because the interest you pay is rarely more than 10% in a year. And when you see that your profit is too low, you can withdraw your money. You probably will have at least a month to react before any noticeable losses occur. Also, if you often enough sell BANAN, even high devaluates will not be a big problem. ApeSwap like and Compound pay their reward based on USD equivalent, which means if BANANA falls, you just receive more tokens.But in general, of course, you are right, and I strongly recommend anyone consider if he is ready for such risks before investing.",

I know that this has been done before and could be the norm. But I'm looking at the APY, if it is practical approach as far as profits goes.",
