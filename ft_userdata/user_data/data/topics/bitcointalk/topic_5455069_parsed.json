I have read about this islamicoin in several places but I am yet to see any meaningful progress being made by this project and its teams. Everything about it screams a scam. And yeah, i doubt i could find one real follower that's not a bounty hunter in twitter. Nothing in this makes sense. Basically same if i was a millionaire and did a Buddhist coin and that would \"hold Buddhist values\". I wouldn't need to ask permission from any buddhist community, as they probably didn't even notice my coin. I would just release private sale of it saying that this is your official buddihst money now. Next to nirvana.And without being an expert about Shariah, even i know that this doesn't meet the requirements of Shariah as it should avoid interest-bearing or speculative practices.So how does highly speculative asset that contains staking (giving interest) is compliant? Everyone should see trough this lie.",

Don't think this token has anything to do with Islam as a religion the name Islanicoin may just be a random name chosen by the team, but the issue is that this project looks so unserious and I advise members to do a due diligence search about the token before ever considering to invest in it.But if you all can stay away from this coin I think that will be very helpful in protecting from possible loses.",

Shit scam project gonna die soon. What you have been saying above was only fully of gimmick only to lure people. 1 million followers in twitter? Those gonna be bots who have been following the twitter account of that shit scam coin. Well, i have marked it as a suspicious one with high probability to be another scam coin.

There is a reason for this, to create Memes that will have a run in this space you need narratives to be on your side and money to pump the tokens initially to as to capture people's attention, if you can't make people the first people that joined your token rich, the herb won't come.

Many people are being scammed everyday in different ways. For someone to make you lose your sense of reasoning on the plater of religion is a scam but these types of scam are overlooked in our everyday life.The religious token is what is about to trend, I have seen some other threads were churches are starting to create their own coins.

Coins which are religious are not new. There is even called Jesuscoin before but they only look like a meme coin. A serious project won't use those kind of name as a respect to the religion.",

I've seen a lot of them fly around me and dodged all. Most times I don't even get to know until the lids are open after some members would've registered and submitted their data to the websites and then they come crying in church. For whatsoever reason(s)  they always hide such happenings from caring eyes until they eventually get scammed is what eludes me.Investment should be without emotion, whatever brings emotion into it kills it.
