  "content": "Strange BankThe Only Bank Guarantees 10,000x ReturnWebsite: https://www.strangebank.org/App: https://app.strangebank.org/What is Strange Bank?In Strange Bank, we reward patience. Every month, you deposit amount of PAT that you choose. After 48 deposits, you can withdraw 480,000 times of the minimum deposit. For example, if you deposit 1 PAT every month for 48 months, thereafter, you can withdraw 480,000 PAT; that is 10,000 times of your total deposits.Wait, 10,000 times reward? Is it guaranteed?The reward is guaranteed by the smart contract. However, the reward is in terms of PAT. The price of PAT may change overtime. You may lose significant portion of your money even if you earn 10,000 times more PAT.Is PAT inflationary?Yes, PAT is inflationary. If everyone finishes 48 deposits, there will be 10,000 times more PAT in the market. Fortunately, very few PAT have been deposited, which means there will be no significant inflation when you finish deposits.What if I miss a deposit?Every 30 days, there will be a very short time window (48 hours) for your depositing. Specifically, you need to deposit after 29 days but before 31 days since your last depositing. If you miss a deposit, You will lose all your deposits. You need to reset your account to start over again. This feature is written in the smart contract and has no exception. If you plan to go to Mars and there is no web connection, You'd better not participate in the project. If many people do not finish deposits, the inflation will be further reduced (even negative!). Be careful, the countdown in app is only for reference. No one excepts the smart contract is responsible for your deposits.How are PAT tokens distributed?PAT tokens are generated only through clicking \"FREE PAT\" button in app. The first three clicks will generate 7 quintillion PAT tokens each click. The further clicks will generate 100 PAT tokens each click. PAT generation will be ended given one million clicks OR after March 31, 2024. Basically, you can generate as many PAT tokens as you need. Investing in PAT is not be advised.",

      "body": "You are correct that PAT has no value now because the contract was created three days ago. You are also correct PAT price may collapse due to huge inflation one day, which does not mean it cannot surge before its dying. Keep in mind, the first withdraw will happen 4 years later (48 deposits needed), so no huge inflation but only deflation (depositing) within the first four years.You call the project \"really strange and unique\". Thank you. This is exactly the value of the project.",
