But I was just curious if anyone has attempted to upgrade their device yet? Sounds like you just have to remove the case and simply replace your 1TB with a higher capacity SSD.",

Sounds like you just have to remove the case and simply replace your 1TB with a higher capacity SSD. If you bought or own 2 TB SDD then you can remove old one and insert the source drive into slot 1 and the target drive into slot 2.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07429D73L/?tag=ricksdailytips-20it may take some time and it is better to back-up it, if any errors happen.If you plan to buy then new laptop and add SSD to it.it will not effect your minning speed but power and boot time.",

      "body": "Thanks guys. The Umbrel Bitcoin Machine is my second node. I like the look of it. I got the 1TB so it's currently at 590GB. At some point, I will have to obviously replace the drive. Was just curious if anyone has done it yet. I still have a few years left. I do have another node that I run on a computer that will run for a very long time.",
