Common things offered by scammers since they always want those newbies to believe that they can earn easy money with cryptocurrency and also by investing with them which is totally not true since this is 100% scam, this is overused for so many decades so for sure newbies can find relevant information or feedback about this if they just research first before deciding to invest on any ponzi scheme platforms.",

Thank you for the well said advice and notification mate. Almost all of the techniques listed are used by scammers to set traps for cryptocurrency beginners in order to see if they can get them scammed.Beginners must be cautious and take their time learning everything there is to know about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency before they begin trading or investing, as scammers are just waiting for them to fall into their trap due to small mistakes made by beginners, and scammers will take advantage of the opportunity to scam them because they are waiting for any slice mistake to scam them.",

Well, if you think it more wisely, no investment that requires only small capital and gains a huge profit. That is very unlikely to be true since you’ll only gain maximum profits if you also place a maximum amount. If you fall for this, it’s a clear manifestation that you don’t understand what an investment is, and that you don’t even know your investment as well.
