With altcoins, there is nothing wrong with your advise because that is what most of the people who create these numerous altcoins do... they dump their altcoins, convert the money to stablecoins or Bitcoin and leave their investors with the bag of shitcoins. So anyone investing in altcoins should know that the main aim will be to sell as quickly as possible to avoid holding the bag of shitcoins. However, while I advice people to sell their altcoins as quickly as possible, I encourage people to hold Bitcoin for long because that is how to make better profit.",

That is why, if you want the rest of your mind in cryptocurrency, invest in Bitcoin and rest.",

It is good one sells their shitcoin to take profit as these shitcoin mostly have no utility value and at such it is always a target to dump on holders and this is mostly done by the developers when they see that the liquidity is high and would want to rug pull. At this point one needs to be very observant to sell when the price and liquidity is getting high and invest in Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a long time investment with a guarantee of return on investment while holding for a long time.",

In this forum for example, it is always talked about how unreliable altcoins are and why you should keep mostly bitcoins for long term reasons. If you must invest in an altcoin, take profit as soon as you can and move profit to purchase of more bitcoins for keeping instead of planning to keep keeping the altcoins you have. If you can channel the discipline you have for keeping altcoins and waiting for profit to keeping bitcoins, you will get more satisfaction in a longer run.",

Many people buy memecoins and some other coins with no use case to make money but they listen to influencers and keep holding after making huge profit to later end up at loss.It can be said that most cryptocurrencies (altcoins, memecoins) are indeed of very low quality. Because there have been many examples of investors who have experienced losses due to buying these altcoins or memecoins. So the opinion you explain is very correct. Because although altcoins or memecoins sometimes have very drastic price movements (pumps). However, the comparison with memecoins of poor quality can be likened to between 1 in 100, or maybe even 1 in 1000. Because as far as I know, altcoins/memecoins whose price movements are very good (pumping) are very rare.Apart from that, in my personal opinion, crypto assets that are worthy of long-term investment are those with a rating of 15 or below. Because at least the projects he works on are usually very clear and good. And for crypto influencers, they should not be completely trusted. Because they only get paid to advertise. So the point is, don't forget to always carry out independent analysis to avoid fraud or loss.",

Always remember that these Altcoins cannot continue to go up forever. Selling at profit will surely make you buy more at low price if you believe in the project. If you don't buy those projects you won't be bothered about what's happening to their price, memecoin are a complete waste of time. Just know that whenever you buy those memecoin you're taking a high risk that usually ends with you losing your money. Those projects are a complete gamble so unless you're not gambling don't buy them and think you're making investment. Memecoin are tools for pumping and dumping by whales and since you're a small investor (when comparing the amount of capital they're using to buy) you'll always end up at the end of the food chain as they use you to exit liquidity. Altcoins aren't meant to be held, you can trade some high market valued ones but do note, you're taking a risk doing so and only Invest in Bitcoin for hodling, if you're holding you won't be bothered about selling or taking profits. Hodling altcoins doesn't guarantee you'll make profit on the future as Bitcoin recovers, only Hodling Bitcoin does. QuoteAlso, selling is important in most cases because its same as taking profit which is risk management, brings peace of mind and lock you in gains..Selling at the right time also allow you to diversify your portfolio.While speaking about diversifying your portfolio, investing in altcoins isn't diversifying your portfolio as you're still investing in a market that has correlation. When Bitcoin increase in value or decreases it affects all other cryptocurency. They are rely on Bitcoin so you're not diversifying but throwaway your money as those projects might never recover when they get dump as Bitcoin experience a correction. Diversify outside of cryptocurrency ny Investing into other assets, that's proper risk management. You can also sell some of your Bitcoin to hold cash that can be reinvest when the market experiment a correction or use for other investment.",

Note : This isn't a financial advice but my own strong opinion according to my experience. I bet to disagree with you on the assumption that crypto is for long term and as far as i know the market does not have the ability to sustain for the long term and so any coin you are choosing as a chioce of investment aside Bitcoin mean you are just gambling with you investment and at that you may lose 100% of you invested amount along the line and also make further attempts that could lead you to more possible loses.If you buy and hold Bitcoin,  then you are safe from all the market volities but aside from that, we also have to pick a point on what memcoin coin we can speculate on a short-term basis and also a short-term basis which I doubt.",

These coins has a low of percentage of accumulating profits over a long period of time. Bitcoin on the other hand, will make you profits if you hold. I see people who buy altcoins as gamblers and just testing their luck because they too know very well that most projects will eventually fail and might end up loosing their money.It's essential for investors to not get swayed solely by influencers or short-term gains",

Memecoins are one of the worst of Altcoins to even hodl once the hype of it getting lunch and passes the only thing left is that the project developers will only be promising a huge pump during bull run while some can come through many die before that time. So whenever you buy any of this shitcoins and you start seeing them dropping do not expect a miraculous recovery again, take your funds off it. This is part of the reason why bitcoin is the only suitable coin worthy to be called an investment because it can be hold for long time Meme of Shitcoin investors waiting for bitcoin halving and a potential bull run to see maybe there shitcoin will pump",

Most of the memecoin project are so risky which you can't predict if it is good for investing, lot of people have lose  so much money all in the name of investing meme coin and this investment is something that was done with good amount of money. For me I think memecoin project should be something people don't need to take very serious by investing with good amount of money. To be in a safer side the best thing to do is to invest bitcoin  which is not risky like meme project that anything can happen and the investment will die off. For the peace of mind bitcoin is the best to consider for investment.",

Note : This isn't a financial advice but my own strong opinion according to my experience. OP I do agree with the perspective to are talking about, but I think most of the people here are the long-term accumulators except for those who are entering new, so for that particular category I don't think selling really matters because in their case the longer run accumulation not the profit booking on the time, even they can adjust their average accumulation by selling and a point and than re-entering the market on lower price, mostly they prefer safe play with DCA.I'm a person who prefers the strategy adoption according to the market sentiments, I do believe in DCA but I consider myself multi strategies, accumulator a constant accumulation + extra accoridn to the market moves. Taking risks rewards more that's a fact. Adopting the hybrid strategies opens a wider range to play on the field but being specific limits the risk and rewards as well, The DCA is good for the newbies for those who have tasted flavors of the market before their own strategy will work more effectively.Quote from: BitcoinBarrel on October 11, 2023, 04:27:56 PMPeople always say they are \"HODLers\" until they lose 50% net worth over night.It will spice up things if you consider the Bitcoin valuation scale rather than the shity fiat money with terrible inflation + unlimited supply and so on...",

Always remember that these Altcoins cannot continue to go up forever. Selling at profit will surely make you buy more at low price if you believe in the project. It's because they're greedy and they don't want to recognize that moment that they've already made money from holding those meme coins and other coins that don't really have a use case at all. Instead, they have to secure that profit, they're incurring losses instead and it's a mistake that they'll eventually learn a big lesson. But by the time that they have learned the lesson, it's gonna make them go back to that coin, it's not what they're expecting because the move of that coin's market won't be the same anymore.

But the problem starts with being greedy there are these what-if moments to each and every one of us that stop us from selling in good profits. Those what if times that, what if it keeps going high and what not but then, you see that there's no sense in holding anymore because you're just losing it and you've just missed the entire run because of your greediness. And when you're not aligned anymore with the goal that you have set, you need to remember that you've been there in the first place to make money instead of holding forever.",
