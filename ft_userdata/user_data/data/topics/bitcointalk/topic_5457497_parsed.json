I don't believe that someone on this forum will call this forum a social media platforms, well you are just a newhie, your rank can tell that. Don't you know that these forum is not a social media platform, why? Because these forum is not for fun, it's a place of learning, people do come here to learn about things they don't know and people do come here to share things they know to others who don't know, by the way since you are here to learn you will observe that this forum is not for fun.",

But mind you, observing every steps of most successful colleague might not go well with some people. Your path is not mine and everyone has a specialty. First of all, you must study yourself to know what work for you and then you're ready for the challenges ahead.You actually did your best but I must still urge you as well to improve yourself of what you are advising others to do. Proofread your post before tapping post. The emboldened (italics) statement from your post shows that you know how properly arranged spelling and grammar make the communication easier for the readers and listeners but unfortunately some parts of your lacks clarity. Just like you said in your last line.... Learning is a continuous process and we are all learning after all.",

According to his assessment, even the description of social media does not correspond to forum activities; in social media, you learn, but not as thoroughly as in the forum. I believe you should address the forum as one of the most extensive learning venues. You mentioned that learning is a continuous process, and I must say that I learnt something from this post; no one knows everything, and we learn new things every day. Learning in a forum is a wonderful concept since you are not limited to one person or one textbook, but rather to many people with diverse perspectives and approaches to your subject. The benefit of all is that you will understand by going through the numerous answers with varied explanations.",

Try to understand the forum for real, you will feel at home here when you have clear goals.I agree, Bitcointalk is not social media.However, if you think that social media (such as Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok for example) are not moderated, you're wrong. There are terms of use that every user agrees to, and moderation of these networks is based on these TnCs. They may be badly moderated, but they're still moderated.",

Speaking about reading, we must read and apply understanding before we post on any thread on this forum, with the use of English language like arranging it properly while making a post, you must agree with me that mistakes are also made while making a post in as much as we try to arrange the English in a proper way to make it look sweet, to me that's why we're human, we make mistakes. And this is the reason why some users engage in using AI on their post, which is not supported on this Forum.",
