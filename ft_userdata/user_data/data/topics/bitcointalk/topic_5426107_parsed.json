  "content": "Looking for someone that is good at statistics/math in order to prove something.We have a new policy at my work that will actually cost my company more money in the long run, and I am not good enough at math to prove it to my boss. So I am looking to hire someone that is good enough at math that can prove it with numbers that the new policy actually costs us money. I could be wrong, but I don't think I am based upon my rough math but my rough math isn't good enough to prove it to my boss I need exact numbersIts hard to explain over text, so I am looking to hire someone that understands verbal english well enough for me to explain the problem to them over voice, Its a permutation and combination problem I believe.Please PM me with a way to contact you with a way I can contact you via voice and I will explain the problem in more detail and you can let me know how much BTC you want  Edit. I think you need to be fluentish because of the complexity of the problem",
