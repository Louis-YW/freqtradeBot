Just enter those words in another wallet (i recommend electrum.org wallet).If you don't have the words, then just go to https://login.blockchain.com/#/login?product=walletInsert your wallet ID or e-mailthen, they will ask you to verify the device (they will send you an email Â with a link).After the device has been verified, click \"I need help\" and then click \"forgot password\"",

This is because we don't have access to your wallet or your wallet password.If you are getting the error message \"Error decrypting wallet\" when attempting to log in, then this means the password you're using is incorrect.If you find yourself in this situation, we recommend trying two solutions: Try to log in using every possible password combination you may have used.Use your 12-word Secret Wallet Recovery Phrase (also known as a seed phrase).https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/4555924189212-What-do-I-do-if-I-forgot-my-password-That might not be possible without having your password.But very possible brute forcing the password can help, like I have seen NotATether posted about this before.",

I tried to access my old wallet(2016) with the correct wallet ID, I have notes where my password is saved and use it. After trying to login in blockchain they email me for authorization and I click it but still, the result shows an incorrect password after I authorize the login. So I think he can only able to recover this wallet by contacting support or if he still has the wallet.aes.json file.Quote from: BitcoinSoloMiner on May 19, 2022, 07:20:20 AMI've gone with Dave from wrs to attempt to recover the walletI hope they can help you recover your wallet and hope that you can update here if you successfully recover it because I also want to recover my old wallet from blockchain.",

I just finished testing it with my old wallet from 2015 and I didn't face any problems... The only way for me to reproduce your issue is to type the wrong password.- Perhaps you changed your password and forgot to update your notes or it's just a simple case of figuring out the uppercase letters [it's case-sensitive].",
