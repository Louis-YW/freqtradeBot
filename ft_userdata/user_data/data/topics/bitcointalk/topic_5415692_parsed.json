The problem doesn't lie on privacy techniques, but on users who are confident with accepting arbitrary rules to pass from entities that don't want their good, and that rely on irrational mechanisms such as blacklisting every coin that comes from a mixer. And we should fight for privacy protection, of course. The Lightning Network is a significant on-going update for those who value privacy.",

The bank will still investigate the large funds that are credited to check who the account selector is. As bank users, we can't do anything, that's their authority and it's written on the term and condition sheet that we signed. Banks have the right to investigate all kinds of transactions made. Privacy becomes something they can treat as they please, some of them even sell our personal data to several insurance companies and others. Bitcoin remains the best privacy, no matter how many privacy transactions are carried out, it will still be safe, as long as it is not published.",

      "body": "here is the thing people are not realisingback when bitcoin was just 'property' in 2009-13. we had good privacy. because bitcoin had property rights(strong protected rights).. however when bitcoin became government recognised as \"currency\" property rights of privacy, changed to privacy rights of currency.. these rights are different. under currency the privacy rights are part of the bank secrecy act. no longer the property rights to privacymeaning the protections of privacy got weakerand under the bank secrecy act. financial businesses have the right to monitor their customers use of funds and report suspicious activity to government. especially of their value is being used in ways that its trying to hide its use.. such as mixers, tumblers and launderingyep before 2013 bitcoin was treated like collectables(pokemon cards, antiques). where sales and payments and custody did not need to be monitored.if bitcoin transitioned over to a monero algo. what will happen is that the financial services like banks and exchanges that are regulated would simply not be able to manage/handle bitcoin.. much like you dont see monero on those regulated exchangesnow here is the thing. bitcoin does not and never has asked for your birth certified identity.. you will not find a bitcoin transaction that displays who you are or what you boughtall the information that businesses get, and share and pass to governments.. is due to users passing their ID to businesses/services.so it doesnt matter what algo bitcoin has.. the problem is the services at the edges of the network that then share information between themselvesbitcoin is not the problem its the services. and the regulations they have to follow due to the jurisdictional gains that politics has managed to get by defining bitcoin first as a currency.. then as a asset currency and lately as a commodity currency. slowly getting more and more involved in bitcoins jurisdictionwhich these political definitions of bitcoin then affect how businesses and services handling bitcoin on behalf of users then has to handle the usersyep under asset.. (SEC jurisdiction) the sec could not do anything about the environment causes of mining.. but under commodity(CFTC) allows a gateway for the EPA to get involved in mining. changing bitcoins algo to monero may cause regulated exchanges to stop servicing bitcoin. and changing the mining algo to PoS may stop the CFTC from punishing bitcoin.. but the only place to stop governments from receiving names of people and what they bought. wont be solved by any algo change.. it would only stop if people stop buying/selling things to other people that require names/home locationsbecause bitcoin(the protocol) does not have privacy issues.. its the services that ask for personal info thats the problemthe ultimate solution is not to mess with the algo yo avoid utility its actually to change the definition of bitcoin back to being a tradable property instead of a currencythere are some idiots in this forum that want to brutilise bitcoin saying its not fit for purpose just to hinder bitcoin utility while they advertise their other networks as the go to place people should use instead. they want to limit bitcoin utility. they want to change bitcoin to be less useful and less trusted. lets not play into that game. lets instead recognise where the real problems are and solve them",

Unbreakable privacy..The thing is most people actually don't care about their privacy. They say they have \"nothing to hide\". With this mindset, we can never expect governments to give up on their task to destroy privacy for good. Bitcoin by itself may not be private, but there are tools you can use to help make your transactions private. For instance, you can use a non-custodial mixer to obfuscate your utmost sensitive transactions, or simply convert your BTC to a privacy coin like Monero or Zcash.Some would say using a new BTC address for each transaction is the perfect measure to help protect your privacy. The problem here is that you're stuck with centralized exchanges which force you to provide your personally-identifiable information. Decentralized exchanges exist, but they have low trading volume/liquidity compared to their centralized counterparts. Not to mention, they're not as easy to use as you think they are. With the introduction of CBDCs, governments will become more invasive than ever. It'll be up to crypto advocates to help defend privacy for the sake of our liberty and freedom. Just my thoughts",
