  "content": "NO, I’m not a scammer. Let me explain:I’ve lost a ton of money in crypto this year, due in part to crypto crash, but also because I was deeply invested in Luna, Ust, and subproducts. I think these losses might be interesting for people who earned money this year, or plan on earning it next years. They might be interested in reducing profits and avoiding paying taxes on them by just declaring these losses as well.The idea is simple: private wallets don’t identify you for tax purposes, so it’s easy to prove that a wallet is “yours” if you have access to it. So I would just sell access to some wallets which have had loses this year, which you can check on the blockchain. I have wallets with losses of all sizes, so losses can be adapted to the client. Here is an image with all of my wallets, in USD: https://gyazo.com/c4e9707ef4ce235e51becd5162554382I’m not doing any tax statement myself this year, since I’m a digital nomad and live travelling.I can let you know the addresses in private. In order to do the selling safely, we can do it throw a reputable person that both parties agree on, who could act as an escrow.If you need any clarification, just send me a DM. To be honest, I’m surprised I haven’t found these kind of sellings on the forum.",

I don't know if that is clear enough, not just that you have a record of those transactions but it was YOU who made them. Here is more on how cryptocurrency is taxed in the U.S. - https://www.moneyknack.com/post/44/crypto-taxesThat's regarding taxes. But be aware of a common scam which this may be a variation of.In this type of scam, fraudsters claim to have a wallet with a large amount of cryptocurrency that they are unable to access or use, and they offer to give the wallet to someone else who can use it. When the unsuspecting victim adds their own funds to the wallet (to pay for gas fees for example to withdraw other tokens), they are actually sending their money to the scammer, who then drains the wallet using bots or other automated means.",

How are you found out since, its mainly private and anonymous. The numbers on the wallet isn't alarming to raise any need for a declaration or call for alarm. Of what purpose does it become then.I wouldn't engaged in any buying and selling of wallets though. It just doesn't feel like a right thing to do for me.",

Meanwhile op here has no plans on paying taxes hence wanted to sell the wallet access and not the tokens. As pointed by the posts above, there are things that could likely land you in trouble for this.or perhaps you were talking about the escrow? well, i guess if op is willing to go first, they could deal without one.",

Also, for anyone that would want to purchase an already used wallet by another person is taking a stupid risk of losing any penny you might wanna put into such wallet after buying it and claiming ownership. As the ownership is now a dual one and prone to scam activity from the selling end.

State does not provide any help for helping crypto guys, they try to ban them from everywhere and when it comes to profit they impose heavy taxes. Do you think it is fair?",
