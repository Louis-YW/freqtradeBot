  "content": "Hi Everyone!Wanted to do a quick intro about our platform.INTROGXG is a DeFi Gaming platform and comprises of 2 sites, GXGBet.com, our fully licensed crypto gaming site, and GXGCoin.io our defi site which allows staking and yield farming of our native GXG Token based on the BSC network.I’d like to think we are leading the way in creating a more inclusive gaming ecosystem and bringing something fresh and unique. Online players of our site earn GXG Tokens every time they play, irrespective of the gaming outcome, which can be withdrawn at anytime without the need to wager. By tokenizing our company and distributing 65% of gaming net profits to GXG Token holders, all our players are effectively shareholders of the casino.As shareholders, players can benefit not only from the entertainment value that comes with online gaming, but also reap up to 450% APY for staking and yield farming on our defi site. Since we will use 65% of net income to repurchase and inject GXG Tokens directly back into the mining pool in real-time, holders have the option to generate increased revenue or cash out our highly liquid GXG tokens at anytime.CASINOOur gaming platform offers over 200 industry-leading providers like Evolution Gaming, NetEnt, BetSoft, QuickSpin & Microgaming.Features;-   Sports betting | Live Casino | Table Games | Video Slots and more…-   Provably fair-   24/7/365 live chat support-   VIP loyalty program with multiplier for token earningsPAYMENTSWe currently accept:BTCBCHDOGEETHLTCTRXUSDTTetherMore options will be added in the near future.

      "body": "Hope everyone is doing well!Just wanted to quickly announce GXGBet.com's FIRST ever signature campaign being launched here (or on any forum for that matter) which I'm really excited about. You can view the details here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403778.0. Only 15 slots available and we're going to run it for a week first as we just wanted to see how it will be received. I plan to fund the escrow shortly so please ignore the part in the thread which states \"Payments will be directly processed by GXGBet\" as I've just realised this can be a sticking point for some members. Thanks everyone for making us feel so welcomed here in this forum and to our signature campaign manager Gianluca95 for his hard work in organising everything! Looking forward to a very long and fruitful relationship with all the community members here.",

This is a major turn off on most of the users here in the forum. Maybe you reconsider excluding forum user so that you can get players from here. Lastly, The casino is very slow to load because the homepage when going directly on the link was displaying all your provider's logos which makes the loading very slow. Maybe you should improve that but the casino itself is neat and good.",

I hope that's not a violation of some sort. Thanks again for your comments. With regards to the KYC concerns for the GXGBet.com site, I have spoken to management and I believe waiving this for all forum members here is not going to be an issue. Let me know if you run into any KYC problems and I will work something our for sure.I do have another slight issue, I'm not sure if its ok to post here. I tried posting the image using my brand spanking NEW Copper status, but got \"bitcointalk.org image proxy: Invalid image\" error. Any ideas? I did check the image link and it did load in a browser for me.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Does both site need KYC or not?. Since you said that one if it is licensed and the other one is not so, does the licensed one have list of restricted countries? Sharing the list would be helpful if there are countries that is restricted to gamble on your site. I visited the licensed gambling site and it seems my country is restricted to access it.Quote from: GXGBet on June 15, 2022, 09:46:54 AMI do have another slight issue, I'm not sure if its ok to post here.

If you subscribe to a bonus when depositing on GXGBet.com, there is a requirement to wager a certain multiple depending on the bonus subscribed to. This can be anywhere from 1x upwards. The conditions are written on the bonus being subscribed (but may not be prominent enough as you need to click the 'i' button for details). Your dashboard should show the progress of the wagering amount remaining. Once that condition is fulfilled you should be able to withdraw the amount. If you continue to have issues, please contact support@gxgbet.com with your username and a screenshot of your dashboard or hit up our 24 hour live chat on the site. Thanks again for your taking the time to try out our site and really look forward to your continued support!",
