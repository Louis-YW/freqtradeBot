      "body": "There are many prospective games that have been started in the past two years.  I see a growing interest in Metaverse because Blockchain will be used more and more in the gaming industry. GameFi Projects There are many interesting features that no other games have.  In my opinion, if the team is committed to creating the game, do not need to worry about an investment in this.  I think that this is a token in which it would be worth investing.",

I guess if you are linked or probably owned by the same guy who used an account in another thread to post about metakiller. Metakiller was a bad project and so investing in that site was a big mistake.",

      "body": "First of all, don't think \"get rich quickly\" that's so wrong and you might end up rekt because of too many expectations. Second, where are you in their target audience? A gamer? An investor who will maximize the profits in the pool? You said the game and interesting and likewise about their staking options. Would you do both? It looks good but just a warning, there is no 100 percent assurance in this type of NFT game. Lastly, if you are a player they will need a certain amount to enter other features of the game which I think is where the profits will come from. Page 24. Same type as other NFT games, pyramid.If ever it will be a success, ROI as quickly as you can then just enjoy the game. It's not a make me rich game.",

Metakiller was a bad project and so investing in that site was a big mistake.  Honestly, promoting the project in this way is actually killing their project more than it does any good. I won't talk about the success of the project but if this is a serious project, they should create a separate thread about the project and ask people to rate the project instead of making shady chants like so.",

Your opinion is very valid, also if you take into account it would protect your money, however in this case I always look for the safest thing, it should be noted that I was one of the people who supported the NFT due to the enormous boom that there was, but since the internal economies became mostly pure pyramid schemes, I would only recommend Axie Infinity as a safe game and that because it is in the hands of a part in Binance and because this already guarantees that it will not become a ponzi scheme, it is the reputation of an exchange, and another that I recommend is those NFTs that are developed in recognized casinos.",

The market is in a difficult period, investing in new projects is not recommended, not only unprofitable but also causing participants to lose all their invested money. The P2E trend is slowing down and is gradually being replaced by new trends. The future of P2E can't be confirmed, but looking at the leading project axie infinity also faces many difficulties. So it would be unwise to invest in a game project right now.",

But investing is really a big risky type of business wherein the result could not be easily attain on our desire.There are plenty of crypto projects and swarming on that could also make us confuse. Why not settle for less mistake and choice smaller groups like top 10 projects top 20 or 50 at least. In that way, you could at leadt lower your risk compared to new projects like the one youve posted.",
