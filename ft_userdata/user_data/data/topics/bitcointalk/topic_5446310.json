The difficulty changes roughly every two weeks, and is a measure of how much computing power is required for mining bitcoin blocks to be rewarded with Bitcoins.ðŸ”— https://forkast.news/headlines/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-rises-7-6-to-set-new-all-time-high-as-hashrate-jumps/\"Everyone has their own opinion about this.\"",

Bitcoin's price as represented by its market capitalization and exchange rate has generally trended upwards since its inception in 2009with occasional drops and corrections along the way. This is due to a variety of factors, including increasing adoption and awareness of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class limited supplyÂ and demand from investors and traders.Howeve it is important to note that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, and the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and subject to sudden changes in sentiment and market conditions. Therefore, it is important for investors to exercise caution and do their own research before making any investment decisions..",

This is direct plagiarism. And in my opinion this should also be an offense that can lead to a permanent ban. Haven't we had cases where members have been banned so far for using AI generated texts?It sucks discussing with such lazy people to be honest.",
