It looks like we're near a pivotal resistance around the 20500-21000 region too (with a channel that's dropping fairly slowly). Yes 18,800 is candle close at around 19th September, but could it wick down to 17,500 where it had its low on 13th June? Before we shoot up to 30,000?That double bottom is strong and prominent on the daily and weekly, also fear and greed is around 25 (extreme fear).",

The fed is looking to higher unemployment as a way to tackle inflation. So we are looking for jobs to be lower and inflation to be negative in the MoM change. If this happens Bitcoin should break the $25k area.However if the opposite happens then most likely itâ€™ll break the $18K because it means higher rate hikes which is what the market doesnâ€™t want.",
