  "content": "Hi all,I am interested in knowing everyone's plans & expectations for the remainder of this year and 2023?Are we expecting these low prices for the next 6, 12 or even 18 months? I first started crypto in February this year so I have yet to experience any profit, I have just bought and plan on holding until the next bull run. I have been accumulating over the last 6 months and if I have to just hold till 2024 so be it - it will be here before we know it. What is your plan & expectations?",

And some remaining few % will be trolls with answers that don't worth reading.My hopes and expectations are that current bear market ends before 2023 starts. As simple as that.",

Oh, but I don't deny that! My point on this matter was that price topics belong to Speculation.Quote from: Jazzi Mahesh on September 02, 2022, 07:18:43 AMCrypto investors expect bitcoin to rally to around $38,000 by early 2023, according to a survey of roughly 4,400 Americans by intelligence firm Morning Consult.Yet OP question was what you expect and you didn't answer to that",

You may have to wait until late 2025 to see the real peak of the next bull run. Historically that’s the way it’s always worked, in four year phases. You are doing well to keep accumulating though, it’s a great habit to get into & over the long term is a true recipe for success.Look at cryptocurrency as a long term plan, a pension type situation, something to get you out of the mundane 9-5 stuff.Patience, patience, patience, you will do well. Try not to keep checking your portfolio prices every day, it’s unhealthy. Stick to your plan & you’ll make bank before 2026.",

Last year we only saw the Crypto market going down. The market is constantly just dumping. I have seen many people who have expressed a lot of despair about the Crypto market and have given up hope that the market will never return to normal. But by the beginning of 2023, the market has started to normalize.  Currently, the value of other digital currencies including Bitcoin has increased a lot. So I hope the year 2023 brings blessings for the market. And many will benefit by investing this year.",
