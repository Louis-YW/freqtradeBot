  "content": "What happened:Avalar is a scam investment project that offers unreasonable high profits. Also, instead of a Telegram group (where you can see the opinions of all investors), you can find only one Telegram ID. By looking at the plans of this project, you can understand that this is an unreasonable profit to attract investors: (~4.333% hourly for 24 hours (deposit included), 120% after 1 day, 200% after 7 days). Please pay attention to this part: Quote from: https://avalar.vip/about/ They created a unique robot that generates daily profit and predicts the stages of bitcoin.  It's like a joke. Also, I have found a site with a similar design that has been launched for only a day and is probably going to scam (In that case, I will update this post). https://amr-invest.com/Reference Link:https://avalar.vip/?lng=enTechnical info:Registration date: 12 Aug 2022 (6 days and 6 hours ago)Expiration date:    12 Aug 2023 (in 11 months and 24 days)Hosted by:   Ddos-Guard Ltd.Server location: Russian Federation (185.178.208.180)Payment Method:BitcoinArchive:https://archive.ph/gJyPqQuote More information:Domain: avalar.vipInstant messaging: Telegram (https://t.me/avalarvip)Alexa Rank: 2,623,448Registrant Address: Ledenweg 7, Radebeul, 01067, GermanyRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +880.1913949283",

As a result, scammers fail to attract them. But you will find many crypto users who look for such opportunities in hopes of quick profits. The current market conditions are not good which may lead to those new crypto users wanting to step into these traps to recover their losses. In bear markets, the number of such ponzi websites increases, because at this time they get more victims.",
