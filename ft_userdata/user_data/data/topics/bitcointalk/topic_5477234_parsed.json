  "content": "Hello I've been struggling with an issue all day and need some assistance.I transferred funds from Coinbase to my account, but noticed Coinbase uses several unconfirmed hashes (Parent) for the transaction. Receiving this through Electrum, I attempted a CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) but the transaction fee was too low for its large size, about 85 KvB.When trying to increase the fee in the new hash (setting it to 20,000 sats for 110 vBytes), I encountered an error upon signing and broadcasting: 'The server returned an error when broadcasting the transaction. Consider trying another server or update Electrum. Fees exceed maximum configured by user.'I was able to set 10,000 satEven attempting to sign the transaction and broadcast it manually on different servers resulted in the same error: 'Code: -25 Error: Fees exceed maximum configured by user' (referring to settings like -Maxtxfee, Maxfeerate).Can anyone provide a solution to this? Your help would be greatly appreciated.Regards,",

Receiving this through Electrum, I attempted a CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) but the transaction fee was too low for its large size, about 85 KvB.If the total transaction tree is 85,000 vbytes, adding 20k sats CPFP only adds less than 0.25vbytes/sat. That's less than 1% of the current minimum fee.QuoteWhen trying to increase the fee in the new hash (setting it to 20,000 sats for 110 vBytes)It may be 110 sat/vbyte for your transaction, but if you want it for the 85,000 vbytes, you'll need to pay 0.093BTC in fees. In short: there's no point using CPFP for a transaction with that many unconfirmed parents. Complain to Coinbase, or wait for fees to drop (and nobody can tell you if that's going to happen any time soon).",

Both of these values are far below the DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE and HIGH_TX_FEE_PER_KB settings in Bitcoin Core (which are 0.1 BTC or 1,000 sats/vbyte, respectively).If you are getting the same error on multiple servers, then the problem is with your transaction. I also suspect you have maybe set the fee to 20,000 sats/vbyte rather than 20,000 sats overall (which as LoyceV has pointed out, will achieve nothing anyway).",

Here are some broadcasting tools. coinb.inViaBTCblockstreamThe other solution is that you make a new CPFP transaction instead of bumping the fee of the previous one. Note that in this way, you will add another unconfirmed transaction to your wallet. To do so, you need to make the new CPFP transaction manually with spending the fund from bc1qkxy......... to one of your own addresses. If you make this transaction with the fee rate of 10,000 sat/vbyte, it would have the same effect as bumping the fee rate of your CPFP transaction to 20,000 sat/vbyte and it would increase the effective fee rate of your transaction to 35.5 sat/vbyte which is still insufficient for getting fast confirmation. Take note that you have already spent $480 worth of bitcoin for doing CPFP and you will spend another $480 worth of bitcoin for making another CPFP transaction or increasing the fee rate of your current CPFP transaction. Also note that you may need to use coin control, if you have other funds in your wallet and you want to make a new CPFP transaction manually.",
