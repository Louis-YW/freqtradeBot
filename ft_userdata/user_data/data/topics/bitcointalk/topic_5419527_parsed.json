'coz I think those are not updated or something? Also you have mentioned about statistics, I think I'd be more convinced once you have posted it in this thread to support what you are trying to promote by this topic. But I'll also ask my friends about their take on your predictions. Will do my part as well to check on some of their games to gain more insight of how this field of sportsbetting work, I guess.",

This means that I still get out with some profit as I hit 60% of the tips proposed. I guess these are awful results as I was planning to hit at least 7 of the 10 Tips. Even so, I have managed to get out and still see an increase in my BankrollSimple Math:10 Tips6 - Tips won 4 - Tips Lost Winning rate of 60%",

It will be useless to have 6 wins out of 10 but the odds for the 6 correct picks were just low. Simple example, his 6 win bets were with odds 1.5 and lets say he place all bets with same stake ($1). It means that he spent $10 and his return was 1.5*6 = $9, so mathematically he lost $1 from the 10 bets. In this situation, his winning rate is negative.",

Let's hope next week I can improve my results.you have to start posting the games you are making predictions along with the odds, only then will it be possible to know if you are making a profit. because out of 10 bets, if all 10 bets have odds of @1.10 if you hit 6 bets you won't be making a profit, even if you say you were 60% correct, in sports betting when the person makes game bets with odds of @1.50 or less in the long run will not be profitable, I realized that making single bets hardly become profitable in the long run, making multiple bets gives more profit, I know the risk is greater but when a person manages to hit a multiple bet that contains many games the person they get a bigger profit that it takes time for the person to lose all the bankroll if he has good management and in the long run it becomes very profitable, but to do that the person needs to dominate the games he bets on",
