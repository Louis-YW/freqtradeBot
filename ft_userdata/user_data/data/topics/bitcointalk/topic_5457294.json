Only those people willing to make quick money will just venture into Bitcoin investment and be eager to make profit.",

There are lots of ways to obtain BTC, even without buying it.I understand the idea of your post OP, but I don't think that having money prevents people from doing their research before investing.When you have a lot of money, you don't want to lose it foolishly. When you have little money, you don't want to lose it either. I think it's more a question of personality, maturity and patience than financial possibilities if you look at people's buying behaviour.",

But at the other hand few days back i read a topic, took me few time to find, whose idea and POV is totally different then ops. Without money, the knowledge is a wasteQuote from: Obari on June 16, 2023, 07:30:19 PMYes! you got the topic very correct and I do mean it because after my last thread, I was actually wondering  the essences of having all the knowledge  about bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large and still don't have the money to buy, I just feel its a waste of effort and such a person  with all his knowledge  will definitely miss out of the opportunities in bitcoin and I'm  on the opinion  that people still need to always have some form of money at all time to buy bitcoin especially  at every instance a dip arises and I want to know the essence of wanting to crowd ones brain Brain with so much about bitcoin  when such a person doesn't have any more to buy rather than seeking ways to buy?Well, i have shared my opinion on the obari's post and i will share mine here too. That i totally agree with you too but also to some extent only. Because as obari said money is also necassary and without money what value our knowledge has, so in the reply i shared we could earn money by sharing our knowledge about crypto just like i am doin as a crypto content writer.Point is, existence of both is necassary but knowledge is most necessary because without knowledge you can not stay longer.",

      "body": "It’s not entirely correct. The people without money actually study hard to get grasp of the thing so that they could offer services on it to raise money and most of them are usually employed by the rich folks to help them invest this is a general principle to all investments. But I tell you not all the rich folks that do that. There some that actually go to read all about it before diving into it. In fact I would say those that do not have money or say little money are the ones that make mistakes in investing into either bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large. This is because they are eager to make lots of profits from it and therefore they rely on charts signals by influencers on social media claiming on how the crypto space could get them rich easily. As for the one with money, he is very skeptical into going into just anything that could actually Would result into him getting into loss. Quote from: Faisal2202 on June 23, 2023, 10:35:33 AMPoint is, existence of both is necassary but knowledge is most necessary because without knowledge you can not stay longer.Also without experience on it you can’t equally test your knowledge, because knowledge with having that experience is just a shallow understanding of the subject matter. So both should be equally balanced",

I guess for the majority of us who discovered this community and started to join bitcoin paying signature campaigns then I will say that we are very lucky because we don't need money to begin with. From the campaigns we have, we learn how to save some and then re-invest it to something or do some trading or venture into maybe some altcoins.But those who have the capital to begin with, it's easy for them. However, bitcoin investment is not a sprint, it's a marathon. So the longer we stay and continue to accumulate the better for us. And with that, we don't need to compare ourselves to some big whales, at the end of the day it's how we invest and not be affected by others.",

Well, yeah people who don't have money to invest in bitcoin may have double or tripled their effort to study more about cryptocurrency in general so they can use their knowledge to generate income in crypto related field and so they could invest those money they have earned. I've seen people offering some services in crypto trading, they offer basic and advance fundamentals of how to predict prices . That's one way of earning and at the same time enhancing your learning.",

Saying that you need to study Bitcoin for the future someone who has no money upsets him even more. Since he will begin to understand that the current price of Bitcoin if he bought it right away, was more profitable than after he learned everything about it,Everything must go together. Sometimes we meet hurried people who rush to invest their money, and this is an indicator of greed. The one who earns steadily knows how to manage money, and it is these people who get the best profit, as they consciously put in a lot of money, which ultimately leads to capital gains.",

There are people who cannot afford long hours just to earn bitcoin so they usually use their own money to earn profits in return.But there are people who doesn't have any money to use so most of the time they exert more efforts to gain bitcoins by working multiple jobs they can get on any platform they are. So you cannot say about its good not to have money to invest since its still depends on situation we are facing on.",

After getting money from salary, they might be in hurry with investment and can change from investment to trading. If they end with Leverage or Futures tradings, no happy result and ending for them.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

I agree with you that this is just about people wanting to learn and not.Referring to the 2 conditions described by the OP, i think it's better not to have money first before actually investing in bitcoin. Try to imagine, if you have the money to invest in bitcoin (without knowing anything there), but at the same time the bitcoin hype is at its peak, do you have time to do more research? of course you will be afraid to miss the hype. So, i really agree with the important point stated by the OP that it is actually better not to have money first, so that we are not in a hurry and have a lot of free time to learn about bitcoin itself.",

The point is that investment behavior is based on elements of knowing them and then coming to specific experiences, to give us desires and goals. Just like a story that reminds me of buddhist monks, they don't know about bitcoin but they have a life and wisdom that is superior to the majority, but if we haven't lived like that, the Life operates like a game with all sorts of pitfalls that arise when given the opportunity to choose whether to participate or refuse is already a decision that has a lot to say.",

I don't really agree with what you said, because it will be quite difficult for someone to be able to profit from the crypto market using knowledge alone, experience and money are also needed. Moreover, the crypto market is quite difficult to learn, due to volatility and various other factors. knowledge alone will not be enough to be able to face this market, that's why it's important for someone to be able to prepare their capital to invest in bitcoin, it doesn't need to be too big, someone can just start investing with small capital.so in my opinion between knowledge and money on Bitcoin investment is important. these things must be balanced, so that someone can achieve consistent profit from Bitcoin investment.",
