He will be trending on the news, social media, TV and everyone all over the globe will have his name in their mouth and in their thoughts, as he is the most entertaining and popular president (candidate) of the world.This does not mean that we won‚Äôt benefit from short term action.In fact, more people will look for Trump related tokens as the market is stabilising more and more, as Trump is gaining more relevance and popularity.Why am I so certain about our success?Everyone here knows that I do not like mentioning other crypto currency project‚Äôs, so let‚Äôs not do this again‚Ä¶ üòÅIn 2021 Elon Musk posted a Tweet saying that he‚Äôd buy a dog called Floki.Remember what happened after?@RealFlokiInu pumped to an All Time High of around 5 billion market cap after that happened just because they were the biggest and most known project in the space with a Floki related name.#TrumpCoin is the biggest and most known project in the space with a Trump related name as well.This means that your investment in TrumpCoin is very likely to pump after Trump gains more attention in the world.Why would you invest now?TrumpCoin is not just waiting for luck or miracles to happen. We are creating our own legacy with the help of our own initiatives.If you remember the very first days of our launch when many other projects tried to copy us, you‚Äôll notice that they‚Äôre ALL dead by now.None of them survived due to them not being as original and dedicated as us.We‚Äôre persistent, hard working, transparent and backed by some BIG whales.Why do you think Venture Capitals approached us in the first place?They know that once #Trump gains more popularity ALL Crypto investors will look for a ‚ÄúTrumpCoin‚Äù so why wouldn‚Äôt they invest in the one and only TrumpCoin!!!Let this sink in‚Ä¶",

Last I checked, Trump never stated any plans of issuing any memecoins. This is fake, bruv. Get something useful to do and stop flooding the forum with useless threads about unreal stuff.",

This is common in the crypto space, anything that can be copied based on its popularity, they'll take it part of the project's name. Thus with the upcoming presidential election again coming to the US, they think it will be Trump back in the office as the POTUS. We have those inu name of meme coins and etc. And at the same time, this has nothing to do with politics and society so this shouldn't be here but in the altcoin discussion.",

Ya, I‚Äôm sure there are hundreds of trump coins out there. These can be fun little projects to mess around with and see what you can turn them into, but they should be marketed as such. That was what was great about dogecoin. If it had been marketed as a serious currency then I doubt anyone would have wanted to be involved since it obviously was not.",

Yeah, I think I've seen a few of them with the same name or this is the one that I've seen before. Well, at the beginning they're not really serious at all so there's no need to dig deep with these. Dogecoin was different and I guess on this market, whoever gets first always gets the advantage just as Doge for meme, ETH for alts and then Bitcoin for the entirety. But with these newly made projects, they've got no objectives at all.",
