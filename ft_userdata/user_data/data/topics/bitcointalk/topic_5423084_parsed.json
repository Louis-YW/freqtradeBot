Common, that board has far more problems than one which could have been easily solved by asking directly the question, not going through really confusing details, you basically locked the topic with the message that would have been the first.",

After all like you said, you'd have to wager the deposits and you might not be so lucky to keep your balance intact once the losses start kicking in.If you wanna take advantage of the markets, keep the coins in a cold/ hardware wallet.

I admit many of the post is still constructive on different topic. I’m not saying they are shitpost rather they are just pushing a quality post even its out of the topic. Let’s say most of the suggestions are suitable for safety precautions.It's often difficult to get relevant answers to questions that don't have a clearly defined structure. It is obvious that there is also a language barrier, so in the future try to be more direct and specific in your questions, and also try to use simple language. This will help you get better results.If you ask a question in a way that doesn't make sense, then you're going to get an answer that doesn't make sense.  If you feel that a reply to your post is off-topic, it's okay to report it to the moderators so they can delete the comment. The moderators are there to help keep the forum clean. Quote from: Wapfika on November 25, 2022, 01:48:34 PMLegit. Looks like a typical comment section on social media that most user doesn’t give a deym about discussion. I think Meta is the only board I know that I can get a better reply.This is true most of the time. Just keep in mind that the Meta board is reserved exclusively for forum-related questions and comments.",

I'd like to see us get back to the levels we were at before, but we probably need to make a few changes before that. Mainly, more moderators or at the very least having a few more dedicated moderators to sections that don't have them. Gambling Discussion is quite wild at the moment.

The problem with it is there's a ton of vague posts there that if you aren't familiar with the sport might seem legitimate. For example, I don't watch basketball, and have no clue about it. If someone reports a post there that the user is just being very vague, and probably hasn't even watched the game, it's not always easy to tell if you don't watch it yourself.

I might gamble every once in a while, but generally, I'm not really interested in gambling conversations; most are also directed towards sports betting, and guess what? I'm not into sports either. Thus, I rarely participate in gambling discussions. If I were to guess, I'd say that quite a few signature campaigns have a certain post requirement to be made in the gambling section. As a result, there are people who may have zero interest in gambling who try to fit into conversations in order to achieve their quota.I'm not following the gambling sections, and it's just my personal opinion, but I thought there might be a correlation between spam posts and the minimum post requirement in the specific section of the forum.",

I think you should read the forum rules again. Especially the first one, because before the off-topic rule there is another one : 1. No zero or low value, pointless or uninteresting posts or threads. And it's not up to readers and moderators to report and delete spams, it's up to posters to follow the rules and to refrain from spamming first. It's the same thing as a thief telling you I'm free to rob you because if you disagree you can call the police... As it has been said above moderators fully dedicated to the (Gambling) section and maybe more temporary bans would certainly help to reduce spam though.",

I doubt the forum is going to enforce rules/guidelines specifically for signature campaigns, if theymos does decide to address the issues caused by it, I imagine it would be less restrictions, and more just outright banning it. Although, theymos has expressed in the past that he likes that signature campaigns have created an economy within the forum. So, I imagine it would be with reluctance, and I don't think the signature campaigns are our biggest problem right now.

Half have no clue what they're commenting on and those that do have a clue are covered by a river of junk, so it's hard to even spot a decent post in the section. I've noticed people are getting pretty desperate lately and are opening threads like the history of bingo https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419869.0 I'm not gonna call out everyone whom I think has opened a shit topic that they know is going to be a spam fest, but it's definitely an issue.As a manager I will lower my gambling section requirement to 4 per week.
