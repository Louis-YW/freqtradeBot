It is time to not touch Solana and FTT. Maybe you will miss a good bounce but profit can be gotten in other ways, other opportunities. With FTT and Solana now, risk is far higher than potential profit.",

Well, for now, I would stay away from Solana as well. Nobody can say what will happen with the FTX exchange in the upcoming weeks, the news makes me think that nothing good can happen with FTX and all FTX projects. But again, if Binance changes its decision and decides to buy FTX or just help them, the situation can change course.So buying Solana now is a huge risk, but where is a huge risk there are huge possible gains. I guess some people are ready for big risks, but I am not sure if they are ready for the consequences if things go the wrong way.",

I think it is not good idea to sell Top currencies like Bitcoin/Ethereum and buy SOLANA which is already in deep trouble after FTX massive crash & market analysts are speculating its dump in coming days as there is significant reduction in the amount of staked Solana.

You can do 10k-10k for each of them and then allocate the remaining 10k to sol if you want to.But for me, the wisest thing to do is to buy $20k of it for bitcoin and then the remaining to put it simply in Ethereum. You'll be encouraged to buy other altcoins because they'll say that it could grow there. But on this market, rely on what have been moved up and trusted by the community.",

Do you think it's a wise investment, or you consider it too risky?Have you been watching lots of bad story about FTX? if you don't know this and FTX was one of heavy investors for solana. that means if FTX's case may give bad impact to the solana for long term. Picking solana at this moment must become the worst choice that has ever been taken by a smart investorQuote from: chrusso on November 12, 2022, 11:15:03 PM2) Do you believe Solana could recover it's price and reach again $200 usd?it will never happen. I meant FTX's case has been destroying solana. Thinking new ATH for solana pretty much the same like you didn't know what happened with it. it has also a horrible blockchain.Quote from: chrusso on November 12, 2022, 11:15:03 PM3) If it's not Solana, which other currencies you consider a potential investment?It must be layer 1 or 2 coins in the market. that must become the best choice that can be taken for now. Decentralized future trading platform might become the best one to investQuote from: chrusso on November 12, 2022, 11:15:03 PM4) What do you think about Bitcoin and Ethereum? I believe those are the safest investments, but I'm also looking for something with more space to grow...Bitcoin and ethereum are always the best investment all the time in crypto.Quote from: chrusso on November 12, 2022, 11:15:03 PM5) Do you know or can recommend another currencies other than Solana, Bitcoin or Ethereum?I can only recommend you something like GMX or MVX since people lost trust to the centralized exchange site",

I think the price could reach $200 USD by the end of this year. Solana is a unique project and the huge supply definitely doesn't scare investors SOL is a fundamentally strong crypto with a big market cap and one that Binance really supports. This isn't the first time we've seen crypto prices go down, and they'll all be back up again soon.I think it is not a good idea to compare Solana with ethereum and even less so bitcoin. Solana already has a bad fate after SBF bankruptcy. The project is not that good either, especially when it is joked that Solana has blockchain weekends for network maintenance. Buying this dip you have high risks of ending up without funds, unlike buying eth or btc.",

I think even worse news will come for the solana and she will be severely worn out. I do not recommend any investment other than bitcoin and ethereum in the near future.",

So I recommend you to invest in Ethereum and Bitcoin at dip. Invest at your own research Altcoins has the biggest rate of increase during bullish market because their value are most of the time low. But that does not guarantee profit. Given the number of altcoins in this industry, only a few has the chance to go along with thr upward movement and it is hard to tel which is which. Safe coins to invest are still Ethereum and Bitcoin but if you are a small time investor and you are only 'scalping' on exchangers, then don't expect for huge return. Usually, big investors are the ones which are getting huge profit everytime the market price of Bitcoin and Ethereum or cryptos in general, are increasing because they have invested huge amount as well. But if people are willing to take the risk for altcoin investment, then go for the popular ones in this industry to get lower odds.",
