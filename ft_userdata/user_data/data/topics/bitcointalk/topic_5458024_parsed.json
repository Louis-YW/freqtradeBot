I am not from US and I do not know what social security number is for, but for an exchange to know more about customers, they can ask for more information. Know that even with drives license, international passport, national identity and other information requested for on crypto exchanges are all risky, especially if the documents is stolen during data breach by hackers. This is the reason some people do not want to trade on KYC exchanges, but no-KYC exchanges are reducing, Kucoin is also on the move to enforce KYC.",

I am not from US and I do not know what social security number is for, but for an exchange to know more about customers, they can ask for more information. According to what I think, drives license, international passport, national identity is sufficient to prove the identity of any user, and address proof documents are also known. I find it strange that the Social Security number is requested and what purpose it might have. He also ruled out that the authorities might request this even if the platform asked about user data.Greater targeting of user privacy leads to necessarily fewer users and thus less popularity and lower revenues, especially since there are alternatives available in the market.",

In some areas (if not in all states), or with some banks, you can't open a bank account if you don't have one.(out of curiosity ID cars have a serial numbers?)It's perhaps because for an exchange, the SSN is the most efficient way to know the customer since no one else than the citizen is supposed to know it. An ID card can be photoshoped, change your face or something like that.Don't know why Coinbase only ask for the 4 digits, but in the old time the first digits were an area code (the state)For americans, pretty dangerous to share their SSN  if you ask me.

Being a CEX I'm not surprised by the information that is being requested. Given that you've been asked for your SSN I'm assuming that you're US based[1] since it is the only place where they ask for it. Remember that CEX's hold a vast private information about you and will eventually hand over that data when law enforcement comes knocking into their door (and other companies that no one knows about). In Kraken case that just happened - According to US court ruling published two days ago, Kraken has to hand over the following information to the IRS:QuoteIV. CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS the Petition in part and orders thatKraken shall produce the following documents for Kraken users with any combination of accountshaving at least the equivalent of $20,000 in value of transactions (regardless of type) incryptocurrency in any one year, for the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020:1. Name (including full name, any pseudonym, or any user ID);2. Date of Birth;3. Taxpayer Identification Number;4. Physical Address;5. Telephone Number;6. Email Address;7. All documents described in Request No. 4 for the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020 except that: a) Kraken shall only be required to produce transaction hash (ID) and blockchain addresses to the extent that information has been or is in the future backfilled into its transaction data; and b) as to Request 4(d), Kraken may produce raw data even though it does not specifically demarcate chainsplitting transactions.8.

I guess that they are tightening their KYC verification to minimize cases which pass through KYC with stolen documents. They maybe faced with stricter regulations on AML (Anti Money Laundering) so they go ahead to protect themselves first, not customer first.Three biggest reasons like stricter AML against CEX, more cheating KYC from their customers, their exchange shady policy.It is good if they can block users with money laundering, stolen documents but in reality, things are not like that, their database can be hacked or just their staffs will leak KYC data to get money from KYC-buying customers in dark markets.Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless",

I was just trying to link my bank account through ACH. Upon doing the process, I've received an error message stating that my bank account could not be linked. The system asked me to contact customer support for further assistance. Let me tell you, that my Kraken account was never used before. It was a new account, and all I did was try to verify myself by uploading my driver's license and bank statement. The ACH issue led customer service to ask for my full SSN. While my issue is solved, I certainly don't like the fact that I gave sensitive information to a centralized exchange. If hackers break through, they could steal all Americans' identity.

It uses Plaid just like Kraken, anyways. What I'm worried about is Kraken's security methods. A major hack could be a real blow to the crypto exchange. It's not like US customers have any other choice, especially when KYC is mandatory to buy/sell crypto with Fiat (USD). With how Mt.

You ended your intervention rather well - You should only provide information that you are comfortable to share (and to assume that it will get leaked some day in the future). This applies to anything in life honestly as no one can assure you that your private information is secure in the long term because, sadly, no one knows what will happen in the long term. If this scares you, good. It means you are aware.In the meantime, why don't you consider using reputable P2P markets? Here's a great list to get a head start[1]. If you've got doubts regarding some of them feel free to post in the forum (or better yet, search for it first). I'm sure someone eventually will help you.[1]https://kycnot.me/",

But I was stupid enough to become fully verified, just because I was in a hurry to sell some crypto. Do not make the same mistake as I did. CEXs are the main target of hackers, not only because they hold plenty of crypto in their reserves, but also because they store personal information. If the CEX has strong security standards, hackers will have a hard time getting access to them. But I wouldn't trust these entities (CEXs) especially when they're centralized. That said, I believe DEXs are a much better choice. The only issue is that you cannot buy sell/crypto with Fiat using a DEX. You'd need to make a balance between both exchanges' advantages/disadvantages to make your move. Who knows how long Kraken will last?",
