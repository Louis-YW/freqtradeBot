  "content": "Hello and thank you for this space to share.My name is Jonathan Alvarez and I am the founder and CEO of a crypto mining startup in Latin America (Argentina).We have been working since May 2021.Our operations started with Ethereum due to the availability of GPUs and the ease of mining this token.When the Ethereum merger was announced, we started preparing to select the most profitable algorithm for our users, we currently mine ERGO.Now we are looking to create mining farms in Argentina.A little history...[size=200]About us?[/size]We are 3 founding partners (2 men and 1 woman). The 3 of us live in Argentina.Our startup is registered in the USA although we operate from Argentina, this is to protect our investors and offer greater legal security in such a troubled world and more so in the cryptographic ecosystem.We offer rental of mining power through a 3-year contract.Our users can acquire mining power through our investment plans starting from $100.When our users rent power, they get a 3-year contract that entitles them to interest on the rented mining power every month.Our company keeps 15% of the monthly returns. This percentage includes the cost of energy, GPU maintenance, support and administrative expenses.We do not charge commission for withdrawing money or for investing.At this moment we have more than 200 registered users and more than 20 investors with an average ticket of $340.Our users can also reinvest earnings to earn compound interest.Our platform is for management and control only, the mined cryptocurrencies are not on our platform and users should not request withdrawals. Your monthly earnings are paid directly to your virtual wallet.[size=200]Why did we create this crypto mining company?[/size]We believe in the individual and social change that blockchain can generate and we love applying it to society.In a world with high inflation, low wages and lack of employment, we seek with crypto mining that our users obtain monthly returns to improve their quality of life and their environment.[size=200]Why Bitcoin?[/size]Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency and also the token that will continue to be used by the PoW consensus system for many years to come.This aligns with our goals and vision.[size=200]Why Argentina?[/size]Argentina is a country with great advantages for foreign investors due to:Code:a) Low energy costb) Cheap laborc) ideal climate to cool ASICd) political government in favor of foreign investment in mining farmsWe have planned to create the first mining farm in the state of Mendoza, city of San Rafael, due to its high energy availability and average annual temperature of 28ยบ.[size=200]Providers:[/size]We have ASIC providers in Florida and Hong Kong.We also have the support of the Mendoza government to create BTC farms in the city.[size=200]Costs and projections[/size]Code:Electric cost: $0.04*kw/HIndustrial Shed: 548 m2 / $500Internet: $19S19J Pro 100Th/s ASIC: $5,674*ASIC cost includes customs taxes and internal fees.Below we share an image of profits and costs according to the price of BTC:https://ricemining.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot_1.png[size=200]What are we looking for?[/size]If you are an investor interested in crypto mining, we believe that Argentina can be an interesting bridge to generate cryptocurrencies and profits.We are looking for investors who can contribute the money to start with 100 ASICs in Argentina.[size=200]What we offer?[/size]Our experienced team takes care of the maintenance, management and administration of the ASICs.We also have our lawyer specialized in blockchain law.We offer to legally participate in a crypto mining startup.We also offer accommodation and stay for those investors who wish to travel to see the city and talk personally with us.If you are interested please leave your concern.I do not share company name to avoid generating spam.Any comments, suggestions or concerns are welcome and I will be happy to respond.Investor Presentation",

      "body": "The best run and marketed project like this I'd ever seen was one in Austria. I forget the name but I can look them up again in old files. Did a bit of work for them. They revealed all. From proof of existence like Names, persons, livestreaming camera feeds showing the actual rigs, the hydropowered locations... to proof of business concept, company incorporations, publishing lawyer letters, business plans with profit projections (one of the few who actually bothered). The only thing they never truly satisfied was actual income statements.Fantastic people are great ideas, but they couldn't really prove it worked -- and it didn't. As soon as markets came down in 2018/19 they just couldn't pay out the shared revenues promised.My message being: you got to do a lot better than this. Documentation. That shows you have what you say you have (your team, for example) and to prove you know what you say you do (your market research, evidence of profitability, etc.).",

      "body": "Hello, thank you all for your messages.My first message was an introduction to our business model and now that concerns and questions have come up from you, I will be happy to provide further information and details.My name is Jonathan รlvarez, I am the CEO of Ricemining LLC.We founded the startup together with 2 other partners (Sergio Garcia and Natalia Cabrera).My professional profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvarezjhonathan/Sergio Profile (COO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiogarcia93/Our company is registered under number 11939140.You can check our information on the Delaware government website: https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/entitysearch/namesearch.aspxOur current company is registered in the USA.For our new business model (BTC mining) we are going to register the company in Argentina, since this is mandatory to be able to import ASICs and pay the internal taxes and customs taxes of the country.Currently we only mine with GPU. (Our idea is to start mining BTC and create a mining farm in Argentina).[size=200]How our current business model works:[/size]We rent mining power.Users through (https://app.ricemining.com) can purchase crypto mining plans.By purchasing a crypto mining plan, investors get a 3-year contract which gives them monthly earnings for 36 months.Ricemining LLC keeps 15% of the cryptocurrencies mined each month. This allows us to pay energy costs, maintenance, website, marketing and investor support.With the money from investors, we buy GPUs that we configure and start mining.We currently mine the ERGO token as after the Ethereum upgrade we decided it was the most profitable algorithm yet.[size=200]New business model (BTC mining):[/size]When the end of Ethereum PoW began to be announced, we began to plan and diagram how to continue mining in Argentina, but with Bitcoin.[size=200]Why Bitcoin?[/size]In addition to being the cryptocurrency with the highest value, it is the algorithm that can continue to be mined over time.[size=200]Projections:[/size]We have made some projections and costs so that you can see and calculate the possible earnings of mining BTC in Argentina.In this online sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7LT49CTew07PAfT2w1vqmtVVwYvOGNylMQQJlHZSUM/edit?usp=sharing you will be able to know some costs of Ricemining in Argentina including ASIC and also the profits.Current data on Ricemining:We currently have 20 investors with an average ticket of $350.We have 200 registered users.Facts about the people behind Ricemining.I have been dedicated to crypto mining for approximately 4 years. After mining with my GPUs, I wanted to bring this to the rest of society and create a new revenue model for people.Sergio, my partner is in charge of configuring and maintaining the mining software.Thank you all for the time.If you have any concerns about the online spreadsheet, please let me know.Also if you have questions about our business model I will be happy to answer.Quote from: SFR10 on October 15, 2022, 12:23:50 PMQuote from: Ricemining on October 13, 2022, 11:48:36 AMOur startup is registered in the USA although we operate from Argentina, this is to protect our investors and offer greater legal security in such a troubled world and more so in the cryptographic ecosystem.I'm confused...

Also, creating a company in the US, but operating it in Argentina is a bad idea, and is on rocky legal ground as well. For such a small profit margin, just a single issue could cause disaster for your entire operation, throwing you into debt. You need to rethink your entire idea before you try to continue. If you have investors, you should just liquidate the assets and return their investment to them.",
