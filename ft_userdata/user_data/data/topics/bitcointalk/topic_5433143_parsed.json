  "content": "**ACCEPTS BUSD ONLY**You'll likely immediately think the platform is a scam because of the Games History or whatever, but...long story.WHAT IS http://RPSBET.IO?A Player Vs. Player (PVP) Betting / Gambling / Wagering beta platform built to give the player the choice to either Be the House or Beat the House. For example, you might take $1000 to a regular casino, but will most likely lose it - that's how 'The House' works. But at least if you become the House, although it's not the best way of 'Becoming the House' you at least have more control.SKILL GAMES VS. RND / PROVABLY-FAIR GAMESrpsbet.io uses Skill Games as this is just a beta platform for testing. I'll likely give the platform away later. But when we move to a new and improved platform (if everything goes to plan) we will have both Skill Games and Casino Games.DEPOSITSTo deposit, currently the only way is to connect your wallet, so if you're really concerned, just use a burner wallet.~0.05p in BNB Required for Gas **This is the platform's only fees!**WITHDRAWALSWe pay the gasGAMEPLAYThere are 2 ways to participate.\"Be the House, or Beat the House\":Create a StakeJoin a StakeCreate a StakeGo to 'My Stakes'Select a GameClick +STAKEFollow the instructions for each game (might take some getting used to)Join a StakeGo to 'Live Stakes'Select a Game (at this time of posting and probably forever, only my game exists - 1 BUSD / 16 BUSD)Click JOIN STAKEFollow the instructions to play game (might take some getting used to)[BUGS]Auto-Payout - Brain Game - doesn't work, so keep an eye on your gameDISCLAIMER ** - All bets are final- Withdrawals / Deposits are done automatically and as this is just a beta platform, I wouldn't go depositing large funds even though they're most likely safe[/color][/size][/size]",
