  "content": "There is a recent strange behaviour that trust wallet users are experiencing currently that those who are using it could be able to identify as an uncommon hange.Â A friend contacted me earlier today regarding how his balance is no longer visible on the trust wallet, but the BTC figures are there but the fait value is no longer attached to it. I advised him to download the blue wallet and import his wallet using the phras he has in it; then he should also create a new wallet using the blue wallet and move his BTC holding over to the new blue wallet. He has done the wallet creation on the blue wallet, but when trying to send out the coin to the new address, this error is showing.This screenshot was taken and sent over to me, which is something I have not experienced before. Can anyone explain the cause of this to me and how to resolve it?",

      "body": "@LucyFurr, OmegaStarScream, Thanks for your quick response. I don't know what the issue really was, but I guess it was a bit connected to the network. I had to rush to his place, try it back, and still get the same error message. I just had to uninstall the blue wallet, install it back directly from the Play Store, do the wallet importations back, and allow the balance to load and reflect by itself. Everything appears to have worked normally now, and the coins have been sent out just waiting for blockchain confirmation; they're already showing on the new wallet as incoming unconfirmed transactions, so we are all good and the issue is solved.",

The problem is a connection problem either from your ISP or there was a problem with the server you are connecting from.The solutions are to change the server or change the IP address, either by using a VPN or reactivating the Internet connection.",

I'd suggest you get familiar with it when you have the time since re-installation is a last resort most of the time. Try to use dns encryption if you don't want to buy a VPN to check whether your ISP is acting up or not. CMIIW.",

I recommend downloading from their official site.Link to download the BlueWallet application in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewalletThere is one more thing to note. Assets transferred to the BlueWallet wallet by importing a seed phrase from Trust Wallet are still vulnerable and will not be safe because the seed phrase is not the one generated by BlueWallet when creating the address. Be careful.If you want to store Bitcoin in BlueWallet, create a new address with a new seed phrase.",

Incidentally, I think OP suggestion regarding wallets to his friend is appropriate for use on an Android device, namely BlueWallet.Importing the seed phrase from the Trust wallet to BlueWallet does not terminate initial access to the new wallet, as you said, it is only a software transfer process, considering that we do not want the vulnerabilities in the Trust wallet to continue.",

Generating a new seed and sweeping all coins to it is better than using one created on Trust Wallet.It does not move bitcoin from that wallet but it is a risky practice.Like using a same password on all platform, for all accounts. Using a same wallet seed on different wallet softwares is bad practice. If one wallet software has backdoors, you will lose your bitcoin.I will import my wallet seed from wallet software A to wallet software B, if my coins is here, I will sweep it to an entire new wallet with new wallet seed.",

A scenario where it makes sense to do this is if your software or hardware wallet has stopped working, and you have no other choice but to import your seed and recover your wallet that way. But as soon as that is done, sweep everything from wallet A to wallet B. If you recovered the seed generated by the same hardware wallet, I wouldn't bother sweeping the coins, though. So, if you trusted, for instance, Trezor last year with your seed, and now you moved to the same or different model of Trezor, I don't think a sweep is necessary in that situation.",
