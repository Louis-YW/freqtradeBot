Not all coins need a lot of RAM. There are a few coins that require more than 8 GB of memory, but 8 GB of memory is still relevant. But I would take a GPU with 12-16 GB of memory.Not all algorithms are memory dependent. The Ethereum algorithm loved fast memory, and new coins love powerful GPU cores. Therefore, old generations of video cards now give a very small profit, and new GPUs pay off for a very long time.",

With data transfer speeds of 9.8Gbps per pin, it is capable of reaching transfer rates of up to 1.2TBps. Samsung has also enhanced its NCF (Non-Conductive Film) technology to improve thermal conductivity by reducing the gaps between chip layers.The HBM3E memory is currently in the sampling phase and being sent to clients for testing. Mass production is expected to begin in 2024. Additionally, Samsung unveiled plans for the development of HBM4 memory, which will utilize more advanced chip manufacturing and packaging technologies. The company aims to use a wider 2,048-bit memory interface and FinFET transistors to reduce power consumption.Samsung also provided more details on its GDDR7 memory, which offers a 50% reduction in standby power consumption compared to previous generations. The company plans to start shipping 16Gbit modules that can operate at up to 32Gbps per pin. This new memory type improves power efficiency in both active and standby states.https://isp.page/news/samsung-unveils-shinebolt-hbm3e-memory-updates-hbm4-development-2/",
