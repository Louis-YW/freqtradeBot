I'm sure there are more that I can claim by holding XRP but the process of setting up a trustline is tedious and scary. In addition to the Flare drop, there is also a MAXX Finance airdrop coming. You just need to hold some cryptos in your wallet on their native chains, like ETH on Ethereum and MATIC on Polygon and then enter the freeclaim on their website. I read a lot of people on here think airdrops are scams and not worth the time anymore but the amount of money I got from just holding XRP makes me think otherwise.",

You don't have to do anything other than press a claim button. It's free money.",

I personally have raised tens of thousands of dollars from these programs.From airdrops? I earned about 10k from UNI, 2k from 1inch, 4k from Songbird (just holding XRP), 1k in Sologenic (holding XRP), 2k from Coreum (holding Sologenic), and I anticipate 8k from SPARK (hodling XRP). As to MAXX, I will probably get at least 2k usd worth because I have a lot of MATIC.",

It's the truth. The difference is that you hold something valuable or traded before in order to receive the airdrop (how many airdrop seekers can even afford to hold that much XRP in their accounts? Try getting airdrops that don't involve any snapshot of sorts and see how much of waste if time they are.",

The developers can't even try to decide which platform / coin that will be used for the airdrop. As far as i know the team was not even serious about that. Good luck with this airdrop. You may earn from there but the bad thing is if you are waiting for so long but the airdrop will never come. This spark airdrop has become a very big rumour in the past but no execution for its airdrop. You're actually an airdrop hunters.",
