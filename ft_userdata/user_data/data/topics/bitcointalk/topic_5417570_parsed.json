      "body": "I think many peoples are looking for that lol. In the beginning, when I create a PayPal account I feel I need something like this. But I don't think PayPal will accept virtual cards (but I am not sure). Because I had tried with Payoneer virtual card and hard card, but both have been declined. That's why I doubt PayPal will accept the virtual card. Hope experienced users who are familiar with PayPal lately will share more details if possible using virtual cards for PayPal. I tried it a long time ago, but I am not aware of any recent changes. But, be careful from scammers, they would DM you for cards, etc. Don't trust anyone if they don't have a good record on the forum.",
