  "content": "Hey folks,I need your expertise on something. I've got some awesome digital products to sell online (i want website to take care of the payment processing and i only send the link to the buyers), and I want to accept crypto as payment. After some digging, I found this site called SecureHub (https://securehub.top). They claim to have the lowest fees and encrypt everything, so even their admins can't snoop. Sounds pretty solid, right?But before I dive in headfirst, I wanted to see if any of you have better recommendations. If there's a different platform you've had success with for selling digital products using crypto, please share your thoughts!Thanks a bunch for your input and advice. Can't wait to hear from you!",

Thanks a lot for the suggestion,  checked out shoppy.gg, and it seems like a popular choice. But they charge a whopping 5% fee on crypto payments, and my people love using crypto. So, I'm wondering if there are other sites with lower fees or more payment options.By the way, has anyone tried securehub.top? Any personal experiences, guys?Thanks again for your input, and I'm stoked to hear more from you awesome folks!",

I'm not familiar with the site you mentioned, but you can try and go with one of these payment processors[1]. The fees are better (1%) but you will have to do some work with their API if you want something like shoppy.gg.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444578.0",

With the amount of scams going on, better prioritize reputation above all else.I'm not buying the domain change alibi as well, at least not yet since it's pretty easy to claim this and that on the internet. Perhaps tell us the previous domain? Isn't it more of a norm to tell us that when a domain change occurs in an announcement/news? A website of 2018 would most likely have a record on the wayback machine. and if they have a reasonable following, being mentioned twice or thrice in other sources wouldn't be unthinkable either.",

Even that nonsense with the excuse about changing the domain is just a lie. What is their previous domain? The site has only one page and no contact information. If any problem arises, how to contact them?If they really exist for 5 years, there should be at least some kind of feedback about them. But there is nothing, not even false positives.Why would you entrust your money to some totally anonymous service, without any reliable recommendation?",

      "body": "Thank you guys for your replies. I was little busy in the last week, sorry for the late reply. ( Also i'm not trying to promote any website, i'm just a trading bot seller that is looking for best platform for that )So i took the decision to use both platforms at first and then figure out which platform will suit me better.So i registered in both platforms and posted a testing product that cost 1$.I started with shoppy.gg it require me to add my bitcoin address before posting the product. So i just done that and posted the product and bought it using Bitcoin, the payment went well and i received the product. But i did not receive the money as a seller! There is no place in the website that explain how to do a withdraw and i did not find any page that does that. At first i thought they will automatically send me the bitcoins as i have already entered my bitcoin address but i did not receive anything. ( If anyone knows how to withdraw money from shoppy.gg please contact me )So next i tried securehub.top , i have posted an item that cost 1$ and bought it, the payment went well, i received the product as a buyer and i got the money in the platform as a seller and then i requested withdraw and entered my bitcoin address and they did send me the money within a day.So i continued using securehub for about a week now and i have done two other larger withdraws and it is all good.Here is a little comparison of both platforms. ( Please note that i'm not sure if shoppy.gg is legit or not because for now i did not find anyway to withdraw the money)Shoppy.gg :Pros:* They offer a lot of features ( such as coupons ) and statistics charts which is very helpful for sellers.* They send the buyer an email when the order is completed.* You can choose what payment methods to accept for each product.* They accept paypal as payment too.Cons:* They website have some bugs ( Email confirmation only worked when i logged out from the account ) and missing pages ( Sometimes i click on something and i get error 404. )* You cannot add an image to your product, which is very important feature for me.* Withdrawing money is confusing.Securehub.top :Pros: * There is a live chat between buyer and seller, buyer and admin, seller and admin.* Email address is not required to register.* They accept Monero.* Added products are encrypted and buyer need the link with the decryption key to access the product.* You can add a picture to your product.Cons:* They do not accept paypal* Less features ( such as coupons )* You cannot select which payment method to accept for each product ( you choose in settings for all products ).This is how the product look like from the buyer side:Securehub.top : https://securehub.top/product?reference=9OLC4STVF9HUWUSF&key=8UbngeQY9w6BE8GHlXMabA6HAeRJF2tYShoppy.gg : https://shoppy.gg/product/KffTDHBPlease note that this review is based on my own experience, Never give 100% trust to any platform.I would like to hear your thoughts about that.(Regarding my case i will keep using securehub platform for now as it is the only good option so far)Also if anyone want to use securehub by any chance please use the link below (They have a good referral system):[DELETED]Thank you!",
