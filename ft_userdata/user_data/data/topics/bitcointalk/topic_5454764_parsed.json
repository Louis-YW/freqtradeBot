  "content": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's recent proposal to offer nuclear weapons to nations considering joining the Union State of Russia and Belarus has been covered by every media outlet. Obviously! Nuclear weapons are a controversial topic, and their possession by a country provides them with a shadow security. The best example is North Korea. Wait a minute! Isn't Moscow getting bombed by Ukrainian drones? A few days or month back Putin's office was attacked by a few drones. This is happening after Russia having the second biggest Nuclear arsenal in its disposal. I am assuming that Alexander Lukashenko do not have advisors who have the potential to understand the present situation on the ongoing war. They forgot that Nuclear missiles no longer have the advantage as they used to have a few decades back. What are your thoughts on Lukashenko's proposal? Thanks.",

It may be a sample of the desperation he could be feeling, seeing the Ukrainian army has not been so easy to defeat as the anticipated...Also, was it confirmed that those droned that alledgely hit the Kremlin were part of a plot to assassinate Putin? It sounds rather daring, if you ask me. We are supposed to look to step down the conflict, a political assassination would make things worse very fast.",

They think that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by tons and tons of TNT to fake the nuke story.Then there are those who are saying that God uses angels (aliens) to stop nuke blasts from happening. God stops the nukes from blasting. So, we can't go to nuclear war even if we tried.Back in the 1960s and earlier, nuclear scientists literally handled small amounts of plutonium without any protection. Small amounts like 5 pounds at a time. They say that nuclear materials aren't all that dangerous, and that the government advertised that they were dangerous to drive fear into everybody for their own purposes.So, give everybody nukes, so that the truth comes out. They aren't dangerous for us or nations at all!",

I'm not saying nukes are not dangerous. What I am saying is that the proof for it might be the dangerous thing.What if Hiroshima and Nagasaki were TNT explosions, and the top secret government stuff in WW2 was the advertising that it was nukes? What if the Jap government is going along with the US government and is simply lying to keep Japanese people out of the areas.Do you know for a fact that there were nukes used in WW2? If you do, how do you know? Do you simply believe your commanders who told you the lie? Or did you actually, personally get burned by nuclear material?Don't get me wrong. Maybe there is no lie in the idea that nukes are dangerous. But how does anybody know... and especially since there are people who worked on nukes who have said that the dangers are way less than they are advertised to be?",

Thanks.Sometimes I wonder why this world is unequal. Nations are given certain privileges that others don't have access to. Why would only a few nations be given the authority to own some dangerous weapons while others will have to worship them to get protection? My country is facing several attacks from terrorist groups and we have to rely on some nations to buy arms to defeat them. We can produce some of these weapons but the arms sector is controlled by some nations which ensures that developing nations rely on them for support. If we want peace in this world let every nation destroy all their nukes or let every nation be given the privilege to own some. If you know I own what you have, there will be restraints. I don't see this comment by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as a threat, it might be a legitimate promise. Russia is desperately seeking more partners and anything can be offered to achieve this goal. Russian territory has been under attack and the war in Ukraine is not going as planned, the current situation can breed unexpected escalation. It could get to the extent of careless distribution of nuclear weapons. The war in Ukraine is a threat to global peace that's why we need peace.",

Just as it accepted the installation of missile launchers carrying nuclear warheads on its soil in order to make itself a nuclear military target.The Belarusian president speaks for Putin within the framework of the policy of complete submission to Russia and the lack of independence of decision-making.",

It's worth noting that there were individuals who experienced that horrific event firsthand and survived long enough to tell the tale.The difference is that everything necessary for making and using TNT is available info. It is easily understandable. Using small amounts of explosive chemical is something everybody can do. It's like taking a shotgun shell apart, and testing the explosive qualities of the powder and the cap.Nobody is allowed to take some plutonium home with him to test. And most people would be scared to do it because of all the media saying that it is bad. So, nobody can tell for himself if U234 or plutonium are dangerous. You simply have to believe it... or not.Yikes! The Geiger counter is blowing its top. That stuff must be dangerous. Or, who has ignored the Geiger counter to see if that stuff really is dangerous?",

Thus it would be necessary for the planes to use bases that are presently safe.Therefore, he said, if those fighter jets takeoff from NATO bases outside Ukraine, and enter Ukraine for battle, Russia will not be able to know if those planes are armed with Tactical nuclear bombs and will have to assume THEY ARE....",
