Why?I just tried to broadcast the transaction in question using coinb.in and got the following error. non-mandatory-script-verify-flag (Using non-compressed keys in segwit) (code 64)If I am not wrong, the transaction isn't standard due to spending bitcoin from a segwit address derived from an uncompressed private key. The only thing you can do is to contact a mining pool and ask them to include the transaction in a block. (It's very unlikely that any mining pool will accept such a request.)",

But in the end, it probably does not matter due to the amount involved. As others have said it's not worth blowing a block for under $25 even if BTC goes to $250000 it's still under $300. OP what wallet were you using? How did you wind up with this? Deliberate thing you did or did it just happen?-Dave",

I'm ignoring uncertain transaction fees in this scenario.QuoteOP what wallet were you using? How did you wind up with this?

This means that the transaction doesn't enter the mempool of any node at all. If a mining pool want to include that transaction, they keep it on their candidate block until they find a block.",
