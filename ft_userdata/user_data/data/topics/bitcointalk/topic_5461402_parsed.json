  "content": "Someone recently won $46,606 from making a correct prediction on one of the matches in the on-going 2023 FIFA Women World Cup competition from his wager of $10 on a sports betting website. The person is unemployed and within the ages of 20 - 23. He lives with his parents who are strict religious people that frown on gambling and other youthful vices. His parents are certainly not going to be happy that their son engages in gambling despite winning such huge amount of money. He doesn't want them to be upset with him. He says he's going to keep it a secret. I disagreed with him because despite having strict parents, they are going to be mad at him for a little while but I don't think they'll tell him to return the money. What do you guys think? Should he tell his parents or secretly invest the money while acting his regular self around the house?",

If they are very religious, that should not affect what I should become. I will tell them and I definitely know that blood is thicker than water. I am good in the public, I am not a thief, I am not involved in any crime, so I am not a disappointment.If I am the parent, I will only advice the child to use the money to establish, not to use it to gamble.",

The parents are not strict that they want to remain poor for life so the boy should go ahead and inform them of his fortune, they are allowed to get angry anyway but they will definitely look at the bigger picture of what such amount of money $46k  can do in their life tremendously. But if the parent rescinded and ask him to return the money, then the young got to think twice that he's got a future ahead of him and such amount of money well invested in his future he's made for life. To those that don't know, let it be known that gambling money isn't an illicit money because your religion condemns it doesn't make it an evil money, there are things/actions that religious fanatics exhibit that their religion doesn't condemn it but by human moral standard those actions are far worse than partaking in gambling.",

This winning is quite doubt on my side I'm playing a lot of games of sports and e-sports betting but this wage of 10 USD must have a really good odds to win this large amount of profit, and another thing that person with that age is can live at his own in some point that's the time most of the children want to separate to their parents so they become dependent on their decisions in life, ideal for me is to keep it secret we know how does the parents who are not into the technology might wonder how you will got those amount and make some weird conclusions how you get those money and if you want to can give them. I guess religion does not brings here up on gambling its all about the parenting perspective, with due all respect to other religion.",

Should he tell his parents or secretly invest the money while acting his regular self around the house? I am aware that gambling is a sin based on Islamic beliefs. It is highly frowned upon because it can lead to greed and the uncontrollable pursuit of wealth. There is no biblical backup that forbids Christians from gambling. I am not well enlightened on how gambling is viewed by other religions but I guess they are Muslims. He is just predicting his parent's reaction. He needs to inform them because he depends on them for now. They might be angry but it wouldn't last forever. He will apologize to them and promise to quit gambling if they insist. I believe they will not ask him to refuse to claim the win or to return it because the money is huge. It will be difficult for him to hide his win and behave like nothing happened. Money can change the behavior and lifestyle of anybody. You cannot have money and not acquire what you desire. Also, if he is not careful he might end up investing wrongly which might lead to a total loss of funds.",

It's also great that the person in question is of the majority age, so what his parents believe is sort of irrelevant. To be honest, the whole vibe of the post sounds like this person might be a minor, significantly below the stated age. If he's a minor, waiting till officially becoming an adult OR telling the parents is required. If he's truly in his twenties, it should not be a problem for him to cash out the price onto his own bank account, and I don't think adults have any obligations to tell their parents anything. So if they are very prejudiced against gambling, I understand the urge not to tell them, at least not for a while. Also, with a win like that, I'm sure he can afford to rent a place of his own now, so maybe it's time to move out. Finding a thing to do with life would still be very desirable, of course, but now there are savings to rely on. Perhaps using a part of that money to, say, buy Bitcoin or invest in something else makes sense, yes.",

This will be the worst because what you were  hiding will be exposed,since you can't hide 46k just like that.On the other hand,if he sees himself old enough to be a man,he should tell his parent and if they disagree with the wins, he can go get an apartment and invest the money into a business that he has knowledge on.

It will basically bring more harm than good- the boy is aware that what he did was wrong and if he sweared that he would not gamble again, then the best action is to just keep it to himself.I have a question- is the boy living comfortably? Is his family not financially challenged or struggling to make ends meet? If no, then he should just re-invest his money to make the most out of this luck. If yes, I think he is somehow obligated to tell his parents in order to at least help the family financially.",

Seriously I will just recommend him to tell his parents about the win, actually he didn’t do anything illegal to get the money, he didn’t hurt anyone or steal from anyone. I know some parents are so religious, and since gambling is strictly prohibited so they won’t like the idea of their son gambling, but I know the only thing they can do is just get mad at him, which if he keeps on pleading, they will end up forgiving him and asking him not to go back to gambling, and they will be able to make use of the money, they can plan the appropriate investments which the boy can make.",
