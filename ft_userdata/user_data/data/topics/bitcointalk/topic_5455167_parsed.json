  "content": "Exactly at 12 years ago, on June 05, 2011- someone anonymous posted that even as small as 10 Bitcoins will make someone a very wealthy man. He was pretty much confident about this and pretty much sure about where Bitcoin will reach. Can you believe this? There were barely any people who would accept Bitcoin for anything. But the guy was able to forecast the future. Is there any information on who the guy was behind the post? We don't even know a username1. Back in the day, it was possible to post in the forum without registration, anyone could post as a guest.I'm referring to this thread- I am pretty confident we are the new wealthy elite, gentlemen.1- There's a quoted post of the OP which I'm quoting below. In that quote, we can see the OP had a username \"Atlas\". It's possible that the user asked admin to make the post author anonymous. Only admin has the access to do this. Or, maybe the man posted the quoted message has purposedly added the username on the quote.Quote from: Garrett Burgwardt on June 05, 2011, 04:00:50 AMQuote from: Atlas on June 05, 2011, 03:50:32 AMThe world just isn't going to be the same and we have been blessed as the pioneers.I haven't been blessed. It was through my foresight that I saw bitcoin for how valuable it was. No man helped me along, and many discouraged me.The original thread is in Bitcoin Discussion so I thought to post it here.",

      "body": "For those of us on the forum today, I would qualify and say that many of us are not among the elite. And even many of those who have been on the forum for quite a few years, you only have to look at the lending section to see that they do not belong to any elite if they are asking for loans of hundreds of dollars in bitcoin. Or that still participate in signature campaigns. Those who bought in the past and holded for a long time, or at least long enough, are indeed probably the new wealthy elite, but I would say that most of them don't show up much on the forum anymore. Either they don't come and enjoy their Lambos or their activity is reduced to a few sections, like the WO thread.In the future, I don't think those who are just starting out or have been here for a short time will be part of an elite either, if they save in bitcoin in the order of 100 dollars a month. They will have a better future than if they don't, but they will not be part of an elite.",

He was projecting that it would surpass $10,000 and go well beyond that. It's certainly unclear if he stuck around till Bitcoin exploded, but judging by how confident he sounded, he definitely made a huge deal of money.Personally, I believe he's still on the forum; it's the largest cryptocurrency community after all, but operating on a new account (his thread was created as a guest) and simply hasn't mentioned anything in order to preserve his privacy.",

Even on the forum you have to keep it to next level to stay updated with all the info you need about the Bitcoin or basically anything related to it. Though there are many legends who are very motivating and has put lot of efforts to push every fellow members. I just hope these legends and their posts would become best archives for the future generations to come and will make us feel motivated and proud just the way 12 years ago those guests made it that way.

I am not saying lets all buy as much as we can and have 10 bitcoins, we can't all afford that, I certainly can't, I do not even have 1 bitcoin let alone 10, even 0.1 would be very tough for me at this point and can't get it, but I may \"aim\" at 0.1, that would literally be my goal.On the other hand, I would highly suggest getting more and more bitcoin is still the right decision, if you could retire with 1 bitcoin, that would be enough to wealthy when you retire and that's why it's so important, I think people should be still buying up as many bitcoins as they can, or satoshis, based on how much money they have. It will stay a good idea until we die, it will be a good investment compared to all others.",

Those who had stood by the side of bitcoin at its lowest are the people who are enjoying the success of bitcoin now. We still believe that Bitcoin has more to show to us. And this is what creates faith in people's mind about Bitcoin. What time can do to one thing, this is the perfect example. Bitcoin has aged like a fine wine. Nowadays, it still feels like we are still early to join bitcoin. Because it has more room to grow and in the future it will show us a lot more, that's for sure. Bitcoin is the no.1 right now and, mark my words, it will remain the no.1 in the future too.",

They are at an early stage, back in 2011, when Bitcoin was a highly unfamiliar currency to the public.Like an animated film such as The Simpsons, but with a more mysterious delivery, it holds a greater allure than straightforward communication. I myself am still curious, whether the person predicting Bitcoin is someone of immense significance like Elon Musk or perhaps even the original Satoshi Nakamoto. Nobody knows for sure, right?

Many people wouldn't accept it or be able to believe it. What transpired at that time is the same way how we respond when someone forecasts that bitcoin would reach $1 million in a short period. The early adopters of bitcoin, in my opinion, wouldn't agree that someone could become wealthy with just 10 bitcoins. Many people won't believe it given the price of Bitcoin at the time. I liked how the anonymous poster maintained his support for bitcoin despite being discouraged by many. For someone to continue to believe in something he doesn't know about its future takes a lot of conviction.",

For sure many people have saw the potential of this technology but not all people had the courage to sit on that belief. There are many early investors who bought huge amount of Bitcoin before. Some have lost their wallets where they store it, and some used huge amount to trade on two boxes of pizza (if you know what I mean). The fact that they have invested means they already saw something from Bitcoin but they are just not patient enough to wait for years to see it for themselves. Same thing I guess with the present.
