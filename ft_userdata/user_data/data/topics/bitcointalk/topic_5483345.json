  "content": "All of the Bitcoin enthusiasts were waiting for Bitcoin ETFs approval because they thought that Bitcoin will grow huge in value once the ETFs get approved by the SEC, and they weren't wrong because Bitcoin was trading at $46.5k to $47k values when those ETFs were approved and it even touched $48k value for short term. However, after a few days from the ETFs approval Bitcoin's price continue dropping again, and in 4th week of January Bitcoin's price dropped below $39k. Some people heavily invested in Bitcoin when its price was at $45k or above and now they regret about their investment decision. This thread is mainly for those people and for everyone else to learn from the mistakes that we make as investors and holders.Well, I created this thread only to share some suggestions to those who invest in a coin when FOMO is very high. Most investors have anticipated that Bitcoin can reach $50k to $55k if the upward rally continues and those who were following such accumulated Bitcoin even when it's price was at $45k and above. Most of those newbie investors don't really understand that how crypto market works and that's why they regretted when Bitcoin's price dropped below $39k. Some of them have sold their Bitcoin holdings at loss in fear that they may lose more if Bitcoin's value drops below $35k while some still regret that why they have bought Bitcoin when it was pumping. They don't really understand what to do now because their PNL is negative within a few days and they get depressed when they see that negative PNL.When a coin gets huge attention from everyone then it's value gets higher for short term due to FOMO but after a point when the coin can't grow more in value because most of the investors who bought it in hope to gain some profits in short term can't buy more of it, and the whales who have been holding it for sometime see no upward movement in market, then they start selling off their holdings which can cause drop in the value of a coin. When market is unable to move upwards anymore and buying orders reduce in number, then most of the investors or to be accurate whale investors place sell orders. When there are few buy orders and more sell orders then market won't move upwards and a few of those investors continue placing market sell orders which causes drop in the value of a coin. Those whale investors are already at profit during the selling of their holdings while the poor newbie investors are the ones who make bad investment decisions and face losses due to the fear.In case of Bitcoin something similar happen this time, the market was moving upward but suddenly it started moving downward and those people who were holding Bitcoin for some time started selling their holdings in fear that the Bitcoin's price will drop to $35k or even below than that. I think most investors don't really understand that why Bitcoin's price dropped suddenly, and that's why most of them sold their Bitcoin holdings below $40k. I think this was simply a fear which caused the holders to sell off their holdings and the investors when saw opportunity again, they started placing buying orders. The Price of Bitcoin has since moved up to $42k after that crash and it's slowly moving upward once again. Those who sell off their Bitcoin holdings in fear should understand that sometimes the market can be manipulated by the huge sharks and whales and thus it's far better to keep holding your Bitcoin rather than selling it for a low value because of the fear.Most of those newbie investors sell their holding due to the feat that they develop after reading online news sites or news on television. One should understand that the news isn't always accurate and most of the times it's the news that creates fear in the minds of investors and holders. It's better to read the news but don't follow it even if you see it's telling you something that's going to happen. The news is very manipulative and most people don't know that. That's why They sell in fear when they read a news report where a reporter says that Bitcoin's price was dropped and it can drop even further to blah, blah values. The weak hands when read such news reports or articles get even more scared and they try to sell their holdings as soon as possible to earn some profits or reduce further losses. They can't really see the whole picture because of the fear. They keep selling off their holdings and when the price moves upward again they regret that why they have sold their holdings. But, at that point they won't be able to do anything else other than regretting once again. I won't say that one should not read the news but it's better to read the news just to understand that what's happening in the market not to get scared of it and sell off in fear.Bitcoin will surely reach it's ATH in this bull run and those who understand that will keep holding their Bitcoin even if they read 100's of such negative news articles. Make your mind that Bitcoin is going to grow huge in this bull run, aim for at least $80k to $100k at minimum if you really want to sell your holdings. Don't sell your Bitcoin anywhere below those values as it would be a very bad decision. Just read a few good speculation and prediction articles to understand that Bitcoin has potential to reach $80k to $100k or even more than that in this bull run. Just keep holding your Bitcoin even if it's value drops to $35k because within two years you'll be happy if you can hold your Bitcoin as it's value will most probably grow higher than our speculations and predictions. I would suggest holders to hold their Bitcoin for as long as possible to see some great profits from their holdings. Never ever sell off due to fear.",

I think the FOMO was high during the days approaching the SEC's decision. During the decision day itself, the very day the positive announcement was released, the FOMO has already died down. There was instead a huge sell off rather than FOMO.Selling isn't done during a FOMO. FOMO is used to refer to buying.",

I suppose that fear he is talking about is the same fear of missing out. I think one does not sell because he gets into FOMO. If he is caught in a FOMO then he is definitely buying not selling. If one is selling because of fear or panic then that is not FOMO. That is something else, probably panic selling or something. In your context, yes, it's correct. FOMO happens regardless of the price movement. Even if the price is rising or falling, FOMO can happen.",

      "body": "Quote from: SamReomo on January 29, 2024, 09:53:07 AM~Another fact is that after the Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale appeared which sold its Bitcoin holdings so that at the same time Bitcoin showed more massive sales plus some who were waiting for ETF approval took advantage of the opportunity to take a little profit. Then as January decline continued, it also provided ample opportunities for institutions that already had access to purchase Bitcoin in the amounts they desired. We are back above $40K and as a hodler I am not too panicked seeing the decline that occurred in fact this price dumping moment makes it very necessary to take a long position.In this case, it is clear that people are committing fomo without having a well thought out plan and not doing much research on the Bitcoin market, which has been like this since the beginning of the cycle. As a result, those who panic and think they will never see a price above $40K again are wasting their time.There is always something to lose due to the mindless news consumption out there regarding Bitcoin rise after getting ETF approval. Not a few of them just hope that this moment will happen in an instant, but how the Bitcoin market works is difficult to predict.",

It did really just turn out that institutions and government had already touched up this market and this is why people or crypto enthusiast are already that expecting something out of those news and other fundamentals on which it would really be just that normal that they would really be able to have those assumptions basing up on what are the things that could happen into this market. This is why it would really be that best that you should really know on how to make that sudden adjustments, it is really just that it would really better that you do have back up plans and whatever things that you are really that dealing on with.",

There are a few questions that need to be asked. The first is why suddenly all Bitcoin ETF applications got approved whereas they were not earlier. A lot of changes were made and those changes do not relate to Bitcoin or its way of its existence. Centralization was the point why Bitcoin came to existence and with ETF they made it a centralized entity as Bitcoin is not being paid in satoshis to those who are investing in ETF. They are only getting a piece of paper that tells them how much satoshi they have on behalf of those financial institutions. It is a game of authority and it will not live for long.",

Alas, we are so disappointed as the price came down below $40K, though as I am writing this it is already back at around $42K. The ETF approval then became a \"sell-the-news\" kind of thing and it was not enough to hold the line and push BTC to the moon. Now, analyzing what happened, I also realized that it is still too early to conclude on ETF so I am giving it at least one year and from there on we can see clear patterns.",

This thread is mainly for those people and for everyone else to learn from the mistakes that we make as investors and holders.That's not a mistake if someone bought Bitcoin at 45K value. You are potentially always safe if you buy bitcoin that's lower than its all-time high price. The mistake was that they bought Bitcoin when its price was one of the highest at the moment and most importantly, this wasn't associated with halving and it wasn't a post-halving episode.There was such a big hype about potential ETF approval that it was only logical to buy Bitcoin immediately once ETF was approved. Imagine, the price went crazy with the potential of approval because BlackRock was involved. What would an average person expect the situation after approval? Skyrocketed Bitcoin prices for sure. It was just a very unlucky result for many people and we can't say here someone made a mistake or not. Trading involves luck and this is the moment where people were unlucky.",
