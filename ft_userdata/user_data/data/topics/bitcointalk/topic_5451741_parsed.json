We have already learned multiple lessons throughout our crypto journey until now where investors had an opportunity to grow big but they lost it all due to fear or temporary greed at all once. Whether it was bitcoin pizza day or two waitress sisters fighting for their Bitcoin share, we have heard and read all the stories. Just came across a story about an investor who invested in meme coin, SHIBA INU. The investor named Damien Slash was one of the early adopters of SHIBA and he had invested around $2000 at the initial value. Damien had lost the hope of getting good profits and he thought SHIBA is just like other coins and there is no point in holding the same. He has withdrawn the investment at $300 loss. However, soon after Damien realized one of the biggest mistakes he had done. His colleagues who knew about Damien's SHIBA holding told him that SHIBA went 67 million % from the initial launch value of the coin. If he had holdings till then, he would have been the next billionaire. Imagine the pain that is soaring from this incident. Have you encountered anything like this? QuoteOnce a Shiba Inu investor, Damien Slash, has gone to YouTube to express his frustration after missing on a lifetime-changing investment. Reportedly, Damien was an early Shiba Inu investor but got out of his investment before the mega profits. In the video, Damien is seen in a somber mood after he learned from his friends that Shiba Inu gained more than 67 million percent after he sold his bag for about $2000. “I just got a message from a couple of mates and they told me that Shiba Inu has gone up 67 million percent since January. At that time I put $2,000 into it and I left it for a couple of weeks. It went down and I sold it for a loss … It turns out that it would now be worth $1 billion if I hadn’t sold it. Now how to live with that?” he stated.The trader feared losing his initial investment after Shib’s price began to dip during the early trading days.Shiba Inu: Smart Investor Turns $2,000 into $1 Billion with SHIB and Latest Ecosystem developments – Report",

The guy in the story hard a very good entry point since he bought those shiba inu at the early stage and at cheap price, but he failed to wait and take on a good exit price since he sold at lose, I don't know what his reasons were but for me, it best to make use of proper DCA at both entry and exit point to minimize profits or cut loses.",

Demian who has invested as much as $2,000 certainly never thought what would happen to the current price of SHiba. I think there is a lot of pain in the world for missing the opportunity to become a millionaire. And besides that there are also many people in this world who have lost billions of dollars in their pockets because they bought Shiba and then the price dropped and continued to decline",

      "body": "Kinda funny how the article calls it an investment when it was basically a gamble imo. I won't deny that SHIBA did indeed had moments where you could profit, but any sane trader at that prior point would've realized that it was a meme, it was nothing of value. Even investing in it just to ride the wave would've seemed dumb on any average mind. It does hurt to think that having a regular mindset hurt the fact that he could've been a billionaire though but hey, we'd probably blame something else if SHIBA ever actually fell below the investment point we entered in (or for any coin in that matter) so no use putting blames anywhere really. To be perfectly fair, every investor would've felt the same at some point, though at varying levels of \"could've been\".",

First of all, SHIBA is a meme coin and no one can really tell the future of it. Imagine the people who are giving away DOGE before when it was worthless, We can't really know how meme coin will perform in the future. Meme coin have become a trend and I'm sure that the majority of us here didn't anticipate that it will come. This is the same way the investor damien slash feels. The only thing we can do in this kind of situation is just move on the lost opportunity.",

No one can tell if that can be a top meme token as many are still doing rug pull. This can be a big gambling and not an investment, high risk high reward, just like the saying of many, profit is a profit.

He had a bunch of coins and then he sold them, he has no rights to feel any regret as he stopped being the legitimate owner of those coins when he sold them.Now I could understand that regret if he lost his wallet and his seed words, as those coins in theory are still his, but this is not the case at all, besides even if he did not sold for a loss he would have sold when Shiba did 2x or 3x anyway, so this idea that he somehow gave up being a billionaire is extremely misleading.",
