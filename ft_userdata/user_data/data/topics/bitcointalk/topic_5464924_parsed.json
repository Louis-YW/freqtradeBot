  "content": "Haven't updated ledger live in months.  Am still using ledger live 2.57.0.  The current ledger live is 2.66.Do I just update it from ledger live in the top right and it should update it without any issue?  Or because it's a much older version of ledger live, there would be issues and I have to download it directly from ledger site?  I remember a long time ago, there was an instance where if your ledger live was older than so and so version... you had to download ledger live manually from ledger website because it wouldn't download the update correctly from ledger live.  Also is there anything you need to do during the update because I recall there was that service ledger introduced which most people did not want to do.Am using a nano ledger s plus.",

Not only that, the company does not care about their user's privacy and the hardware wallet part is close source.",

Give it up, read your own post history instead of asking the same thing over and over again.Wait for it, I'll go on a reporting spree now. Enjoy.",
