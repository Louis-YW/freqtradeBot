  "content": "Today's world is unquestionably digital. The world we live in has completely changed because to new technology, like digital twins, artificial intelligence, and GPS systems.Hold tight if the pace of change makes you sick. The pace will only increase. Disruptive technologies are emerging at an increasingly rapid rate and are altering our way of life. You can act like a digital native today even if you're not one. People in their mid-life are maintaining their social media accounts and using Fitbit to monitor their workout routines. Seniors are favoring FaceTime over phone lines and iPads over newsprint.With the average person in the globe spending more time staring at a screen than sleeping, more and more of us are spending more and more time online.New business models are emerging as a result of the same technologies, with companies employing digital to produce and monetize new types of value. More often than not, new cross-sector, outcome-based propositions rather than customary sector-specific products and services are used to generate this value. Businesses that can provide clients customized, on-demand goods and services stand to benefit.",
