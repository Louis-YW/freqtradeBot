As we are aware most clubs are currently signing new contracts, what do you think about all of that, and what are the expectations of football fans. Let's hear your personal views and predictions.",

Anyways the attention of the moderator has been called to lock this thread to avoid spamming the board with repeated discussion and double thread existence.",
