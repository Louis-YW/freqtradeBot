      "body": "Bitcoin used to peak in value during the black friday and christmas holiday season. The 1st quarter of the year is usually when there is a lull in transaction volume, which is when bitcoin historically declines in value.With the exception of the latest drop in bitcoin value, bitcoin has exhibited considerably less volatility than stocks, bonds and forex. If we're discussing market mechanic based influence on crypto prices, its certainly an interesting discussion we will have. The evolution and shifts of crypto price trends has certainly been an interesting ride for anyone who bothered to pay attention. The faces of crypto traders has certainly changed over time. With each shift and introduction of new trader classes, trends in crypto value have shifted. New amendments to crypto trading such as commission less trades in 2017 also have exhibited a noticeable effect. As has the introduction of stablecoins like tether.What will the next few years hold in store for crypto as an asset class. As some mentioned we have the upcoming halving which historically has been extremely bullish for btc.",

Most people will be interested in investing, but once the market begins to decline—which is normal given that we are experiencing a bear market—they may become impatient and pull out, so whenever investment advice is given, we should try to make it as clear as possible. In my experience, after investing and telling people to conduct research and give concrete explanations the following few weeks were very difficult. After providing the fundamentals, make a decision, that how I give my advice to people that want to invest.",

At least have their own analysis to suggest other people join in investing their money, we must realize in a situation like this many people keep the value of their money, which makes them be careful with spending their money. if it's just baseless speculation you better know what to do.This situation is indeed very difficult everywhere, I myself feel uneasy with what is circulating in the news for my assets in crypto and Bitcoin. but after twisting my mind, many major media have been reporting about crypto and Bitcoin since its rise in 2021, its popularity was unstoppable at that time, which made many new people from various parts of the world enter into trading. I think, more and more media reporting about the rise and fall of crypto and Bitcoin indirectly introduces it to ordinary people. My confidence increases because almost everyone in this world has a smartphone and television so it is easy to receive information circulating.I can't imagine what it would be like if Bitcoin started to rise significantly (bullish) from its slump (bearish) maybe it will reach its new ATH every week.I realize this will not go as expected, it will definitely take time and stages to achieve it. but now is a pretty good time to enter a market that not many people do.",

It can get even lower, but it's low enough now for nice profits in the future. Maybe Bitcoin will recover in 2023, but it's not unthinkable if it stays quite low throughout the year. But I believe it's reasonable to expect Bitcoin's full recovery to the previous ATH within more than two years from now. There's no guarantee it will happen, but given that 2022 has been a time of low pricing, I find it unlikely that Bitcoin remains low for 3 full years.",

You're not really investing when buying cryptocurrency, you're doing something more akin to speculating. It's not like buying into a company like Coca Cola, who have a steady history spanning almost a century with plenty of assets and fairly consistent sales figures year to year. You know what you're getting in that scenario, a cut of the profits from their sales which have been reliable over a large time span because they are producing and selling something to actively generate a profit. That is investing. Cryptocurrency is akin to buying any other currency and hoping that you can sell it on to someone else later on for a higher amount, which is FOREX trading and one of the riskiest things you can do with your money.",

Anyone who claims to be able to predict 100% of what will happen in the future while discussing cryptocurrency is lying because all of this is based on technical analysis. Analysis of the likelihood that what actually occurred four years ago will still occur because they have already experienced it multiple times Therefore, I won't appreciate it if you suggest that people invest just because Bitcoin or altcoins just  because they will huge there in 2014 for other reasons.Tell people that they will make big in crypto in 2014 is not ideal. Giving this kind of advice could result in people borrowing money or selling their properties in order to invest in cryptocurrencies because they want to it so big by 2024. Not advising individuals to invest large sums of money in bitcoin but  crypto rather to only invest what they can afford to lose. This kind advise that they will hit it big in cryptocurrency have lead some people in debt because some people thought is to hit over in few days more not knowing it will take some years if luckily they will make it crypto",

We all rely on history to predict the future so there is no 100% guarantee that it will happen and moreover we are going through a period of economic crisis and most likely a prolonged recession so things may not go as expected. Investing in bitcoin is a good long term investment but nothing is certain in 2024 so don't give advice to anyone but say they should do their own research and be responsible for the investment mine. But I will agree with you if you buy bitcoin now and hold it for long because bitcoin price is pretty cheap and in the long run wont let us down.",
