  "content": "All these platforms run on evm-compatible chains, so you can use metamask. Use instant exchanges like simpleswap to first get to Polygon (it's cheap) and thereon use bridges like bungee to move between chains. Have excluded a few which only had couple coins support. 1) Pika Protocol (Optimism): https://www.pikaprotocol.com/2) Helix (Injective): https://helixapp.com/Note: Use simpleswap to directly convert to Injective (don't select erc20 one).3) Perpetual Protocol (Optimism): https://app.perp.com/4) GMX (Arbitrum, Avalanche) : https://gmx.io/5) Vela Exchange (Arbitrum): https://app.vela.exchange/6) Kwenta (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC): https://kwenta.eth.limo/7) Gains Trade (Polygon, Arbitrum): https://gains.trade/8 ) Dydx (Ethereum): https://trade.dydx.exchange/9) Polynomial (Optimism): https://trade.polynomial.fi/",

The only one that I have seen before that OP mentioned is dYdX, but I am lazy today to do more research on the exchanges he listed, but I am sure they are decentralized exchanges as I can see Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche and the likes which are alternatives to ERC20 and BSC. They are smart chain exchanges which you can interact directly with on your noncustodial wallets without KYC. Point of correction, Binance is a KYC required exchange. Probably the last time you use Binance has been long ago, when the exchange has not made KYC mandatory. But in two years back or so, they made KYC mandatory, probably as a result of regulatory pressure. If you want no-KYC centralized exchanges, you can check this which was created by Ratimov: Current list of exchanges without KYCI have preferred Kucoin, but I also used OKX which is very good too, but Kucoin asked me for mobile phone number forcefully. I have used Huobi and I was unable to trade futures without KYC.",
