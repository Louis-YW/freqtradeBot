  "content": "Selling Movie and TV-Show websites.Back in the day some of this websites were making 100$+ a day. Now I don't have time for SEO and monetization therefore I'm selling them. I haven't touched website and monetization for last 1.5 years. You can easily earn 100$ a day from this website with a bit of SEO and set up right monetization.The website don't have any players installed or any video files included. You get only domain, wordpress backup of entire website and mysql db. You will receive as is.Some of this websites still have traffic and in total all 29 websites still making 200-400$ a months.
