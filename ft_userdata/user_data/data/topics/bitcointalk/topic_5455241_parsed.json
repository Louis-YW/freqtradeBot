Today I deposited some funds, played a few games and began to lose so I tried to make a withdrawal. I guess they didn't like that for some reason and flagged the withdrawal. They gave me mixed reasons as to why from random checks to accessing the site from a restricted area which isn't true because if the IP is blocked the site will not even load. Anyways, they are demanding kyc and I refuse so they will close my accountNever had this issue at any casino. Even ones I've logged onto from restricted areas, including LB. They refuse to complete my withdrawal so all funds are lost. I think they're just mad I tried to withdraw to another casino so quickly and have stolen my funds. Just a heads up, lucky block is not safe.",

Many casinos have an anti-mixing rule and will not allow you to withdraw if you have not met certain wagering requirements. In addition, it is becoming more and more common nowadays to put in the ToS that you may be required to KYC.Quote from: CryptoGamblingSites on June 06, 2023, 03:23:10 AM1. Curacao registered site What do you mean? Most of the ones advertised on the forum are licensed in Curaçao and I have played on several of them for some time without any problems.",

      "body": "If they are asking for KYC information then you should give them the information because nowadays most of the online casinos require that KYC information from the users and every user of the sites know that the casinos can change their T&C without any prior warnings. Your refusal to KYC might put your account and your funds at risk and you should better know that.Quote from: CryptoGamblingSites on June 06, 2023, 03:23:10 AMNever heard of this site, generally there are a couple of red flags here though: 1. Curacao registered site 2. Very little history/info on site 3. They appear to have a shitcoin called Lblock that has lost 99% of it's value in a year If we are technically good and are into online casino thing then it's a sure thing that almost every other casino site has the license from Curacao and if you are saying that a site that's registered in Curacao is a red flag then you're wrong with that assumption. And, there are many sites that start providing their services to customers and they don't have to be 5 years in the business.Sometimes a coin doesn't work very well and when it has no good utility it starts loosing its value over time, and I think the same is the case with that coin and if it lost it's value then that doesn't confirms that the site is a fraud or has something wrong.Back to OP, I recommend you to complete your KYC information and then ask them to unfreeze your withdrawals and record the process in the form of screen recording and screenshots and even after KYC they refuse to pay your money, then and only then you should create a scam accusation post against them so others could avoid such sites.",

I mean, you agreed to their ToS so you should know that they will ask you for KYC if they think it is reasonable. anyway, try posting this on casino.guru or askgamblers, they might be more of help.",

If they give KYC or any condition before withdrawal and you withdraw violating that condition then they can hide your money. You take live support help with them and hopefully your problem will be resolved. But one thing you must remember is to always use a trusted casino. Here are various trusted casino sites for gambling where you can participate in gambling by creating an account. The Lucky Block platform you are using here is not a trusted casino platform. Never heard of such a platform before. The Lucky Block platform has tokens that have been dumped 99% since a year ago. So from here it is understood that this platform is not very trustworthy.",

They also stated some consequences if players failed to do it, in this case you refuse to complete KYC. You have agreed with their ToS on registration so you need to follow it. If you have agreed it before but you do not follow it, you are the one who is responsible for any consequences including losing your funds.",

If I may ask you, did you not read their policy, terms and conditions of Service before getting involved with them. One thing you should know is that rules and regulations are dynamic, it can be changed irrespective of the time. I believe possibly when you registered a year ago probably there was no kyc and maybe they changed their ToS without you reading through hence they demanded you do a kyc. You should have done that with them rather than being adamant. It is a pity that your chances of getting your funds back is near impossible a the casino presence here in not noted.",

There’s a zero case here that become successful recovering their balance without undergoing KYC. Even accusing them for being scam will not gonna change the fact that only them can help you to recover ypur funds. Every casino ToS has a rules that they are allowed to imposed KYC whenever they want. You should read that ToS that you agree on.Probably you triggered their security on your withdrawal without completing the minimum wagering requirements.

Just a heads up, lucky block is not safe. Before you deposit money to the gambling service, you need to read their user agreement. If you want to do this, it is better to write to support with the question: do I need to pass the KYC in order to withdraw the money I won later. Because bad gambling services are ready to happily accept money from your losses, but they are in no hurry to give away the winnings. I had a case with a Russian poker casino when they refused to give me the winnings, asked for a photo passport. And even when I sent them this, they asked for other documents. It is clear that they were dragging their feet and acting on my nerves so that I would not want to withdraw money. It is better in the future to play at proven casinos, like Roobet.",
