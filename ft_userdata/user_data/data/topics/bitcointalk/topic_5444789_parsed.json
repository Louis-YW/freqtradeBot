The government and federal reserves backstopping the banks with the protection of assets above 250k. So we won't see more bank runs because people know that their money is protected now so banks are safe. Some people and media also say that the system broke and that means that federal reserves won't rise interest rates at the next meeting. And I think it's completely wrong. I think they will just rise rates for another 0.25% as a response to the SVB situation. The inflation is still pretty high and FED will keep fighting it, they can't afford to stop right now. So I think we will still see a lot more bankruptcies, there will be more layoffs and the stock market will keep suffering from that. This also means that bitcoin will probably find a new bottom.",

And what the fed did, still didn't stop the bank runs we had today. Look how many regional banks traded at negative double digits, pretty much like a repeat of that Covid crash day 3 years ago. I think they will pause and see what happens. If the CPI is still going to keep printing high and unemployment is going to go lower, then they will obviously have no choice but to reverse course. However so far their increase rate hikes is breaking things and they need to slow down.",

The fact that bank stocks price is going down does not mean that they are hit by bunk run. It only means that investors are scared that it will continue.What FED did is they simply changed a bank investments into YOLO trades. As a bank, you either make a good investment and profit or bad investment and be bail-out. We leave in a YOLO times right now. All 3 banks that went bust did terrible mistake in their balance sheet.Just like OP. I don't think that it will affect rate hikes.",

This will cause banks with less capital to bankrupt. So i am agreed with you. more interests are definetly going to be increased because they want to increase their interest profits. but I do not know what plan they have to deal it with later.I was wondering how this increment in interest will help SVB's situation because as far as i think it will give borrowers a reason not to take loans from SVB which in a result reduces their Interest Profits. i think is it, giving people not chosen for being independent of taking interests from banks.Overall, these banks are taking advantage of people's needs by giving them or i do not know how to buy by convincing them to take interest so that their plans could succeed. because the more the condition of the economy will go down the more will people came to take loans and the more interest and profits they will make.",

Who tells you that a bailout is certainly going to happen if no bank runs happened for a long time? The \"what if\" will always be around and systemic risk is no constant either, it can change over time. Banks and financial institutions in general also know a lot more about state finances than the average individual person. If they sense faulty tendencies within the system, they also know that a situation where even the (indebted) government gets overwhelmed is not impossible. It's not like everyone now thinks forever that because the government protected assets yesterday, they will do it without a doubt forever in the future. Lehmann Brothers are a good example that bailouts might be denied. I think that these bailouts produce very, very bad incentives for big financial players because there are two mechanisms that a bank must pursue in order to never go bankrupt. 1) become very large and interconnected2) load up the systemic relevance gained through 1) with leverage / risk and you turn your institution into the house with an edge even over the government. It is not \"make\" or \"break\", it's \"make\" or \"nothing happens\". As is stated here, AIG was bailed out while Lehmann was not because AIG was several times more interconnected than Lehmann. That's where the problem kicks in as I mentioned above. Banks have an incentive to become systemically relevant and then go all in. Credit Suisse had a series of scandals, the consequences of which are devastating. Cutting 9,000 jobs means 9,000 people are left behind. The chain reactions of these events have a bigger impact than is often portrayed in the media. But nobody is even interested in all this stuff anymore. It's part of our daily lives. Bailouts, banks crashing, sometimes not even worth the articles. But pumping up some Bitcoin news is worth the headlines. It is more interesting for people to read what this new thing is doing. That's probably not even a bad sign.",

Elections are close.I am not the biggest expert on this topic, but if I understand the issue at hand correctly, it is not only a liquidity crisis because of securities that have not matured. The banks' equity capital took some serious hits because they have unrealized losses on their balance sheets of $620 billion at yearend 2022. But you are right as the report says that once the banks are going to sell those securities below their face values, they do indeed have liquidity issues as their cash flows are way below what was initially planned or expected. That's interesting and I wonder why so many big and experienced banks get into trouble so easily when actually they should know better in the first place. But the risk is worth it, they can play the lottery day in day out because they get saved anyway.",
