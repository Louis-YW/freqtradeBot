Combine these two points and Bitcoin is bound to surpass goldI don't know if what you say is true and what the future of bitcoin will be. But as of now, the capitalization of gold is 20 times that of bitcoin so it is definitely safer than bitcoin. Moreover, why does bitcoin surpass gold? While both are different, one is a physical asset, and the other is a digital asset. And both also have different use cases. Bitcoin doesn't need to surpass anyone to prove anything, given what it has and gives us, suffice it to say it's amazing.",

The same applies to Bitcoin. The number of bitcoin that will be mined is less than the bitcoin currently in existence, and then it is the users who will give the price a value if the demand increases. Increased demand is what will determine the future direction of Bitcoin just as it did for gold.",

Bitcoin is completely credit-free and is managed through blockchain technology, which makes it difficult to be controlled by governments or financial institutions. Bitcoin is very convenient for online transactions and often has faster and cheaper transactions than traditional payment methods.The comparison between Bitcoin and gold to determine the average value in the future is quite difficult. Factors such as price movements, global economic conditions, new projects and technologies can affect the value of both assets. With its advantages, it is not unrealistic for Bitcoin to surpass gold in the near future, but cannot be underestimated nor easily derided.

Bitcoin is man-made and like anything that was made by men, it may or may not fail. I know it is ultimately based on math but look at the latest Ordinals/NFT stuff happened... the network was already crowded enough and NFT's made it even worse. What makes you think that the next update won't break bitcoin for good? We can't know that. No matter how many hours you test the software before the launch, there is still a chance that you will find a bug later on...Every new update makes bitcoin more complicated and more prone to the new attack vectors. Segwit was cool but now the btc network is starting to look like a total mess.Gold on the other hand has been running the same software (which is physics) since day 0. Never had an update because it never needed any. I think that's a big achievement over crypto.If God had made Bitcoin, he would have made it so perfect that it wouldn't need any updates in the future...",

I do also view that Bitcoin do not need to surpass gold because of these differences; it just needs to be as is. Bitcoin is really a profitable asset but is it enough criteria to make it the greatest? It has its pros and cons just like other investments but we should keep in mind that it is still a currency that should be used in transactions. It happened that at the present it is more often viewed as something which is just profitable.",
