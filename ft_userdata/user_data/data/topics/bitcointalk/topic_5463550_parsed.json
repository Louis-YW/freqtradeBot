If yes, you can start by signing a message from the wallet to prove that you own that account and not just a random stranger claiming that they own that account because the password and email was changed. Aside from this text you have written in this thread is there any other proof that you‚Äôre the real owner of the said account?And another thing to note. Using curse words does not increase the chance of you gettin your account unlocked, instead it could make others think that you‚Äôre only here to troll and not actually interested in getting your account back.",

Either way Fuck you.¬† I don't really know much about you, but the way of your posting shows that you're still immature as a person. I don't think that theymos has anything to do with the ones who have lost access to their accounts. If you still have your e-mail address then you might get access to your account if the e-mail of the account is still same. However, if someone has stolen the account from you and has changed the e-mail of the account then you may not be able to get that account back that way. Another way that most of the users suggested you is to recover your account if you have access to the address that you might have stacked during the times when you still had access to that account. But, still you can do something like that if you still have those addresses in your control and if you have lost access to those as well then I'm sure you won't get your main account back.Instead of requesting theymos, you're saying wrong words to him. That's not a proper way to get access to your account, and if you continue your such behavior then you'll be called as a troll and spammer. I recommend you to change your behavior and try to request theymos and other staff members in a proper and respectful way.",
