      "body": "Analysing the interest rate from the bank, each year I get a 3% interest which equals up to a $3,000 increment yearly. But with bitcoin at 17,000 at purchase time in a year if bitcoin grows up with a 1,000 price up (moves to $18,000) I will have my assest increased by 6,000 or so. And with bitcoin price at this low I expect it to get higher than that In year. Further more since it is an amount I could do away with I will readily invest it in a thing that stores my value. With it been in the bank I could face devaluation of that currency over time.",

So in this case, I will choose 20% to deposit in the bank and 80% will invest in bitcoin and gold. I want to diversify my assets and don't want to focus it all on one area, although Bitcoin can be more profitable but it takes a long time to achieve, so I don't want to be passive in investing.",

It depends on what’s your goal with your free money. I assume the subject has a good steady income for having this huge free money. The answer will always be an objective one based on the person perspective. For me, I will invest on business the 50,000$ then put the rest on Bitcoin. There’s no sense to stay the money on the bank since you have a steady income to cover all your expenses and necessities. There’s nothing to lose here so I will choose to venture out on investment opportunities that will give high return rather than put on the bank with minimal APY. Assuming Bitcoin bear market will last up to 3 years. You can still earn more on Bitcoin investment rather the bank because you profit on bank is limited only to 3% per year while Bitcoin is limitless.",

People invest on what they have interest and know about, therefore it will be difficult to convince a hater of bitcoin to invest in it, he will obviously be looking at the depreciation or drop times and calculating it as lost but not knowing that with time it will go back to profit. To invest in bitcoin is the best compared to keep your money in the bank and expect just $3,000 as return in a year when you invest $100,000. If you buy bitcoin now at $17,000, you can be sure of $50,000 turn over soon after halving.",

Regarding what I would do with $100k, I would probably buy bitcoin immediately with part of the money (maybe some gold too), then set aside a 2nd part to continue doing DCA and keep the 3rd part in cash as you never know what future brings.

You might as well go to a casino with $50k as you will certainly have more fun while having similar chances to profit in the end.",

Our bank has only a 0.5% interest rate, but let's say it's 3%. Well, $100K is huge, so my plan is not to put all eggs in one basket, 50% of it goes to bitcoin, and the other 50 is on additional investment such as business or time deposit in the bank so that it would be safe. I know most of the answer here goes to bitcoin since we are in the bitcoin community, but bitcoin is risky, so to play safe, do not go all into the bitcoin as this is the most investors say, but if you are risk taker then go ahead invest all.",

There are two things here that need to be done wisely. First investing wisely means that you need to invest in bitcoin and/or in good altcoins and also do the dollar cost average. Second wise thing is to store your bitcoin and crypto in a safe place. If you store your investment in centralized wallets or exchanges, then you are carrying the risk with your investment which can go to zero if those platforms scam exits.",

Investment is always the way to go if we want maximum profit.  Besides the bank interest cannot compensate to the deflation of value of money so it is wise to look for an investment that has a higher return.  Looking at the option, investing in Bitcoin would be the better action to choose.  If we look at the percentage growth of Bitcoin, it beats the 3% annual interest offered by bank and in addition we still have the access to the fund if we save Bitcoin in our own wallet.Profit aside, I believe it is always better to have control over our money.  If we put our money in bank we lost our control.  The bank then have the power over our money. But in Bitcoin , if we invest in it and keep it in our wallet, we have a 100% access and control to our fund 24/7 which we don't have if we put our money to the bank.",
