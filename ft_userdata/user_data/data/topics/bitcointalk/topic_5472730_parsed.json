  "content": "Introduction:The adoption of cryptocurrency has seen a well hiked up growth in recent years, as seasoned investors and newcomers looking to have good profit from the digital world. While in this unexpected world of cryptocurrency, investors face a crucial decision: whether to rely on information of social media platforms or should conduct their own research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research). I hope this topic would be interesting to talk about the recommendations of putting the well-balanced decision in b/w “Social media or DYOR” approaches to follow.Social Media Hype:There are many social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and various online forums where communities have been created to spread information about the discussion of cryptocurrency. Sometime these discussions are created to catch the investors in the traps and on the other hand, some fair social media communities are created for just the benefits of investors where investors can have real time information. These are some pros and cons of relying on social media for crypto investment information.Pros:Quick Updates: Social media provides quick updates. For example, market trends, news, and the latest happenings in the world of cryptocurrency.Fair Community Insights: There are many social media platforms where worthy communities have been created so that investors can join and have wisdom of the crypto community, which can offer them a valuable perspectives and insights.Quick Accessibility: As we know that information on social media is freely available for those people who are interested in crypto world. They can join many communities as many they want to join which means social media communities are quick accessible for the investors.Cons:Leading Misinformation: Many of the times social media information created just to mislead & misguide and to create fake hype in the market of cryptocurrency. Following these wrong advices can lead to big losses.Emotional Traps: There are many emotional traps which are created on social media that can be play its role to emotionally charge to investors. Which in response investors make impulsive decisions based on the traps like FUD (Fear, uncertainty, doubt), and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).DYOR (Do Your Own Research)DYOR is the most important fundamental principle in the cryptocurrency world, which emphasize the importance of personal research. DYOR can help you to get more information and knowledge.Pros:Confident Decision-Making: Conducting your own research will allows you to fetch well-informed decisions based on facts, rather than relying on rumors or fake hype which are created to get trap investors.Reduce Risk: When you do your research properly this will help you to reduces the chances of falling prey to scams of fake social media hypes.Cons:Time Consuming: DYOR is the time-consuming part because to fetch more accurate data you need to do Comprehensive research.Complexity: We know the fact that Crypto projects can be highly technical, which makes it a big challenge for newcomers to understand them totally.img sourceimg sourceWe can see the report of scams due to social media which is reduced by 2022. Maybe be it is due to the DYOR people are getting aware of many scams.i could not find the report of 2023 if you guys find it anywhere please mentioned me here. Thanks Conclusion:In the world of cryptocurrency, I would say combination of both social media and DYOR is the best recommended decision to follow like if we see any hype or news on social media, we must conduct DYOR for that to verify that it is real or fake? and we should avoid impulsive decisions. By combining both approaches and following the recommendations aforementioned, investors can have benefits in the crypto landscape more effectively, minimize the risk and rate of success can be increased.Disclaimer: This topic is self written and i did research about the report to know that what is the ratio of scams due to social media Which is now impressive than before.",

You can hardly get verified informations from  the social media, to be on safe side it to never take social media information serious not until you do your own research about it through verified channel's. Making an independent research and study is a weapon any serious crypto user has against scammers and fake news that may cause fomo or lead you into bad investment.",

One thing is avoid those influencers on social media, most are paid just to advertise shitcoins.",

But come to think of it, it is only short term investors that needs to always do their research because they are looking for the altcoin that they want to invest in for quick profit or bitcoin traders, that want to male quick profit that can fall for these social media influencers.A bitcoin hodler that is on a long term investment and is also increasing his bitcoin through regular DCA will only need to prepare and set aside 10% or 5% based on his income. This is to enable him take care of all necessary needs and emergency with the rest. All he needs to do is to learn the basic knowledge of bitcoin which is to invest in a long term and how to buy bitcoin and transfer to his self custodial wallet from an exchange because he doesn't need any news to deprive him from accumulating because he buys bitcoin no matter the price of bitcoin at that moment. Only invest in bitcoin for a long term will and save yourself from much risk and fake news from social media.",

As we don't know the absolute truth behind their promotion, but we can do our own research if they are legit or not.Most social media influencers these days are being paid, so they will say what they are hired for. The good thing is with a lot of resources that you can find over the net, you can educate yourself on basically any subject you want to check with.",

When an average joe searches for information, he will ask Google, so add how to do DYOR would be better because just as scammers mislead information on Twitter and Reddit, they can write some articles and make them appear first in search engines. If you search for keywords such as BEST BITCOIN WALLET, you will find that Exodus appears first, and you may get an article telling you to avoid Electrum because it is not safe.Some articles about hardware wallets favor Ledger.DYOR is not enough if one does not know what one is looking for and has a basic ability to filter information or at least suggest forums like Bitcointalk.",

Saying that a person should do their own research without taking the necessary steps to explain where and how fraud can be detected is tantamount to a pat on the back and a message to take care of oneself. Not exactly sincere help. But the person who saw the news on social networks about a colorful project, supposedly giving prizes to everyone, and also saw admiring reviews from bots, unaware that he was being deceived, will rush to participate in order to catch the train. It is necessary to explain to newcomers that there are and will not be such gifts for which they will not pay. It is better to tell the hard truth and the stories of those people who ended badly, so that every beginner is afraid of stumbling and is always skeptical about any freebie.",

It is so helpful to have it as a first thinking before making any decision because with it, you won't trust anyone, any information without checking. The bottom line is this, checking what you see, read, hear to detect in accuracy in it if possible.I agree with you that a newbie must learn from senior people, experts but with DYOR attitude and actual practice with it, a newbie can improve his knowledge very quickly and soon will become more knowledgeable.A simple example is learning English, with English - English dictionary. By checking one word meaning, you will learn so many more vocabularies and it is a free booster for your learning progress.Bitcointalk is a good forum to start learning about Bitcoin, I can not disagree.  Back to OP's points, social media influencers usually follow a market trend and give their followers most trending information. After the trend is broken, what they said a few weeks ago will become wrong but their followers will soon forget about it.",

A wise person is one who knows how to conduct research that provides him with the most reliable information possible, and thus gives sufficient time to research the sources of information that he finds.In the field of crypto in general, I have a lot of confidence in the bitcointalk forum because in the most extreme cases, if I do not find satisfactory search results, I can create a topic in which I ask about what I want, and there are good members who will provide appropriate advice without hesitation.",

Anyone with some basic understanding will see that those coins are scams or doomed. So analyzing social media trends is actually a viable DYOR in crypto if you can predict where the hype will flow next, you just shouldn't ever allow yourself to genuinely believe in the coin that you are buying (if it's not BTC).",

It happens most of the time like the first link on google can be misleading Because they are using some kind of sources to promote their website to be show at the top when user is searching for some desired thing. In This way, they use Some trending keywords for their misleading link to be rank on the top of the page. I myself have seen alot of links like this and also seen those people who begin to think that they really get these rewards but the bad part is that they don't do any kinda research before clicking on the links So I would say DYOR is very Important.
