  "content": "If Bitcoin becomes widespread enough that most people hold their savings in it, then it will greatly and permanently reduce liquidity in the financial system, lead to a decrease in consumer spending and cause major ructions in the global economy. People part with their money easily these days because in the back of their heads they know that what they have in their hand right now, will be worth far less in the future due to inflation. So they spend their money on gratifying goodies now rather than save it for later when, due to a negative real return, it will be worth less. In a Bitcoin world this behavior is reversed. People will understand the resilient and long lasting value of their Bitcoin and not want to part with it unless they are getting something very favourable in return. The psychological hurdle to spending money will be raised in each individual's mind.This change in the mass consumer psychology that is so important and relevant in the world today will lead to a liquidity crunch. Central banks usually solve the problem of a liquidity crunch by printing money and lending it out cheaply but they won't be able to do this as faith in fiat currencies will already have been so severely degraded by Bitcoin's ascendancy. There will be no answer to people becoming more prudent with how they spend their hard earned bitcoin. It will simply shrink the economy.In my opinion this will be a good thing as so much of the economic \"growth\" we see in the world today is a vacuous re-packaging of frivolous fancies to meet imaginary needs fueled by an incentive to spend currency that is always losing value. Things that satisfy a genuine pressing need will continue to be invented, bought and sold and this is all that is necessary for a vibrant healthy economy.",

However, there are people who are into trading of Bitcoin than people who are willing to hold it. So the money still circulates around because a lot of people are still willing to sell. As long's there is needs, wants, merriments, vacations and emergencies then people will tap into their Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Bitcoin about challenging the accepted wisdom on money and you're scared about less spending? Good. Perhaps we will start investing in things that truly matter instead of wasting money on garbage we don't need. Regarding this whole liquidity issue, sure, it causes worry. But you have to understand, Bitcoin is evolving faster than most people can even comprehend. Like the early years of the internet. Think back on how slow and awkward it was. Now take another look at it. Likewise for BitcoinEmbracing Bitcoin is not about shrinking the economy. It's about growing the proper way with actual value, not only figures on a screen. It's about turning our attention from consumption without thought to deliberate investment. It's about realizing that things that last, not the newest trends, define actual riches. Thus, friends, let yourself unwind. Bitcoin will save the economy - it will not bring it down",

Nice write up OP this should really should bring mixed reactions from the community for a healthy debate/discussion.And I want to agree with you on the possibility of a liquidity reduction should a widespread Bitcoin adoption happen...but then again one of the qualities of money is scarcity, for as long as the central banks aren't printing money to cause inflation then in some way this actually gives fiat value and not liquidity reduction. Btw, think of it as Bitcoin being a savings account that the banks will benefit from such that the fiat equivalent of holding BTC can easily  be pumped back into the economy to address other business which makes this a win wins scenario, so no need for alarm I guess.As of consumer spending, it really depends on several factors tbh such as inflation, buying power of fiat or crypto, otherwise Bitcoin doesn't really have this influence over people's spending as its pretty much a parallel economy.",

As much as I might want to agree that all that you have said does make a lot of sense, it's still important you understand that the acceptance of bitcoin into the mainstream financial market won't in any way shrink the economy of any country, expect for countries who's economy has or had been previously bad.Bitcoin is another form of money, and there is no way (not even in the next 30 or 40 years) that Bitcoin will completely wipe out fiat, both will co-exist in harmony, and this is because, people are still going to be needing fiat to invest in bitcoin, which is a means through which bitcoin will become more valuable, and those that live in rural areas where internet is a big problem; are always going to need fiat for their day to day buying and selling transactions.Every economy will go on as normally, the only thing I see is that alot alot of people are definitely going to be pumping alot of fiat into bitcoin, which may cause the central banks to print even more.",

Are you trying to make us believe that people would never buy a new car if they weren't inclined to do so by inflation, or that they would never buy food if they had vehicles that permanently increase their purchasing power? Every time my sister makes a dumb purchase she defends it by saying her money won't be worth anything in the future so she may as well spend it now. I do not believe she is an isolated case, and her reasoning isn't wrong either. People, even those who don't know what QE is, intuitively have come to understand that their money will be FAR less valuable in the future. The only way to combat that is to invest but most people think of investing as difficult and risky, so their bias is to spend all of their available income. Bitcoin provides an incentive for people to save their money, the incentive being that their bitcoin won't lose value systematically. This incentive does not exist for fiat due to negative real interest rates and future pending QE. A world in which Bitcoin achieves mass adoption will clearly impact people decisions on what to buy, how much to buy, and at what price. People will of course still buy the necessities such as food and a car but the psychological hurdle to clear before buying frivolous items will be raised. And of course, economic growth depends exclusively on the sale of increasingly frivolous items.",

The current concept governments have on how an economy should work is totally despicable. They profit from the ignorance and compulsivity of individuals who are likely to live an entire life without making any significant financial progress, because they spend more than they earn in worthless stuff, endorsed by celebrities and influencers they put on an altar. And there are very few people with enough reach to try teaching something different to the masses, as the most influential ones just want to maintain the gears of the system working smoothly.It's not possible to say if the scenario you mentioned would be the solution for the current problems we face.

It will simply shrink the economy.I don't get what you mean by when a consumer's psychology will be changed from buying less. I mean they will prefer to buy BTC for long-term investments but they still have to spend money on their daily needs which means they don't have to spend all of their money in BTC but have to keep some money in liquid form that they could use to meet daily expenses. And how the change in the psychology of consumers is going to crunch liquidity and which liquidity are you talking about, I mean if you are talking about fiat then you also mentioned such a problem can be faced in fiat via lending and printing more money, etc.Overall, people can't just survive by holding BTC in their wallets, they need food, a roof, have to pay bills, etc. So to meet all the expenses they can't just rely on there funds in the form of BTC because in the long run BTC does give profit but in the short term BTC can also make you loss. And a person with mindset of keeping no funds for emergency cases, is consider idiotic because investing in one coin is extremely risky especially when you are spending it all.

Millionaires and billionaires today hold the most in long-term investments, but still, it's millionaires who spend the most money. This is to tell you that holding Bitcoin won't affect the way people spend negatively. People who hold Bitcoin also spend money. They have bills to pay too, they go on vacations and throw parties, and they have kids to take care of. The world is not good to abandon all these things simply because they want to hold Bitcoin, it'll be simply business as usual, most likely better because this time, people have more money to spend because they have gotten more from their profits on Bitcoin.No economy will collapse.",
