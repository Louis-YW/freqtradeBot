Because you will need to withdraw your money after trading, even with loss you will always need withdrawal.Some exchanges charge high withdrawal fee that is harmful for your capital, if it is small, it causes more loss on your capital from withdrawal fee.https://www.cryptowisser.com/exchanges/Cryptowisser.com has its table for information like this.",

In trading what you consider before choosing an exchange that you want to use to trade is the reputation and for how long had it be existing and also this size of the exchange. Binance is the biggest exchange and they also have low fee which will not be a problem for traders to use in their trading activities. All you need to do is to register but before that make sure that you have read their ToS and understand it to see if you are cool with them. Don't leave your coins in an exchange because they are like a market place and you can loss your coins at anytime.",

If those other exchanges are known to have a risk, that may not be known yet, so anyone who uses them will only be in a worse position.That should not have been shared here, friend. There are many legitimate exchange platforms that we can see that are top-listed on CoinmarketCap, Coinecko, and Crypto.com; just shop there from the ones I mentioned.",

Why do you want to test something you have no idea about? If you don't have time to read through their terms and conditions, why not go for reputable ones? The minimum deposit, withdraw and fees are always visible when you click on deposit and select the coin you want to deposit. I know dealing with exchange is a risk on it own but taking a calculated risk is advisable. Although, I'm not saying the exchange is bad but I must admit that this is my first time hearing about it and from the majority of comment above me, the exchange looks strange. It's not hard to register on reputable exchanges, so I will advice you to look for one and register.",

For any centralized exchange it's minimum 10$ I think. They will charge some trading fees too though they're very small for a 10-dollar trade. Using a dex doesn't require trading fees you only pay for the approval and transaction fees.",

It depends on the rules of the exchanger. But if you want to start trading you should start with minimum $100. Because if you trade with such amount you will not be able to profit much from trading.  But if you are completely new to trading then you can start with $10 to understand trading.",

If this is just another lame way to promote the exchange by the owners, then believe me it won’t work. Else if you legitimately wants to know the information, then let me suggest you to trade at more trusted exchange. You can try trading at Binance and Kucoin. Both are present in the market for many years. So here you can trade safely. Now regarding the minimum amounts, then it completely depends on the coin which you are buying or selling. Don’t worry these exchanges FAQ sections have all the informations that you want.",

Also, if you are trading, the amount of your asset will determine your level of profit. If your asset is very small, you might not really archive a huge profit, but it is just small, and while risking your asset, it should at least be on a good CEX that has at least gained a better reputation.",
