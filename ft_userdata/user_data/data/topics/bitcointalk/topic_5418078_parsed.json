It could even happen unintentionally, as a result of data they amass that one may not be aware of, which can eventually get leaked. Hell, you’ve even got to be wary of text prediction options.",

And to be honest, I even get a strange behavior back then when I was using Touchpal keyboard. Not sure if the theme that I downloaded was malicious ones or it is the Touchpal itself.Aside from what was mentioned above me, you might also try to avoid those random USB keyboard that are capable of being connected to your Android phone if you can avoid it. Those have some weird behavior that I do not understand wtf is happening to my phone, lol. Good thing is that I do not involve any seed phrase nor any sensitive information in my phone.",

      "body": "There's at least 4 ways I can think of a smart phone keyboard being attacked:1. The physical hardware of either a USB or Bluetooth keyboard (lots work without special drivers but if you need a special adapter for it then that can also carry malware as well as the keyboard itself being able to connect to the Internet via the phone to relay information).2. The most likely way is downloading a keyboard with additional features that comes with malware that can see what you type as you type it in your keyboard..3. Downloading some sort of app that allows for accessibility or productivity improvements and giving it access to your keyboard.4. Anything that can record or log what's going on on your screen (including the coordinates of where touches happen) but this one is easiest to do if something like predictive text is also installed and shows suggestions to the attacker.",

Developers know what they are doing as they make virtual keyboard to popup when you are writing your seed phrase while setting up a wallet on Android devices. You will notice that on wallet like mobile Electrum.  I was going to say, it doesn't make a lot of difference to have them words pop up in setting up your wallet either new creation or importing the wallet with the seeds on your device but in fact, it does make some difference as it pops up a set of words that could make the hacker have wide guess at almost 12 or 24 words in a phrase. That could be exhausting.It's therefore of importance you don't tend to write all your seeds out but source out the words from the pop ups after inputing the closest characters.Also, while being careful on links you click, also avoid downloading the fancy keyboards out there as some of them could be bugged to mirror your data's as you type. Always be okay with your device's default keyboard.",

Yes, I have friend with a case that when he copied his ronin wallet(axie infinity wallet) the address that been copied is exactly identical to his but to his surprise there is a few changes at the end of his wallet which means theres a malware infected on his cellphone. It did happened also on other users, so those scammers are literally good at spreading those infected files. Not sure how, but of course there is something related to download.",

The rule of thumb I go with when a device is potentially infected with a virus or malware is to assume that all systems are possibly compromised. Assuming the extent of the breach and the resulting damage to security and privacy could be misleading and lead to losses.Safest alternative, use an airgapped device for sensitive information like wallet address etc.",

Android phones to be precise. Not only these hacks can happen, but they are also continually happening as more and more users enter this new field and download dubious applications from the google scam store. These malicious applications may take control of your operating system and inject malware, keyloggers, and trojans of a different kind without you ever noticing it. Of course, until bad things happen and your crypto holdings get stolen by these evil applications. For example, two years ago or so,  android clipboard-hijacking malware called \"Clipper\" was found in Google Play Store. This malware would replace cryptocurrency addresses with ones belonging to an attacker.

Instead of having that, why not simply using a hardware wallet? It is much safer and more convenient than any other option you can have for your smartphone.Of course, picking the right hardware wallet is important. Of course, setting up correctly and safely that hardware wallet is even more important. But then one has the funds secure in a convenient manner.PS. Even if one uses HW, he has to be careful when doing copy/paste. Clipboard malware can still exist, but a bit of carefulness fixes that.",

Android phones to be precise. It doesn't matter the kind of device in use copy and paste malware attack can be found anywhere but most predominantly common to PC, this type of an attack is very dreadful to left you unaware except if such user is quite aware that whenever you make use of the clipboard function, you must ensure to always check if the address copied and paste tally with the original one, you can do so by checking the first few letters that begin the address and the last few ones that end the address as well to tally from the original one, it can happens on mobiles ad well but mostly common with computers, read better on this aspect from: How to lose your Bitcoins with CTRL-C CTRL-V which is a thread by LoyceV that talks more on the needful things to do in identifying such and how to prevent the attack.",

Furthermore, the majority naively believe that everything in the PlayStore is safe and harmless, and what about those who install apps from unknown sources, bypassing the protection that protects them from potential malicious apps?In a nutshell, anyone looking for trouble by behaving irresponsibly in their online activities will find it sooner or later, whether it's a PC or smartphone. Do you want to protect your critical information? It's simple, never enter them into any device that you even suspect may be compromised - use cold storage, hardware wallets or computers that are completely separate from your daily online activities.",
