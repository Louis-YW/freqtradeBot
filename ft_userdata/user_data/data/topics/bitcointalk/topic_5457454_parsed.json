In addition the attorneys agree and pundits who are smarter than us both... so could careless what nonsense you try to assert. Â Its clear who stole it where else did he get the 100+ btc from cant even account for it. Â So well see when the exchanges are subpoenaed, more so it was not MTGOX as all the funds were accounted for prior to this and marked. Â More so who do you think pointed it out to tokenviewÂ  Â  but their assessment is incorrect.Â  That being said you being his friend i could careless what you say which my claim was legit so realize that and stop trying to say otherwise. What else are you going to try and be biased on? oh ya everything.... Mixers are money laundering maybe you need to look it up yourself ... and the cases of which the owners who were convicted of Â doing that .. coinninja just to name one ... go do your own research. More nonsense i see.. but opinions are like assholes everyone has one.. good thing there are lawyers to straighten things out. So what if i was helping someone with this...better than spouting nonsense. Anyways im done with this nonsense... Â  Â  Â  again thanks to everyone besides stalker which seems like a fitting name.

Another thing is that you can not use transaction or transaction hash to determine the wallet it goes to.
