The judge made findings of fact that Dr Wright’s original case on serious harm (supported by a statement of truth), his written witness statement on that issue (also supported by such a statement) and his oral evidence on the matter (given on oath) were all deliberately false.QuoteThe libel here was not that Dr Wright “is not Satoshi”. It was that Dr Wright had made fraudulent claims, in other words that he had deceived or tried to deceive the public about his status. The sting of the libel was one of dishonesty.More damning quotes to go with all the damning quotes from the original trial. Love to see it.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on July 26, 2023, 10:36:16 AMAlthough it's weird the verdict say faketoshi (the claimant) deserve 1 EUR.The original trial was not whether or not CSW's claims about being Satoshi were true (they obviously are not), but whether McCormack had hurt CSW's feelings by calling out his bullshit. Since McCormack was technically guilty of that, then CSW won that trial. But since CSW is so completely full of shit, the judge awarded him only £1 in damages. My understanding is that by letting CSW \"win\" the trial, the judge closed off some avenues of appeal which CSW would otherwise have abused. CSW is now appealing on the grounds that he should have been awarded thousands in damages instead, and three higher up judges have all just agreed with the original judge, so all he gets is £1.Still waiting and hoping the he is also forced to pay McCormack's legal fees.",

Or what.. Please  I will like someone to clarify me on that.The legal battle has been a long one since 2019 and a past judgment mandated Peter McCormack to pay fakatoshi Craig Wright about around £900,000 to cover the latter's legal fees. Another court judgment reduced the damages to  £1 because Justice Chamberlain found that Faketoshi included false evidence in his claims. The current judgment upheld the £1 judgment of the other court. So Craig Wright will only receive an amount that cannot afford candy. It is really sad to see that people want to gain attention and acquire wealth fraudulently. But this judgment is a piece of good news to the true lovers of Bitcoin. I know my Faketoshi will seek other legal means to continue his quest for attention and criminality.",

Not to mention he is massively in debt and his lifestyle is being entirely propped up by the handful of rich idiots he has managed to fool or are complicit in his lies in the hope of future gains.
