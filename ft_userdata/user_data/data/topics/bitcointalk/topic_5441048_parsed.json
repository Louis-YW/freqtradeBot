  "content": "We all know that all citizens in all corners of the world must be taxpayers. Let me say about taxes in my country:1. vehicle taxObliged to pay once a year, but there are also those who do not pay and the authorities also do not come to the taxpayer's house and in the end it is left abandoned2. Land taxOnce a year the authorities will come to the taxpayer's house to collect taxes3. Income taxThis will be my concern this time, whether all countries treat the same rules or not, I want to hear from all of you.Income tax in my country in general will be very effective for employees of government agencies, offices and entrepreneurs. Let's say this, everyone earns whether it's from farming, freelancing, or any kind of work that isn't recorded at the tax office, if they don't report it to the tax authorities then they are exempt from tax. However, there is a provision that if someone has ever borrowed a large amount of money from a bank, even though the borrower was not notified by the taxpayer at first, in the end he was exposed to the taxpayer's accumulation of taxes over the years and he didn't know.I mean this tax regulation seems uneven and it seems that people who have to pay taxes are people who deal with large amounts of money. Let's say a farmer in 1 harvest (3-4 month) earns $2000, he will remain tax free if not registered or he doesn't register it whereas an employee from the start is already registered with the taxpayer even though their monthly salary is $300. What do you think? I'm a little confused with this tax rule.",

A self employed person is submitting his identity on the freelance website, so the site already collected all of his identity and how much he make for every day/month/year. I believe the site is working together with the government.If the bank account of those self employed person receive the money which exceed from the minimum income should be taxed, of course the bank will ask him where he get the money and he should report it to the tax department.@OP is from Indonesia based on his old post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1758141.msg19176208#msg19176208",

What do you think? I'm a little confused with this tax rule.Maybe we have to look again at how the tax regulation is applied for several groups and the percentage they get for 1 year. So income tax will refer to annual profits, some get 5%, 15%, 25%, 30%, and 35%. for example,in 1 year income reaches $0 - $4000, then the tax rate that you get is only 5%.So, we only need to look at how much the profits of farmers and employees are for 1 year, even though each of them gets 5%, the amount to be paid will be different.Farmers earn $2000/4 months x 3 (in 1 year only harvest 3x) = $6000taxes paid = about $300/yearMeanwhile, employees earn $300/month x 12 = $3600taxes paid = $180/yearBoth are still included in the income tax range of $0 - $4000, so each is a 5% maintenance tax.",

What do you think? I'm a little confused with this tax rule.As far as I know farmers cannot escape the taxes set by the local government, when talking about agricultural product policies, especially in the Asian region such as: Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, philippines, China and others, if you look at the yields, you think the farmers are tax-free, you are wrong, isn't that, the government does not collect taxes directly from the crops for the farmers.Way Government policies take taxes from farmers' crops.1. The government will take the VAT rate charged to farmers at the selling price directly to entrepreneurs and agents.2. Mechanism Other taxes imposed by the government on farmers are calculated in terms of purchasing fertilizers, seeds, and all other needs.You need to know that all forms of industrial business entities buying and selling farmers' produce do not escape government supervision, all collectors have a minimum tax value of 1% to farmers, whether it's like: rice, rubber, corn, tobacco, coconut, patchouli and so on, whether it's agricultural products from gardens, rice fields, mountains, and so on.There is no confusion that the government implements a tax policy for the share of farmers' income, everything has been stipulated in the tax laws of each country, they know that agricultural produce is the biggest economic turnover for the government than land, vehicles etc., they will not let farmers escape taxes. there are a thousand ways the government takes taxes from agricultural products.",

Official Assessment Systemnamely the tax party that determines how much to pay, usually this tax collection is for building houses and vehicles which have been determined by the government.3. Withholding Systemnamely taxes that are taken care of by a third person, usually this is for income tax which is automatically deducted when we receive a salary so we don't need to take care of it because it has been done by this third person.For the third tax, this is usually only for people who have a fixed income, while those who work odd jobs are far from tax collection.

But they are limits to what is considered personal usage, so you can't plant 2000 ha of corn and say it's for your morning cereals. If you do sell your products to a third party, thus engaging in a taxable event, you are subject to taxation which works like this:- your revenue is under a limit (depends on each country), you won't pay taxes but you need to declare the revenue- your event is over the limit, you're treated like any business and you have to pay your taxes.So basically, you plant a few melons and you eat yourself in your backyard you don't need to tell anyone, you plant a few and you sell them you need to register but you won't be taxed for 5 euros profit, you plant 100ha and sell them, you're a business and you need to register not only for tax but with the agricultural office also.Again, and I must mention this, I don't know how the law woks in Indonesia, I'm just telling you from an EU citizen (who is has been for 20 years involved in agriculture) point of view.",

Most of the cryptos are categorized in the same tax asset class as precious metals. The difference is, that you consume food fast, but precious metals is a long term trading value. So you first point from the quote is right. Under a certain amount of selling profit you does not have to pay taxes. Above you have to pay taxes - But: If you hold that kind of assets 1 year, you also have not to pay taxes for the profits. / Except stable coins and staking (other tax classes). And if you buy crypto there is no VAT.",
