Avoid such people.This may belong to the gambling discussion because someone wanted to trick him using a casino and gamble in it, and have a discussion with other member of community if they had received the same offer.Somehow I experience the same thing years ago and from telegram platform also.  He was saying that he is one of the admin of a casino, and wanted to offer me a huge win.  Then we can split the winnings.  He even promised to give funds to my account just to go with his plan.  It was enticing but I rejected the offer because of the possible problem I might face if I agree with his deal.",

I don't know whether this is a usual strategy, but take care out there...I've seen the same story of this scam.It's certainly a scam and he'll ask you for some deposits and with the promised of interesting returns. Well, good thing that you've sensed already the scam within.Don't believe on these people that are reasoning an exploit to a casino, it's better for them to report it and given a reward instead of abusing it only if there's really a problem.Quote from: mich on August 08, 2022, 05:33:15 AMI was scammed by Telegram and to this date I know who the Scammer is but Telegram says they will not do anything about it.  It is a program enabling Scammers and we see so many of threads like this one and I hope that you did the right thing and Blocked and Reported Him.
