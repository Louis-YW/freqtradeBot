  "content": "I am currently using Bitcoin Core version v0.18.0 (64-bit) on Windows. Noticed there is a Bitcoin Core 22.0 available now. Couple questions:1) How did Core go from a .18 version all the way to 22 versions?2) Can I upgrade my current .18 to 22 and still keep my current chain or do I have to download the whole thing all over again?Thanks!**edit- whoops, this thread should have probably have been put into Bitcoin Technical Support section.",

It's a bit confusing with the way the versions are numbered, for example they go from a version 0.21.2 (which is less than 1) all the way to a full-numbered 23 now. Just semantics I guess.",

The wallet.dat file itself was not damaged, I could exclude that as reason. While it might have been possible to update immediately with the current version in 2021 for everything except the wallet, this current version of Bitcoin Core in 2021 wouldn't load the 2014 wallet.dat at all!So I chose to update this old Bitcoin Core wallet.dat step-by-step with each intermediate Bitcoin Core version from 2014 to 2021 and this worked for me in this particular case. There were IIRC about two Bitcoin Core versions which required changes and updates in the wallet.dat \"structures\", I guess probably those were the versions I shouldn't have skipped over.Just my personal experience in such kind of an update edge case.",
