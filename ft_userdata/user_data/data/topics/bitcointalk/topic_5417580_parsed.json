Using myself as a case study, I was brought up in a family where you cannot take anything that does not belong to you, infact as a child any amount of money in my hand no matter how small my parents will ensure that they know the means through which I earned the money.I was brought up to believe that all smokers are criminals but actually it is not true, but that believe made me to avoid smokers at my tender age but when I became an adult, made friends that smoke but not steal, I realised that smokers are not criminals. Those initial trainings hibernated me till I am able to make decisions for myself. I can confidently say that i will not embezzle public fund. I have been in many positions that I delivered even with my personal funds. It is not taught in school. Mortality is the greatest tool to combat corruption and those kind of morals will only be gotten at tender age. Forget about the world, just ensure you raise a decent breed of children and you could make a difference from there.",

If an example is made out of some individuals, it can prompt change which can have a ripple effect on the mindset of other individuals. Corruption can be an effect of an environmental factor that is when everyone around you is corrupt it is difficult for you to maintain an incorruptible culture, In other words, an environment full of incorruptible people can turn a corrupt person for the better.",

You don't expect to teach a child the disadvantages of corruption when every thing the child interacts with on a day to day base is completely corrupt. If we teach a child about corruption from the home what happens when the same child interacts with a corrupt society. I am not saying teaching them about the impact of corruption is not good but it will require a corrupt free environment to see it fully effective.Morals is never learnt it is transferred. Transferred in the sense that this kids grow with them. The see justice, peace, good morals, transparency and equity has the interact with their family and society every day.",

Take a look at the tipping culture in America for example, it makes absolute sense to abolish the whole concept and have a minimum wage (with tips entirely optional) but you have many states which skirt around paying their staff proper rates and they essentially have to put this nasty fake act on to appease (read: beg) every customer for money. It's degrading, but is so ingrained in their culture that it would be almost unfathomable to many in the USA to change it at this point - against all logic.",

Actually, there are parents who teach their kids to take advantage of situations they occasionally find themselves in life.Moreover, corruption is part of our socities and it is seem by many, if not by the most, as something trivial and that we must live within in order to thrive socially and financially, although they aren't going to state such things publicly.That is a very sad reality which push me aside from society because I don't want to be part of this system.",

In my country, corruption seems to be deeply rooted and very difficult to eradicate. This seems to have become a habit for anyone to commit corruption on a small or large scale.

Even when they were students, there were many of them who were always against corruption, saying \"No to corruption\" out loud. However, when they entered the system, they were unable to avoid it, and in the end, they were involved in this corrupt activity. Corruption is like a systematic congregational activity and is very difficult to eradicate. Although many have been caught, in fact, this never ends. Maybe because the sanctions are less severe for the corrupt.",

How would you educate youth to choose good over evil?Isn't it the basis for religion and law over thousands of years of human history? Maybe you could argue that there haven't been many amendments made to most religions in thousands of years. They can be modernized and improved upon through the addition of more real world data and applications. Criminals and thieves could be interviewed to tell their life stories and how crime doesn't pay. Bernie Madoff, Martin Shkreli and others might feel inclined to do testimonials about corruption not being worth it. Maybe that would persuade youth to follow other paths.But I think the harsh reality is that if a person is working full time and not earning enough to pay their bills. They don't have many options aside from crime. In that sense, any attempt at raising social standards must also come with economic and job opportunities to give people options other than crime and corruption.",

Good number of young generation get into stealing activities not by interest, but their situation force them and later they turn this to be a common practice. If the government is able to provide proper education, medical service and employment majority of the problems can be solved.Almost similar is the corruption, we can lower the corruption among the officials, politicians and in all sectors. The change have to begun from the people, because we're the one paying them to make things done in an easier way.",

I mean, if a child has been taught from a very young age that taking what is not hers/her is bad, then she/he won't steal. Of course, he/she also would have to be living in a family or community where what is taught is also lived with. After all, a child learns a lot more from what he/she sees or observes than what he/she is taught.So I don't think young children will have to be taught about corruption itself. Corruption is already a socio-political issue; it's just a result of a society with very poor values. It is actually an adult issue. Young children should be taught with the most fundamentals lessons. I believe giving them a very solid values foundation is enough for them to grow into responsible citizens or leaders.",

I doubt that people who commit corruption still have a high sense of caring for others. They become selfish and only selfish without caring about their actions have harmed many people. then it is appropriate for a corruptor to be called an immoral person. because he couldn't control his greed.so I think the effort that can be done to eradicate corruption from an early age is to teach more about Moral itself from an early age. Teach our children the importance of being a moral person. starting with teaching a sense of caring for others by always sharing goodness in the form of services or materials. starting with relatives and neighbors.and we as parents must be an example for our children to follow.Moral is something that needs to be built from an early age. and a moral person usually he will be more able to care about the surrounding environment. he was used to living honestly. and obey the rules. and always be compassionate and share love with others. he is always willing to help without expecting anything in return. because he realized that humans are born to need each other and must help each other. because someday he too will need help. a moral person prefers not to be concerned only with himself. he will act carefully in every job so as not to harm others.if this attitude is embedded in a person, then of course he will stay away from things that harm others, such as corruption, one of them.but cultivating a moral attitude in today's environment is a difficult thing. because the attitude of individualism has been firmly attached in today's society. sometimes even in urban residential areas, we don't even know our neighbors well. we live alone in the crowd of people. and this kind of attitude is very prone to falling into the loss of caring for others and making selfishness superior to us. so that when we don't care about each other, doing corruption will feel like a normal thing and commonplace. and even the guilt fades away. and feel that everyone would do the same if they were in the same position.",
