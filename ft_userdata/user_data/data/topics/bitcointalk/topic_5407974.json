  "content": "You wouldn't know Bitcointalk is big place until you become one of it member, bitcointalk is more than a place a place to ask questions and get fast reply, you wouldn't know the value until you become one of the user. I joined this forum due to my little-late knowledge about bitcoin, I was searching and opening different tabs and I don't know which bring me to bitcointalk, I have read some guide and tutorials and I'm Amazed by how some members quickly reply questions when someone is ignorant of some things about bitcoin.I am going through the forum and I have found some interesting things in the forum that are more exciting than been a guest, there are could be more I don't know yet but the ones I have seen are fun and interesting when you register in this forum.These few things I found are more engaging when you become one of it member and they include:(1)Ask Questions: I am still learning what the circle of Bitcoin and to facilitate this understanding and comprehend things faster, you have to ask questions and to that, you need to be registered as a member to do that, you can't ask questions in Bitcointalk unless you register as a new member.(2)There is dedicated Local board for popular languages: Bitcointalk forum isn't just a place for only English discussion, they have locals where you can communicate with other members of you can't speak your language of countries like Russia, India, Arabic, Turkey, China, and many more. They also have unofficial thread for other languages that are not yet available like Naija unofficial board. I will also be happy when Theymos approved our Naija board.(3)Open Market for Trades: Bitcointalk has market where the member can trade openly with everyone, you can exchange your bitcoin and other coins with any buyer you desire and the help of Trust system in everyone profile has make this more transparent to sport who has good reputation with positive feedback and a likely scammers with negative feedback. An outsider cannot do this unless when you register in Bitcointalk, this is one of the merit you get over a guest.(4)The Private Message: I like Bitcointalk because your privacy is respected, you can communicate with any other member of the forum without third person knowing what you are talking about. The demerit of this is that, newbies cannot message other members, they are restricted by default but ranks above can make use of this feature and communicates effectively.(5)The Ranking system: This is one the part that make bitcointalk lively, the more you stay here and post, the more your activity increases and the more merit you get too but not always and the more your rank increases. This also contribute to your knowledge in the forum because since I joined the forum, I have learnt many things like exposing some cheaters.This are the few I have learned and I am looking forward to increase my findings about bitcointalk and everything behind bitcoin, one day I will look back and smile at my Genesis.",

Bitcointalk is a very big forum. From bitcoin discussion to politics, trading, market place, to gambling. These boards are like different worlds inside the Bitcointalk. Anyway I login and visits different boards, I feel like I have toured the world.Quote from: RockBell on July 28, 2022, 08:36:30 PM(4)The Private Message: I like Bitcointalk because your privacy is respected, you can communicate with any other member of the forum without third person knowing what you are talking about. The demerit of this is that, newbies cannot message other members, they are restricted by default but ranks above can make use of this feature and communicates effectively.This is not wholly true as I have seen where it is advised that from PMs are not 100% privacy guaranteed. That you can consider encrypting your message if you need absolute privacy.Quote from: RockBell on July 28, 2022, 08:36:30 PM(5)The Ranking system: This is one the part that make bitcointalk lively, the more you stay here and post, the more your activity increases and the more merit you get too but not always and the more your rank increases.

Bitcointalk is more than a place to ask questions; it is a place to be part of an active community that it is often encouraging people to be active and work together in developing better and more secure software, growing the Bitcoin economy, learning and understanding various concepts like Blockchain technology, Economics, top down thinking, various technical issues, legal and other challenging issues. In this sense, it is more than a place to ask question, it is a place to learn, exchange ideas and maintain a very close relationship with like minded people.Welcome to this enjoyable and exciting community and thank you for your participation!",

After all, they are stored in the forum’s database, so it is technically feasible for them to be browsed or leaded at some point in time (although they may be encrypted in the storage – speculation – which could mitigate the latter).PMs are stored in the system even if both sender and receiver delete them as per the privacy notice, during a period of 6 months at least. The notice also states that, as we can verify by going over our own forum’s linked email, PMs tend to generate emails with the content of the PM, which we receive in cleartext.People can and will obviously use the PM feature, it’s just a matter of knowing the above and determining whether one is comfortable with it or not, with their PM content.",

I will also be happy when Theymos approved our Naija board.Seems creation of local board is still a huge process where as others requested a board for their own but of course there are parameters before its creation like how many users in that particular board. There are some who havent yet have any boards probably due to low members quantity to be able to make it.Im not sure hows the qualification for this. Maybe theymos is strict or not necessary for that board due to that reason.",

The demerit of this is that, newbies cannot message other members, they are restricted by default but ranks above can make use of this feature and communicates effectively.OP, if you think sending private messages, whether by a newbie or some other rank, is a handy feature, then I can warn you that you're wrong.Sending unsolicited private messages to a stranger, and even more so, sending spam from a PM, can end very badly. There were cases when users marked such accounts with negative tags. Many will simply complain to the moderator, while others may simply block you so as not to receive any messages from you in the future.This is a forum, not a messenger, in which two people communicate. Get used to asking without disturbing private messages. This way, you will get much more quick and complete answers.",
