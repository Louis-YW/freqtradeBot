Questions to these questions also lie in their good and bad use cases.Well look at it this way. They shut down Chipmixer, right? (And I'm still wearing this stupid signature until next week probably)Did they simultaneously clean out all of the bitcoin doubling scams, Bitcoin exchange scams, Bitcoin services which just take the users' money and don't return it, scam casinos like 1xbit, the KYC scams, and the bitcoin address stealing malware?No, of course not. Why? Because they don't care about any of that stuff.Governments that are hostile to crypto are two-faced just like Harvey Dent - on one side you have them fight \"money laundering\" (including bogus assertions of laundering that are actually just a user protecting their privacy), and on the other hand, they don't give a rat's ass if their population loses all their Bitcoins to scammers vacationing in Malibu.Just some food for thought. Everything they do is heads - as in \"good\".",

It's quite unfortunate that a huge amount of fund was seized and apparantly there's no way to receive it back now if someone is not involved in criminal activities. More and more mixing services are being targeted by the enforcement agencies since 2022 and multiple mixing services were shut down completely since then.",

Questions to these questions also lie in their good and bad use cases. It does not matter what BTC is used for, many countries would never make it a legal tender because of it is a decentralized currency. But you should understand that there is a difference between legal tender and legal. BTC is legal in most countries around the world, only in a few places is it illegal; and in the places it is legal people spend it like a normal currency through merchants that openly accept payment in BTC. Quote from: Faisal2202 on March 15, 2023, 06:07:08 PMall we can do is promote good use cases of blockchain and BTC, not the bad use cases which harm the beauty of BTC. Fiat is used for all kind of bad purposes, but nobody preaches to people how they should use it, Fiat is even easier to use for bad purposes than BTC because it is harder to trace the criminals. I do not want people to use BTC to do bad things, but the beauty of BTC is in its freedom, and we can't dictate to anyone what to do with their coins.",

I mean, I understand how you block a website, but seizing assets and closing a business down is a whole different thing which required either Chipmixer's cooperation or very impressive investigative work of the authorities. I've never used mixers because I've never felt the need to do that, but I do believe that some people can use mixers for privacy reasons rather than money laundering. Then again, it's not like a company can check which reason its service is being used for, and mixers are very convenient for financial crimes, so I'm not surprised that the authorities cracked down on it.",

In any case, I don't really have much of a say in this other than I fear that they may go after other mixers in the market, because as of now what I get from this coordinated pincher attack against chipmixer is that the government sees cryptomixers as \"bitcoin mix, bitcoin can't be traced anymore, mixer bad, mixer money laundering\" awooga bullshit. Which begs the question of why in the hell are they specifically attacking mixers when the problem is still at large? Scammers, thieves, all of those entities still roam free and are still availably tricking people out of their hard-earned money! Stopping mixers from operating isn't gonna solve the problem, and for me this is just a lame attempt just to say \"hey, we're doing something please praise us\".

Quote from: stompix on March 15, 2023, 06:32:08 PMsniphehe, is it used for money laundering? If yes, then I will be happy too if the same happens. I think i should add few more words as i re-read my post and it looks like giving the vibe of hyyyy wow this is banned and business will run. but that was not my impression i was trying to say, bad things have a bad end. if the mentioned one has the same then i am ok with bad end.  note* i am not an expert or high-rank member of this community i shared my thoughts according to my mentality and knowledge and idea about technology no doubt Mixers has a hell lot of good uses but that uses if being used for the wrong purposes then its a shame and in that usage, a platform end is also sad. If any of my words upset or are no right then i seek forgiveness because my intentions were not to offense someone but just to share my thoughts.",
