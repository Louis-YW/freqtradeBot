The price of course depends from country to country, and in my case the Premium UHD package costs 9.99 EUR per month, while the Basic package costs 4.99 EUR. If you believe the data on this link, in some countries the Premium UHD package costs as much as $27, while there is also a country where it costs less than $4.",

If the information on the link I posted is correct, Premium HD in India costs $6.07 per month, but as @hilariousandco already mentioned, you have at least a dozen members who sell N accounts for a much lower price - although I should be honest and say that most of them are shared accounts, even possibly hacked because you are not allowed to change anything.However, considering the changes that have already affected some countries, in the future each account will be locked to a specific location and device, so \"sharing\" of this type will no longer be possible.",
