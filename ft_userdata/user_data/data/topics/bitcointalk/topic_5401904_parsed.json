Each investigation would likely involve separate legal fees and could damage the overall view of the exchange by users. If this happens, it's unlikely that the price of the BNB coin will change much; however, if there is a penalty involved in the ruling, it could hurt Binance's reputation.",

They will fine them but Binance can handle it since they have huge funds and profit. SEC just want to milk them that’s why they always do this kind probing on project that successfuly operating under there jurisdiction. CZ is very smart to avoid them and stop to prusue US market because SEC is pain in the ass that wants money to his business.This will cause a FUD to BNB just like what happened to XRP but this will not stop Binance as they are currently number exchange.",

Zhao in a 2020 blog post said the change was made in response to legal advice “indicating the potential for being misunderstood as a security” in some regions. SourceCould it be that CZ already envisaged this issue coming? It is understood that Governments are well against cryptocurrencies in general and I think they might continue to go after the system in every way.",

The news already known by all of crypto users and this is not something that will make people feel panic. This news from SEC was nothing compared with the massive dump that already created by luna. This was even worst compared with the SEC news. People already known SEC was nothing for now.",

Binance has already been aware of SEC and have different operation globally and in US. The US version of Binance was made to satisfy the conditions and demand of SEC and yet they are investigating on it. Binance US is still a large part of Binance's profit and they would probably try to keep in running by paying a fine both on and off bills. Small crypto fluctuations needs no large issues I don't think any results would have significant effect on BNB or crypto as whole.",

But let's wait for the investigation and hope that Binance doesn't have any problem with that and can show proof about what is happening at that time.The SEC again raises the question, as in the case of ripple, whether BNB is a security coin. Rather, he already considers this coin a security and, on this basis, makes claims against its leaders about the illegal cashing of securities for a large amount.BNB is practically a slightly modified copy of ethereum, which the same SEC did not recognize as a security. It is not clear to me then how BNB can become a security.I also believe that nothing serious can happen to BNB. At most Binance officials will pay a decent fine. After all, there are no complaints about BNB itself. But while an investigation is underway within the SEC itself, it remains to be seen whether the case will go to court.",

Has it ever happened where a company was certified innocent after SEC started investigating? I don't think so! There will be a temporary reputation loss for Binance and as a result, the price of BNB might tank which will give us a great opportunity to buy some more BNB. Binance might have to pay a huge fine which may or may not affect their liquidity. But that's it! I don't see anything beyond these are happening to Binance.",

I think this is because of their ICO before and not sure if this is only for Binance US or it tackles the whole Binance system. Obviously, the normal scenario is that Binance will suffer a dump because that’s how whales work and then later on, they will buy again and that is the start of the rising Binance again. Don’t be afraid if you see BNB dumping because that’s a good opportunity for you to accumulate. Binance wont go down easily without having a fight, so don’t overthink.",
