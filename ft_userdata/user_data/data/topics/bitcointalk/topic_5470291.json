  "content": "I was searching for a article about bitcoin fees to know more about it, But I redirected to final article thread, there all images were non visible/an error was showing.what if I update these threads by hosting the working images to other website like talkimg or imbb? I will do this in archive board in my free time with same title with little change in title like writing a word :\"updated\" Is it a waste of time?, does these updated images will stop working after some times?I will find most guides from @Ratimov's this thread: [SEPTEMBER UPD.] Beginners & Help Encyclopediashare suggestion: is it a right idea? or it is a waste of time? Because many guides are written by old members who are not active, so they can not update them by tryninja's script/",

There are many guide threads that have images that do not show again and some of this images are what makes the guide understandable. So nothing is bad in updating them because it is even advisable to start a dead thread after so many years. But be sure that does old thread do not have outdated guides. Most especially for wallets, since there are updates continuously on this wallets some hides are no longer useful",
