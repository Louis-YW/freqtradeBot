This would be just another backup where if anyone finds it, they wouldn't be able to access the wallet without the password. I would stash the USB drive someplace safe.What I'm worried about is someone finding my written down seed and being able to use it, while, if they found a thumb drive they would not be able to use it without the password, which only I remember.",

Regardless though, I think it's better to keep the wallet copies to a minimum.As for your seed phrase, then you can always make a new one and add custom words to it. Write it down and store it without the extended words, that way, if someone finds it, he can't access your wallet.",

Discretion should be highly considered when storing your back ups and you can play around with it a bit to ensure that if anyone does find it, they would but be able to access your funds with only that information.An extended seedphrase is one option, and works better than omitting one of the words when writing it down.You can also have a multi-sig wallet and store them in different locations, so finding one of then would not grant access to the funds.",

If you store your wallet file on a USB in the same place that you store your seed, then the risk of losing coins to some natural disaster like fire or flooding remains almost the same. If you store your backups in different places, you raise your chances that they will fall in wrong hands. If you don't encrypt your backups, they can be easily stolen. If you do, you risk forgetting your password and losing your coins. You have to decide for yourself which threats are the most likely for you - theft, misplacement, natural disaster, etc.",

When you say \"remember\" do you mean keeping your password in your head? This is generally a bad idea for a number of reasons, some of which are :people tend to forget, even things they know are very important to them.the human brain is very sensitive, any head injury can cause temporary or permanent memory loss.under the influence of alcohol, drugs or certain medications, we can unconsciously say things that we would not otherwise say.In a nutshell, don't rely only on your brain as a storage of such sensitive information, others have already given you good advice on how to reduce the risk.",

As already said, relying on your memory for passwords is a bad and risky practice.2. If the password is strong, USB sticks can be handy, but don't rely only on them; USB sticks can break rather easily too. But I would store there the seed (too), maybe archived with the same very strong password. If by odd chance the electrum wallet format changes by a lot until \"next time\", the seed may become handy.3. I would also consider handling the seed completely offline (maybe on a live system), let's not expose it in the attempt to make backup.4. I would consider using a hardware wallet and backup that one's seed (and only the seed). I expect the only relevant extra the wallet file could hold is labels.",

You USB can be infected by virus, malwares too if you plug in, plug out, connect to other devices.Well you nailed it --if the purpose of the USB is for saving your private key only that is good enough. But for me, it is not advisable you only keep your private key in one device, it should be written on a piece of paper that cannot easily to destroy by minor incidence like moistening by water that causes mold --or it would be better in you will engrave it on metal that won't easily break in wet or burn by fire. However, all I said is too much that is I think it is a paranoid reaction, write on a piece of paper and keep it safe, done.",
