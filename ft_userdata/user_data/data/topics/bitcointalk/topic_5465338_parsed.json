Making sure that the papers are complete and law backed.If you do not want to talk about altcoins because they are shit coins, some people invest in stocks. I do not know much about stocks because I prefer bitcoin. Another suggestion is to invest in gold, but gold is more like a store of value than an investment.",

But the most interesting of all my ventures is Bitcoin. The ride is wild. There's so much anticipation. There are disappointments and surprises, but it seems they don't bother me at all.

I also have some that I bought in the past but I don't currently invest in them. It seems to me to be a much worse investment than bitcoin today and in the future.

Yes. BTC is the most potential thing for now to buy, considering the price is very decent also many people have predicted more increases in the future and hope to make a profit by selling it at a later time although some people still say BTC is still expensive ( They Say) and one thing to note at this time The market is volatile, transactions are slow, when it is time to buy or sell you need to do it as soon as deemed necessary if it is an emergency because the market is in a frenzied phase at the moment.",

But there is no guarantee that history will repeat itself and bitcoin will definitely still make new ATH to bring us profit. So investing all in bitcoin just because the halving is approaching, I don't think it's a good idea. If someone has a lot of money, diversification should still be maintained because the future is unpredictable. As for me, I'm not that rich and I'm still making a trade-off to just focus on bitcoin even if we don't have a halving.",

After he got to know Bitcoin, he decided to divide his capital into stocks, forex, and Bitcoin and he could live it well.And another friend of mine invests in gold, securities, and bonds. After learning that there is Bitcoin, he also decided to invest in Bitcoin. And because he was previously an investor, he could hold Bitcoin tightly and not be provoked by the news circulating. He always says to be patient and stay calm when investing. No matter how difficult the situation is, we can emerge victorious if we can be patient and remain calm.I only invest in Bitcoin and altcoins, although I have some gold in reserve. And I'm still trying to have more Bitcoin. And with the Bitcoin halving next year, the price of Bitcoin could soar very high, exceeding the last ATH. And if at that time, I already had a lot of Bitcoin, it would be a huge profit for me. That is also what people who have invested in Bitcoin are doing.",

The real-estate and commerce sectors still have potential in the future and it is quite worth it to invest in companies in this field. And apart from that, I also have a part in an offline business in the health sector, even though the income is quite small, it has a market and I don't need to bother thinking about operations because it runs itself.",

It's like the concept of putting all the eggs in more than one basket. In addition to investing in bitcoin and altcoin, I have investments in shares of industrial campaigns, as well as shares of two banks. Its are not as high-risk as cryptocurrencies, but this allows you to distribute capital. I also want to buy a property for rent.",

If you have enough knowledge about the market and after researching the market well you realize that investing in bitcoin is not safe for you but you don't invest in bitcoin then you try to find a different platform to invest. We have always considered Bitcoin a very safe currency to invest in. We don't see the volatility in the Bitcoin market that we see in other coin markets. The Bitcoin market moves at a certain speed, just as the possibility of the Bitcoin market going up suddenly is low, the possibility of the market going down suddenly from a good position is very low.

However, in regards to investing in other things, it is not surprising that a lot of us have other investments outside of Bitcoin, and some even put more attention, effort, and money into those investments. Aside from the obvious fact that it is always better to have more than one source of income, it is also the factor that Bitcoin investment is unpredictable and cannot be fully relied on for our daily necessities in terms of finance. Such a reason is the main concern many have that drives them to invest in other things such as gold and real estate. To put it simply, the security of having various sources of income plays the biggest role in why we invest outside of Bitcoin, and I don't see anything bad regarding this as long as proper financial planning is included. Personally, I am interested in investing in real estate and starting a business as I continue with Bitcoin investment. Real estate is doing relatively well here in my country and having a business on the side is never a bad thing as long as I budget things perfectly.",
