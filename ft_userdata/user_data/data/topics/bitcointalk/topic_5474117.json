  "content": "Good day my people dem,Well this no be new tori again as everyone know how many people take suffer in the hands of the former CBN governor and the former president on the matter say dem come up with the idea to change our currency for the following note #200, 500, and 1000 naira note. This matter caused so many damages for the country last year when the election being dey near so tay many people come dey even think say this people dem just come to kill everyone in the country. But so many people come dey make suggestions say the whole idea na about the election and how dem see fit to take reduce the rate of corruption and to wicked the politicians wey already get plans to buy vote for the election but other come with their suggestions say na to actually give the naira note small value as wicked people don already stock pile so many printed currency and this they make the CBN print more money and we all know when that happens, the money starts losing value. This na the main reason wey even the dollar and so many other fiat currency dey lose value too and na also why the technologist behind Bitcoin creation make Bitcoin get a limitated supply of 21 million so that no matter what the currency go get value overtime as people start demanding or please correct if am wrong @open for corrections still learning.But all the same, the attempt to change the naira wasn't a pleasant one as the CBN failed to make the cash enough or maybe that was also part of the plan as shortage of the cash made the demand increase like mad or the so called politicians dem been already don hijack all the money finish. Going to bank was a war zone and so many terrible things occured during that period, police even nearly beat me up trying to get into the bank to collect your own fucking money, Omo, it was not easy many people Starve well well and most of them get millions for bank but the issue be say no way to a access the millions and money.Now all this suffering and complain also bring good side effects somehow sha because massive cashless economy was adopted immediately as many businesses come dey accept transfer for the country and till now sef many people eye don open up but the negative effect was too much so the CBN had no other choice but to extend the deadline for the termination of the use of old naira note to  DECEMBER 31 2023 and time for this don dey near and I believe upsets don dey come small small as money come dey somehow scarce if you ask me.But I come see this official release say the new administration don EXTEND THE DEADLINE TILL FURTHER NOTICE  so i say make I drop the matter here and many people fit go online see their selves and as we do am make we try relate on our experiences and impact wey this naira swap cause for our great country NIGERIAImage source :: twitter app X news online",

Imagine the stress people went through that period, a lot of people got defrauded of their money just because everyone was rushing to deposit their old currency in the bank and due to  the high rate of electronic method of performing transactions as a result of scarcity of the redesigned currency made a lot of people lose their money.Moreover, the judiciary and the legislative arm of government didn't formerly adopt the redesigned currency as a legal tender. So for me; I don't know the reason why we should redesign the naira except a situation where the country feels that the secrets of the currency have been compromised by another country or fraudsters.",

The Naira gain is as a result of massive influx of dollar into the market as a result of CBN directives to clear foreign-direct contracts that were long overdue. These contracts involved big fish like Tony Elumelu, Dangote and others and resulted in poor flow of dollars. Since they were mandated to pay back their dollar, there was sharp increase in supply of dollar hence Naira had to strengthen... simple demand and supply theory.

I'm happy this new administration is not adding to our suffering with their policies like the last administration. Even though we are yet to see much improvements in the key indices of development, the suffering should not be worse than they met it else people will go into depression.",

I wonder what came over the last administration on that decision to put people into unnecessary sufferings by causing the scarcity of naira for some political reasons. Because you cannot say that was solely done to stop kidnappers and bandits from requesting for ransom when at the same time, you didn't work on the security architecture of your country. I don't understand how some leaders take such kind of decisions without considerations to the emotions and well-being of the people.I no fit imagine the kind of sufferings wey we self undergo because of that decision wey few people make in a roundtable against the will of the general public. Oboi, Nigerians been take style see shege then and I don't really see the much impact that made to improve the lives and properties of the people, if not worse. In that period, we witnessed cash hoarding to the point that most of our parents mentioned that they've never faced such incident before. Even in the past when there was food scarcity. The unique thing about the cash scarcity was that many people had money in their bank accounts and wallets but could not access it cash for their daily business purposes, especially the petty business owners  Nevertheless, one can say that the cash scarcity also had some positive impacts like the use of e-channels such as the POS, Bank Transfers etc. Since a lot of businesses were losing customers because of lack of cash, they had no choice than to switch to e-channels through accepting POS and bank transfers. For me that is not a fan of cash, I didn't feel much of the impact like others did.The  idea of naira redesign and cashless society policy were not a bad ones but the implementation process was very poor and inconsiderate. Now this government have relaxed the ban of the old naira notes from thr market while it still promotes the use of the e-channels which people are gradually adopting to. That's how it should have been from beginning and not inflicting hardship on people.",

As early as possible, we are already awake to go to the bank just to get a chance of withdrawing only 20,000 Naira per account. Though it is just time and it has come and passed, now is just history, but to be sincere, we suffered a lot with your own hard-earned money, but you will have no access to it, which made many things happen and many deaths occur due to that cashless policy. Most especially those residing in rural areas are the most affected because I know the health emergency case that happened. It was a pregnant woman who couldn’t give birth due to the position of the baby in her womb, and she needed surgery. She needed some money to buy some surgical instruments, but due to that cashless policy, that is how we lost both the pregnant woman and the unborn baby. Such a great loss happened at that time that made me feel so sad.QuoteBut I come see this official release say the new administration don EXTEND THE DEADLINE TILL FURTHER NOTICE  so i say make I drop the matter here and many people fit go online see their selves and as we do am make we try relate on our experiences and impact wey this naira swap cause for our great country NIGERIATo be sincere, this is the best solution. If they are trying to enact a law, they should be considering not only people residing in the urban area but also those residing in the rural area. They will have to understand that some people in the rural area don’t have enough access to many things like banks and others, so it will be hard for them to have smooth access to the change in their money to the new note, but with the time given now, it will be very easy for them to have it because of the time given. They will accumulate the new note with time, which is the best opinion.",
