Many crypto traders follow his movement. So I can say Elon must can manipulate crypto market shortly and it will be stable within a short time. So we should research by own by not being manipulated by anyone if we want to be safe.",

In the future, with Twitter, it will be again, but i dont think it will be as strong as before. Elon Musk has a huge fanbase and also a lot of money/power, so he will eventually come back into crypto space. I hope that Twitter will become a kind of crypto exchange, because binance was involved in the deal of Twitter/Musk. The name could be twittbin. Since binance is currently under attack by the American state, CZ could look for alternatives.",

On march 4th the price went down. You can see that in here :As shown in the picture, you can see it did suffer some drop, but it got up eventually. There are some people who still follow Elon Musk, and they think that he still got some influence on the crypto market. But in reality, they are just temporary. The price went higher than before, as you can see. So you should never follow any influencer in order to stay strong in the market. Do your own research and if you think you are good enough, then stick to it no matter what. We know what Bitcoin is and what it holds for us in the future. These kinds of news and FUDS are not going to harm it in any way. Stick to your plan and have faith in what you believe.",

I still think Elon's words are utter nonsense because his words will not be consistent and he may say bitcoin is an asset that he will adopt \"again\".",

While he has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the price of Dogecoin in the past, it seems that his tweets are not always as influential as they once were.It's possible that many of his followers are already aware of how he has been able to manipulate the market in the past to make a significant profit. Therefore, his tweets may not have the same impact that they used to. There are still many blind followers who are quick to react to his tweets, regardless of their actual impact on the market.",

Most of the people who earlier used to respect him now feel him more like a dumb ass who speaks a lot of random things on social media. So obviously his reliability has gone down a lot. Especially the meme coins saga has hit his credibility as well. But obviously he is world's richest billionaire so obviously anything he say isn't going to go unnoticed, so it will effect the market but only not that largely like it used to do at some time.",

But then, if the market is bearish there's a little boost he can give to it but that's not guaranteed. Anyway, we see that only has little impact he's contributing to the market now because the market is working on its own and we're getting closer to the time that bitcoin will halve. So it means that he may take advantage of that event again and will make it look like it's his doings whenever bitcoin's price increase somewhere in the future.",

When he initially announced that his company Tesla is going to buy bitcoin as a reserved, obviously it was a big news to us, as the price goes up instantly. However, in 2022, in their Q2 earnings report, it was revealed that he sold 75% of their holding. And he said that they loss their investments (because of the bear market) and that Bitcoin has a negative impact on them. And with that, we understand that it's more of a business moved for him to sell and most likely that he is just riding the bandwagon early.So Bitcoin investors knows what's up with Elon and so we lost \"trust\" on this guy. Now he is not that influential to us and everything he says with Bitcoin on it is not going to affect us. He also attack Bitcoin mining and said that it is harmful to the environment which we know is very wrong in the beginning.",

I do however think that if Tesla started accepting bitcoin again for payment the price would have a short term pump.Elon can probably still pump shitcoins with silly immature tweets. Low liquidity coins are a lot easier to pump, I do think he enjoys doing that.",

He could somehow encourage people to invest in crypto and all of his tweets also affect how these followers take on it.

He talks about AI and people think about it for hype and even though there is no Elon Musk saying about it, this probably happens.",
