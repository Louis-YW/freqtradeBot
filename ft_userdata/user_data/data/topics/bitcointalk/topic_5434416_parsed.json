You do not promise a \"bailout\" and then do a rug pull at the last minute... when you know your competitor has no other options. I think FTX was deliberately brought down for strategic reasons.",

Another question is in what currency will Binance pay their new staff? If this is in BUSD, I would not be shocked if they have began issuing unbacked BUSD and fractionalized this more.",

According to some news articles, Binance has been bleeding assets. $12 billion in less than 60 days according to a video interview in Forbes published on January 10.Binance Is Bleeding Assets, $12 Billion Gone In Less Than 60 DaysSource https://www.forbes.com/video/6318474359112/binance-is-bleeding-assets-12-billion-gone-in-less-than-60-days/This is mass liquidation, I reckon. Traders might be losing confidence and they are cashing out. Also if an exchange or an investment bank goes through a mass liquidation, it might break unless they find another source of dollars to refill the billions of dollars that those customers have withdrawn. Will CZ use his own personal wealth to refill the billions in outflow? I do not know the answer hehehe.On BUSD, it has fractionalized and it might presently be fractionalized. Bloomberg reported Tuesday (Jan. 10) that the Binance-Peg BUSD reserves were at three separate times missing collateral of as much as $1 billion.The cryptocurrency exchange’s token is meant to have its value backed by reserves of another stablecoin, BUSD, that has the Binance brand but is issued and managed by Paxos Trust and is backed by a reserve of cash and U.S. Treasury bills, according to the report.However, according to the report, there were times when new Binance-Peg BUSD tokens were minted without having locked up the equivalent amount of collateral in the form of BUSD, the report said.Source https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2023/binances-stablecoin-was-at-times-undercollateralized-by-up-to-1b/",

It appears for the first time we are in agreement in an argument hehehe. In any case, with losing confidence and mass liquidations happening in Binance and with their stablecoin fractionalizing and becoming something undercollaterized, is this only a matter of time before we witness Binance become something similar to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers?",
