I honestly thought his career was done after that Pacman fight, but I did some digging into his boxing record, and he's got two consecutive wins via unanimous decisions against Jovanie Santiago and Bill Hutchinson. Now, it's not a championship fight, but I couldn't help myself from starting this thread. I find Adrien Broner to be a really interesting boxer, and the way I see it, he might just be gearing up for another shot at a championship bout in the future.The guy's already 34 years old, right smack in the middle of his career, but this journey could be his last shot to see if he's still got what it takes to be a champ again.In the Welterweight division, under WBC, he's currently ranked at 15. It's probably not going to be an easy journey for him if he wants to become the mandatory challenger but probably Crawford possibly moving up in weight by that time already, so who knows.",

      "body": "It's not a championship fight, but it's certainly an intriguing one, mainly because many of us here would like to see Broner lose. His cocky demeanor doesn't endear him to everyone, and his style has its fair share of critics. Winning by unanimous decision in his last two fights does highlight his dominance as a boxer, and some see similarities between his style and Mayweather's. However, his loss to Pacquiao by UD did diminish his standing in comparison to Mayweather.Being currently ranked in the top 15, he's in the bottom part of that list. It's hard to say whether a championship fight or retirement will come first for him.Anyway, I would be interested of the betting odds in this one, would you love to share?",

Moreover, he's involved in a legal case that demands significant financial resources. It's possible that this is why he's continuing his career in boxing. Regarding his legal situation, since he hasn't been incarcerated yet, it's conceivable that he's had to shell out a substantial sum of money, leaving him in a precarious financial state. Quite a precarious situation indeed!

Even without one, as long as he continues to compete, there's still a chance for him to earn some income. Let's hope he finds the support he needs in that regard.",

Pacman didn't do much damage because Broner doesn't want to fight but just survived the whole 12 rounds. Against Maidana, he was the big favorite, and I guess if you are really too arrogant sometimes karma will get the best out of you and that's what happen to him.Quote from: bittraffic on October 10, 2023, 05:10:54 AMHe is fighting an unknown boxer.

Like counter punching and his defense and Philly shell stance that all they learn from the legendary Floyd Mayweather. Perhaps this could be a 12 round decision win for Maidana but I don't think it will be enough for him to go up in the rankings and fight the champion.",

Broner seems to be active after all, but just very stealthy I guess he lost his fans that's why even the media is not covering him. Arum still wants to extend Broner's career so they pick the ones that he can just crush.Adrien's latest stunt was this https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vmAAQaG8xtY accusing McDonald's staff spitting on his food.  I read Chris Howard was his sparring partner years ago. I guess they wanna make it right this time where Chris can finally hit back and put it on record.",

But if he keeps winning then he will have this illusion that he can continue to fight and won belt and obviously chase for more money.But we have seen that he is no longer in his prime and just fighting low rated fighter just to stay above the division. But if he losses this one, he will be done and I doubt that any promoter will give him a chance. Unless he is willing to be the stepping stone of a upcoming fighter. Meaning he is willing to have a huge pay cut and is there to absorb and not to win. And I don't know if boxing fans are excited to see him in the ring with some unknown boxer.",
