What their deep relationship? Why btc important to altcoin, what's the connection in between? Will altcoins really survive without btc?The altcoin market is rapidly evolving, and it is likely that some of these digital currencies will eventually be able to stand on their own without depending on Bitcoin to determine their price actions. While Bitcoin was the first fully developed cryptocurrency and currently serves as the dominant coin, much like the US dollar, individuals often hedge their tokens and altcoins against Bitcoin when they perceive a risk in holding onto a particular altcoin. This practice can result in the value of these tokens dropping when Bitcoin declines and appreciating when Bitcoin rises.",

Anything can't survive without bitcoin but since there are also stable token in the market and i think opposite thing gonna happen even if bitcoin was disappearing. Altcoins used bitcoin to determine its price in the past but it's now different. Some coins were using stable tokens to determine the price of altcoins. Im not sure if altcoin will have no value if bitcoin was disappearing from the market.

During the bull market nothing gets close to bitcoin and yet they talk about flip and they think that bitcoin could ever be not the first place, which is idiotic because it will always be first place if this is the competition. I have never seen any project in the world that was even remotely close to being as good as bitcoin, and I doubt that we will ever see it because of the greed of creators.However, when the bear comes they realize how wrong they were and stop comparing their projects to bitcoin. You will see, during the next bull run in a couple years, we will see some projects get hyped enough to talk about being bigger than ETH or BTC, which they will never be.",

A lot of people are saying this because this is how they observed alts when BTC drops. It was the price of the alts that only drops but it does not totally mean that altcoins have now no value because value can still be measured in other things. It can be on how useful these altcoins are.In fact, there are some altcoins who can be able to recover last time while BTC is still in dumped position. They can still get a demand because there are people who are using these alts for certain purposes not just for investing or trading. We saw a drop in Bitcoins value these past days but later this day, it is showing a signs of recovery again. This is great and altcoin supporters will not worry anymore.",

I think the relationship of bitcoin and altcoin is inseparable in value, bitcoin falling and altcoin falling is normal and it has nothing to do with the meaning of existence or not!

Will altcoins really survive without btc?It's simple because in general Bitcoin is the only benchmark where when speculation on the price of Bitcoin drops automatically the price of altcoins will follow because the focus of large investors is Bitcoin and is the only root of the growth and death of altcoins. ETH may be the best altcoin but investors do are still looking to profit by selling altcoins to collect more Bitcoins.

And with such a fall off with some stablecoins, the market had recently put into dumped due to it as it also affects bitcoin. Notice that every time there's news about stablecoins, if it's positive, the price of bitcoin goes up and vice versa. Altcoins will survive but it's not going to be all of them that will have that space for which the market will be turning into some focus on different trends that we experience.
