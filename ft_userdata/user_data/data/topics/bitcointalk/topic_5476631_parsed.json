And if anyone invest in altcoins and do not invest in Bitcoin there means they don't understand the value of Bitcoin. And as you said Korea is one of the country that have the highest awareness in Bitcoin and they invest in dogecoin and other coins more than Bitcoin then they don't understand Bitcoin and they are the people promoting dogecoin and others. And really $50,000 is very big amount of money that some civil servants will not see through out their service years. There is a very big different among them. Even between or among the altcoins there is is a different. Like the ones you mentioned, dogecoin is more valuable than the other.",

Bitcoin is for those who want a long-term investment like a retirement plan and those who want to make a quick profit for a short time but it's involves risk, investing in altcoins might their choice. Correct me if I'm wrong because ain't Korean, in South Korea, gambling was strictly probihited right?So I'm thinking about how people in Korea decide their money to take a risk and it seems like gambling.  Invest in altcoins and hope to gain a profit in just a few weeks or months, they might be aware of the pump-and-dump tactics and how they will ride on it.  If you have a lot of money you know how to play with it. But who knows, there are also Bitcoin holders in your country that you didn't know since this thread is a baseless story.",

      "body": "I think that, above all, one should respect other people's decisions to invest their money in what they want, as long as such investments are not illegal and do not contribute to endangering other people. If some people (and even the majority) think that investing in something other than Bitcoin is more profitable for them (and that is the main reason for their investment), I don't see why they would be seen as someone who is doing the wrong thing.Theoretically, if you invest in BTC, it is realistic to expect that you will earn x5 or in the best case x10 in the next 2-5 years, and some altcoin can result in much more than that in the same period. Of course, there is always a risk that things will go downhill, whether it is Bitcoin or even more so with altcoins. People simply like to gamble in a way that they invest a little and get a lot, and that is exactly what the owners of these altcoins promise them.Quote from: puradak on December 05, 2023, 02:28:33 PM~snip~Koreans don't buy bitcoin, thinking there's no difference between bitcoin and altcoins.Is that your opinion or is there any research to back it up? It's kind of hard for me to believe that most people don't know the difference, but I guess there is some truth in that, because a lot of people have a very wrong perception of what Bitcoin is. It's not that I'm an expert on South Korea, but I watched a documentary a few years ago and it seems to me that it's the only country where, in addition to knowledge, young people must also have a certain physical predisposition to get a job, which means that many go for medical procedures to look more acceptable to the employer.",

We don't know exactly what the reason why they prefer to invest in altcoins and there is a reason behind that. Investing in Bitcoin is safest way to invest but the profit potential is a little bit lower compare to altcoins. Altcoins is a risky type of investment because of their volatility but the potential gain is so high and that's what I think why people in your Country prefer altcoins. By the way, if you do a screening, doing a deep research about a coin, investing in them really worth it.",

Generally speaking it is hard to know these things unless you run a centralized exchange that people visit so that you can have a solid statistics and CEXes don't release such statistic for the public to know these things.In any case, another possibility (assuming your stats are correct) is that you are looking at \"traders\" not \"investors\". When it comes to trading, altcoins are better than bitcoin although not the altcoins you listed here but altcoins that are getting pumped in that particular day so that you can buy them during the pump and sell them before their dump begins to make a decent profit in a short time.Of course a lot of people trade using their bitcoins (not fiat) so that they can make profit on the amount of bitcoin they have. So your concern about people not having bitcoin is not correct in this scenario even though they are seemingly trading altcoins only.",

It's clear that it's likely to be one of the biggest markets globally, and the article does mention a particular interest of South Koreans in altcoins.I do agree with the sentiment that it's better to buy BTC than altcoins. It's just less risky and can pay off significantly in the long run, especially considering the investment amount that the op is mentioning because it can buy a whole Bitcoin and then some.",

Koreans don't buy bitcoin, thinking there's no difference between bitcoin and altcoins.You should discuss this matter with your local board if there is any because in this way they will understand it better. And there are facts behind the choice of most people in alts and leaving BTC in the first place. The first reason is BTC might not give them 4x, 5x, 10x, 1000x, or any x that investors are hoping for. BTC is a safe place with lower profit but alts are risky places with more profit. So I guess Koreans, must be aware of the risks involved and they must be prepared to face outcomes also.I don't know how much money a Korean can make by how many hours a day and for how many years, but if $50k is an average adult income per year then it is a good one, those who are investing such big investments must have backup funds and if they don't then they are being optimistic about the market and its bullish trend.The blame is on market sentiments, currently, no wonder what coin you choose from the 200 100, or even 500 list, it will give you profit because the market is going up but blind investment will cause loss also so, choosing one coin from the list, should be done by at least with basic analysis like fundamental.",
