  "content": "This na to acknowledge say we dey increase our pressure for the local board, usually na we all dey benefits because now e come dey more interested say as you drop your quality post las las Joy go follow you back, because at some point here been dey dry onto say the pressure don pass one person wey we get as merits source but as we don ginger so tay theymos no gree turn eyes for us but God use another person com give us small lift I dy see say the pressure don fall back with full force. Even self the numbers of newbies don increase this is to show say the reason we no dey make progress na because no much joy coming out from this side of board if not for brainboss and Igebotz wey dey help to give people small hope and joy if not here for no be no go area for we people since every body dey run go out go hustle how them go take grow.So like this I want to really appreciate una for coming back with full force and this na to show say very soon we go take over some board especially that of russian because them dey always dey top. This hustle no be for one person but na for everybody, weda something come out or not make we still stick here to dey do our normal task and to dey keep here clean so even though our generous giver come stop e no go worry our mind again because I know say him don try for us. Like this I really like the vibe wey dey flow smoothly here like this, so make we keep the energy moving and remain oneness as one family together you and I go grow reach were we want.Love you allSmartGold cares.",

Na true you talk because I no say e no easy sha but I go still thank their people wey bring them come onboard, still on still anything wey you see say you supposed share here or any topic you know say go help the community no hesitate to share here because I believe say here na open place wey people supposed learn and we must not only seat and watch the newbies at least we are all learning together by sharing thoughts and knowledge.Giving them space be like say we too no wan contribute to the increase of the forum, but as we talk them talk here becomes more friendly to everyone to learn and grasps things across the board and that of the general board.",

      "body": "The effort wey oga BrainBoss don put for this board, I still dey find the best way to appreciate am. Like how will one person be so simple, magnanimous and progressional at heart. Him just dey wish everyone wey be Naija person for here as well as him they wish himself. Oga BrainBoss carry everyone turn in brother. His down-to-earthliness is second to none. These reasons na why I talk say we no fit thank am enough.Senior men wey join this forum before me describe how e take be back in those days, how the board na just thread wey every body dey try come contribute them quota, how Naija dey put energy but we still be thread. Them talk say na with the help and expertise of them boss including BrainBoss himself na hin make this thread turn to a full board now. Now, we can boast of this like any other country out there.One thing wey dey give me joy and inspiration anywhere I find myself na how Naija person dey show muscle. Na how we dey take para regardless of our numbers. All of these no be government efforts, na individual effort, na efforts wey people like us don make. If na government own we want to follow, we won't have gotten here. Las Las, no Nigerian is less patriotic of the country, like the government itself. E be like na swear dey swear that place. Sha no be the matter dey here.Thank you to the newbies that have been encouraged by the senior men and bosses to come here and for their beliefs to actually come here. I was also once a newbie here and today, I don become full member and still counting. With no neutral or negative tag. At least that's an encouragement. Plenty senior men dey here wey be hero members and them still dey gallant with no neutral tags. Make sense.Thank you to the fams. The vibe is indeed flowing smoothly!",
