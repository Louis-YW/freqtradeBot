  "content": "UPDATE: PUZZLE HAS BEEN SOLVED. Congrats to the winner!Hello!Happy 14th Birthday to the Bitcoin Whitepaper!To honor this day, I would like to re-introduce this video mashup puzzle I made for last years Whitepaper Day. Last year there were 13 million SATS (0.13 Bitcoin) up for grabs hidden within the mashup video. To date, the reward has gone unclaimed. Therefore the reward has increased to 14 million SATS (0.14 Bitcoin) and the difficulty has decreased since there are some more new clues in this version!I will say no more other than, you can find some other clues in this thread from last year: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qjo9b0/run_itcoin_run_happy_13th_birthday_to_the_bithttps://youtu.be/kbRhr2ITblU",
