  "content": "Hello or good evening gamers,For the second time, Shiftcrypto has entrusted me with the reins of this competition to win a Bitbox to secure your precious private keys. We're lucky to have such a sponsor, so it would be very kind of you to complete the survey conscientiously and efficiently. (https://bitbox.swiss/)The purpose of this contest is none other than to complete a survey so that Shiftcrypto can further improve its products. You'll be drawn at the end thanks to the wonderful bitmover tool (https://bitcoindata.science/giveaway-manager/). Deadline: July 9 midnight Paris time.Here are the rules:1. To participate, you must be registered on that forum since at least January 1, 2023. Your mission will be to find a partner in a local section who has written at least 10 messages on the forum. Your partner will also have to register to take part. It's a great opportunity to make new friends.2. Fill in the survey (about 10mns). No email required.3. Once you've completed the survey, you'll confirm on the forum that it's done.4. Prize draw on July 10.¬†=> After midnight July 9, it will no longer be possible.=> No possibility of getting satoshis instead of the prize.=> You can offer the Bitbox to anyone you like.=> We're counting on your fair play to be honest - there's no point in filling in several questionnaires anyway, it won't give you any more chances of winning.Here is the survey : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-IQ8EZtAcqkZu8SDnwnPw0SwRHL08upOXvFIhmzNWHX7CzQ/viewformGood luck to all.",
