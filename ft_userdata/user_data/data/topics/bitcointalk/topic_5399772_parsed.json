  "content": "It’s breath taking to see how Binance the worlds most popular crypto exchange had to suffer losses not in millions but billions of dollars! Binance had an address where at the peak price Luna were sent adding up 15 million LUNA on binance. These were around 1.6 billion dollar worth before the month Luna dropped to almost cents. Binance CEO, Zhao however still not worried much considering his net worth still stands at around $14 billion.  In his tweet, he shares funny meme and says “Poor again”, with picture of terrified guy. Lolz. I am not sure how Terra will help Binance, but CEO Zhao requested the project team to compensate the Binance users for this down turn. QuoteChangpeng Zhao, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, tweeted a few days ago that he was “poor again” after losing billions of dollars in cryptocurrency following a market crash, which wiped out the fortunes of many investors. The exchange's assets in the cryptocurrency Luna fell to just $2,200 from $1.6 billion, at the token's peak price, a month before. In a tweet, Zhao claimed that Binance held 15 million Luna tokens, which the exchange had obtained in exchange for a $3 million investment in the Terra network, which Luna is founded on. The Luna tokens were “never moved or sold,” he added.Luna's fall began when TerraUSD, its sister coin, lost its peg to the US dollar. The two tokens' prices are linked. When the price of TerraUSD dropped, investors raced to sell their holdings. The price of Luna was pulled down by the drop in TerraUSD.Despite the crash and the fall in the price of Luna, Zhao has a net worth of around $14.9 billion, as of Sunday, according to Bloomberg. His estimated 70 percent stake in Binance accounts for the majority of his wealth, stated a Forbes report.In another tweet, Zhao urged the Terra team to make reimbursing its retail investors top priority. He wrote, “To lead by example on protecting users, Binance will let this go and ask the Terra project team to compensate the retails users first, Binance last, if ever.”Terra Luna has dropped 99.15 percent in the last few days, according to Binance data. It has a market cap of $924.99 million.Daniel Shin and Do Kwon founded Terra Luna, a blockchain technology that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins, in January 2018. The token was first made accessible to investors in a private token sale in August 2018, raising a huge $32 million from investors including Binance, OKEx, and Huobi.Zhao founded Binance, which has grown to become the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volumes. Binance's daily average volume is over two billion, with over 14 lakh transactions per second. It provides cryptocurrency trading help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",

Another platform like stable gain has been declaring to bankrupt and it was also facing so many legal actions from its investors.There are so many parties starting to confirm about how much they have been loosing due to the terra luna failed project. Binance was the biggest exchange site and im sure that 3 millions UST meant nothing for binance.",

I think it's very impossible with Luna's death, of course there is nothing more that we can hope for.Hundreds of millions and even tens of millions of them were harmed by Luna in the blink of an eye, it was like a dream of Luna's project failure that made everyone confused by losing their funds.",

It's not just them, but I read a lot of tweets that concern Luna and them losing millions of their money to it. It's just that volatile, you know. Algo-based stable coins are probably not yet ready to be here because they have just been left to die, but Luna may have a fighting chance with what the Team Terra is proposing. Imagine being the leader of this, and many people have probably lost their life savings because of this. I'm not sure if it will still be able to recover from this, though. Has anybody thought of buying Luna despite what's happening?",

I don't think Terra can compensate binance users for what happened because the project team is surely in a big loss too plus they are having problems with how they can further save their coin. Plus there are millions of binance users. And I also don't think luna can ever recover from what happened, for me, there is a very high chance that it will just keep on going down no matter what the project team would do. It's much better for them to just start a new project and learn from what happened and try to make a coin much better than luna and then try to compensate luna investors somehow afterward if they can.",
