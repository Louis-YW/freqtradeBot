With Bitcoin blockchain, you only have to pay transaction fee but with altcoin blockchains and decentralized exchanges for altcoin trading, you will probably have to pay tax. It depends on that DEX policy and tax policy of that project.Some altcoin projects like high inflationary altcoins in GameFi, Metaverse, NFT, can set very high sale tax fee.QuoteAlthough the Non-VAPs keep declining and the data last in 2019, but people can still enjoy decentralization. https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/bitcoin-market-data-exchanges-trading/Thanks for the information that is interesting and it is my first time to know such a chart on VAPs, Non-VAPs.

Bitcoin is still decentralized and many of the crypto that where modeled after Bitcoin still has thier decentralized nature but that doesn't mean that if the owners of such project choose to link themselves to the project and refuse being anonymous just like Satoshi did that it has changed it from being decentralized. The very concept of a coin being decentralized isn't even that the brain or team behind the creation of those kind of coin is known, as long as users have full control of the said coin instead of a single person or group of people having control of it, then it's decentralized.That is the main issue with altcoin and the reason why most People don't still consider most of them an investible asset. Most of them aren't decentralized but have some level of possible manipulation that can go on with it which makes Bitcoin totally different from them. When using an exchange to buy your Bitcoin, you might provide your kyc which only reveals your anonymous self but doesn't still makes Bitcoin to become centralized. As long as you're not keeping your Bitcoin in a centralized exchange but you're securedly keeping it in a cold storage, you're just right on track and the concept of Bitcoin being decentralization hasn't failed a bit.",

A decentralized system works without any third party or central authority having control of the system. That's different from be anonymous or having kyc. These new projects like I've said several times are just there to make profits for their developers. So I don't usually advice people to stress them self investing in such project. They might claim to be decentralized but they actually work on centralized networks where users might have to give out their personal information to use them. Bitcoin is nothing like them. It still decentralized and will remain that way for ever.Â  Government have tried but they hurt cannot control it. Except those who uses centralized exchanges or platforms to store their coins.",

The vision of inventing a digital currency like bitcoin in a blockchain is for decentralization purpose meaning users can be a self custodian to their funds unlike the fiats which is controlled by the government with a central authorities regulating the Centralized financial ecosystem.If you want to remain anonymous with your bitcoin holding, then practically keep your assets on the decentralized networks where your funds are at your custody and you literally doesn't need to do KYC there.The concept of KYC it for crypto users who may want to trade their bitcoin assets in exchange of the fiats through the Centralized exchanges networks. By so doing, you're to be let known that you're there by dragging closer to the government are you're to intersect your decentralized bitcoin to their centralized fiat currency. So then, KYC would be duly required where the government or an authority may have traceable through your resume of transacting with the banks which is under their custody.That doesn't contradict the fact that bitcoin isn't keeping decentralization as meant to be.",

That's why you see KYC everywhere.Yes Crypto has long since abandoned the idea of decentralization. Bitcoin is and has always been the only cryptocurrency focused on decentralization. This is well understood. Crypto never embraced the core ideas of Bitcoin - decentralization, global security, money - and instead turned towards the idea of somewhat centralized apps and shilling of tokens. Well Crypto back in the old days at least tried to embrace Bitcoin's most important values, but no altcoins could ever match Bitcoin so eventually they just abandoned that goal and, led by Ethereum, decided to just be app and token networks where decentralization is not the goal, but they still pretend like it is (how many crypto founders have said their token is just as decentralized as Bitcoin? lol, probably all over them) because it makes for good false marketing for them to pretend they are like Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin is the most decentralized because no-one identity controls the network consensus. It's important that we make that fact very clear.As for newer projects, I want to believe that most of them are driven by VC funds and incentives that team members stand to gain.

So nowadays, people complaining about decentralization, complaining about anonymity, I think it doesn't make much sense anymore. because see, why are most people entering this cryptocurrency market? The answer is simple: they want to make profits. They don't want to obtain anonymity, they don't want something decentralized, but they do want to make profitsA few years ago, when people wanted to invest in cryptocurrencies, they analyzed whether the project was decentralized or not and whether it was anonymous or not. when they knew it was anonymous at least, then they ran to invest because they thought it would be the trend because it symbolized victory over governments, but nowadays with governments interfering in this market, people even stay away from anonymous currency, they prefer to invest in coins. Memes that are centralized are mostly scams, but because they will make a profit it's okay for them. By this I mean that today the market is no longer made up of people who love certain projects, who love certain purposes such as decentralization and anonymity, today the market is more commercial, in which people enter with the sole objective: to profit and abandon the altcoin and look for another to make a profit. and because of this, the creators of new altcoins will create alts with the purpose of attracting investors, they will not create decentralization or anonymity projects, they have created something that is only profitable",

There have been various theories and speculations, some even believe it's the CIA. This can be achieved because Bitcoin was built in a way that whoever created it is not making money directly from it, unlike most altcoins.
