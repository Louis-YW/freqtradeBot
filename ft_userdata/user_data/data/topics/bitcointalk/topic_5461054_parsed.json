It's quite unfortunate that twitter has now become the center for scammers and what if Elon Musk implemented the payment system on the twitter, doesn't it mean it would go worst than this? This side of the board are meant for newbies to be visiting since they always focused their efforts on getting free tokens.Anyway thanks for sharing.",

And right now, Elon Musk has made things very easy for scammers, as they can now get the blue ticker by just paying 8 dollars. There is no need for some verification and all those checks, which makes the account look more real and less suspicious with the fake followers, which might have possibly been boosted by bots or any other means necessary. ScamViruS, I know this is about scams, which makes this place the perfect board for them, but I seriously doubt this information will serve its purpose well on this board. As the highest percentage of newbies are always active in the beginners and help sections, My suggestion would have been for this topic to be in the beginners and help section for a little while before you could move it back to this place. Just my suggestion, though.",

Control your greed and avoid sending your wallet information to scammers, stay safe from hackers.This is one phishing site among the thousands of domains that occupied the hashtag #AEKM on Twitter after the Binance news. It is worth noting that ARKHAM is not the only project that scammers set eyes on its community to defraud them. Still, you will find that most of the currencies that rise in the trends are due to an event or some hot news; you find a lot of tweets about fake airdrops or giveaways around them. However, I am sure that these traps for scammers have become common, but awareness must be raised among new users and investors and help report to suspend these domains; perhaps someone will fall into them as a result of their lack of knowledge.The phishing domain has been reported successfully, thank you, OP.",
