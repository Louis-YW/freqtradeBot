  "content": "QuoteMany warning signs suggesting that a debt reckoning is imminentMinxin Pei is professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and a nonresident senior fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.Confidence in the safety of Chinese banks has been badly shaken by the failure of several small banks in Henan Province in April this year. In terms of their assets of about 40 billion yuan ($6 billion) and the number of customers, roughly 400,000, the shuttered rural banks are minions in China's financial system.The implosion of these poorly supervised and likely corruption-ridden financial institutions should not be surprising. But how local authorities handled the fallout is shocking even to the most jaded observers of China's political scene.Instead of compensating the depositors, who are entitled to up to 500,000 yuan, according to government regulations, officials in Henan have done everything imaginable to silence them.They initially restricted the movement of the depositors by turning the COVID test code on their smartphones red, which effectively made it impossible for them to take public transportation or even drive their own cars. A public outcry forced the Henan government to abandon this abusive tactic.But when several hundred depositors unable to gain access to their savings in the failed banks gathered on July 10 to protest in front of the People's Bank branch office in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan, local officials sent in a large number of thugs who viciously assaulted the depositors, with uniformed police officers looking on.This scandal should alarm investors not simply because of the brutal tactics used by local authorities eager to cover it up but because of the circumstances under which these small banks failed.Ever since China began to binge on debt to fuel its growth in 2009, many have wondered how long the party could go on. To the chagrin of many bearish observers, predictions of a financial crisis have not panned out. Today, China's banking system is still standing despite a debt-to-GDP ratio of 264%.Perhaps because Beijing seems to be able to defy financial gravity, fewer people these days worry that its ballooning debt could unleash a systemic crisis. But there are many warning signs indicating that China may face a debt reckoning soon.Weak supervision, poor risk management and corruption that likely drove the small rural banks in Henan into insolvency are systemic among the country's nearly 4,000 small and medium-sized banks with nearly $14 trillion assets.It is highly likely that other similar banks will fail soon. By pure coincidence, when Henan authorities were cracking down on the victims of bank failure there, authorities in Shanghai had put on trial, in secret, a former billionaire who allegedly controlled a medium-sized bank in Inner Mongolia and used it to fund various illicit schemes. When the government seized the failed bank in 2019, the bailout cost several billion dollars.If a large number of small banks fail together, such an event could produce a chain reaction threatening the stability of the financial sector. Their counterparties and lenders, especially bigger banks, could suffer massive losses. Confidence in China's shadow banking system, through which small banks attract funds with a higher interest rate, will likely evaporate.The chances of such a financial meltdown are much higher today than before. One of the reasons that China has avoided a financial crisis in the last decade is that its economy managed to grow at a reasonably high rate, averaging 6.8% a year from 2011 to 2020. A faster-growing economy normally makes it easier to manage or even conceal the debt burden.But as the Chinese economy is now slowing down rapidly, in part due to Beijing's zero-COVID policy, the debt bomb is ticking much louder.The most ominous warning light is clearly China's debt-ridden real estate sector. China Evergrande Group, the country's largest real estate developer, which has borrowed more than $300 billion, has already defaulted on its bonds. More defaults seem likely because Chinese developers are on the hook for $13 billion in dollar-denominated bond payments in the second half of this year.China's debt-laden local governments are also facing grim prospects. Declining income from land sales because of the crisis in the real estate sector and falling tax receipts are expected to cause a 6 trillion yuan shortfall, roughly $900 billion, in local government revenues this year. Local government financing vehicles that have borrowed heavily from banks or issued bonds will have great difficulties servicing their debt.Large banks in China are in trouble as well. They have lent tens of billions to poor countries as part of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. A significant portion of their credit portfolio is likely to become nonperforming as their borrowers are unable to service the debt due to the global economic downturn.The most recent economic implosion and the collapse of the government of Sri Lanka will likely force their Chinese lenders to write off a large portion of the loans. If big Chinese banks themselves face rising nonperforming loans abroad, they will be less able to help bail out insolvent small or medium-sized banks at home.It might be possible for China to dodge another financial meltdown this time. But if local officials have to hire thugs to attack bank customers trying to get their money back, investors should brace for far worse days ahead for China's banking sector.https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/China-s-debt-bomb-looks-ready-to-explode....It is possible that china's economy is imploding at the moment. The united states $50 billion dollars in ukraine funds, might have gone to china. To stabilize their economy and prevent global collapse. This could be one reason behind the united states currently throwing \"additional funding\" at ukraine. And funding additional near $1 trillion dollar packages.A high percentage of funds could be diverted into china, to bailout their economy as credit and debt bubbles pop.None of this would be remarkable if it was true. The united states has bailed out many foreign banks since the TARP bill was passed post 2008 economic crisis. The federal reserve claims every dollar it loaned to foreign banks has been paid back prior to the 2020 pandemic.What is remarkable about these trends is if the united states economy flounders and the US government doesn't settle debt issues. America might find itself in a position where it can no longer bail out china, and other banks and lagging economies of the world. What happens then? It would be nice if we could plan ahead for likely scenarios. However it doesn't appear to be a high priority within the grand scheme of things.",

The US seem to 'condemn' China's ways, but still wants to bail it on its enormous debt when the time comes. I guess there is no turning back to this massive bubble that the Chinese created and directed upon themselves. This kind of tactic to grow the economy can only go so far.  Once the bubble pops, the whole world will certainly be affected, and we will experience yet another shaky future ahead of us. Knowing that the Chinese government is very secretive when it comes to imperfections and negatives in its country, I wonder how bad the situation really is?",

And the funny thing is that the Chinese economy is exactly the same as the crisis of 2009, when the real estate bubble burst! They did the same, only within the local market. And the result was not long in coming. But in the case of the Chinese economy, everything will be even worse - not a segment of the market, but the entire economy will collapse, because. In China, the domestic market is very \"fragile\" and everything is highly dependent on all internal processes. After the \"explosion\" of the real estate market, the construction-related market has already begun to crumble (from the production of concrete, building metal to manufacturers of electrical wiring, laminate and household kitchen appliances) ... And these are millions of workers who will soon be left without work, companies will stop paying taxes , and .. and further in a vicious circle. The only thing to say is that this will not happen this year for sure, China still has some inertia.PS by the way - the United States officially began to withdraw production and technology from China, and transfer it to the United States, to solve 2 problems:1. Solve internal problems, \"burn\" tons of money printed, give new jobs and boost the US economy. At the same time, provide their manufacturers with microelectronics (microchips, etc.)2. Show China its place, and force it to be more accommodating.",

The 2009 crisis might still left China on the same place and with their current issues, it’s possible to make thing more worst. With the US bailout, I guess they can’t do this with China’s failing banks since the number is too much, and their funds is quiet focused in something else, China should take actions now or else many will suffer more.",

This is just the initial problem. It is extremely difficult to imagine what we will entail, an artificially contained crisis. But as history shows, there is only one way out - to borrow real money somewhere, in huge quantities. Without this, a kind of chain reaction of the destruction of the financial and economic system of China will begin (most likely it has already begun), and an increase in internal tension, which will soon give rise to a strong explosion!",

And the result was not long in coming. But in the case of the Chinese economy, everything will be even worse - not a segment of the market, but the entire economy will collapse, because. In China, the domestic market is very \"fragile\" and everything is highly dependent on all internal processes. After the \"explosion\" of the real estate market, the construction-related market has already begun to crumble (from the production of concrete, building metal to manufacturers of electrical wiring, laminate and household kitchen appliances) ... And these are millions of workers who will soon be left without work, companies will stop paying taxes , and .. and further in a vicious circle. The only thing to say is that this will not happen this year for sure, China still has some inertia.PS by the way - the United States officially began to withdraw production and technology from China, and transfer it to the United States, to solve 2 problems:1. Solve internal problems, \"burn\" tons of money printed, give new jobs and boost the US economy. At the same time, provide their manufacturers with microelectronics (microchips, etc.)2. Show China its place, and force it to be more accommodating.Have you ever wondered why large factories from the USA and Europe moved to China?Anyone who studies economics knows that the production of goods in China is more profitable than in the US and Europe.Therefore, the US government will have to spend a lot of money to compensate for these losses and train its engineers.The situation with Taiwan is even more ridiculous for the US. Chips are made in Taiwan for the US military industry, and they are located near China and Russia. It doesn't matter that Russia will locate military production in Cuba.",

It's a dangerous game to play, but I'd be more concerned about the fact the U.S. is in a recession and birth rates seem to be declining which means there isn't enough economic output to support the debt. Inflation compounds the issue to the extent that it accelerates other countries dumping USD from their currency reserves as its purchasing power decreases too quickly over time.",
