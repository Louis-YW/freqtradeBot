I don't know how trust wallet generates seeds or what length they'll be but it makes sense it'll only give you 12 word seeds (that's 128 bits of entropy and an already impossible number to crack/guess).Most wallets that incorporate bip39 go with 128 bits (12 words) or 256 bits (24 words). The best way to ensure your wallet is more secure is by extending these words with a passphrase that you'll remember (it can't be recovered) if Trustwallet supports that or finding a different wallet that does.",

If someone be able to predict your phrase than it can be easily hacked. I want to know is there any kind of solution so that we cannot be hacked from trust wallet?Seed phrase can be 12 to 24 words (12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words). But 12 and 24 word seed phrases are commonly generated on most wallets.12 words are secure enough, provided you do not expose it where someone can see it, or got exposed online. If you do not feel comfortable with only seed phrase, then you may not want to use Trustwallet if you want to extent it with passphrase.Trustwallet also only provide you with one address and it is a close source wallet. Some of the reasons I do not recommend the wallet.Quote from: jackg on October 05, 2022, 05:54:19 PMMost wallets that incorporate bip39 go with 128 bits (12 words) or 256 bits (24 words).

It has 10 million downloads, but check their WalletScrutiny results:Quote from: https://walletscrutiny.com/android/com.wallet.crypto.trustapp/NO SOURCE FOR CURRENT RELEASE FOUNDA wallet that claims to not give the provider the means to steal the users’ funds might actually be lying. In the spirit of “Don’t trust - verify!” you don’t want to take the provider at his word, but trust that people hunting for fame and bug bounties could actually find flaws and back-doors in the wallet so the provider doesn’t dare to put these in.Back-doors and flaws are frequently found in closed source products but some remain hidden for years. And even in open source security software there might be catastrophic flaws undiscovered for years.An evil wallet provider would certainly prefer not to publish the code, as hiding it makes audits orders of magnitude harder.For your security, you thus want the code to be available for review.If the wallet provider doesn’t share up to date code, our analysis stops there as the wallet could steal your funds at any time, and there is no protection except the provider’s word. [emphasis mine]I think it's unintended, but the reason you probably don't want to use it is even in their name: 'Trust'. You have to trust the provider, instead of being able to verify that its codebase is even secure in the first place.",
