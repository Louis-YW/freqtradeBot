The cost of production of these GPU's which includes, the cost of acquiring their various components plus transportation, even electricity to mention a few has increased, so you don't expect the price it was a year ago to be the same price currently. You can blame general inflation.",

You can blame general inflation. gpu's are cheaper on sept 1 , 2022 than sept 1, 2021inflation may have caused them to cost more than sept 1, 2020.  But mining really ran gpu prices way up all of 2021. Now that eth is destroying itself by switching to pos and off pow gpu prices are far lower.I can see the op is new and may not follow prices well but a senior person should have more of a grasp on current gpu prices than you do.I can go to EVGA.com and buy gpus for 30% than I could do last year.",

Do visit aliexpress and check on prices, the are already down but still not far from MSRP, if the merge is complete by 12 or 13 of this month many miners will shut down because profit will be lesser and unbearable.",

Pretty much everything is much more expensive now.Houses, rent, cars, computer equipment like GPUs.Another reason why GPUs went up since 2019 is because mining was very profitable in 2020-2021 so all the miners bought them up. Hence why the pricing doesn't make sense. Whats worse is people paying $200 for an RX 470 which had an MSRP of $200 about 6 years ago.",

So I think  Both are the reasons for the increase in the price of GPUs. And now it's became little cheaper than 2021 but I think it is also can be reason that where are  you living. Moreover, due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the prices of all goods are increasing all over the world.",

Your retailer is probably trying to get more profits if they're offering you that price point unless your location is so remote nobody else sells any GPU other than them.Go look online, you'll see that the price is getting better as others have said. If the online price + tax + other cost is still cheaper than your local store, I'd say go for it.",

I think I got 2% off the 277 so say they were 272 and six months to pay them off.these cards went as high as 650 a piece when eth peaked40 mh 90 watts good cards still working now.now that ETH has decided to destroy itself and I am sitting with about 200 cards it should be fun to see just how much the market tanks",
