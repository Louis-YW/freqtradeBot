  "content": "World's first hardware-based MPC Wallet, making it the first BIP-39 compatible seedless wallet.Cypherock X1 uses Shamir Secret Sharing along with distributed tamper-proof hardware storage used in the banking industry to prevent single point of failure with private key security. X1 has five components- 1 X1 Wallet and 4 X1 Cards. Your Crypto private keys are distributed in 5 components, such that you need any 2 out of those 5 to access and/or recover your Crypto assets.              https://imgur.com/jenzlwcProduct Features: Cypherock X1 is the World's first BIP-39 seedless wallet. Unlike other wallets, there is no need for the user to write the 24 recovery words or the seed phrase anywhere.Open Source with secure elements both on the X1 Wallet and the X1 cards. Source code - github.com/cypherockCypherock X1 is the World's first sufficiently trustless wallet. As a Crypto investor, you have to trust your wallet provider that they will not push a malicious software update to your wallet that extracts out the private keys. In Cypherock X1, even if a developer pushes a malicious software update to the X1 wallet, they will not be able to compromise your private keys since your private keys are never stored as a whole on X1 wallet. X1 cards are not upgradable once shipped to the users.No Single Point of Failures as the private keys are never stored in a single place. Cypherock X1 solves for the first time the inheritance problem with Crypto assets without compromising the privacy and control of the assets. (Coming Soon) Majority of the hardware wallets today only allow the user to store one seed phrase wallet per hardware. Cypherock X1 allows the user to store upto 4 different wallet seed phrases on a single Cypherock X1. Generate new wallets or use any of these 4 slots to backup your existing hardware and software wallets, thereby making them seedless too. Portfolio Aggregation: Backing up existing wallets allows you to manage your multiple wallets from a single interface i.e the Cysync App.Website: https://www.cypherock.comSecurity Audit Completed by Keylabs.io without any major vulnerabilities found.

But imagine how many different backups you would have to make and how many new physical locations you would have to keep them in if you started using 4 different wallets with their own unique seeds?This is the exact problem we are trying to solve. Current self custody solutions have tons of limitations. For a start, there is no portfolio management tools in self custody solutions. If a user wants to manage multiple portfolios they need to buy multiple hardware wallets and computer setups, in order to do so. From our interaction with users we found a few interesting customer profiles facing this issue. Let me mention couple of them.Bitcoin Maxi but likes testing Smart contracts on other chains: Because of the faith in security of Bitcoin ecosystem, users liked to keep their wallet containing Bitcoin funds separate from other chains. To do so, users had to maintain multiple device setups, one for bitcoin and one for other chains.Web3 Startup Founders/ VC Partners: Founders usually are responsible for managing their personal funds along with company funds. This is problematic is current solutions but with X1, they can create multiple wallets with separate seedphrase, each for different portfolios from one setup and use them separately in a sandboxed manner. No need to maintain excel sheets to keep track of your portfolio. Additionally, They can create sub portfolios. Like Marketing funds, development funds, Legal funds,s, etc. using multi-account feature.(Scheduled for January Release)You can read more one it here: https://www.cypherock.com/features/portfolio Quote3 backups per seed takes the total up to 12. Add passphrases to that mix (if you use them) and you will have to buy/rent more properties or get more friends and family.  Precisely, seedphrase backup is the sole limiting factor for self custody solutions making bigger leaps in terms of innovation. We believe our solution has solved core problem of self custody. As you mentioned finding 12 secure places to store plain text seedphrase is quite a tedious task for a users. But with Cypherock X1, you have Zero Seedphrases and you can distribute X1 cards to any geo location or trusted person without ever worrying about that entity being able to read your private keys.",

Thank you for flagging it. Will do the needful to prevent further confusion.QuoteI finished watching Crypto Guide video and other Cypherock video reviews, and I have to say that I don't like single point of failure that makes wallet unusable if PIN code is lost or forgotten.There are considerable benefits of PIN backup over solutions opted by other wallets:1. Backuping up PIN is 100x easier than backing up seedphrases. (Like mandatory in all the rest of the wallets)Easier to write, no mis-writing mistakes.Easier to store. Need smaller space.2. PIN backups are not single point of failure like seedphrases [ IMPORTANT ]PIN backup can be taken at 'n' number of places as it is not a single point of failure. Same cannot be said with seedphrases. User cannot take 'n' number of backups as losing any one of them is catastrophic.That being said, we agree with Crypto guide's point of view. Therefore, we are redesigning our onboarding flow so that there is a substantial warning while user sets up the PIN. It will be same as other wallets give a substantial warning to backup your seedphrase. Once our Inheritance Solution is released. Forgetting PIN won't be a problem as our Inheritance Solution will take care of it. (More on it on it's launch)QuoteSome other things really need to be improved if you want to compete with all other hardware wallet manufacturers, and I hope to see software updates and compatibility with other wallets (like you said before for Electrum).I agree, since we are a new player in the market.

PINs are just the top layer security to prevent anyone from getting into the device. What i meant by seedphrase being single point of failure was: Not Seedphrases but Seedphrase backups are a single point of failure. Anyone getting access to your backup can wipe you out completely. Here is a great example that happened recently. https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1604599964713328640PIN Backups which are 4-8 character long can be hidden indistinguishably anywhere. As compared to seedphrase backups which are exponentially much more difficult to hide. An unauthorised entity getting hands on seedphrase backup can drain you out as they are so easy to recognise and the only component needed to wipe you out. PIN backups are almost impossible to find if hidden properly. On top of that, even with access to PIN, attacker needs atleast 2 components of the wallet in order to break into your funds.QuoteCan I still use the seed words I used on Cypherock wallet and import them in some other brand of hardware wallet, let's say Trezor, should everything work fine or they are useless without PIN?User can export seedphrase from X1 and it takes under a minute to do so. X1 being BIP-39 compatible means it works with all the mainstream software and hardware wallets and users can seamlessly shift from X1 to any other wallet, or vice versa.Here is how you can do so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W22TcY8MtQ QuoteJust wondering if you can tell us how big Cypherock team is, I mean how many developers you have that are working on firmware, code and everything else?Cypherock currently is 20+ member team.",

The device is the processing house to provide coin-specific functionality. The permanent storage of all the account secret is on the cards. To provide some authenticity check, the device stores private keys of its own in the Secure chip (ATECC). Apart from that, the device also stores some session keys specific to enable a secure execution environment.2. The device has access to PIN (and its subsequent hash) only for a short duration (one session) of time in its RAM. No information about PIN is stored on the device. Whenever a user enters PIN it is erased right after it's used. The cards store the double hash of the PIN permanently to provide an authentication mechanism whenever someone tries to access the user data on the card. The storage of PIN digest on the card is fully managed by JCOP OS that is EAL 5+ certified which provides in-built safety even from side-channel attacks.3. If the user has set a PIN, then the shard is first encrypted and then stored in the NVM. If there is no PIN, the shard is stored as it is. The decryption is done using the first hash of the PIN. The handling of PIN is unaffected by this bahaviour since the nonce for encryption is stored on the cards. The nonce for encryption acts as salt for the encryption along with hash of PIN.4. information about accounts, history, and transactions are never stored on the device or cards. They are only available with the desktop companion (CySync) application.QuoteI get the point that you wanted to achieve simplification with PIN code, but watching all Cypherock review videos I still think it's a bit complicated to handle and tap all those cards multiple times.I agree that these are minor UX issues at this point. This is what we are currently solving at the moment.
