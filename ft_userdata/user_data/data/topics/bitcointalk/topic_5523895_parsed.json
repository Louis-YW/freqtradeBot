Bitget launched services like Bitget Pay and Bitget Card for low fee, instant settlements of money, while Coinbase recently announced it would support Apple Pay to ease crypto purchases. These steps essentially point to the fact that the industry is trying to play catch-up, but it is not quite smooth.https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/23/3001089/0/en/Bitget-Partners-with-Fiat24-to-Advance-PayFi-Solutions-for-Crypto.html?https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2024/coinbase-integrates-apple-pay-into-crypto-onboarding-solution/The name Normie Tech in and of itself feels like a nail right to the head of that issue. A seamless way for customers to pay in fiat and merchants to get their crypto for all of the freelancers and businesses around the world. Good luck.",

As for the other hoops to jump through, any registered platform offering fiat services is bound to comply with regulations. This equates to inconvenience to users. There will be hassles. You need to submit government IDs, for example, to prove your identity or bills to prove your address. And then there will be processing time, so transactions won't be instant.  As to your solution, wouldn't you charge anything? Wouldn't you ask for KYC?",

I don't want to mine it and spend money on buying the hardware, setting it up, and running it. There are services that allow you to mine altcoins with your existing GPU and computer and get paid in bitcoin, but we are again talking about a middleman that takes a significant cut.",

Even with your Normie tech, you're still a middleman, which means that you've not eliminated the need for it. You have to understand that cryptocurrency is alternative to fiat, except for El Salvador, that has made Bitcoin a legal tender, the accepted means of payments in every country remains their fiat currencies, so nobody is compelled to transact cryptocurrency. What will eliminate middlemen in crypto transactions is massive adoption, if majority holds Bitcoin, they can do p2p transactions without any hassles.",

So which of the two will it be?Hi @bias, the intention isn't to have people buy crypto. If the person sending money received crypto, they would need to KYC. Instead, the payer sends money to the middleman, the middleman buys crypto using that fiat, and then sends crypto on to the person the payer is trying to pay. It's forwarding on a payment in a different form.That way to the payer, all they did was easily checkout with credit card, and to the receiver, they easily receive crypto from their customers.",

That's the reason why you had faced such issues. There are some well known freelancing platforms who had made the crypto payment simpler. Your client pays in whatever ways they like and you get the payment in crypto. Banks will never make it easier for anyone to use crypto with ease.

Even if your friend has bitcoin, he is under no obligation to pay back his debt in bitcoin since when he borrowed the money,  he did that in fiat, so paying back should also be in fiat. If you badly need to get bitcoins, you should buy by yourself from the fiat he would pay you.As for getting paid in bitcoin by freelancing companies, I have never encountered any of these challenges.  My payments come when due without me facing anything like transactions fees and bank stress. Freelancing companies that pay in crypto know how to do it very easy and stres free for both parties. Take this forum for instance, campaigns that pay in bitcoin don't put you under any of those stress.",
