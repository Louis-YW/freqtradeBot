Looks like a different method us used here to generate round result from SHA512 hash.Does anyone know a different method to solve this???All suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!!",

Yes these hashes are the actual final strings where the result is calculated from. There are different methods to use such as this which is commonly used by most companies like Aviator, BustaBit, SpaceX,Bitsler etc.Stake.com uses it too but with first 8 characters not 13;Example 1;SHA512 hash=\"3f3da73e3d30f5791c628ae61d236744304efdbd51ba3e2505588fa76f466dd41e201a3acfdac47 e1a08fb9be9a5240eeda3c0e1fddab92d2d30523e90df3dab\"-Take the first 13 characters (3f3da73e3d30f) and convert it from a hexadecimal to decimal (1112544502862607)-Divide it by pow(2, 52) to get a number between 0-1 (1112544502862607 / 4503599627370496 = 0.24703450459964293)-Calculate the payout with the formula: floor(98 / (1 - 0.24703450459964293)) / 100 = 1.3 and max cap it to 1,000,000 to get your final bet result: 1.3x;Above method is most common but there are other several methods available If you apply this method to the strings i provided you won't get those exact results i provided;So i need more methods to try and go through them to get the exact one that was used",
