If we talk about making money on cryptocurrencies, these are sales on lunchpads or testnets. But only those testnets, which have to involve real money, only they can give something in the future, all these free testnetes, where you just perform tasks, out of 100 can give something maximum 1-2, so this is also a waste of time. Almost always any action in cryptocurrency, where there is no initial investment, it is difficult to call earnings, rather just a waste of time and pampering.",

You don't know how much you are going to be paid, you don't know if your work is being counted by the manager, you don't know if the project is going to make it all the way until the launchment, you don't know if the token is going to be listed on exchanges. There are no guarantees and that is terrible, since employees don't have any stability when performing tasks.After ICOs hype has started, it has become extremely difficult to find worthful earning opportunites to collect cryptocurrency from zero. The ones promoted nowadays, like Coinbase and Coinmarketcap \"earn cryptocurrency while learning\" features, are extremely scarce and limited. Another alternative is to join a micro tasks platform, like Pico Workers, and cashout BTC, although executable offers are also scarce and there are a lot of cheater users using multi accounts who fastly drain the tasks.",

Which of these methods of earning free crypto should I pursue? Airdrop are a good way to make money, but airdrop events have evolved from what we know from days back. Now you have to \"invest\" by joining retroactive airdrops where you get to use layer 2 platforms, buy and stake certain tokens to be eligible for retroactive airdrops, example of such are OP tokens (optimism), Hop Exchange tokens, and lots more. For Staking segment you have the several airdrop received by users who staked Atom, Osmosis, Juno and so on. To earn from airdrop, these are kinds of airdrops you should look forward to",

Profit there are unstable and if you've made so much there then that's good for you. I rarely see people nowadays that have been telling that they're making well off from these two. Usually, in bounties they've got a higher chance of success than airdrops. Gone are the days when most airdrops have been making decent money after the launch of their projects but today, if you're lucky that have chosen a project then that's on you and you can literally say that it's profitable because you're the one that have chosen that airdrops. Bounties and airdrops are just incentives so any of them you pursue, just make yourself aware that they're not stable.",

Which of these methods of earning free crypto should I pursue? I myself feel confused about how to make more money through the Airdrop route, while we can participate with one account. Maybe some use two or three, but that's also not optimal. For me, bounties are more profitable than Airdrops. We will get a big profit if we hold the coins for some time after the distribution is done. If the price of the coin has increased, then we can sell it. Or by trading with the coins we get. In general, after the distribution is done, the price will drop for a while, so we can buy to increase the number of coins.",

Which of these methods of earning free crypto should I pursue? If you managed to earn more money from Airdrops than from Bounty, you are probably choosing your campaigns wrong. Airdrops are usually dust that is given away almost for free, and owners aren't interested in long-term growth at all. When it comes to Bounty Campaigns, it's also not easy to find an honest project, but if you do find one, I'm sure you'll earn more in the long term than with Airdrop.",

If you got lucky with those airdrop you can have more money and if you reinvest your reward with Uniswap, most probably you can earn more. Bounties and airdrop are still active right now, we’ve seen a lot of good projects hosting bounty and they are really paying good money to the participants. I believe you can still make money here, you just need to be active and choose the good project to work with.",

Which of these methods of earning free crypto should I pursue? It really depends. You should always do a minimum amount of research before you invest your precious life's time on some project. A lot of people think they are getting it tokens for free just because they do not have to invest money.At the end 9/10 projects never even make it and the tokens stay worthless.But I have earned a decent amount for translation bounty jobs, for example. I had to research the project and if it was worth wasting time on. But really? In reality you still make more or less the same amount of money you would have if it was the same job but paid in fiat or Bitcoin. I got tired after a while and stopped. Its easier taking jobs where you get paid money, not something that MIGHT become money.",

Which of these methods of earning free crypto should I pursue? A direct answer is NO. They are apparently unreliable way of earning, they have been ignored by many people knowing that they are useless, majority of these airdrops have small market value or even totally nothing. But, if you want to have some collection of them, wasting your time, this is the thing we do. But I guess, you don't but I think you also have to try just to prove by yourself and of course, for you to know the sentiment of the participants complaining about unpaid airdrops.",

Not all bounties are giving profit to everyone here, though I cannot deny there are some bounty are giving payment in altcoins, and some are via bitcoin payment. And for airdrops, I am not sure about this if we can still get a giveaways for this one. Just be wise in choosing the new bounty campaign here in the forum. It maybe a waste of time to others but for bounties are not a waste of time especially if you know how to determine the legit one new projects.

Though, in every participation of the projects there is still risk in it. Because, for me bounties and airdrops are both opportunity here in the forum.",
