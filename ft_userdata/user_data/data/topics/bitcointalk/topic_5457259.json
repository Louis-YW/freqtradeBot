But to me this is an unhealthy discussion.So I commented on the thread created by Not your key not your BTC. I commented my opinion, but he fired back by calling me \"kid\" without offering a clear argument and kept at it until perhaps I had taken the subject off-topic. I know I was wrong but I don't think what he did was ethical to discuss with the term “kid” which I think was purposely done to belittle me.The discussion starts here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456709.msg62436311#msg62436311https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456709.msg62438016#msg62438016https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456709.msg62441644#msg62441644https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5456709.msg62446676#msg62446676Is this a normal thing in this forum discussion?

Sometimes people don't miss the chance to criticize others rudely. He could have explained it to you with better words. But, he chooses not to explain and is aggressive. You should know there are some groups of people with different mind setups than yours. Sometimes they will come up with arguments and sometimes you will do the same. Take positive things and try to ignore negative things. Go forward and never look back. Good luck!",

      "body": "1.  You need to have a thick skin if you're going to be a bitcointalk member for any length of time.  Complaining about what you think are rude posts won't accomplish anything, believe me.2.  You wrote this, which is part of one of your posts that contained more than just this:Quote from: PytagoraZ on June 20, 2023, 12:56:59 PMDo you really not trust crypto exchanges? I trust well known crypto exchanges, like binance, coinbase, etc. If there is no exchange then bitcoins are of no use. There is no single valuable asset that cannot be exchanged for money. So crypto exchanges are an important instrument for building trust in bitcoin. Bitcoin is an asset that has value, you can sell bitcoin whenever you need money.If that was a post all by itself, it'd look like a typical bounty hunter shitpost that's written in poor English and contains no thoughts or ideas that aren't obvious or haven't been written before hundreds of times.3.  The OP of that thread isn't worth arguing with, because he can barely write English as it is and there's about a 95% chance he's just here to troll.  Why you're trying to engage him in a debate is beyond me.But the bottom line is that nobody here is going to look out for your delicate feelings if someone calls you a kid or says you don't know anything.  You either have to do it yourself (which is usually a waste of time) or put the member on ignore.  I wouldn't say it's exactly normal for someone to react to what you wrote like that, but it's been known to happen.  Toughen up.  With freedom of speech comes people saying things you're not going to like, and that's the price.",

It can be used for a young person in real life or a young member in this forum. Think it simple like this and you will no longer feel bad.QuoteIs this a normal thing in this forum discussion? I have nothing against differences of opinion, but I think there is no need to insult the interlocutor with insults for which there is no clear reason.The forum respects freedom of speech and calling someone as kid is not too rude. If that post is no value, you can report it and moderator will delete it. If the post has value, one word like 'kid' does not make it becomes no value.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMQ: Do you moderate/delete (possible) FUD, accusations and untrue information?A: No. We don't have enough time to check every single piece of information and verify the validity of the sources. Also, just like scams - too much room for bias and abuse.However, trolling isn't allowed. If a user is habitually posting obviously false nonsense (\"obviously false nonsense\" to an outsider, NOT to someone who follows or is involved in the discussion) just to stir up trouble, then it's considered trolling, which is prohibited. Such cases should be thoroughly documented in the report though (There are tons of reports that just say \"trolling\", but moderators don't have time to look through each user's post).When it comes to accusations of commercial misconduct, if a user is accusing you / someone else of scamming or defrauding them in your / someone else's sales thread without providing evidence (either in the post itself or by linking to evidence elsewhere), that's considered low value and thus should be reported as such.Q: Someone insulted me. Why aren't you deleting his post/thread?A: Possible (since we don't have the time or resources to check) insults are also allowed as long as they contain any kind of constructive opinion, info or something else substantial and aren't off-topic. For example, posting something like \"you are dumb\" will be deleted as it contains no meaningful content. However, if the post is somewhere along the lines of \"You are dumb. This is wrong because this website/thread/etc. has explained it's not right\", it's in most cases accepted.More simple, use Ignore.",

If you look closely, you will notice that your opponent came to the forum for merit, as he clearly tried his best in the pizza contest. As you know, it is customary on the forum to evaluate posts by merits. Just look at your progress, which I would call a good move and the progress of the one who insulted you so rudely . Can you be called a \"child\" in this case?But seriously, don't be a snowflake, people are different, their upbringing and education are different, where you see rudeness, others will see a joke.

Those who know, from them majority still do not have anything in crypto. So, don't get offended when anyone try to make you down. I don't say it's the correct use but there are few things you can follow.Ignore the person, try to communicate as low as you can.Grow a better skin. No one knows you in person.

I've seen some here being cursed, some are including their parents, etc. and that's more harsh than you just being called a kid.The word \"ethical\" isn't applied here especially when we are in a forum where it's free to speak. We aren't in North Korea where there are some limitations. I guess if you want to stay longer here, it would be better if you train yourself to read harsh, and bad words. I don't have a thick skin TBH, and I'm not used to being criticized, but I guess I'm lucky that no one here is talking harsh about me.",
