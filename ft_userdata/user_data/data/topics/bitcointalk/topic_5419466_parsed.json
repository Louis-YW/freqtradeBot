These steps may include, but are not limited to, examination of Players device properties, detection of geo-location and IP masking, transactions and blockchain analysis explicitly prohibits the use of services to change your ip, so I would be careful not to do this so as not to lose my funds.

Obviously, you did not read the rules or the terms when you sign up on Stake.com if it's something about level-up verification youÂ  ask the support so you'll be guided properly QuoteI was able to play for a couple months by just submitting an invalid picture, it would let me deposit and bet immediately, then 2 days later ask for ID again, rinse and repeat. I got suspended after depositing recently unfortunately.You are caught cheating that is why they suspended you, even if someone suggested a remedy they will eventually catch you, and worse if you have huge money in your account, they can confiscate it for breaking their terms, don't involve the community by asking how to resort to cheating.",

      "body": "Short answer no. Pretty sure that since you're using VPN, you're already aware of Stake not allowing your participation in their site, especially since using a VPN or any similar or related type of service to provide incorrect information is already a breach of their ToS. QuoteThe attempt to manipulate your real location through the use of VPN, proxy, or similar services or through the provision of incorrect or misleading information about your place of residence, with the intent to circumvent geo-blocking or jurisdiction restrictions, constitutes a breach of Clause 5 of this Terms of Service. If you really want to go around it, finding an identity that is able to play and buying said account can work but it'd probably be a matter of time as well before your found out and may even have legal issues with it afterward. I'd suggest just using a different casino altogether really.",
