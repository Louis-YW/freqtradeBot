  "content": "One of the most valid criticisms of Bitcoin is that it reduces the ability of the Unite States to sanction enemies of the West e.g. the billions of dollars in accounts belonging to Russians confiscated last year after the invasion, and the kicking off of Russian banks from the SWIFT network.Given we are now moving back to the war portion of the war-peace geopolitical cycle, using the dollar and the traditional monetary network to sanction enemies is going to become more important. Does Bitcoin weaken the West's position? It's obvious to most people that the West has a growing number of enemies whose values are antithetical to freedom - mainly Russia, China and Iran. Therefore the problem Im outlining is going to become more into focus. What's a good argument here, beyond \"well the dollar-based sanctions weren't very effective anyway\"?Note:  I dont want to go down the road of whatabouttery and arguments about how the West is no better than Russia/China. It clearly is, and needs defending.",

For instance in my local banking, one of the banks was febiting people's account for no reason. And since I had an account in another bank, I simply moved my money to the other bank and stopped using the former bank. This is the situation with the west as you discussed in the topic.

And Im hearing this more as a valid critcism of Bitcoin from people in important think-tanks. My retort is usually \"the money based sanctions werent very effective anyway\".

Just like at what happened to Germany before WW2. In fact I would go as far as to say sanctions were the main cause of WW2. Had the Germans not been bled dry and left to their doom, then they may have not followed a maniac who wanted to exact revenge on those exact people and steal what he considered rightfully theirs.And Bitcoin cannot be used to overcome sanctions that easily. In fact, Fiat is way more useful in money laundering and sanction evading because its not on a public ledger, unlike Bitcoin. Nobody knows where Fiat goes.",
