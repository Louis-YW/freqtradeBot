Also, the Intersango code has not been updated for several years, and therefore advising users to avoid that site will not change anything, as the code is old and most of us have not heard of that platform. Or is there something new about that case?",

As far as I can remember, there are 3 names behind this project, Patrick Strateman AKA Patrick Moseley, Carole Strateman and Amir Taaki.Also you might want to refresh your memory here: Your police reports needed. Patrick Strateman - Buddy wants his Bitcoins. Or you can add that to your website.",

That means you were both feet deep in the running and operations of the company right?I don't know the part you might have played in all this but, I'll like to think that, your at an end to whatever is owed to the Intersango as well and I this might be some way of having to reach the then users of the site with not just having Patrick Strateman to pay up what is owed to its investors, it would be quite noble of you and some good way for a start.Not except there are other means to which your excluded from what went wrong in the operation.",

I don't think it's difficult to uncover everything that happened (in your blog post) in those years here, where this forum is probably the place that most accommodates the bitcoin community. Somehow you just appeared 10 years later, where most likely your exchange users have long since left.",

Do you have the case number for what you site on your website.Working through a tablet to a desktop so there is a chance I'm just missing it.But, in the end it really does not matter. A lot of people have taken the money from exchanges they ran and walked away. Almost none have had any real consequences happen to them. Reading about them is always interesting to see what they are saying about it.-Dave",

If your partner or co-founder has stolen users' bitcoins, and if you really are trying to bring the matter to light, why not make the website open for general public to check and see?

I am seeing no one is complaining about this exchange. I am not seeing any scam accusation raised by anyone. Moreover, there is no topic on this exchange in 2022/2023, I am sure; double checked.Quote from: PayPeoplePatrick on January 07, 2023, 12:33:12 AMIf you or anyone you know used Intersango please share this with them.It seems Intersango was famous by 2011 to 2013; later on, there were less discussion on this exchange.Here is a sample:Quote from: afbitcoins on November 03, 2020, 11:29:00 PMI think I bought my first on an exchange called intersango for about 17 british pounds.",

He isn't one of the victims who lost money in the incident but he wants the victims to read a complete report about the issue that he has set up on a website.What I personally feel is that OP is simply using this trick to get some visitors to his own website and probably monetize the web page that he created for some reason. He will most probably just change the domain name and rename the website later when there is another story he can use.",

In these times a bitcoin was still relatively cheap, why are you one of the victims of this exchange for the past 11 years?",
