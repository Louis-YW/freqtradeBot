Mining margins are already thin, and while the duty fees do take a sizeable amount from your profits, it's a one-time payment and as such it can be offset over several months by amortized mining profits.Lying to the authorities about the quantity of miners will incur even more penalties on you if they find out the true quantity of miners you're importing. Never try to cheat like that (unless you're sending them to some country with lax inspection and customs duties then you might get away with that, e.g. some african country).",

More to the point, the buyer has no say in what the value of a shipment is that an exporter declares to Customs. If a manufacturer or exporter cares about staying in business they will NOT 'help' you like that.No one likes it BUT most of us here DO NOT try to 'hide' the equipment cost and NO reputable manufacturer would ever help you to falsify the value of a shipment. A manufacturer or exporter falsifying declared value is a very good way to have their goods banned from entering a country once they are caught.As for the recipient the equipment was destined for, yer boned.

Declaring fake amounts will only give you trouble. You'll lose more than the tax money and risk yourself for a jail sentence. Is the risk of getting a penalty worth saving a few bucks illegally? If you are seriously into this, then you will do something similar when you run your miners because they don't run on water. They consume electricity and it is not cheap neither. If you can cheat your taxes, you can steal electricity too? Why stop there?",

So, yeah you should be declaring the correct values on your imports. Factor it in to your mining costs, and profits. If it doesn't benefit you, don't mine.

As you mentioned, it's the best to follow the rule.If they did do this, I'd seriously be considering who I'm buying the miner from, and if it's going to be what you even paid for. That would be some pretty shady stuff, with big consequences for them, i.e not worth the risk. Most sellers, and manufacturers are offered an incentive to declare correct values, because it doesn't bite them in the arse. It's up to the customer whether they want to pay those taxes or not.",

You can choose for example used hardware or sometimes even new with good prices. What would also be possible to contact the manufacturer. If enough people would do it they can set up a workshop in the US or Europe. They ship the unassembled parts there and can declare a low value, because it is just simple parts. The pay import tax on those low values. Then they assemble it and sell it to you directly locally. Now they can say that most of the value comes from the product as a whole thing. Meaning on most of the price they will not pay import taxes.",

Unless a low value transaction that classifies as an informal import, customs has years they can go back to investigate imports, reclassify, and collect unpaid duties/taxes. FedEx got in trouble with this from one of their brokers misclassifying ASICs some years back and then they were trying to collect the tax off the receivers by sending them threatening letters. If you want to avoid higher duties/taxes, import single miners or parts at a time at a value that meets informal import. Last I bought any ASICs, that was around $2500. DHL and customs never charged the higher duties/taxes for informal imports but they always did for formal imports over the limit.",
