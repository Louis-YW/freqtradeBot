Im looking for others who do Understood same and they like aswell speculating with markets.If you want people to buy your ideas/predictions/prices or whatever you are trying to share then it should be more organized instead of just jumping out and dropping a bomb.Some suggestions for you Create your own ANN thread for posting predictions, ideas so that you no need to create a spearate thread for each of your predictions Be Clear and Concise Back up your ideas with data and evidence to demonstrate their validity Use charts, graphs, or any other visual aids to enhance your presentation Explain the factors influencing your predictions and their potential impactP.S: Improve your English, there are a lot of spelling mistakes.",

Im looking for others who do Understood same and they like aswell speculating with markets.Maybe you look for a means to make your announcement on service board or service discussion board, you can also create ANN thread if you don't mind as it has been suggested to you, from what i can sense here, you're interested in collaborative support in working with other experienced traders in sharing ideas.",
