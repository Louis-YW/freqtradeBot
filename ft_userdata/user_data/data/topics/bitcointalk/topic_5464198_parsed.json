You can´t say your 2 Gigahash Rig, because the hashrate depends on the Algo you are mining. So it is more interesting what cards are in this rig.you can watch on miningpoolstats.stream for new and existing coins. You also can see if the coin is traded somewhere and how it is trending the last days.Hashrate.no is good source for standard OC (but for sure this are not the best values) and you can see current trending coins - but you must ignore the power consumption on this site, because they are wrong mostly.",

You will have to independently look for new coins or mine with a minimum profit.",
