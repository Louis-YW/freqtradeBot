It is good to just use a old and reputed site to buy miners instead of newly created ones that is not having good reputation at all. I will prefer to order miners directly from the manufacturing company if possible, or using a common and old reputable online site for it, especially if I can see official reseller on such site.",

This website platform is really a scam website I think, because here what appeared on my desktopit can harm our desktop or any other device once anyone try to open this one. So, it is better to stay away from this platform if you don't want to have a problem in the future.",

If nobody does anything it will probably around forever and will get probably from time to time somebody that is willing to pay them bitcoins that they will never see again.
