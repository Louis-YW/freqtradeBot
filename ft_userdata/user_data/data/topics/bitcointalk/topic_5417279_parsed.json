  "content": "During the sixth and seventh centuries where the Roman empire held sway, their reign was characterized by a decline in culture, uncouth cavemen destroyed cites, government laws, libraries and the like, but for the intervention of Benedict the monk, Western civilization would have been wishful thinking. Such acts of kindness has extended to today's world in the form of Benedictines of Mary, a sect of Catholic nuns who with the help of Bitcoin have been able to build a befitting monastery. It's good to note that Bitcoin education has spread and with the use of cold storage, these nuns where able to buy, receive and hold. Having educated himself on Bitcoin Standards, a book by Saifedean Ammous, Fr Bartulica, priest at the monastery,  also helped set up hardware wallets for these nuns and today a beautiful edifice was erected by nuns, disputing the ideas that bitcoiners are miserly hoarders after they were able to sell off proceeds just so their monastery could be built. Amazing to also note that these nuns have not deviated from their way of worship but are now armed with a technology that has set them on a path to financial freedom. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/catholic-nuns-building-church-with-bitcoin",
