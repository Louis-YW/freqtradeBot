  "content": "E get something wey dey bother me like this for some time and this this thing don too much and I don decide to bring am out make other country people put their mouth for this matter. Why be say we Naija people believe say anything wey we dey suffer na spiritual attack, without seeking for scientific explanations. Even the evidence dey show say the thing get scientific solution most Naija people go still believe say na spiritual problem. We don give room to this spiritual houses to exploit and milk us dry and many of them they lavida from our ignorance. I get one friend wey been no well, the guy start to dey misbehave and e dey show say na mental condition but the parents and other close relatives come dey think say na juju dey hold the boy. The guy been dey act normal but suddenly him come dey act like say him dey run mad, if you and am dey talk him go dey talk off point. You go tell am something and him go relpy you with another thing come dey laugh join. The people come they go prayer houses and herbalists them place dem spend money on goats and fowls for sacrifices. After many months the boy situation come dey worst more than before. I been don suggest for them make them carry the boy go Psychiatrist hospital, but them no agree them say na juju wey dey family house dey do the boy. After some time when dem don do everything and nothing happen na there them come approach me say that hospital wey I been talk say make we go there. Na so I carry them go the hospital for rumigbo inside Port Harcourt. After the doctor attend to the boy and test was conducted, dem come discover say na one condition wey dem dey call dementia dey worry the boy. Na so them recommend drugs and injections wey the boy go dey take every month. Today the boy don dey normal and don get him life back. The thing come be say him dey on drugs monthly and the doctor say thank God say we come the time wey we do, say if to say we waisted more time say the boy for don mad finish. Something wey I want make we know be say no be everything wey dey do us be spiritual. Most people wey dey mad for street today no smoking or durgs make them mad and no be even people wey be their enemy make them mad. Some na cases wey be like this my friend own but people over look am say na drugs, smoke, or spiritual attack. To know more about this condition you can read more here. https://celebrateseniorliving.org/2023/04/19/different-types-of-dementia/ Knowledge is power. Before we conclude say something na spiritual make we make sure we don try and there is no medical or scientific explanation to the problem. Many people they they suffer today because people around they are ignorant. I believe we can still do more to save people that have this similar cases from running mad totally and other people passing through other conditions by always suggesting science first before spirituality.",

But me i have ever see a person that try scientist but they see say that is the solutions to their problems, they no have choice than to come to the spiritual own. Is just that the problem we have in this country they believe spiritually than scientist, if you are sick before some naija parents go take you to the hospital, until they see that it's not for the spiritual situation.Our naija parents believe in all this juju stuffs, any small sickness that children will be taken to the hospital to prescribe drugs for, they will first do their own first, all this believes don make some people lose their children thinking that is the only way, that thing they pain me seriously even all this herbalist na fake full everywhere they won't have solutions to your problems and they go just dey make you spend anyhow to the extent they won't pursue you but you go quit by yourself, even a little bit i no dey believe them nowadays, because we of nowadays don't have much believe in all that. If you did not talked about your friend condition and about the hospital, only God knows the condition he will be right now.",

We tend to be more religious than even God that is why we put everything intop spirituality. See as the country keep face, God give us everything as a country yet we allow the worst people to rule us while we pray to God to come down from heaven and help us. It is a thing of religious colonialism. No blame our parents, their own parents also pass the same thing to them... na chain reaction. Wetin you dey even expect from a people wey think say the poorer you are, the more righteous you become just because Bible talk say \"it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a niddle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God\"The one wey dey pain me be say no how you go to any spiritual house that they will not tell you there is a problem. It must be either your forefathers, your village people, your mama, uncles etc, there must be somebody after you. They will see all these problems yet they cannot offer solution. The earlier we focus on God a lone and forget about all these plenty fakes around, the better for us.",

      "body": "The reason why most people attribute their challenge to being spiritual rather than a medical abnormality Is because of the kind of society we find ourselves in. There are so many cases of individuals who suddenly develop mental disorders with no clue about the cause and that will normally warrant the guardian of the person to term it spiritual.What I normally advise people in a situation like a sudden mental shift is that they admit the victim in a health facility while praying or believing for healing from whatever God they believe in.",

This spirituality of a thing I no go talk say e no dey oh, the thing dey but no be so we suppose do for this kind matter. Like case wey be spiritual person suppose know and case wey need medical care person suppose know but wetin dey pain me people don decide to die in slient for all this prophetic homes I no know if na ignorance or wetin but the thing dey pain me, the worst part be say fake prophets don open church and na their church full everywhere who no know no know and just like wetin you talk them dey milk people dry when it comes to money aspect, where in the Bible did Jesus heal and cast out demons for money but still yet people no go know oh. Secondly this mental issue, in a situation where the case is not a spiritual case and the case needs medical attention, but the cause of this mental issue is coming from smoking of weed and hard drugs, after treatment we all know if the person goes back to smoking that mental issue will still rise in this situation what should the person family do.",

If you check the margin of such people you will see it is mostly poor people that lives to such mentality because spiritual consultations is affordable to them than that of the science and technologies.This basically is inspired as a lineage characteristics inheritance from foreparents because they lived lives without the introductions or invention of the sciences of today's.However, they could be right too. Most spiritualist are not only based on spiritual awakening but are also dependent on herbs which also termed to  serve solutions to such sceneros even if it was a non spiritual being.I can also tell you that I have withness an African citizen but a USA base who suddenly seized to walk and can't even stand despites the technological and developed country he was and yet could not be offered solution after undergoing one scientific and technological treatments in one way and the others.But someone recommended a prophet who based her win Nigeria and then the victim (sick man) was eager to do whatever it takes just for him to be fitted again then he came down Naija and told you prophet that \" Many had tried in many ways but can't make me walk but if you can do this, then it is like I owe you my life\". Then the prophet embarked on his spirituality assignment and was able to make the man walk at last.Never underestimate the potentials of spirituality anyways but the mentality of every negative occurances being spiritual is an awkward state of being.",

I no talk say to pray no good ooo but then even the Bible talk say “heaven help those who help themselves”. Religion don make us feel say na prayer we go use solve all our problems whereas some of our problems na we cause am to ourselves or maybe we just need put in work. But no pastor go talk say make them pray your way out.  We go miss our parents them cause na them pray pass this our  generation now the almighty gen Z way still day shake yansh for internet.  Spirituality good oo but the way we day take carry am at times day sometimes spoil am, plenty of us don even turn hypocrite for this matter, they go day preach watin they no day practice. If na by prayers and kabashing our country for don good by now, the country situation come even make us to day pray harder. Na so the condition don be, they don brainswashed most of us thinking say everything fit day solve by praying when clearly person fit just make good decisions way go favor everybody.
