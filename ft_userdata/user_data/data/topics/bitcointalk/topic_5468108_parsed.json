You can’t do a chargeback like you could with a bank.What you need to do is get a hardware wallet and you also need to format your computer and reinstall everything because you got some virus and that’s how you lost your coins.",

It seems like the address the OP posted was an address that the said person used to receive bitcoin, and after a successful receiving of the bitcoin, the coins were then moved to another address. Upon checking the address, the address appears to look like an exchange address. The exchange in particular is . Binance  according to the  final address  of the bitcoin receiver.@Op If the money is large enough, you can try reaching out to Binance Support and reporting the scam transaction to them to see if there is anything that could be done from their end, maybe restricting the user account (which I don't know how possible that can be), or monitoring the user closely and trying to figure out what really happened if it was a scam or a business gone wrong.",

So, if the funds from that address has already been moved or spent then there's no way that it will be returned back to you. Well, even if by just chance, a hacker/robber will not return anything to you. Sad to say OP but consider it as gone forever and review how did that hacker was able to take your funds. Did you unknowingly gave your seed phrase or private keys to a random guy that has messaged you out of nowhere? Following where it's been sent, it seems that it landed on Binance. Maybe from there if you truly want to do something without assurance that it will be taken back, contact the support and give all proofs and necessary details to prove that it was your fund that was sent by one of their users.",

But that's that. Once the funds moved to other platform, all they can do is freezing the account, they can't do anything with the lost fund.",
