Bitcoin is not the only asset that grows and fall but the only problem is that Bitcoin just like many other crypto has high volatility but it's that same volatility that attracts many people to buy Bitcoin. If it's investment and guaranteed, there are many other stocks that you can invest into and worry not much but the return Bitcoin has given to people over the years is more appreciable than other investments.What I think will happen in the future is that the Volatility will reduced drastically because when the circulating supply is held by some people and only few remain by the public, there wouldn't be much to play around with and good news will surround Bitcoin most often to reduce price manipulation of fall and rice that happen most often in Bitcoin.",

I think when more people are trading BTC they will be doing speculation on different levels. Which means some will hold, some will sell, some will buy, etc. The difference between demand and supply will be bigger if more people are trading in crypto. Although currently People (individuals hold most of the BTC). And remaining amount is around 1,222,318.8 Which means this amount will not be bought by one or more companies like Grayscale etc. However, some parts of it will be purchased by individuals from all over the world. This indicates that it will not be centralized ever until it's not forced to run on PoS consensus if it's possible now to shift! Overall I think we are safe even after the halving.",
