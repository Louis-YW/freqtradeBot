  "content": "Hello,I suffer from Gambling addiction and I requested my Cloudbet account to be Permanently Closed.It was closed indeed but two days later, due to my addiction I requested to have my account reopened, and it was reopened immediatly.I believe they violated their terms and conditions by doing that as I can read here:https://www.cloudbet.com/en/help/self-exclusionThey refuse to comply with it as they answered me this:QuoteThere are key differences between account closures, Responsible Gaming and regular account closure. In your request to close you made it very clear that it was due to the bet settlement issue that you were following up on, you did not state any responsible gaming reasons.It is a shared responsibility to ensure that responsible gaming measures are followed on the site, as you never mentioned this before we had no reason to believe that you we not managing your gambling activities responsibly.Therefore, when requesting to reopen your account our team was able to do so at your request as it was not a self-exclusion.As you have now indicated you have responsible gaming issues, we have acted swiftly and blocked your access.Therefore in accordance with our regulations and account closure reasons, we can confirm that your account was closed as per the correct procedure.We therefore deem this case to be closed and encourage you to reach out to support groups to tackle your gambling issue.We are unable to offer further assistance in this case and further conversations for this reason will be closed without any further action.If you are unsatisfied with this outcome we can only advise you to raise a complaint to CEG by clicking the link at the footer of our website.Can someone try to help me? am I wrong on my request? In their terms and conditions I can't find any different type of account closure per user request.My goal is to have the deposits made after my account be reopened, refunded.",

The screenshot showing nothing, just a requested (permanent) from @OP not from a casino. Since you are admited have a gambling problem.Contact your gambling help center, and contact your family, block all the site gambling and give all of your money/fund into your trusted family and ask them to manage it. It's clear @OP cannot handle it, there is no guarentee at all @OP are stopid (He just can created another account / playing on other site).",

At one point of time you asked them to close the account and then you requested them to reopen and they reopened it. So is there any issue with it ?Now what do you want ? The deposit which you made after the reopening of account to be refunded ? Did you play at the casino after reopening and lost the amount/bets ? Or you did not play and the deposit are still there in your account ?",

Just wanted it locked. This may happen due to someone else having access to that computer and OP being at risk of someone logging in, or because his wife found out that he was gambling and was about to try if he has an active account? There can be many different reasons for asking that.Then OP wanted it to be reopened and it was. Now OP claims the casino wasn't trying to help him maintain addiction. I'd call the complaint is baseless and OP will not get any support from the community and the casino. The only thing this conversation proves is that Cloudbet's support is active and reacting to customer's requests.",
