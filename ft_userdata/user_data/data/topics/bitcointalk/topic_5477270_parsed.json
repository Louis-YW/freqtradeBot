For me, it's up to you. Bonk is extremely volatile just like other memecoins. Taking profits is already good.I will only share my BONK story here, I sold my BONK 19 days ago, and, it should've been x3 since I sold. But it's fine, I only got that BONK for free before.",

I was about to say \"I have never heard of it, you shouldn't even be having it so selling is a great idea\" but turns out me not knowing or never hearing about it before is my own mistake, top 100 is usually not a terrible place. It is 90th place at the moment when I check it though, so it means that it doesn't really look like a shocking result neither, its quite alright and I think it will be fine, I get that it may not be all that easy to handle, but I believe that we are going to see it have some trouble. I think selling is good, but keeping it at dollar is not, go buy something more sturdy, like bitcoin for example, which could give you better return and less fear.",

Was this a smart or stupid move? I am not sure but I just followed my intuition (The swap fee was under 1%).You did what you had in mind already, I think this question is damage control but I think Bonk was airdrop to Solana holders last year if I remember correctly, where you holding since that time or you bought when the price was low and have you been in profit since you bought it? I don't know much about Bonk but I know a little details about the coin, it was first distributed by some group of some solana developers that were trying to create PEPE meme version on Solana and because solana was also in a lot of controversial news due to FTX, the team the community were fighting back the dump of Solana and that is how Bonk meme was born and people fomo and I think lots of Solana bag holders were compensiated, that is little I know about the coin.If you ask me about the future and certainty of price discovery of Bonks, I will say \"I can't say because meme coins don't have direction and it is upto what the community brings to the table, they may bring another hype that will bring the price up or something that may bring the price further down. However, why don't you like to invest in coins that are atleast with a working products and not some shitcoins that will always give heartache.",

Thanks for helping me.  Bonk is the most popular memecoin in SOL, i don't even know if there are other memecoin in SOL but it could go higher after the dip. Just like any other shitcoin during the bull run, they will rise. looking at the most popular memecoin like SHIB and Doge. The SNEK memecoin in Cardano will likely rise too since this is the most popular in their ecosystem. smart move to sell while the price is high. if it dips to $0.0000088 i would probably buy back, this is if i were you or even at $0.000009 looks like the support line.",

I hope you keep abreast with the exchange pairs that may be available on the exchange you use, because it is very important to know, so as to know the best way to swap to the currency of value for the future. It's a smart move no doubt since you think it so, and have already done so without any advice or push. Please do more research on the best practices to keep and multiply your coins, because as daring as you are, I think you just might succeed excellently at trading profitably.",

Still, according to the FA and a small overview of the last few week's rally, I can say in the short term your position on the trade was right, you should wait for a significant drop to take a re-entry I haven't analyzed the support and resistance levels yet.In a quick overview, I can say the move was decent and would be the same if I were in your place. Shitcoins/memecoins are not the way to trade I use to play in the controlled risk environment with some top projects and hot projects.",

Because if the down trade is not too much, then I think it is not a smart move to convert your bonk into USDC. I mean, it's part of trading that there are down trades because that's how the market works. What if you encounter a down trade every time, then you will swap your bonk for another time after time?. But if the down trade is too much and you realise that you will be at a disadvantage, then it is a smart move anyway; it is your own trade. But remember, patience is a must, so better wait for a while. But yeah, it's your own decision and the risks are up to you. I'm sure many here will give more advice.",

I'm sure many here will give more advice.Well, you didn't provide enough statements on your topicI swapped yesterday when Bonk was down around 15% (24h market) it did go down all the way to 30% (24h market) and then turned around, I feel you answer from a long term hold perspective and not trading. I was lucky from this one, but should have earned more Bonk from this my move was very smart. But I was way to cautious and slow, I should have took action faster in both directions. What if you encounter a down trade every time, then you will swap your bonk for another time after time?It depends on how it will look, if it will fall as it did now yes I will swap. if it swap slowly of course not. But it's soon time for me to sell anyway I think. I am always looking for topping my profit's and this is a way to be able to top it more but can also be risky, but I don't see this as so risky since it was very easy to spot and sell and buy back.  FinalHave a great weekend it's finally a new one and time for new opportunities to find success, go up early take a shower look yourself in the mirror and say loud \"I am in control over my actions\" say it five times and then go out and start take control, you will be a winner from start. 💪",

Before you are interested in Bonk you should have a perspective regarding the journey and it becomes the basis for the time to sell so as not to get a loss. I am not so familiar with him that there aren't many things that can be given but the decision you have taken is quite appropriate than maintaining because we will never know how the results and may experience a big loss.If you think the token has a in the short term potential then wait two to five days after the sale, so you can buy it back. For swap problems you can choose blockchain at a lower cost so you can avoid excessive payments. Following your own intuition will be much better than you listen to other people's advice but do not make previous analysis to decide.",

But I get your point it's hard to be able to buy back in the right time before it bonces back I was close to miss it yesterday I could get more than I actually bought back in the end but still I am happy, but I take it with me for the next time to be more cautious. 🪖",

I swapped back also yesterday to Bonk and got around 3.6M bonk extra for the same $ for the effort, but i am far from pleased I should have done much better but I was to much of a pussy so I learning and take this with me to next time, never same mistake twice.",

It's not benefit is the one that traders are going to get here but it was headache.The second thing that you said looks confusing but it only implies one thing. No experience crypto users are going to do that or to suggest such meme coin like Bonk to their fellow people, even though they will only use extra money. That is how unworthy the meme coins are. Cryptos are known to be unpredictable but there are exceptions like if the coin is really bad or really good.",
