But I believe in karmaWell when he got asked about it, he instant locked the thread instead of explaining, and he got a lot of negative feedback from other trades he have done, in fact he does not have a single positive/neutral feedback,, only negatives one.He was in my thread like a month ago and wanted to do a $500 trade and we was talking in telegram, but lucky for me i did see his feedback on his profile here and another person warned me from him so I did not proceed with the trade.He also tried to get some loans here not so long time ago...Sad if its true, very sad.",
