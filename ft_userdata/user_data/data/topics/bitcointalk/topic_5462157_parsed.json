He found an exploit on Silk Road's withdrawal page and stole quite some btc. In the end, maybe because he felt bad, he shared it and was approached by the SR owner to tell him what the exploit was.As a thank you the owner even sent him some more btc.",

And i think it would be a first person who is thanking you for the spoiler. hehe. But again thanks for the correction, Actually the headphone hack of my laptop is not working so i have to watch the video on my phone. (I don't have BT headphones so).",

I can’t believe the days where I am living my life with billions of dollars in my bank account or by other means and then on another fine day court just confiscated my funds and made me road side Romeo. That’s really bad management of the funds. He can’t even steal properly.  I think this is why they what goes around comes around. It is better to earn less money rather than be greedy and thus steal the money in the process. It can be very harmful for the future. One way or other you will see the truth hitting you very hard no matter what. He was early adopter, he could have just stayed loyal with the Bitcoins he had in the early days and still be a billionaire or at least multi millionaire with no juries actions on his head. Greed nothing else.",

Honestly he shoulda moved somewhere far away a long time ago & did P2P BTC exchanges, always moving on to somewhere else after a while... would have had a much better chance of making it for the long-haul. There's some famous instances of retired darknet market admins that never got busted, even though they made their fortune in BTC which as we all know is quite traceable. A moderator for one such market who made millions from AlphaBay said he moved to South America, for example.In the end, hubris got the best of 'ol Jimmy Z. Same thing with Alexandre Cazes, AlphaBay admin, who lived a lavish lifestyle in Bangkok. Ross Ulbricht, not so much, though it just goes to show running a multi-million-dollar criminal empire and living in America usually never works out.",

He absolutely stole those money from Silk Road. But it's interesting that the US government decided that it owns all Silk Road money retrospectively, and it prosecuted Jimmy even though Silk Road wasn't going to chase him. Maybe Jimmy could have defended himself at court better, but it seems like he decided to take the deal and only spend 1 year in prison, as opposed to risking many more years if he'd lose his case.",

His addiction, his obsession with girls really got him bad. I just watched the documentary, and I think the turning point of his life was when somebody robbed his brief case because of Zhong wanting to impress girls so he showed a case full of money. Anyway, that's the problem when you didn't get the coins \"legally\". He maximized that bug to stole Bitcoins, that lead him to more addictions, more desire to women, but less cautious on his decisions. At least the good thing is his sentence was only 1 year, and 1 day. Now he's working as an Uber Driver, so I guess he's trying to change his life already, but he's a programmer so why not use his skill to work for other company. Hmmm kind of curious.",
