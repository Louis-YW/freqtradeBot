  "content": "TL;DRVOSTRO functions as a native proxy utility token (BEP20), enabling investors gated access to the KIASILIGOLD™ investment fund. VOSTRO tokens will be offered at a dedicated presale event (TBA) and serve as proof of stake for the BUSD equivalents locked in the KIASILIGOLD™ fund with an 18-month vesting period, whereby the predicated RoI will serve as a powerful incentive. Subsequent to the vesting period, investors can redeem their BUSD equivalents plus any RoI accrued, in exchange for their initially staked VOSTRO TOKENS, which will be burned as proof of redemption. VOSTRO is therefore designed as a deflationary token.The VOSTRO©TOKEN derives its value, inter alia, from the KIASILIGOLD™ INVESTMENT FUND's assets under management (AuM) and associated profits. The 18-month vesting cycle was chosen because it is long enough to rebalance in the event of major market corrections and still generate returns, while short enough to keep investors enthused vis-a-vis a decent return on their investment.We provide a low-barrier access solution for retail investors keen to participate in the burgeoning crypto economy. We offer a safer selection of investment opportunities, greater asset management expertise and lower investment fees than retail investors would encounter on their own accord. Our aim is to continue to foster the mainstream adoption of crypto as an alternative investment, despite the recent industry-wide set backs and upcoming regulatory head winds. Your feedback is welcomed.",
