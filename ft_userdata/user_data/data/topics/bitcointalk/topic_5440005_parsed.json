I guess the news is in Portuguese? I've searched and I don't see anything about it but I did find this which is relevant to the general match fixing problem:Suspicious sports results? Mafia might have fixed themQuoteOrganised crime groups make an estimated €120 million of profit a year from betting-related match-fixing in sports events. Not only football matches are fixed, but tennis results are also manipulated more and more. And sports mafia are no longer only corrupting players, but clubs too.",

Match fixing has always been a problem when it comes to sports and the only thing that somehow protects the most important leagues are the high salaries they pay to their players and coaches so they cannot be easily bribed.But away from the spotlight and with salaries many times smaller it is easy to see how organized crime could bribe players to do whatever they want, as 28k dollars to each player for each penalty they commit is a huge sum for them, and it is likely an amount higher than what they receive for each game they play.",

In such games, it's much easier to fix a match.In our country, the premier league is the highest competition among the clubs and you know match-fixing is common in this tournament. Years back, a video footage was leaked where a note in a paper was sent to the captain of the leading team but after that note was sent, their performance was dropped significantly which arose a question of what the hell was written in that paper. Though I didn't follow the news, I'm sure no one had to set forth on that issue. The whole BFF is corrupted.",

      "body": "That match-fixing persists as a problem in sports is disturbing, as is the staggering sums of money involved. Although the cheating in this case affected only a lower-level competition, it nonetheless casts doubt on the fairness of higher-level contests. I'd like to think that as a sports fan, the outcome of a game is based on the skill and effort of the players rather than chance. It is imperative that authorities crack down hard on these illegal actions and implement severe fines in order to deter any further occurrences. Last but not least, sports shouldn't be used as a cover for illegal behavior but rather as a platform for fair competition and audience enjoyment.",

It's that when they are caught, the coaches and players are hit harder because they could be ban for life.",

      "body": "^Yeah, that might be the reason for accepting those bribes. As players with a low salary,  they have to go illegal just so they can make more money even if it includes doing it the wrong way. This is the reason why organizations are usually attacking smaller leagues, they know they can easily manipulate them and especially if these leagues are available to bet on online sports betting sites. That would be an easy profit for them if they will be betting millions of dollars. So this $20k+ bribe payment to every player is just pennies for them when they know what the outcome will be.",

Big leagues are high likely doesn't have any manipulation and it's safer to bet, but it doesn't make you rich if you not bet big amount of money. There are many matches on minor leagues are really worth to bet the underdog because the odds is really huge. In big leagues, usually the underdog have almost 0% chance to beat the favorite team due to huge gap difference.",

There are other well documented so we need to be careful on the leagues we are watching especially if we want to bet on the games played. On bigger leagues well maybe this happen but its not rampant since nowadays since medias are covering up and maybe the league coordinators or promoters are been much careful about this since its a big shamed for their league if his game fixing will happen to them.",
