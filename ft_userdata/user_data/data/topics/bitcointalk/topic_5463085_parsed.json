That can be found at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463143.0Regarding the talk of scams and premine etc are false and without merit. Coin was launched on August 4th, that is when mining started but only enough to secure the network and spinup a masternode for testing. If you look at the block explorer, you will see HUGE gaps between any mining while the dev team fixed issues. A few followers of our progress grabbed our code and started mining to a private pool, so we had no choice but to launch a little early. This is why the official bitcointalk was not posted. Our team has nothing to hide, and if we wanted to premine we would have just added to the genesis block like so many other projects do.Regarding any coins mined, these are to be used to pay for all servers, exchange listings and future exchange listings. We are not asking community to fund our project. Come join our discord before passing judgement.Sincerely Diabase Blockchain Dev Team.",
