Better leave it for now and           make yourself that familiarize or make yourself that get used to spot before touching futures. This would be the best thing to have for now.2.  A market would really be that compose of buyers and sellers on which it would really be just that common sense that if there's someone who buys the there's someone who do sell in the other side    in regardless on what you are really dealing with. They do only differ on the leverage you are really that setting on, the higher then the more faster you would really be that liquidated.Whether you would really be taking up my advise or not in regarding about futures but its up to you if you could bare up the risks but it seems that you are complete noobthen better not engage on this one for now.",

With 10x leverage, you are most favorite customers of centralized exchanges because your positions will be liquidated easily by their automated tools and they will get richer by money liquidated from you.If you set your target like earning a fixed amount of money such as $50 a day from trading, it is a wrong approach already. Because it will cause pressure on you and you will always have to trade daily.You must know, trading too often will cause you loss because your brain must be fresh, calm to trade successfully and you must trade only if it's good entry to open your position. If you don't see good entry, don't trade even days or weeks.",

It would be nice if i could have a conversation with someone who has experience on the matter. Profiting that 1% per trade with 1x leverage is possible but challenging without sufficient trading knowledge and experience. While it's feasible to make a 10% daily gain, it comes with risks. Nonetheless, losses are also involved, and if emotions take control, you could potentially lose 50% or even 100% of your account.Quote from: vineetrughwani on October 25, 2023, 07:29:43 PM2.

When you decide to go long in futures, you're making a deal to purchase an asset (like coin X) at an agreed-upon price and date in the future. When someone goes short, they're making a deal to sell that asset at the same predetermined price and time.",

Therefore also a lot of trading tool that can help you to do that especially the futures trading which you can get even 10% profit or more if you are good on short trades.Quote from: vineetrughwani on October 25, 2023, 07:29:43 PM2.

There’s a lot of VC nowadays that invest on exchange liquidity to give instant liquidity to the orderbook which means it’s not always you are buying or selling on other trader because there’s an exchange liquidity itself. It’s same idea to the house bankroll on gambling but this time you are trading to other people and exchange at the same time.",

Many traders lose their money in the beginning. Do not forget that for every winner there is a loser in trading.Therefore, my humble advice to you is to start only with spot trading in the beginning until you gain sufficient experience, after which you can move to futures trading slowly and with a small capital, because entering into futures trading without experience is a very big risk and may cause you huge losses.",

In trading, there is a white day and a black day, meaning that you will make a profit on one day and a loss on the other day. The possibility of achieving 1% of profit per day may not be possible in the first days. You will achieve profits of 1% or more, and tomorrow you will achieve losses, and so on, and therefore you must try to make the average 1%.Quote from: vineetrughwani on October 25, 2023, 07:29:43 PM2.

In light of the fact that not all of us here have the knowledge of trading, people who lack fundamental knowledge will be at higher risk than those who have the knowledge, even though risk is natural in trading. However, once you know that you don’t have knowledge of trading, the best is to hold bitcoin for a long time so that we can yield profit there.
