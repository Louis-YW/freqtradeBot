He wants to restore his wallet through master private key in bitcoin core. But Im unsure if bitcoin core has such facility yet. Btw, @nikok, why did you edit the post ? Is your issue resolved ?1] https://ninjastic.space/post/61566357",

Second, why are you making a topic that you don't even give a situation based on the title you made?How can we resolve the issue of the title you made if you didn't say what kind of crypto address are you referring to dude? what is it, have you lost or forgotten what your password, private key, or seed phrases are? or what kind of software wallet are you talking about dude?",
