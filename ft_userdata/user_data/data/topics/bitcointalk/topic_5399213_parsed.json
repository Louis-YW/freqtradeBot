IMO you can get one used for cheap  . Yep a good CPU and SSD will make your machine work 100%. Do not forget about a good motherboard and some decent ram 16GB minimum.You are welcome",

Do not forget about a good motherboard and some decent ram 16GB minimum.You are welcomeIt is not necessary to spend what they say here to be able to play to the maximum, far from it. With a simple mid-range i7 and a rtx3060TI, and at least 16GB of RAM, you can play everything currently on the market in ULTRA without any problem.The budget needed for a 3070TI GPU is huge and the difference although it is abysmal with respect to a 3060Ti, the truth is that in games is imperceptible.I assure you that with a budget of 800â‚¬ I can build a PC to play any current game in ULTRA and without noticing slowdowns.",
