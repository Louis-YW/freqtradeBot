  "content": "TLDR; We used the World's Fair of Money as an opportunity to gauge reactions of a strictly traditional numismatic market. Our hypothesis was that crypto currency collectibles would be swiftly rejected. The actual results were mixed, but also extremely promising. The main takeaway we got from this was that people are receptive but lack the understanding of how crypto works. Therefore; first and foremost- we have a responsibility to educate people about crypto.",
