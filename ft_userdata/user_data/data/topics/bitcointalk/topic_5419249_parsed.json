  "content": "I found this cool art from cryptograffiti, and wanted to share here:It looks great, and it actually mines Bitcoin.Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ykhsof/minedala_2_bitcoin_art_that_mines_bitcoin/The front of this piece was created from dead S9 hashboards and various repurposed smining parts.On the back is an underclocked S9 hashboard (~4TH/~300W) w/ Braiins OS+ firmware mining to Slushpool.The front-facing exhaust fan powers on bringing the work to life while it works to pay for itself.At the end of this month will be 10 years that I've been creating Bitcoin art. Thanks for looking!",

Now I have seen everything!Although it would probably not mine enough coin to be a significant miner, but rather serves at artistic purpose, I think thats pretty cool. I think it would be even way cooler If the art would be energy-self-sustaining (like instead of getting power from an outlet, the artist could perhaps install solar panels or some other form of green energy and put it outside in the sun (but not too far away from a wifi source) then that would be a very nice Bitcoin monument to self sustaining decentralized financial freedom.",

Â  I love how creative some people are.And to be honest, it's a pretty decent miner. I mean, it's doing 4TH/s, that's better than the home miners like the Compac F(about 300GH/s) and the Apollo BTC(about 3TH/s).If you just point it to nicehash it should give you a few thousand sats per day...And yeah, I agree. It would be super cool to have a self sustained miner art. But I guess you need too much power these days.... maybe you could get away with an under powered Compac F. Those are really efficient.",

I was pleasantly surprised to see this is literally a repurposed Bitcoin miner that has been made into a piece of art. Very cool and innovative. I could see cool artwork like this doubling as space heaters and becoming popular for crypto folks.",
