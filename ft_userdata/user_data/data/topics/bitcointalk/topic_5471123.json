I'm Thinking About Making an InvestmentI do not advise you to ever bet on any of the projects that are launched from an ICO campaign. This type of project proved to be a failure from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018, which was the period in which these campaigns flourished. In the end what happened? More than 99 percent of these projects failed and collapsed, including those projects that succeeded in being listed on one of the trading platforms.Why not invest in Bitcoin? It is always the safest option.Or you may be looking to make a quick profit in the short term. I advise you to invest in one of the solid projects that have proven their efficiency over time. I cannot direct you to specific options, and therefore you will have to choose for yourself according to the research that I advise you to do before venturing into investing in any project.",

I'm Thinking About Making an InvestmentI wouldn't recommend any pre-sales here, as most of them are just rubbish that come and go quickly. So, it's better to avoid them all except tokens that are at L-1 or L-2, they look more promising.Then, you said that you wanted to make an investment, right? investments are usually made over the long term, so wouldn't it be better for you to buy Bitcoin (BTC) for the purpose of holding it in the long term? after all, we're due for a halving in a few months.",

Not like that my friend, we don't recommend any coin unless you intend to invest in bitcoin.I'm sure many people will come to this thread to advise you not to put money in the pre-sale because it will clearly be detrimental, just choose bitcoin your investment will be safe and never scam like tokens that are in the pre-sale.",

I'm Thinking About Making an InvestmentNone.Investing in a project that's on a pre-sale, or in short a new project has the highest risk. They can build a project, launch a pre-sale, and when they got enough money, they can just run away alongside with your money. I guess this is also the reason why I didn't invest into new projects so much especially in 2018 where new projects are being launched every day thru ICO's. I tried 2x I guess, and both failed. If you're thinking of making an investment, why not invest into established coins already? If you want to make an investment, why choose those start-up projects? I mean we the profit might be lower when you invest into those top market cap coins, but the risk is also lower as well. If you want to risk your money then go with these pre-sale tokens, but we can't recommend, or at least I can't recommend any project that has a solid connection towards other influencers. If I were you, I will just put that money into coins that have been there for a long time such as Bitcoin, and even those altcoins like Ethereum.",

I'm Thinking About Making an InvestmentI cannot really advise you at this moment. Just try to join in the launchpad but don't expect you can grab huge allocations of token without having big sum of money to be staked first before the allocation will be determined. The presale and ico were not really hyped again these days. IEO has become a new trend but since there have been many projects prefer to run their projects without even getting to fundraise some money and it's hard to find a legit project to invest these days. Try to find some upcoming IEO through some website like cryptorank. This will be really help you a lot to know that which tokens that is potentially to launch its IEO. You can also try to use some exchange sites which was also regularly launching their IEO.",

Pre-selling tokens is always a very huge risk. So many people have gone through this experience in 2017 and have bad success. That's why something like ICO is very risky right now. It is better to buy time-tested coins and wait for a bull run.",

I'm Thinking About Making an InvestmentI’ll cut right to the chase OP.First of all, we are not financial or investment advisors here. Cryptocurrency projects like in pre-sale are subject to substantial risks and are prone to high volatility due to the unstable and unpredictable market conditions.And not just that, it doesn’t offer any promises or astronomical guaranteed returns. So regardless if the pre-sale has so many partners that doesn’t guarantee you anything about making a profit. In my personal experience, I did participated in many presale campaigns with highly known partners, VCs, etc. However, only a handful of them that I made a profit especially if 100% of the tokens are unlocked during the TGE and with no cliff.And as for the rest? They are under vesting period in an average of 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and more. The problem is that most of the time the prices went downhill even below the seed sale price, in which I have experienced that before. Although that I am not discouraging you because of my experience (nor encouraging you either), but it is better that you should decide by your own instincts and acknowledge the risks no matter what. When you spend that money in the pre-sale, just treat it as “dead money” like you’re just fine affording to lose it. Just my two sats.",

I'm Thinking About Making an InvestmentFirst seeking such advise from the public will only increase your risk of possible investment into be wrong project,  since altcoin general is full with unpredictability also there be measures that must be followed for you to arrive and a good position of opening and investment entry in altcoins direction,  so much so that you have to consider a lot of factors and the various risks. I will not advise anyone to buy into a pre-sale because most times those coins after the ore sale will never make it to the exchange and their investors are made to wait endlessly for when their investment will yield any positive result or ever get the chance to trade the pre-sale tokens since must are not listed. So my best take is to buy some of the few potential altcoins that are already trading in the market and also make sure to check what are their liquidity availability and what ecosystems support them in real life.",

I don't recommend getting into pre-sale tokens these days, yes some were successful and they're like a lottery honestly. And that's why if you want to make an investment in the market, choose those that are established already so you won't have any regrets in the end. Many of these pre sale tokens or any type of crowdfunding these days could be at their worst time. But if you're really up on it, this is your first step asking the public about our opinions? You can do more by DYOR and searching for those but if you do that, you're likely to fall on the wrong projects and that is because there's no assurance on them. So we go back to the first suggestion of buying bitcoin, you minimize the risk and you get a more secured investment through it.",
