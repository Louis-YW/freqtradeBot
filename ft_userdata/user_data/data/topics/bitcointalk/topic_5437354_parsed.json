  "content": "WEBSITE  | WHITE PAPER | TEAM | CUT | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | MEDIUM | WHAT IS CRYPTOUNITY? CryptoUnity is a Slovenian start-up that is building a beginner-focused crypto exchange. The project aims to bridge the gap for beginners in the cryptocurrency space.We understand that the world of crypto can be overwhelming and complicated for those just starting out.That's why we've created a platform that simplifies the crypto involvement process. With our user-friendly interface and comprehensive educational resources,we strive to make the world of cryptocurrency more accessible and lessintimidating to beginners. Whether you're looking to learn about the basics of cryptocurrencies,understand how to securely store your assets, or just want to dip your toes into the world of crypto trading,we've got you covered.  Our mission is to help beginners confidently navigate the exciting,but sometimes confusing, world of cryptocurrencies, so the whole platform is backed up with 24/7 support for users. The project is also paying attention to the safety aspect of crypto - by implementing the cold walletwith an NFC card, CryptoUnity provides its users with a secure way of storing funds.With safety, they took it another step further. They will be  the first centralized exchangethat will not hold their users' funds. Those will be securely stored with an independent highly regulated custodian , meaning that those funds arecompletely separated from those of the project and can therefore not be manipulatedor influenced by the company's operations or potential financial challenges. At the end of the day, the community is a big part of CryptoUnity. That is why it isalso involved in the design of the application itself. Since that is in our opinion thebest, and the only way we can make it as user-friendly as possible. We can also boastof concluding a  partnership with the globally known company called Lenovo.ACCOMPLISHMENTSSo far, the CryptoUnity project can boast of quite a few achievements.Our presales, presence, and successfully completed audits stand out among them.PRESALESPrivate presale (70.000,00 €) - SOLD OUTPresale Slovenia (300.000,00 €) - SOLD OUTPresale Balkan (240.000,00 €) - SOLD OUT Worldwide presale (2.500.000,00 €) - Q1 2023AUDITSCompleted an audit by  QuillAudits  in September 2022Completed an audit by  CertiK  in November 2022Received the CertiK KYC Gold Badge (meaning that the entire core team providedthe highest amount of verifiable background information, demonstrating a veryhigh level of transparency and accountability)PRESENCE[/color]TMRW CONFERENCE, Belgrade (May 2022)ENEFTI, NFT CONFERENCE, Ljubljana(June 2022)SOUNDGARDEN, Festival of Creativity, Velenje (July 2022)BLOCKCHAIN EXPO, Amsterdam (September 2022)BLOCKCHAIN EXPO, London(December 2022)CUT TOKENCUT is a utility token that will provide holders with many differentbenefits and utility cases on the CryptoUnity platform.

CRYPTOUNITY'S SECURITYOur project recognizes that the safety of our users' funds is of the utmost importance. That's why we havedecided to implement a cold wallet feature into our platform. By using a cold wallet,our users will have complete control over their private keys, eliminating the need for blind trust in third-party storage solutions.To make the cold wallet as convenient and practical as possible for our users, we aredesigning it in the form of an NFC card. This way, the cardcan be easily carried with you wherever you go, allowing for quick and secure access to yourfunds at any time. We believe that this combination of beginner-friendliness and top-level securitywill make our platform the go-to destination for anyone looking to get involved in the world of cryptocurrency.CRYPTOUNITY'S PLATFORMOur main product is a comprehensive platform that combinesall of the necessary tools and resources for easy trading, safe storage, and education. Whether you're just starting out and looking to learn the basics, or you already have someexperience and you’re in search of a secure and user-friendly platform, CryptoUnity has something for everyone.With our exchange, portfolio tracking, cold wallet solution, educational resources, and more,we've created a platform that truly has everything you need and want.
