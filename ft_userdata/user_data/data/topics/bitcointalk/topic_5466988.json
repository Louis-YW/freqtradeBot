As the founder, I'm excited to share this exclusive peek into what we believe is the future of asset markets.Nothing against your optimism to what you're doing on this project and keep it up. But IMHO, if you have missed the early days of ICO/IEO, there have been projects like this so to claim that you're the first tokenized asset exchange, there have been others. I just can't name them because I have forgotten them since they were years ago. And with those projects, most of them have failed and I remember that there's one that have focused into real estate and tokenizing the shares that one can get. Since you have said about its potential to real estate and tokenizing fractions of it. I just don't get it because if I am an investor, aside from taking and owning a real land, I might just buy a REIT. And for the others you've mentioned like collectibles and arts, there have been the same platforms that are more popular than of yours. Of course it's understandable because you're just starting out so the real challenge is there.",

Is there any plan to use Bitcoin to secure the network or anything like that? It doesn't relate to Bitcoin. AssetX is an exchange that facilitates the trading of both digital and traditional assets, with Bitcoin being just one of them. This industry, though it may appear old, is actually in its infancy and requires significant development.Most platforms you see today are Asset Tokenization Patforms focusing on tokenizing specific asset classes, we aspire to build an exchange where all asset classes can be traded securely. Our goal is to provide buyers with the assurance that these assets are tokenized by a trusted source.Quote from: joniboini on September 20, 2023, 12:12:19 AM Personally, I've seen some projects trying to do the same thing and most of them have failed. Demand for tokenized assets is not good enough while the market risk is too high.Yes, as with any other industry, the successful ones will be built on top of the lessons learned from the failed ventures. The demand for tokenization is expected to be a $16 trillion business opportunity by 2030. This represents a growth of more than 50,000% compared to $310 billion in 2022. So the industry has a large room for growth.Quote from: joniboini on September 20, 2023, 12:12:19 AMthere is little to no guarantee that the user can even redeem the underlying asset if they own a lot of tokens. I don't think you can solve it by slapping Bitcoin in any part of your project. Redeem\" is a trendy word used by NFT projects. Tokenization aims to attract more everyday people who want to invest small amounts of money. It's about making assets available to regular folks that were hard to get before. In this setup, getting your hands on the actual assets might not make sense, especially if you only own a tiny piece of them. It's all about enjoying the benefits of owning assets, like making money from them, gaining from value appreciation, and spreading out your investments, without the hassle of managing and taking care of the assets.",

You have to gain trust first so that you can convince investors to buy those tokenized assets and hold them in a central platform. But my question is, how is this different from an NFT? Can you explain to me the difference between tokenized assets and NFT?Yes, trust is really important when you're letting someone else handle your assets. Trust is something that grows over time as people get to know and rely on a company.Big companies like BlackRock have built this trust and manage a massive amount of money, over $9.42 trillion, which is more than four times the size of even the biggest company like Apple. (Apple actually makes products, while BlackRock doesn't create anything new but instead manages what others have already earned.)We're planning to put in the effort and keep working hard until people start taking us seriously. It will take time, but I'm confident that AssetX will gain that trust from people over time..Quote from: amysteryremains on September 16, 2023, 01:00:52 PM But my question is, how is this different from an NFT? Can you explain to me the difference between tokenized assets and NFT?They basically are same, A digital representation of an asset that already exists in real world.But NFTs are non divisible.. they are good for claiming ownership rights for unique one of a kind assets.. But since the ownership can't be shared it is not economically feasible to tokenize them.. If a person has the capability to actually own the full asset he would wanna hold it in his hands, keep it somewhere where it can be shown off to people.. Instead of trusting a platform to hold it for them..As a matter of fact this project was started for ABNFTs(Asset Backed NFTs) because I was angry at the developer's selling people useless NFTs knowing it has no value, I also presented this idea on Bitcoin talk but decided to pivot since it was not solving a real world problem.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5451014.msg62185378#msg62185378Tokenization of real-world assets in the other hand is a concept that allows everyday retail investors to participate in an industry that was previously only accessible to large institutional investors, mainly because of the high costs involved.",

Maybe this time it will work and it will depend on how encouraged you are to do it and will tirelessly going to work for it.

We aim to bring them to one place. We want to build a platform where users can be assured that each asset listed on exchange is properly vetted and Tokenized.. Of course, it is not a new idea. It has been there since the inception of Bitcoin. But this time it's different. There are evolving laws now and a renewed interest in tokenization.The platform is still in development. We're currently working on building an MVP. I appreciate your caution, but creating something like AssetX is essential, and we're committed to doing it soon. We're not preoccupied with what others may have fallen short of achieving. We're approaching this with a fresh perspective, determined to construct this remarkable platform from first principles",

It sounds a bit contradictory when you want to follow regulations but claim your platform is decentralized by nature.The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model means that decisions about AssetX are made by the community, not just one central authority. This includes things like platform rules, updates, Assets / Asset Classes allowed to be traded on the platform and even how funds are managed. The community, including $RWA token holders, can discuss and vote on proposals related to regulations. As for user data, the AssetX platform will never have access to personal information or the rights to assets being traded on the platform. Real-world assets cannot be legally traded without complying with KYC/AML and similar laws, and I believe there will always be such regulations in the future. They exist to ensure our sanity.Hence we aim to comply with all applicable laws to ensure a safe and secure environment. It's important to strike a balance between decentralization and compliance.",
