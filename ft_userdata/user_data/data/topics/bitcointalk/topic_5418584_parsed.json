  "content": "Welcome back, Alex’s readers!In the previous article, we analyzed how market leaders including Market Makers, Shark-Whales & Dev & Funds set up the game using TokFlow's Shark Analyst and Holder Tracking features.Continuing the SANTOS token analysis series, in this article we will use two dashboards - Profit/Loss Average and Volume Tracking to observe the next movements from SANTOS traders. Let's get started!https://i.imgur.com/CWlNvPh.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/K47j95B.pngAccording to TokFlow’s latest updated data, in the past 2 months, all SANTOS investors in different positions are profitable at least above 100% considering the current token price of $11.4. Notable losses were scattered from May to August as you can see in the clusters of charts “Profit/Loss in real time” on your right . Only Shark-Whales wallets experienced slight losses due to market fluctuations with the ratio 50:50 (the bar chart on the left).In short, the profit coming from all 4 wallet clusters shows that all of them are long-term holders. Therefore, in Q3 there was only a small loss and while Q4 witnessed all profitable investments. All players are “diamond hands” with good position and entry. Holding SANTOS for a long time represents investors' expectations for the future development of this token.Now let's continue with the next part by leveraging the Volume Tracking dashboard to see what's going on behind the charts as well as the latest happenings of SANTOS.https://i.imgur.com/6Pw3STB.pngTaking a look at the Chart Volume that shows the detailed volume of tokens per week, we can easily see that the highest trading volume of SANTOS in Q4 was recorded on August 19, 2022 with Total Volume up to 280K tokens equivalent to $4.7 million. Right after that time, the SANTOS token experienced a descending trend and moved sideways steadily at less than 100K equivalent to $2.1 million.Fake Volume only accounted for 0.008% of total trading volume, which indicates that the Market Maker team didn't meddle too much with pushing the price. Instead, the majority of transactions came from retail investors. The largest fake volume on record occurred on August 19 when SANTOS had a spectacular pump from $6 to an ATH of $16.50. Up to now, the price of SANTOS has dropped much from the peak and started the sideways phase.According to the current sideways situation of SANTOS, perhaps we will have to wait for 3-4 months for some noticeable volatility in the market to take place. This is the time when holders should store assets in the form of stablecoins and closely follow market movements in anticipation of the latest news.https://i.imgur.com/Jf2G5sk.pngOf the total supply of SANTOS tokens, 12.54% of them are being traded on Centralized Exchanges such as Binance, Gate, MEXC, etc., equally divided among different wallets. Binance is the exchange that owns the most tokens with 3 wallets including Hot Wallet 20, Hot Wallet 6 and Hot Wallet 7 respectively. The number of tokens on CEX suddenly increased on October 17, accounting for 12.5% ​​of the total supply.The Decentralized Exchange possesses profound advantages in terms of transparency and security. The amount of tokens on DEX accounts for only 0.07%, a very small number compared to the overall. However, for that reason, it allows the DEX to have an exclusive advantage over the SANTOS token when it is only listed on PancakeSwap.It can be presumed that Fan Token is affirming its position in the community when it is constantly listed on reputable centralized exchanges such as Binance, Gate, MEXC… However, this will potentially pose a risk of price manipulation and derive the benefits from investors. Also, the negligible amount of tokens on the DEX may not meet the needs of liquidity for the majority of investors, which results in the fact that most of them are flocking to CEX as an alternative. However, that it’s suddenly listed on CEX can raise the possibilities of a dump phase.https://i.imgur.com/6oJsaF5.pngThe amount of SANTOS tokens is mostly in the hands of long-term holders as these wallets hold 287K tokens that account for 1% of the total supply. The amount of tokens belonging to the short-term group accounts for only 0.01%.In a nutshell, the above figures show that SANTOS holders have their own long-term profit goals and expectations in the future. Market Cap of SANTOS will be a relatively small number if it is in an uptrend. But for the downtrend, this is quite a large number when the capital released into the market is no longer as abundant as before.After all, Fan Token is just a lottery coin created for the purpose of attracting cash flow into the market. So SANTOS token just serves as a refreshment for this crypto winter. If you decide to participate in Fan Token investment, then start with small capital and accept that it is possible to lose. Remember to have a plan for your investments before entering. Good luck!!!Be sure to follow and support the next analysis from Tokflow!!!",
