  "content": "Not sure if this qualifies as an intro or not, but here's a start:I've downloaded and been running a full node for a couple months.  Since this involved just downloading and running an exe I'm not quite sure where to go from here.  Some questions I have:1 - Since I had a windows 10 machine, I just downloaded that exe and ran it.  Is there a compelling reason to wipe the machine, install linux and run that instead?  Note: this machine is dedicated to just being a node, so I don't do much else with it other than browse bitcoin topics. (pc is an older core I7 w/12gb ram and 1.8tb ssd for the bitcoin data2 - Is there a place where I might find an experienced person to provide some guidance and education regarding running a node?3 - I've read there are benfits to using my own node with my wallet.  I'm not sure how to set that up, or which wallet I should use.  I currently use wasabi, but all sats are on a coldcard.  I'll read the wallet thread here soon and see if that sheds light.  But sometimes the back and forth with a guru really speeds up the learning process.4 - Is there a consensus here are the best way to setup and maintain multisig?Thanks.",

Most prefer to use Linux, as it is cheaper, tends to be safer and more private, and has more configuration freedom.

(pc is an older core I7 w/12gb ram and 1.8tb ssd for the bitcoin dataYes there are many reasons why Linux is better in everything compared to wInD0ws OS.Linux is open source, nobody is going to spy on everything you do, you don't have to pay anything and you don't have to use pirated software because Linux is free, it's easy to install and usually there are no separate drivers to install.For older computers Linux running Bitcoin node Linux is much better because it can use less resources if you choose lighter distribution and desktop environment.

I don't think using alt accounts in this way is going to be beneficial to you in any way How many forum accounts you made so far?",

(pc is an older core I7 w/12gb ram and 1.8tb ssd for the bitcoin dataIf you are planning to actually use your full node and not just have it running to support the network, then it would be wise to switch to a Linux-based operating system because you will have more options. For example, it is much easier with Linux to spin up your personal Electrum server and connect mobile and desktop wallets, which usually results in more private and secure transactions because the Electrum server won't be storing any records of your balance and indexes all transactions equivalently. As far as I know, on Windows, you have only https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server but it is lightweight and has extremely limited functionality: it only supports one wallet at a time. The other option is Fulcrum, but it is Bitcoin Cash-aimed software and barely can be considered reliable. On Linux, however, you can install almost any implementation of the Electrum server, and they will work out of the box after a minimal setup.",

      "body": "Running your own node is not easy at all, mate. I'm not an expert, I don't know code and I'm not running a node. Not running a node is normal for us normal people but we should know a few Bitcoin details: decentralized, transactions are paid to miners, difference public and private key, create wallet offline, Bitcoin Halving, Bitcoin scarcity limited to 21M coins and how many confirmatios a transaction has. I could list some more Bitcoin basics, where you need no coder knowledge. Even when you hire an expert to set up yur node, you'll need to maintain it, monitor it, solve mistakes and similar tasks. I can't give more insights because I'm not a coder. Better ask your question in Bitcoin Technical Support, where Bitcointalk's coders are active.",
