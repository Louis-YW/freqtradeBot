  "content": "I wrote another thread about this subject but someone recommended me I could ask about it to you guys here on this part of the forum. First of all, my original message was this:QuoteI am trying to help a guy with a project. He mined bitcoins back in 2010, 2011 or maybe 2012. Not for a long time, so its not like there should be worth that much but still, you never know, and we want to at least give it a try and see if we could find this potential money.So we are trying to figure out where it was mined, first of all. So I was hoping maybe the more experienced members on this forum would could give us any idea about what websites or apps that were available at the time. Maybe he could then recognize it. So we are looking for any information, whatever it is, that could help us and give us a clue where to start.I guess it is very hard, but it would be great to at least know something more so we know if it is possible or not.What he recalls:There was an app or a webpage where you typed in some information, probably a username and/or a password.Then there was a load of text like a CMD, probably in text or maybe the background was white.Anyone knows anything about what site this could have been?",

Can you clarify what kind of mining site you are looking, Is it a mining pool or cloud mining because the login info that you described suggest that it was cloud mining website due to login details while most of this services doesn’t exist anymore. You might probably looking for a closed cloud mining company at this point. You should give too an specific user experience like the process of mining to match it to the old member experience here in case they read this. Mining section is not that active and you can much faster response on the beginners and help.",

      "body": "Would help more to pinpoint what happened if he could remember if he was CPU or GPU mining at that time, for now with the info we have we could only say that he was probably mining on a pool and that CMD thing he remember might have been one of the mining programs like cgminer but that's of no real help.Anyhow, there are just a few pools that are still online and only slush would be the one that he could have used back at that time, if he can't figure out how to recover his account then that's it.If he was solo mining (which I doubt because of the webpage thing) he must first recover those files, again, I doubt he has them since he could have started the program and remembered what he was doing.Anyhow, maybe one of the old timers here that was an active miner at that time might have a flashback but the chances of getting those coins....",

      "body": "Do you think your friend can remember the design of the pool website?It's hard to guess without more details about that pool.Anyway, Slush pool and f2pool that I know pools launched around 2010 or 2011 but if you are looking for a list then check this below- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_mining_poolsIt includes shutdown pools and maybe one of the pools listed there is the pool that your friend talking about. If it already shut down I don't know if you or your friend can still retrieve that mined coins except on pools that still operating.",
