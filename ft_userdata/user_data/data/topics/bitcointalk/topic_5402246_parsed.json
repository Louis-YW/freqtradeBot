Yea, I thought of that. But with keen examination of altcoin boards, you will understand that the behaviour of the board colorate with the name of the board and the behaviour of the coins. Though, the altcoin section has become a major section in terms of population in the forum and the forum can't afford to lose that section. My respect to alcoin section grew when I learnt that Ethereum was launched in this forum. It means that this forum is not only for bitcoin, it also give enabling environment to other projects who sincerely wish to excel.",

      "body": "Nothing is stopping someone from doing this themselves, but being implemented natively in the forum? Very doubtful. Instead, someone could build a scraper externally, and then maintain a thread here on the forum, that would be fine. Although, it'd probably be difficult due to the varying different formats that projects use when they post their announcement threads. You'd probably have to monitor other websites other than Bitcointalk too. Quote from: KingsDen on June 12, 2022, 12:05:01 PMYea, I thought of that.

My respect to alcoin section grew when I learnt that Ethereum was launched in this forum. It means that this forum is not only for bitcoin, it also give enabling environment to other projects who sincerely wish to excel.It's very much a part of the forum now, however it definitely isn't without its problems. I don't even know how much spam is removed every month there, but I'd say it's well in the thousands minimum every month. Some months it seems that the altcoin section dominates the reporting statistics. Although, these are now mainly older posts. I think we're playing catch up, but I do think we're making some progress. I think most of the reports I receive these days are from posts back in 2017/2018, during, and after the ICO craze. Although, the bounty section is a little wild. That's probably the hardest of them all to clean up.",
