God help the mini rich or very rich person who happen to cross paths with such kind of persons that would beg almost to the point of even stealing what ever possession is intact. I have grown almost fed up to the point that I don't even want to go out of the house to hang out one normally would on a regular basis, I no get is my popular slang , still, it does little to wade off these hungry and greedy fellows that can be brutal for just as little as a #100 naira. My sincerest prayers of late had become that God should open a channel wherebeit I can help these youths earn for themselves and stop being a nuisance to the environment and society at large, so as crime would reduce, development and investors would come in, and as such a steady source of income would come in to help these youths who have become too rascally in the society.Please share your thoughts on this subject and any good advise on how I could go about this scenario, is highly welcomed.",

Nothing pain me pass that thing, how will a grown up person just decide that the only thing he would do with his life is to be begging others on the street? There is one in my school that will be walking around and be deceiving people that he needs transport to go back to his house, every day he will still be looking for transport and just now that you gave him the money, you will see him begging another person. This is pure laziness and has nothing to do with the current economic challenges facing the country.The other set of people are those agbero that extort money from people on the street, while there's might even be better than those ones that begs, it's not even a noble and reasonable thing to do with ones life. And the thing you have to understand is that most of them will squander almost all you will give them if you're trying to help them out.Make we try de distinguish between laziness and people working hard but receiving little or no support from the society and our leaders in general.",

No doubt the economic situation is very bad, but most youths are taking advantage of the economy situation and gradually becoming begers on a broad day. For me I dont help able young men like me that beg on the street. because there is no different between me and them. The only different is that I don't beg to survive like them, but take full responsibility of myself and family, so I see no reason why a youth that is not physically challenged will be begging on the street. And most times if you help them they use the money to smoke weed. So helping people on the street should be base on consideration, maybe physically deformed. But now normal people choose to play the part of physically deformed to satisfy their dirty desire to get money on the street. And this has cause many people to stop helping the innocent physically deformed.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 28, 2023, 09:12:32 PMi have grown almost fed up to the point that I don't even want to go out of the house to hang out one normally would on a regular basis, I no get is my popular slang , still, it does little to wade off these hungry and greedy fellows that can be brutal for just as little as a #100 naira. I don't really think you will have to deprive yourself of your comfort, due to the people that don't want to make there life useful, but only depends on begging as a means of survival. I think helping is base on choice and individual differences. And not by force. So I sudjest you enjoy your life because you worked for it. and moreover the joy of working hard is to enjoy the fruits of your labour and not to be deprive of it by nobody.",

You see them hanging around busy hotels and supermarkets.  I agree it is their fault many of the times, because the kind of beggars these days, have better choice and preference for the help a good person wants to render them. Worst is if one tries to engage them in learning a new skill or getting a job, still they prefer you let them be and give them money instead of to teach them how to fish or earn for themselves. For the ones that do own smart phones, to teach them about cryptocurrencies is more like a security breach to one's own crypto wallet and HODLings, because they instead want to steal your phone or steal the key phrases so as to gain access to your funds. Hence, why I pray for a physical and offline means to earn where the job process is more physical and engaging rather than online, do as to assist in fine-tuning these poor masses with negative mentality to earn for themselves instead of begging wantonly.",

But where I want dwell na people for our neighbourhood wey dey like to beg. Because dem see say you look nice, dem feel say you dey alright, dem go begin dey task you upandan as fit you no get money challenge. If you try show them love the first time, and maybe the second time, dem go begin dey expect money when them see you and when you tell them say you no get, dem go feel say you want give them and them go come carry you for mind. E get another set wey na corporate beggars, them go look nice the waka for street dey beg, they go tell all kinds of lies just to collect money from your hand.

Even if small money enter their hands, them no go reason tomorrow, na to just blow everything finish and them go blame the government, their family members and their village people for their misfortune.",

If government provide jobs for youth that will engage them people will stay away from crime, they will know what to do with their life that will be productive for them. I just pray things get better,  the government needs to play a good role that will transform the society.  If things keep going bad like this that means in the next few years it will be worse than today.",

The both of them don't have any advantage rather they are treating to the society. They are very dangerous to our community and can never be trusted because some of them are always on a mission to spy someone or something, even the kidnappers make use of them to watch over people movement to know who are successful and who are not so that they can have a target. People keep on blaming government that there is not work, I really blame those people for sitting and be waiting for the government to provide them job, mostly those agbero or begger on the street are not even educated, how can government even help this people, when he as not even accommodate educated people. To survive in this world is not all about going to school but depends on our ability to create ways for ourselves.",

There are some people they prefer to remain in such condition no matter what you do to stop them begging for hands, but they will stop at the moment for people to think they have stop in that particular area and they will change their dressing style in a way you will not recognize the person you gave huge amount of money to quit such attitude. I don't think some of them need prayer because, the thing has enter their blood in a way they will lie  that they loss their wife and children in Motor accident that put them in such condition and, if you find out about that particular person or  people you will know that the evils they did in the past is the one affecting them in the society.Please don't force yourself to feed them, because among those people beginning in the streets, there are scammers, fraudsters, fake pastors, native doctor and ritualist and, they can do anything to turn your face to empty your Bank account or use the money you give to them to empty your money in your pocket.",

Because if they want to beg for arms,  how long will they continue begging and how sustainable is begging, the best advice is ask them to get something doing, if it's to learn trade or go in menial jobs that can sustain them pending when something big will come.",
