  "content": "Two months ago I signed up on Roobet after being referred to the online casino by a streamer. I played for maybe 2 weeks, ran my balance up to $922.04. The very second I tried to withdraw some they immediately locked my account and have refused to pay me what is owed. I have emailed several times and have sent my btc depo address. I have yet to get a response or my money which would be really nice right about now since Christmas is next week and the fact I've already waited 2 months! I have screenshots of how much is in my account that I have sent. On Roobets own website updates this year the following is verbatim;             The following countries are restricted to access Roobet: French Guiana, French Polynesia United Kingdom. Countries like the USA may also need to use a VPN to play Roobet.I also know they support and sponsor several streamers in Canada, illegally I might add, until Roobet(.)CA comes out. I have video of one of their own Canadian streamers admitting to it as wellI do not live, nor have I even visited the 'restricted countries'. I have taken screenshots of anything I can think of that will help my case and can share when or if needed. I could really use this money right now too. If anyone has any suggestions or can help me in anyway I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for your time",

Although I had previously encountered this error twice, Roobet allowed me to withdraw my money without any problems after I switched to my desktop where I originally created the account.I'm not pretty sure, but I assume there is a hidden security measure in place to prevent users from withdrawing funds from multiple device at once. And I don't know if it's a bug or a feature.",

The very second I tried to withdraw some they immediately locked my account and have refused to pay me what is owed. as far as I can see, withdrawal is currently disabled but your account is not locked. in that case, you wouldn't even be able to log in to your account. or maybe you still have a notice somewhere that you are blocked. (will be fine if you are it also)Have you tried what Maus0728 suggested? log in using a different device, or PC if it is possible.",

And if you create account using VPN and enable then your account will be banned when caught. So it is important for you to know their rules before registering on this website. It's actually useful for all of us who think we're smart enough to avoid reading the TOC before creating an account. As a result, various problems later appeared which were unexpected.",
