If your report is good, moderator will take the thread down if a topic is a spam. But if moderator do not take down the post, leave it be becuase this forum is a bitcoin forum and we can discuss anything about bitcoin. If I invested in bitcoin and it gave me 5x return and I used it to build house, I can be happy to bring it to this forum.

Some members even set that board to ignore, some decided to try with as many reports as possible, but that board is still littered with a large number of low value topics. Fortunately, there is a \"report to moderator\" option, and anyone can use it to report any topic or post that they think does not meet the criteria - and it is obvious that the vast majority have never read the sticky topic that has been at the top of that board since 2016.Low quality topics do not belong here.Quote from: _act_ on October 09, 2023, 09:30:48 AM~snip~If I invested in bitcoin and it gave me 5x return and I used it to build house, I can be happy to bring it to this forum.

In a forum with such a diverse membership, it's common to come across questions that might seem basic to some but are actually sincere inquiries. Everyone's learning at their own pace, and sometimes people are looking for a bit of spoon-feeding to grasp certain concepts.Now, when it comes to merits and signature campaigns, it seems like the members, especially those who can award merits, know where to invest them wisely. They're not just tossing merits around for low-value topics, and the same goes for their replies. As for the moderators, their approach might rely largely on reports from members. That way, they can keep things in check and ensure the forum maintains its quality. So if you want to help cleaning the forum, be active in reporting spam post.",

Democratic in the sense that freedom of expression is totally allowed because if they become too rigid, many people will become too scared to post in the forum.

Nevertheless,  it is still expected we aspire to encourage as much quality posts as we can so that time in this forum will be worth it. We can use the report to moderators tab more if we feel certain posts or comments do not meet the forum standard...if many people report a particular post, it becomes easier for the mods to act knowing that deleting the post is in the interest of a good number of the forum users.",

And you're here to help and offer suggestions because you genuinely care about the forum's well-being.Given the sheer number of members and posts, it's a real challenge for moderators to handle everything in real-time.

In a community that values freedom within the rules, posts typically stick around as long as they don't violate any rules.For threads that become repetitive or no longer provide value, moderators often step in and lock them down.

And just so you know, even if you make a reply with a font size of 50pt warning other users not to reply to those made up stories threads they’ll still ignore it and continue with their congratulatory messages which sometimes makes you feel as if you have no idea about the warning you posted.",

Anyway, I've witnessed the era of Yobit and later CryptoTalk. It was the community that played a pivotal role in their efforts to halt these campaigns, and if I remember correctly, Theymos even decided to ban some of them. As for these spammers you mentioned, who just post low-quality content, they wouldn't be able to persist if there were effective campaign managers in place. I believe most of these spammers come from participants in the bounty sections. To revisit my earlier point, what we really need are capable campaign managers. From what I've observed, campaign managers these days have improved because many of them value the forum more than just a paycheck, so they're cautious about admitting suspected spammers. However, they should also be reminded that continuous monitoring is essential. Even if a poster is initially of good quality, there's no guarantee they'll maintain that standard over time.",
