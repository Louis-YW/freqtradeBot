Depending on where you are mining those may be converted to BTC but of course they have a much smaller value then BTC. For my part I never really understood how merge mining could secure two blockchains at the same time? Knowing that NMC allows merge mining but that BTC does not allow it if I understood correctly, is that what you mean when you say that it benefits only to the secondary coin? I know that some miners could take advantage of merged mining from a financial point of view, but isn't it a waste of submited hashes from a BTC's blockchain point of view ?I don't understand technically how they can earn BTC knowing that their submited hashes doesn't count for the BTC block",

      "body": "Merged mining was a thing many years ago, when new popular altcoins used to simply copy the bitcoin mining algorithm. In the past years new coins however started to use newly developed algorithms to prevent merged mining and to be able to say they are innovative. Basically it just means that the developers donâ€™t want the pools like brains to merge mine and directly dump the coins on the next exchange for any price. For bitcoin merged mining is actually a good thing, since the profits form the merged mining usually are converted straight into bitcoin.",
