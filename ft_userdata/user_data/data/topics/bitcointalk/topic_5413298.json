  "content": "The capitalist economic system is a system in which private business actors own and control property according to their interests. An important factor of the capitalist economic system is the profit motive according to Adam Smith's theory. In his book entitled \"Wealth of Nation\", he explains the concept of laissez faire and the principles of the invisible hand. Capitalist Illustration ImageThese two concepts are the basic framework for the formation of the capitalist system theory, which includes the value of goods and services, structure, consumption prices, and production prices. There is a shortage in the capitalist economic system, because their goal is not to see the impact of consumers, but rather to the value of profits from the products and services issued. Thus it seems that the capitalist style will destroy the order of life of the little people, in making purchases, be it products or services. Let's see how they work, in the area where I live, currently intensively promoting various types of houses, where they work with banks as third parties. However, in this case, the Bank is authorized to determine the prospective buyer, based on consideration of the criteria, employment status and agreed terms. However, it must be understood that Real Estate is different from Real Property, both which can involve the government in its management and those related to financing and settlement as building ownership.Terms and Rough Figures For the Purchase of a Single House1. Time periodThis relates to the time period agreed upon by both parties (the Buyer of the House and the Bank), the longer the agreed year, the greater the profit received by the third party.Because the buyer will continue to deposit every month according to the current year's agreement.2. AdvancesThe amount of the down payment that must be deposited depends on the agreement between the home buyer and a third party (bank), taking into account the conditions they provide, the smaller the down payment, the greater the monthly deposit.3. Monthly InstallmentInstallments determine the price of the house, because the smaller the agreed monthly installments, the longer the ratio of the specified repayment period, so the more expensive the house price.Term of 20 yearsDown Payment $5,370.21Monthly Installment Ratio $134.26Let's count?20 Years X 12 Months = 240 Months1 Month Deposit $134.26 X 240 Months =$32,221.25Down Payment $5,370.21 + 240 months Deposit $32.221.25 = $37,591.46Total for one house $37,591.46In fact, if we buy land and build our own house, without using their system, the money we need is about $16,781.90So, if the term of the agreement is long (Current Year), then the third party will automatically benefit $20,809.56, because the monthly deposit will run according to the year and the agreed down payment.This is an example I got in the field, a few weeks ago?Actually, I have conveyed this example earlier in this post Why the european housing market is about to crash, But because I think this is interesting, then I try to recreate my post?This looks pretty crazy, the way they rob people of financial freedom, where for a need (a house), people have to spend that much money and not to mention talking about monthly deposits during the agreed-upon agreement. Of course, the consumer has the authority to buy or not, but if it is considered a house is a necessity, what can they do?In the context of Economics, there is nothing wrong with this capitalist system. But there should be other ways that can be done to not be burdened by the system, so that people are not trapped in something that is not necessarily capable of being done. Now I want to combine buying a house using this system, with investing in crypto and bitcoin. Maybe this can be a reference, especially for those of us who are in this forum. If people currently choose to buy a house, then they have to make a down payment of $5.390,11 as a condition and they continue to deposit a monthly fee of $134,75 for the current period (20 years).Just imagine, if we invest $5.390,11 in bitcoin or in altcoins, if the return on investment is maximum and we do it at the right time, then to make one house no more than 1, 2 or 3 years running time, without having to wait for repayment annual fees that run according to the agreement. Of course, the investments that we make also have the impact of risks and losses, if someone does not understand the pattern and the right time to enter the market, this problem is related to knowledge, which may be learned before starting an investment. But that doesn't mean the risks are unavoidable. Because there are many things we can learn before starting, be it investment knowledge, strategies and how to enter the market at the right time. Because what I see, the pattern of buying a house that they do, is no less than the danger posed by investment, meaning that both processes have the same risk, only in different conditions and portions. Oddly enough to understand, if we want to get involved in such a home buying system, despite the opportunity for change, we can do so through investment.Whereas in Crypto systems in general we are used to determining the direction of freedom we want to do. Instead I think, cryptocurrencies are a way out of a problem they can't solve, towards housing needs for low-income people. By making the right investments, we will save ourselves from problems that are considered incapable of becoming easier. Technology that has developed, will pave the way for everyone who wants to learn to do something new.Why did I mention cryptocurrency and not specifically Bitcoin, because the concept is more accessible to the lower classes, because talking about cryptocurrencies in general, it has a cheap purchase value, but the return at a certain time is quite maximum.",

      "body": "It's a long standing scenario that houses are normally built for a lot cheaper than what they're sold for (I'd say its particularly in the UK and the nordics but the US might have a higher margin if they live in wooden houses). I've seen it be complained about a lot online even before now.If you got a social housing system where people put money into the workers to develop a skill related to building houses and they started doing that, they'd stand to gain a very high profit from it. The problem is that most property construction is dominated by a few industries and banks and the people who have skills can already build their houses cheaply.Also, you can buy fractions of bitcoin, you don't have to buy a whole one and if you don't know what you're doing, a bitcoin investment is the best place to put your money while you learn (aside from diversifying into stocks too so you can buy more bitcoin if it drops - or at least not panic sell your bitcoin).",

If you are rich or look rich they charge you higher, if you are poor they charge you less, then they use the extra amount they got from the rich to compensate for the lesser charges to the poor and still remain profitable. We all faces so many problems in our lives - the problem of rich people is different.But what is not good are the people who create problems for the other. The dirty and sick mind are the most problematic of all and may we be safe from all this. Hope it's not the poor you are calling dirty and sick. This looks kind of exploitative but it's not because the poor sellers typically sell things incredibly cheap compare to what is obtainable in big stores where the rich should be going to but prefer to compete with the poor or middle class for cheap things in businesses owned by the poor... It's hard to survive without the poor. By the way, not the kind of poor you see on TV begging for alms and looking wretched .. I call those the needy which you can find once in a while but are typically rare to see. The poor sustain themselves pretty well and can live without the rich but the rich can't live without them.",

If that same amount was invested at the height, you would have lost 60%+ of the value of your money so far, but the same rabid crowd were still preaching that it will keep going back upwards.",

This is happening to almost all countries, theres always a party who will benefit the most especially if it takes more than 10 years to fully pay. Better be a wise buyers. Installment is usually not good when the house buyer has to pay the installment coming from his monthly income.  A wise buyer will look at it as opportunity to earn when the house is already built an can be occupied already. He can rent out the house and the pay goes to the monthly installment.",

So it is of course very clear that people will prefer it because of the innovation that is better in the economic sphere.QuoteTechnical talk can be learned according to one's preferences before getting further involved in investing, that's why a more systematic and measurable introduction to this problem is needed, so that people can know the functions and the best way to invest in bitcoin.As for how to invest in Bitcoin, I think there has been a lot of exposure on several websites that can be read by everyone now. Likewise for a further introduction to Bitcoin because everyone who does not know Bitcoin further will definitely find out about Bitcoin first before finding out how to invest well in Bitcoin.",

So it can be concluded that the benefits obtained will be maximized in the future, in accordance with the involvement in the investment taken.Nope, no way I'm letting you avoid this question.You presented this as a solution for everyone to ditch loans and invest in Bitcoins because in 5 years they will turn 5k into 30k, you words not mine:QuoteJust imagine, if we invest $5.390,11 in bitcoin or in altcoins, if the return on investment is maximum and we do it at the right time, then to make one house no more than 1, 2 or 3 years running time, without having to wait for repayment annual fees that run according to the agreement.So again, I'm asking you if this would be possible, why would anyone sell you a house for 30k when he invest 5k and get 30k by doing nothing?Why do you think inflation happens:People have more money, there is a limited offer for their demand, and prices skyrocket! The exact same scenario will happen in your example, who will buy the land work to build the house, and do all this when they could simply turn 5k into 30k in 3 years with no work?Just as in order to make a profit from bitcoin somebody must buy that from you, the same happens with a house, it's not a dead asset as you have to buy it from somebody, just as how you're unwilling to sell your coins now for 10k a piece that guy won't sell you house for 30k.",

The exact same scenario will happen in your example, who will buy the land work to build the house, and do all this when they could simply turn 5k into 30k in 3 years with no work?This is where the real problem arises, the person you are referring to also does not fully understand how to invest in bitcoin, even the people around me are not very familiar with bitcoin, so the decision to buy a house prefers this way.What needs to be underlined is that the company is the first party that owns the capital and simultaneously builds the house, while the second party is the bank as the guarantor for the purchase of the house.Quote from: stompix on September 21, 2022, 08:29:12 PMJust as in order to make a profit from bitcoin somebody must buy that from you, the same happens with a house, it's not a dead asset as you have to buy it from somebody, just as how you're unwilling to sell your coins now for 10k a piece that guy won't sell you house for 30k.There's no need to buy from me, and I'm sure you misunderstood the conversation we're having, or I don't quite understand the content of your question.This is to be straight and not misunderstood, I mean the purchase of a house is a purchase from a private party, they are investors who build houses, while the buyer is free from anyone, but there is an agreement with a second party as a guarantor.So, I mean houses as dead assets, because they buy houses to live in, not to resell as the first party did.Well, on this basis I think people should learn more about bitcoin investment, when the investment they plan goes well, then to build a house there is no need to follow them, but we can build our own with the size and model we want.My focus is hereQuoteSo the point of my post is buying a house as a place to live not for a business and that's why I say if someone invests in bitcoin at the right time, then there is no need to buy a house from them (the company).Because we can build our own according to the wishes and sizes we want",

Of course, the consumer has the authority to buy or not, but if it is considered a house is a necessity, what can they do?In the context of Economics, there is nothing wrong with this capitalist system. But there should be other ways that can be done to not be burdened by the system, so that people are not trapped in something that is not necessarily capable of being done.The thing is, no one is entitled to housing the same way no one is entitled to inherently benefit from a capitalistic system. In fact, there's a lot of \"losers\" in the capitalism system. That doesn't mean communism or socialism is the alternative answer. I don't consider the burden of having to sustain yourself through food, water, and shelter to be a burden that's attributable to capitalism. It's packaged in as part of the deal with being a human.Only in a utopia would people not be burdened by the system, and that's unattainable.Not a quote from me, but I borrow from it loosely:Socialism is a great idea, wrong species.It works great if we're all mindless insects without any desires to exceed past the norm.",
