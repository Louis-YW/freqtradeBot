  "content": "I am fairly new to Bitcoin and recently I created a cold wallet using Tails on an USB-Stick. To see the history of my transactions, I created a watch-only wallet on my online machine. Now I have two questions:1. If I want to transfer Bitcoin to my cold wallet, it is enough to create a recieve request in the watch-only wallet and send it to the adress generated by this request?2. Is it possible to create multiple watch-only wallets on different machines for the same cold wallet?",

      "body": "Yes to both questions.1. If you've properly created the cold-storage set-up, your watching-only wallet should be able to re-create addresses from your offline wallet.2. There's nothing wrong with it since the coins aren't stored in your wallets.Your coins are in the blockchain, your wallet only contains the necessary keys to spend those (\"public keys\" in your watching-only and \"private keys\" in your offline wallet).It's like creating a duplicate car/home key.",

If I want to transfer Bitcoin to my cold wallet, it is enough to create a recieve request in the watch-only wallet and send it to the adress generated by this request?Yes.However,  you don't need to create a receive request (only if you want).Just get your Public address from the cold wallet and transfer the funds to that address. Public addresses can only receive, not spend, so it is safe to share them. Quote2. Is it possible to create multiple watch-only wallets on different machines for the same cold wallet?Yes. Simple import the xpub or each individual address into the wallets you want.You can create as many as you want , there is no limit.",

You can go to \"Addresses\" tab and pick any of addresses you see there. All of those addresses are yours and can be used for receiving bitcoin. If you don't see \"Addresses\" tab, click on \"View\" at top of the window and select \"Show addresses\".",

However, you don't really want to open your offline wallet every time you are going to receive a new payment. This is not a good practice if you want your wallet to remain as safe as possible.A better alternative would be to use the ismine command from the watch only wallet to check if the copied address does really belong to your wallet. Can someone confirm if it's possible to run commands from a watch only wallet, pls.",
