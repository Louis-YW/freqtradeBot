I just looking for a stable cpu miner, would you recommend any?",

I have free electricity but my aim is mining difficulty.Check your profit in the Raptoreum calculator. If you are satisfied with such a profit, then continue mining. You can sell the processor and buy a video card, but in the last month the profit in GPU mining has also dropped a lot.https://mineraptoreum.com/",

Therefore, these processors are rare on ordinary used parts bulletin boards, and companies usually buy new equipment.",

If you can find a working CPU miner it's performance is pathetic.As far as getting a TR for mining more CPU friendly coins it's probably not a good idea, especially in this market.CPU mining should be considered as a secondary task. If you need a TR for something else, or just want to have the biggestCPU, that's fine but I wouldn't buy a big CPU just for mining.",
