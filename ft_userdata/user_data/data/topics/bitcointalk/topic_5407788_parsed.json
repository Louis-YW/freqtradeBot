Really it's a challenge for developer to create solid, secure contract - you can't easy update code,you need to proof/share your code, you have many limitations -¬† so everybody can test/debug and try to hack your smart contract. That's why smart contract code audit is so important.We all know about Certik, Hacken and many other agencies who provide smart contracts audits. We chose Callisto Network and it's Audit department and here is why:-They Audited 350+ smart contracts, which is more than the top 5 audit companies. -Callisto founded by Dexaran - ex ETH, ex ETC core developer and auditor of many contracts on ETC chains. -Callisto and Dexaran invented the ERC223 token standard - more secure than ERC20 - simple changes that save millions. And here is our smart contracts audit report:https://callisto.network/vipwarz-v2-security-audit-report/Woof!",
