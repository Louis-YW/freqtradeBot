But this kind of project doesn't survive a long time. Keep in mind how long they can pay if there is not enough revenue. Many projects promise a lot of things before raising funds. But after launch, they forget about everything and enjoy. Better finds some legit and potential coins that can survive for a long time. Don't run behind of shit coins and lose eventually. Research very well once you are going to invest in any coins. And be careful with brand new projects.",

In fact, as you can see many gamers are leaving for this because of many scams and useless P2E games. How could you think of risking into this? P2E is now vanishing its good reputation and popularity, it probably sooner or later this will totally put an end. Now, if you are really thinking of earning money, I suggest just invest potential coins like BTC and ETH which you can trust and surely earn profit from them.",

Axie is a money sink now that you need to craft items in order to get your axies stronger, and the reward is miniscule. Chumbi valley is meh. There literally isn't any promising P2E projects right now and the scene is looking dry. I have given up on the prospects of P2E in the crypto world, and accepted that maybe the concept needs to 'mature' first before we see a good game that is worth investing our time and money on. P.S., Mir4 is still going strong, but it became more of a serious MMORPG rather than a P2E game.",

Since the market entered winter, I don't have any P2E projects that are playable and worth the investment, previous projects also canceled all plans when the bear market came and P2E projects were no longer profitable, even Axie Infinity announced to close the game because there were no players and could not bring in good profits.",

A bit surprised to see that but it seems like that you are actually aware with the risk for your investment. I think that will give you a huge profit once the market will turn to be bullish again. Mostly of metaverse tokens have been dumping so hard to the bottom priceYou need to have a good patience when you already invested your money, not sure about those projects and as for now I don't have any idea with which projects inside meta are doing great, but basing to what you said, those project who experiencing downfall are good prospect if you believe that there's a good chance of bouncing back.Quote from: virasisog on September 24, 2022, 07:50:41 PMI don't see any developing play to earn games right now. Most of them are actually having a hard time surviving the current market situation that we have. Some of them are drastically using their value so I think they are not worth playing anymore. Others have promised that they will have continuous development but most of them left the game undone when the bearish market happened. Play to earn games' hype isn't as noisy as before so I guess it will still take time for them to have the same hype again. It's true, a lot of play to earn project are having problem surviving with the current market, there are many project that really collapsing and investors are losing their money, it's risky to invest if you are not prepared with each risk that you will going to experience, it's better to wait and do deeper research in each possible projects that you'll going to acquire.",

This can be a good strategy for now to keep buying good projects who are none stop working for their improvements because I’m sure P2E is not fully maximize yet and there’s still a chance for them to rise again.
