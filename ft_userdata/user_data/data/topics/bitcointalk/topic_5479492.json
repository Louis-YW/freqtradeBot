  "content": "Bitcoin transaction fees have become a topic of discussion lately. A lot of topics have been created about Bitcoin transaction fees. It seems the transaction fees are throwing Bitcoin away from its original goal.Today I attempted to make a Bitcoin payment on Namecheap. Instead of making transactions from the Ledger wallet, I tried to make them from Binance for a faster transaction since there was a 15-minute time limit. So the transaction and withdrawal fees asked in Binance are 0.0004BTC, which was almost $17 during the withdrawal. Ok, let's forget Binance withdrawal fees. If I want to make transactions from the ledger, then the transaction has to arrive in 15 minutes. I am pretty sure if I want to ensure the time frame, then I have to spend similar fees, even from Ledger. So it's become hard to pay $17 transaction fees to make a $50 deposit. And by force, I had to use a virtual card that doesn't cost anything (I didn't notice any significant fees) and was an instant transaction as well. It made me believe that we are drifting away from Bitcoin's original goal in some way.",

      "body": "The current bitcoin fee rate is forcefully chasing people to abandon using the network as a payment option for those who have made it one of their favourite means of payment for their online purchases. No matter the love you have for the network, you can't ignore the fact that the fee is high and still continue making use of it when there are better and cheaper options out here. For the time being, Bitcoin is not the best option to use and make small purchases; it could only be used as a store of value; you could buy and save it for future use. I mean, for profit-making in the future when the price moves above what you purchased it, but if it's for payment, altcoins are gradually taking over, and the use of the fait system has also been rapidly growing as a payment option as the fee is way cheaper.",

Though at the sane time, this could be a highlight of what the Bitcoin network will look like as a store of value rather than a payment system, and this premium may become the norm for transferring value....Bitcoin might become a network for those of higher net work while those with smaller values will be forced to use other solutions that are more scalable. It is exciting as it means new opportunity opens in the market, but if is also disappointing as an efficient network is what we hoped for Bitcoin.There is only one thing to blame right now for the problem; ordinals.",

But now, we're dealing on it for several months and still, we've got still problem that we have face every single day and made us thinking whether we'll do the transaction or not or if it's worth it to pay $5-$20 worth of fee now whether we transact. It's not a problem if we'll be transferring a couple of grand or even hundreds but if you'll have to pay $20 or what not, it's not worth it.",

Sadly it is what is, I have been advising since the start of this congestion and high transaction fee saga that bitcoin currently is only suitable for large amount of transaction or rather cross boarder transactions, other than those I will say Find another way. I feel it is the price one has to pay for a decentralized network at the moment. Hopefully the devs will come up with a solution that in my opinion shouldn’t be anything related to censorship of transactions though.",

Some of bitcoin's aim and purpose have been trampled upon . You can no longer use the network when you want it and make your payment unless you are ready to use the second layer or forced to pay a high fee, which could be higher than what you are even paying for. When one experiences such a high transaction fee, where is the joy of using that payment option again? We are gradually losing it unless something is done real quick and the ordinal madness is put to an end. Currently,  altcoins like Doge, LTC, and some others with low network fees and fast transaction fees have seen an increase in transaction volume recently as a result of people diverting their crypto means of payment from bitcoin to something much more affordable.",

It is too early to talk about future generations resembling some sort of stability in Bitcoin's functionality. As you can see, this is subject to many variables at the present time, and in some crises, Fiat becomes closer to it in competition.This does not detract from the value of Bitcoin, given that everything that happens is circumstantial and determined by multiple factors. There will never be any guarantee for future generations of what will happen to Bitcoin or anything else.There is a state of anticipation in the community awaiting the next halving. Perhaps this is what people are most patient with now. Even all current development work will be more in-depth to solve more potential problems, which will ensure that Bitcoin achieves its purposes for which it was created efficiently.",

But if you compare it to now, Bitcoin payments on Namecheap are not worth the $17 fee that must be paid, unless the Domain payment is quite expensive, it will not be a problem. The problem as you experience is the limit of transaction confirmation that must be done for 15 minutes. I read some guidelines, that if the transaction is not confirmed for 15 minutes and you have made a payment, you can send a complaint to Namecheap or bitpay support team with payment details made in the form of Transaction ID / Transaction Hash.Very boring, but when the transaction has already been done, there must be other follow-ups so that Bitcoin can enter the name cheap account.https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003001363Currently, Bitcoin payments are managed by Bitpay and BTCpayIf you want to make a payment in less than 15 minutes, you will have to pay a fee396.2 sat/vB is about $24.61, but must make payments via personal Wallet, not from CEX.https://bitcoinfees.net/",
