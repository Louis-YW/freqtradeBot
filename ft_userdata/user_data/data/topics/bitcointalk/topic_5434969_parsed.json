One thing I could say is that you could have sold a lot these during the last bullrun. Maybe keep creating and see if you could make improvements until the next bitcoin halving.Quote from: SmokerApeth on January 16, 2023, 03:20:07 PMIf it's a problem, I'll delete the post right away.You're good.",

Adding a cigarette to some nft collection that already exist doesn't really signal any effort or that you are being serious and had big plans for this. ( i am assuming that you took the apes from somewhere and modified as there are ton of these pixelated punks and apes, if you didn't please do correct me.)Â At least you aren't using midjourney so i am giving points for that, AI art is currently lowest effort of them all and for some reason EVERYONE wants to try it and flood the markets with it..",

      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk, Smoker Apeth!IMHO, your NFT is like a copycat of the cypherpunk NFTs. Yeah, you've added a cigarette and the image changes but I don't see originality with it, nice try though as you're wanting to improve so you asked the communities thought about it.Well, keep on improving and despite the NFT arts are no longer on hype but having the talent of making art images, you've got a lot way to go but be unique.",

      "body": "It has the feeling of the usual NFT people buy, question is, can you hype it big enough to sell it? Cause NFTs that have styles like these are mostly just hyped-up projects, without any marketing strategies I doubt you'd be able to sell much at all. I'd honestly spend a year or two developing a personal style instead and then creating an NFT project, maybe even accepting commissions (since no one really buys NFTs for how \"good\" the art is). IF you're continuing on to the NFT path, I don't think you need to copy how most NFTs do the \"Base NFT + some flavor\" style, make your own unique ones. It doesn't matter if the quantity is small, quality over quantity at the start imo. Quantity will come sooner or later with you continuing to develop your skills.",

As I can see, the majority of NFT projects are worthless that is why only a few investors have the courage to collect them. If we are aiming to earn money from having this stuff, this can be difficult, this can be just considered as a market collection in the end. Honestly, it was not a profitable investment by now as their time has been over.",

      "body": "It's nice to see a lot of NFT collections being developed.In my opinion, your collection does not stand out from hundreds of other collections, and judging by the sales volume, others think so.On the face of it, artists and collectors enter the NFT market thinking that as soon as they create a collection, a \"full sale\" is guaranteed. In 2023, this is no longer the case.In my opinion, you need to think about the development of your community, because. Only with a developed NFT community do collections have a chance of being sold out. You made a big mistake by not gaining loyal fans before the release. Your collection is completely missing any unique, personal idea. The idea that the collection conveys has a strong influence on the value of the collections. Try to create a bounty campaign to attract users and get advertising and social media coverage.You have decided to upload your collection and promote it on OpenSea without maintaining pages on social networks. This is a big mistake. OpenSea algorithms can push you to the top of the main page if you have significant activity in social networks.We have described the most common tips for promoting NFT collections in the article: How to promote an NFT collection.If my advice helped you, you can send your NFT to our official wallet as a thank you, in addition, those who visit our profile will see your NFT.",

      "body": "The design is quite good but with my personal opinion, connecting artworks to 'ape' which is a successful project in the first place. It would still be better to create another concept to introduce yourself as someone 'new' than to have an image of a copy artist in this industry. Well, indeed it could share a hype with the original project but still, things won't be the same if it is outcome you are hoping for. Use your imagination and capability as an artist. Would be much better to also express yourself and create your own 'self' in this industry and outside. NFTs are really hard in terms of choosing which is which. Demand based as well but originality and concept would be factors to determine a project's outcome.",
