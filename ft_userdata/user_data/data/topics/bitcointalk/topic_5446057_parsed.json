This needs to be eliminated from the system entirely. But honestly I am not sure if these things will materialize. As of now India maintains a good relationship with US. If this CBDC becomes a reality then that relationship will not take much time to change. Indian government will have to balance this properly.",

They are starting to use their own currencies than using USD for international trades and remittances. But in your post I don't understand one thing. What are the charges you are talking about? Anyone can transact in USD, there are no charges involved to just use it. The only issue is the forex risk that one carries when it has to trade in a third party currency, rest I don't think there are any transaction charges on this.",

I mean the settlement is not done through help of US, Indian government just buys USD in open market to pay for such transactions and it only has to pay the exchanging fees or charges which isn't that much, main risk is the hedge risk. US valuation is growing more because of the increasing inflation in the US thereby dollar strengthening measures taken by the government as well.",

They are not going to change that and they really like playing the world police and attack countries according to their whim and they are printing money in trillions and it will collapse eventually as the inflation and the bad fiscal policies are showing its cracks .Quote from: avikz on March 23, 2023, 05:50:29 PMBut honestly I am not sure if these things will materialize.

As long as US sees China as their enemy and the relation with Pakistan is not that strong like they used to be in the past they will keep ties with India as long as they think that it is its strategic partner.",

I remember I saw a few news on mainstream me India discussing UPI & PayU be part of the payment system in a few countries. I vaguely remember UAE, Vietnam, Singapore, and Srilanka adopting it. I am not sure if it will benefit the expat as it is still not clear what would be the fee for transferring from UAE and vice versa. BTW, do you think the government cares about US and Europe? India is still importing oil from Russia.",

Let's see how far the new CBDC reaches.",
