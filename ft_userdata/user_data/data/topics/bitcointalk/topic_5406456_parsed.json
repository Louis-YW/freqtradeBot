  "content": "Today i decided to hit x330,000, My best shot is x99,000 and it takes 50,000 bets. But when i was chasing the x10,000 it takes 21k bets. So, today i'm running some bots chasing the jackpot.Already placed 37,700 bets, but i'm ready to gamble 1,000,000 bets for that multiplier. My idea is to hit with the first 100k bets of the same seed, if the shot doesn't came i will change the seed.So, what do you think, will i hit that multiplier in 1M Bets?Some technical information:Casino: Just-dice.comCoin: ClamcoinBets/second: 20Bet amount:0.001 Clams.Bot code:Code:var chance = 0.0003; var a = 1; var betAmt = 0.001; target=101;var balance = parseFloat(document.getElementById('pct_balance').value);var mybet;document.getElementById('pct_chance').value = chance;parseFloat(document.getElementById('pct_bet').value = betAmt);async function dobet(){balancez = document.getElementById('pct_balance').value;var stuit = document.getElementById('pct_bet').value;document.getElementById('pct_chance').value = chance;if (mybet==null) {mybet = stuit;}if (balancez>=target) {return;}if (a==0) {return;}balancez = document.getElementById('pct_balance').value;parseFloat(document.getElementById('pct_bet').value = ((mybet*1).toFixed(8)));$('#a_lo').click();}setInterval(() => dobet(), 70);UPDATE:I just get the hit... here is the proof.

Not familiar with the site you are playing but I think the chance of winning is still high for you, just make sure you are following their rules about using BOT to avoid any inconvenience. Looking forward for your update here. That’s a 14hrs Bet if I compute it correctly, but you can pause or stop that once you got bored waiting for the 1M bet. I think using bot in Just-dice is fine and OP knows this for sure since he is a gambler. Many site already allows betting using a bot as long as it is safe for them. The specific x330,000 might not be hit after the 1M bets, that’s very hard to hit but who knows, luck may find you in the right place and you might be able to reached that multiplier. What’s good about x330,000 multiplier OP?",

I already asked this on the chat and using an automated bot was allowed as their admin said. Back to the OP, probably that is a good strategy that will work somehow but this strategy will need huge money for the bet that you have targeted to achieve. I had like to know what is the result please OP update your thread and show us the result of your plan. It seems there will be a profit waiting ahead with your strategy.",

This is just be his experiment but if he successfully did it to get a jackpot he will most likely increase his betting amount.

It's is gambling, so you might hit it earlier or maybe later like after 2M bets. Placing more bets won't increase your chance of winning more. and I doubt changing the seed matters at all. In the long run, the results are always the same.You should be asking, is it worth hitting that multiplier after 1M bets?",
