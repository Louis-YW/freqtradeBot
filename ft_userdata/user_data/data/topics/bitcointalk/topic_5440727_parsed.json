  "content": "Actually there is still a good chance that itÂ  has been and I have lost a few Â£1000, at least that is what I have 100% thought for the last 4 days and now I have a little hope and it's a weird one But just for starters and I know someone will give me stick here as I partly use a blockchain.com among others and I have spread my risk around, I am not very clued up on crypto and just HODL and leave my wallets alone apart from a little trading on Binance.Last week I had a text from blockchain notifying me that my 2fa security had been removed around 1 am in the morning while I slept and I saw it at 7am, I went straight onto my blockchain.com wallet but the first thing I wondered was how could someone remove my 2fa security when they first needed 2fa to get into the wallet to then remove it, I tried to explain that to Blockchain.com.But anyway I could see my wallet was empty and thought shit, I then could see 6 transaction were sent early in the morningÂ  and it wasn't me so I have basically just thought lesson learnt. And just for the record I am super security conscious and there is no chance that I would tell anyone anything about seeds, passwords or wallet ID. But there was just this one case way back in 2021 where loads of us could not access our wallets and customer service was totally crap so what I was a advised was open another wallet and use my seed phrases. I used Electrum as they had a good name but found it difficult to use and could not get my head around it so just gave up in the end and trusted it to God  and thankfully it all got sorted out and I just left the wallet for years and left some funds in it and just checked once in a while.So I have had the Electrum account set up for years and never looked at it since and for the first time opened it up today grasping at straws and what did I see but 6 events only in my history all happening on the same day and within an hour of all my transactions in Blockchain.com, coincidence or connected but how?I am still sure if it is my Btc and Eth there because all the jargon makes no sense and in all my years I have never sent Btc wallet to wallet, like I said I just mostly HODL.But there is also one other thing, when I checked my blockchain wallet a few times this last few days it was left with only Â£29 and I thought why have the thieving shits done that, but a few days later it went to Â£43 and today it is Â£65, I cannot work any of this out.But for the last 4 days the only thought in my head was how could this be hacked, there are 4 stages to the security and it just did not make sense.",

This is worrisome mate, If I am not mistaken, you talked about usingÂ  Electrum wallet and of lately, there has been series of hack in this same wallet possible their must be some breach somewhere. As at last month a high ranked member here suffered a hack too and funds meant for campaign all stolen. No wallet is safe but it takes extra measures to properly keep your funds safe in your own wallet. Keep your pass phrase safe and secured where only you have access to. If i may ask did you update your wallet to the current version? If no then I will recommend you do that for your next wallet so as not to loose your funds.but I am still curious about your case.",

Everything on the internet in vulnerable. So if you choose to keep your assets safe, keep them in personal hardware wallet. The way you expressed your story, I think given the reputation of what blockchain.com have, it is more likely the hacker got the access to your wallet from that. And they can get your seed if they have access over your wallet. No big deal. I am not defending electrum, as it is an online wallet, it could get hacked too. Lesson learned.

But I am stillÂ  eager to know and as a learning curve want to know where it was that I was compromised.This is it more clearly.1. Opened a blockchain wallet in 20182. fine for 3 years and then in 2021 many blockchain users were shut out of their wallets for a few months, some(including myself) were advised to import to a better wallet using the seed phrase and I created a spectrum wallet to do that.3. I attempted to do this on my new spectrum wallet and this would of been my first ever use of it, I was struggling with it so left it a few days and in the mean time Blockchain.com fixed their issues(sever problem is I remember correctly) and problem was solved.4.Â  So I now had a spectrum wallet and no use for it though I still kept it on hand and password etc hidden way, it sat there unused and not touched until yesterday(2 years), we will come onto that in a minute.5.last Friday I had a text from blockchain 2fa had been turned off(though could not of been me)Â  5 minutes later and first time in a month or two I checked blockchain wallet to see that it had been robbed(probably)6. Since last Friday all I have really wanted to do was know from what area/angle or source they had got to me with no thought of spectrum, as far as I was concerned it was a f*** up by me or blockchain but for the life of me I cannot see how anyone got through the blockchain security that was well hidden away and protected.7. Still unclear how and what happened and I can see the record in blockchain of my crypto leaving my wallet in six stages at 1 am on the 17th Feb, I just thought I would check my spectrum wallet for the first time in two years and went to history and the only events in all that time that happened were the day IÂ  created a spectrum wallet in early 2021 and six events that happen(precisely the same time as my blockchain departing) at 1 am on the 17th Feb, odds are that this is nearly an impossible coincidence.8. So for the record I have never had any crypto in my spectrum wallet and it has only been lookedÂ  a couple of times in 2 years in the early days it was created. The 6 events that make no sense to me are not wallets or sums of Btc, they make no sense at all to me and are just numbers, but they are events that happened that I am sure are connected somehow.Yes someone could have somehow got my seed phrases but all the information would have been on blockchain.com(which it is) and spectrum does not even come into the equation as it should not even be relevant.",

This would explain the fact that you see identical outgoing transactions in Electrum and blockchain.com - because they both share the same seed, that is, the same addresses/private keys.If what I wrote is correct, then the only question is whether you left that seed unprotected in any form and someone managed to get hold of it - or are you a victim of some other exploit that exists on blockchain.com.It probably has nothing to do with your case - but it reminded me of something from the past -> Blockchain.com scam - lost funds",
