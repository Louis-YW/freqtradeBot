Growth refers to the new ideas that are being put forward in a market and most of the currencies you are talking about (18000 cryptocurrencies) are duplicate models of less than 20 cryptos with some lazy modifications.Most of these coins are tokens that are created on Ethereum, BSC and other quick token development solutions that mainly aim to make developers rich.As for the technical development of altcoin, it does not go beyond a few models, and the rest of the models try to repeat the idea.",

This level of growth in such a short period is remarkable and has benefitted early adopters of the nascent industry.Innovation seems to rise exponentially because most likely it is based on crypto technology available to build on. More platforms offering more opportunities = more crypto technology is launchedBitcoin is just a payments system, where you can't really build on and applications are really limited. Applications can be wallets but much more is just not necessary for Bitcoin. Blockchain 2.0 enables much more applications and developers can select from a wide range of Blockchain 2.0 platforms to build on. Opportunity is growing exponentially currently, because it just is discovered what's possible to use Blockchain 2.0 for. Especially, more cryptocurrencies means also more applications based on multiple cryptocurrencies, like multicoin wallets, swap platforms, analysis websites and similar.",

We have witnessed here different scam projects, a hyped coin that usually happened on meme coins.Â  Look at how many fork Bitcoin projects exist even though it was copied/pasted to the Bitcoin.

Actually being a bitcoin copy-cat is not that bad as long they change other feature and have a better proposed use case not claim that its the real bitcoin or whatnot. Look LTC, although people will argue about LTC but people still using them for faster confirmation and cheap tx fee ~ most of the time.",

Juicy yields usually come followed by juicy token devaluation. For most altcoins, that is the only advantage or benefit they can offer to investors, because the currency actually doesn't bring any innovation or particular feature adopters could be interested in. But it doesn't matter, since all the yields received are in vain once the hype is gone and the token's price crashes.It's much better to invest in bitcoin and earn regular yields that are considered low for many, although we can have the assurance to be investing in something that is solid and has passed the test of time.",

He just wrongly see the growth for that aspect because the growing numbers of cryptocurrency happen because there are so many scammers keep creating new scam tokens and its not good to look at it as a growth because some of those tokens are totally dead already. Quantity or those rising numbers is very much important so its good for us to only count those legitimate crypto which is still alive now. The rising industry by adoption and frequently been mentioned in mainstream media will be one of indicator that crypto is totally growing.",
