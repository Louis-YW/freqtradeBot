  "content": "So those ordinals suddenly got very popular at the halveving, which caused fees to go way up for a little while. And on Mempool.space, you could see a lot of tx's were OP_Return tx.And right now, fees are pretty good at around 4-10 SATs/vB. So I assume the ordinals craves subsided somewhat.Now, I don't understand what an OP_Return tx is for. But I understand that an OP_Return tx can be a valid non-ordinal transaction, but an ordinal is always an OP_Return tx.And so, we can pretty much visually gauge how many OP_Return tx's there are by clicking on each tx in a block. But that only tells me if a tx is OP_Return of not, it doesn't tell me if a tx is an ordinal or not.So how much room are ordinals taking up on an average block? How much of a blockchain real estate problem are they, really?",

Because implementing via OP Return is simpler and would boost adoption since most individual are familiar with the script code. QuoteSo how much room are ordinals taking up on an average block?
