Exchange platforms aren't too flexible as a medium of payment and can charge excessive fees.At least you state your preferences, using crypto isn't as easy as imagined, especially regarding local legality and of course there are some technical things that you need to learn.",

To do so, just open an account in the biggest exchanges such as Coinbase,  Binance  , Kraken, Bitstamp, etc...I would avoid small and new exchanges, as they have higher risk to disappear with your money.",

Where should I start? Thanks a lot in advance! I'm a bit confused about your intentions. Are you looking to invest in cryptocurrency or use it as a method of payment? While it's possible to do both, there seems to be a bit of a tradeoff between the two options. Investing in cryptocurrency involves holding onto it for potential future gains, while using it as a form of payment requires spending it now.Quote from: bitmover on March 20, 2023, 04:32:58 PMYou cannot use crypto in daily basis, there is no place in the world where you can every day buy stuff with crypto.Don't be so sure about that. It's not a stretch to say that living solely on cryptocurrency is possible, given the increasing number of stores and businesses that now accept it as a form of payment. In fact, I myself have been able to pay for groceries and bills with cryptocurrency. Additionally, with the availability of payment cards that can be topped up with cryptocurrency, it's becoming easier to fully embrace a crypto-based lifestyle.",

It depends on which country you are in and if Bitcoin in your place was fully regulated or announced by the government as a legal tender. You can't use Bitcoin on a daily basis because a few are using this and some physical stores didn't accept Bitcoin yet as a payment.Just try to Google it if what crypto local wallet supports crypto in your place, it could that way, it may help you to use Bitcoin in some merchant's stores but I guarantee not them all.  Just like in my place, we have Coins.ph wallet/exchange app which is a centralized app that you can possibly use daily.As of now, Binance is very popular, using a web or an app could be a much better UI.",

If so then it's better to use a non-custodial wallet it will be simpler that makes frequent transactions.If it's about the best platform to start investing maybe you can choose Binance platform and need to pass KYC to be able to buy bitcoin or other types of crypto, after that you can withdraw to holding wallet or hardware wallet if you have one.",

Hi and welcome to the forum.As you clearly lack basic knowledge about cryptocurrencies and where and how they are used, you should first educate yourself on that. Start by learning about the basics either from this forum or using Google. Once you acquire enough knowledge and understand the basics, then you should go for investing, you can use Binance.com for easy buying and selling of all kinds of cryptocurrencies.Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies is a high risk, so though you may get returns on your investment if the price of the coin/token goes high after you buy it, the possibility of it dropping is always there too.",

If you intend to invest in cryptocurrencies then you need to buy and hodl mainly bitcoin for a long time for you to make some profit. If trading is your main aim, then you need to pay more attention to the market to enable you to buy and sell profitably. I hope you are also aware of the risks involved in venturing into this sector.Using cryptocurrency for daily expenses will be largely based on your country's stance on the currency. There are nations where you can't buy anything with cryptos. Some are more open to cryptocurrencies and few have made it legal tender.",

If you're referring to the best best way to buy cryptocurrency then choosing a centralized exchange is fine but if you're to store and keep your crypto it's a very bad idea, you get a decentralized cold storage for doing that, you can learn more about trading before starting and these depends on which kind of trading you wanted to begin with, but i will suggest you start with bitcoin only for a start, and learn all the trading patterns.",

      "body": "OP, Investing in cryptocurrency can be an exciting and potentially profitable endeavor, but it's important to approach it with caution and do your research. Before investing in any cryptocurrency, you should take the time to learn about the risks associated with it and how it works. Once you've selected a cryptocurrency you'd like to invest in, you'll need to choose a reputable exchange to purchase it. You should also set up a wallet to store your cryptocurrency after you purchase it, and practice good security habits to protect your investment.If you're interested in using cryptocurrency on a daily basis, there are several ways to do so. Many merchants now accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, so you can use it to make purchases just like you would with a credit card or cash. Additionally, some companies offer cryptocurrency debit cards that allow you to spend your cryptocurrency anywhere that accepts traditional debit cards. You can also use cryptocurrency to send and receive money to friends and family around the world, with low fees and near-instant transaction times. Overall, investing in and using cryptocurrency can be a rewarding experience, but it's important to approach it with caution and stay informed about the latest developments in the market.",

You can guarantee that your funds will never leave your wallet even if convert it on different currency. First you should define what Blockchain you want to use as your ecosystem for your trade. For starters, Binance Smart Chain is good for beginners because it has low transaction fee, fast transaction confirmation and vast number of dapps which you can choose to invest frequently.If your goal is to trade in regular basis, You should use an exchange that has a very active development to make sure that most of the projects has volume that you will for trading. Never use CEX to trade in daily basis because you will surely leave your assets inside the exchange which is very dangerous since you don’t have access to your  wallet private key.Do more research on DEX trading and find the perfect blockchain that suits your trading style. Good luck!",

But if you are a beginner and you have no knowledge, then you will lose your investment in trading.If you want to invest, then buy a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet first. They support a lot of current coins, and then start building your portfolio. I do not recommend that you choose more than 10 coins. It's very difficult to follow up.",
