(wiki) In the US, legal tender is limited to US dollars only - sorry, Bitcoin!  But seriously, although Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren't considered legal tender in most countries, they can still be used as a form of payment. However, in some cases, you may be required to pay taxes on your cryptocurrency transactions. For example, if you're an American citizen and you make purchases with Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, the IRS considers this a capital gain or loss.",

Imagine Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar, that would mean the financial power and control of the market by the US would vanish overnight.",

However bitcoin isn’t illegal in the United States, you can still buy bitcoins in the US and in most parts of the world. I think China is the country with the strictest laws on bitcoin but recently they permitted bitcoin in Hong Kong. It is possible the United States may change their opinion on the subject someday.",

      "body": "The overall crypto situation in the US is a bit complicated. As the state does not recognize any digital currency as a legal tender (under a legal clause), but at the same time it allows the activity of companies operating in the field of cryptocurrencies. It means that US citizens can engage in activities related to digital currencies and adopt service companies such as trading platforms that have legal licenses for activity.The biggest problem facing any country that wants to legalize cryptocurrencies is challenges in the field of combating money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism and its control.",

If you use it and get caught, you will be put into jails.Legal means you can use Bitcoin without risk to put into jail because of illegal prohibition in that nation.Legal tender means you can not reject if someone brings bitcoin to your store, business and want to exchange it to you to get a candy, book, whatever they want to buy from your business.QuoteThese countries are El Salvador and the Central African RepublicThey are countries that make Bitcoin legal tender, a far step than make Bitcoin legally.",

El Salvador is so far the only country that recognizes Bitcoin as legal tender. Before this move, it was recognized as a risk for investors. Bitcoin as legal tender in any country is a great phenomenon that deserves all the press. There is no doubt that El Salvador's move could be a significant precedent in history if other countries around the world are encouraged to adopt Bitcoin in the future.",

Bitcoin has a lot of uses specially when it comes to transactions. Bitcoins in USA isn’t illegal that’s why it is okay to use but not totally legal like fiat currency.I believe your post lacks clarity. If you say that Bitcoin is not entirely legal in the USA, what exactly do you mean? As you stated earlier, it's not illegal, so it must be considered legal. Right? Or did you mean that its legality status can be open to interpretation depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction?",
