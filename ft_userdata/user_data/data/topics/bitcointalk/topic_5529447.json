And don't get me started on Quantum computing.The math is like a cycle with a biggest barrier for governments to shut down Bitcoin, is its design which is decentralized and open source. Everyone can reproduce Bitcoin node and run it to decentralized the blockchain from Bitcoin open source code, and the Bitcoin community are free to choose what chain they want to support and use.Governments can do similar things like some teams that tried to fork Bitcoin, and succcessfully create many Bitcoin forks that are dead and are going to be dead coins.https://forkdrop.io/how-many-bitcoin-forks-are-there",

As you said, its open source nature can be updated by anyone and its coding can be adapted to the most advanced technology. But it is not known when it will happen, maybe 50-100 years in the future with a more advanced version of the technology. That is personally why it is not right to say bitcoin is eternal, but rather can be updated but still maintain the essence of bitcoin. This is just based on my assumption so it must not always be the same as others.",

In terms of supply, it's not immortal, it has a limit of 21 million and it will be last mined approximately in 2140.But if we look at it, maybe even if all have been mined, obviously there will still be a lot of holders that are not going to sell. Although we really don't know what the future will be because it's obvious that we are unalive by that time. It could be that one one is using it, or everyone is still with this technology after 100++ years.",

In that scenario, Bitcoin would likely go back to being mostly used for illegal activities, as those users aren’t worried about breaking the law in the first place.",

Personally, I don't think the government will agree and start hunting all these 65K computer users to shut down these nodes. They even couldn't find hundreds of them. If the world cannot be united to stop these wars and help the poor people who are starving, do you think the whole world will be united to stop the internet and shut down Bitcoin? I don't think so.",
