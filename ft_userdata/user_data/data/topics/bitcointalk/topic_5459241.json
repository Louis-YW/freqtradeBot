So if you hold it in your wallet for to long that you can make a profit or there is what we call return of investment.If you spend your bitcoin then you used it as what is was designed by Satoshi in the beginning, as a payment scheme.",

This is even the first priority of bitcoin inception in the first place. The only person regarded as an investor is a longer time holders",

But there are still some people who don't see bitcoin as an investment, they see bitcoin as a currency, a peer-to-peer means of payment, and those who buy bitcoin for the purpose of spending cannot call them investors. As I said, when you are a holder, a trader, as long as you are looking for profit, you are an investor.",

If you own some amount of BTC, constantly spending and earning or rebuying a part of bit, but also holding some for the future, then you are simultaneously an investor and a user.Outside of the US, a lot of people store their wealth in the US dollar, because it's more stable than their home currency. But they aren't typically called \"USD investors\". Technically, the same should be true for those who own BTC, because Bitcoin is a currency. But it's so fast growing that a lot of people buy it for the sake of making quick profits, which is easier to categorize as investing.",

If your goal is to buy cheap Bitcoins and in the future, you wanna sell them for profit. If you only use Bitcoin in your daily life, without losing or gaining any value, I don't think you are being investor, so hodling Bitcoin could be also referred to as investing.",

To me, Bitcoin investors could be considered anyone who has put in something, either their time or wealth, in order to acquire some Bitcoin. Wealth in the aspect of using their money to buy Bitcoin. Their time in the aspect of mining or any other means of acquiring Bitcoin. You can only be called an investor if your acquired Bitcoin is still stored somewhere. No matter how little the Bitcoin is, there should be at least some of it to represent your investment before one could be called an investor, and if eventually all your holdings have been spent, the person should no longer be considered an investor but will now be referred to as someone who's invested in Bitcoin.",

Think of the way some people say ”I’m gonna invest in some gold”, does this mean they’re gonna “hodl” forever? It could be until tomorrow or for a decade. They may not even truly believe gold investments are worth the effort on the long run, but they’re shortly investing in it.Investing doesn’t require belief or long term planning.

An investor puts capital to use for long-term gain, while a trader seeks to generate short-term profits by buying and selling securities over and over again.Investors typically hold positions for years to decades (also called a \"position trader\" or \"buy and hold investor\") while traders generally hold positions for shorter periods. Scalp traders, for example, hold positions for as little as a few seconds. Swing traders, on the other hand, seek positions that are held from several days to several weeks.",
