This is a loss of control. And this is a kind of undermining of political power. If cryptocurrency is accepted at the state level, this may result in a loss of control over the movement of cash flows. It is difficult for governments to track the income of cryptocurrency holders, which raises the question of taxation.And yes, bitcoin is still not popular with many due to various scammers who are doing their best to deceive users. And there is also a lack of good computer literacy in the population in order to use and store their crypto assets correctly.",

The news also has an effect on people's opinions about it (quite a large effect actually), and the current trend, from what I can observe, is continued derision of whatever new technology comes out of the production line.For example:First DeFi was invented, then the media started criticising that.Then we had NFTs, with the same effect on the media as above.Meanwhile, random cryptos are being created that increased in value very quickly comparable to Bitcoin in 2017, so all the media attention was diverted to those cryptos.And the general reaction to all of these developments was contempt.With such an attitude among the public, why would you expect the governments to adopt a different opinion about them?",

Not that it will reduce the number of scams of this nature though.",

If it’s getting hacked then it’s good for them because that becomes one integrity question so that they can tell us why we not accepting it. But the reality is they don’t want the trouble of loosing centralised monopoly over currency management. Apart from this, who said fiat never gets stolen? Well fiat is also hacked form the bank accounts many times, even ATM, physical cash loot are another ways to hack it. Nothing is secure and it’s part of crime management rather than accepting which one is safer.",

It is more resilient in hacking compared to other apps, platforms, websites, and central organization system because hackers can't easily infiltrate it due to its encryption. However, most people fall victim into scams and schemes. This is mainly because of lack of awareness, being relaxed, and being careless and gullible at the same time, Several hackings that I have encountered were due to human error which cannot be undone and we cannot really blame the security of  crypto because of this since it is the owner's duty and responsibility to verify.Regarding why the government don't want to accept crypto, this is typically because of the reason that they do not believe in it and they see it as a hindrance in making the traditional fiat system grow. In addition, some government do not really want their citizens to become financially independent and educated because they won't generate taxes and the citizens will be aloof with them. Hence, instead of wholly adopting it, they just regulate it in their own terms, which of course, in a way still beneficial to them.",

Then if they want adoption, it may need an allotted budget to educate people about cryptocurrencies. I can agree with you here. The regulation is not a problem in crypto itself, it is the entity or organization who wants to accept crypto in their financial system. So the regulation depends on the government or institution who wants to accept crypto. Because if a particular organization doesn't have any kind of regulation protocol, it would be hard for them to track down what's going on with their people and so as mentioned, for example, how can a government implement taxation if they have no kind of control around it?",

Government couldnt fully regulation crypto literally or technically thats why they do really target out platforms on regulation them specially to those who are attached with crypto servicesthats why we are seeing more stricter rules and verification which users need to abide.",

It is a wild wild west out there and there are not enough security and safety measures to guarantee and ensure that the consuming public and their money are fully protected. Whether we like it or not, saving in a bank gives peace of mind to a lot of people. Whatever happens, their funds are insured and accountability is more or less guaranteed. There is a system in place of which the people have become comfortable.On the other hand, in DeFi in the year 2021 alone, at least $10 billion is already stolen from users. How many of them have actually recovered their funds? How many of the thieves and robbers have been brought to justice? How many developers have been made accountable?",

This is one proof how Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrencies, I won't expect any other crypto will be accepted as legal tender except CBDCs.The reason why cryptocurrencies didn't get accepted as legal tender isn't only easy to hack, but:1. It's really easy to manipulate due to low market cap.2. It's centralized and there's a CEO behind of the project, they can do what they want. Proof of Stake coin where you can burn and mint your coins, it's show how centralized the token is. 3. It's easy to pump and dump, government doesn't like high volatility.",

It is due to different vulnerabilities like the people revealing their private keys or not securing their devices, most of these can be prevented by the owner of the coins. Exchanges getting hacked are occurring with a frequency of once per year and they cannot be prevented from our side, but measures can be taken to avoid storing coins on exchange hot wallets for long.But these events and governments not being lenient towards crypto are different in my opinion. Government has their own reason to avoid something that allows tax evasion. It makes crypto a risky asset to store your hard-earned cash in, but that is a risk that the investor has to bear.",
