      "body": "It depends on various facts though. What type business it is, how it runs and what are the required skills for the same?I mean any business that is running successfully will always have two strong bonds: Employee and Employer. Now frankly speaking if you look at big organization then employer (owner themselves) would never know all of their employee except the higher managements who reports to them. However, they are always hired based on the job requirements and skill sets. It may not concern whether they are smarter than the employer or not smarter. All it matters is they are giving their 100% for the job they hired. If we come down to small businesses whether they are start ups and small scales then it might have some direct impact. Lets say there is smart person whose part of such small business but he has no interest in running the business itself due to less funding's, his family conditions, or he might be just interested in using his smart work to do his work faithfully. So it may not be that much concerning. However, a watch from employer is always needed in such cases. Stealing ideas, making own establishments out of the experiments is something we can never hide or tell about anyone. However, an owner knows how difficult it is to create successful business. So it may happen they never be success though they have the ideas stolen. What I am seeing here is, multiple scenario's based on multiple factors. Good or bad, mixed.",

What is your view regarding this?But you don't need to be too paranoid about this because you can still limit something that you think is important for your employees in your company or business. Your concern must be something very positive if you really have a good mindset in building business. I mean, you can give enough capital to your employees to open another business with the same idea which in the end is still within your control.Your business model will determine how you can build this business to be more successful. If you are smart enough to take advantage of the odds then your money will really work for you. I've seen success with this kind of business model before, so I'm just saying.",

There isn't such thing as a smart number and people are like in a line over that.People have different qualities and know about different subjects. Someone may be very smart in coding but an idiot when talking about finances or administration (like Sam from ftx) Nobody can be smart in everything. So, a boss should always hire people who are smarter than him in various area where he is not or just doesn't have time",

That worker cannot be smart, otherwise he would have launched his own project and supervised it instead of working as a wage earner in projects owned by investors who are supposed to be less intelligent than him.The owner of the project will look for smart workers, and I do not think he will compare his intelligence with their intelligence before assigning them. The man in the video probably wants to present a distinctive picture of his project and how he employs efficient and intelligent employees.In the best cases, the intelligent person will be able to employ his skills without his employer noticing him because he will simply focus with him more fearing that his intelligence will lead him to actions that are in his personal interest and not in the interest of the work he was assigned to do .",

Having smart employees is definitely an advantage since they can serve as assets in the company. If I am an employer, I would not resort into thinking that I will be taken advantage in the end, instead we can work hand in hand for the success of the company. If ever they will decide to stand on their own and build their own companies, I guess it should be my pride since they were able to learn from me, and for me atleast I’m thankful that I will be part of their success sooner.",

There isn't such thing as a smart number and people are like in a line over that....Correctly said.There is no universal scale which determines who is smarter than another and the degree of said difference. People have their strengths and weakness and as an employee, or business owner, your job is to utilize the strengths of people you employ and find ways to minimize the effect of their weakness.There are key factors to a business and as an owner, you cannot be equally skilled in the various areas. A great project design would need good marketing, and this involves hiring people smarter than you in that field, same with finances, Human Resource, customer service etcetera.Quote from: krishnaverma on November 21, 2022, 05:02:53 PMWhat are the possible intentions behind doing this?

This is even a great edge having those brilliant minds working for you because they can do well in their respective jobs and they can be trusted enough to meet the success of the company. So they will always contribute to the growth of the company, and definitely not the other way around. However, it’s a good thing that they will also learn from you, because you can be their own inspiration to do better in their jobs and find their own success in the future.",

They can be your big assets in your company to achieve faster your company’s goals and become successful eventually. And also, you can ask for them some new and interesting ideas that they think will be of great help for the company’s growth and success. So the process will be very smooth sailing. Whether they also sees you to be their stepping stone, well this is even better because at least you have helped them to become successful in their own career too once they decide to separate from your company.",

Back then in the University (college), there is this popular talk that the \"A\" students usually end up being employed by the \"D\" students who while in school, already recognized that school was not their thing and started businesses. Some people who are not good  with book work can be very good and creative in business and life. As an employer, and someone who has been able to package a business, your business now needs some professionals and specialist who can carry out your ideas to standard. You should not be afraid to employ smart people, it is for the benefit of your business and company.",

And a list of clients + idea is not enough to start most businesses. You need capital and time, and there's a huge risk that you won't get enough customers. Plus being smart does not guarantee success in everything. A boss might not understand every intricacy of the field they operate in, but have a good business sense.If someone hires only mediocre people out of fear of them surpassing the employer, such business is not likely to survive the competition in the long run.",

It does an excellent job of addressing the topic.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Why_I_Never_Hire_Brilliant_MenThe concept of human intelligence could be a myth. While there are people who specialize in certain areas of study. Specialization usually does not translate to greater average competency. Being 10/10 in math doesn't translate to being 10/10 in other human endeavors. The confidence that comes with excellence in singular fields could be an illusion to a certain extent. This is something we have seen repeatedly throughout history in terms of people overestimating their capabilities and productiveness while underestimating the obstacles and problems they will face. With catastrophic results. Whether its star citizen in the modern era or nazi germany underestimating the russian winter in WW II. The idea that people approach things rationally and logically while being concerned primarily with facts is a trend which is far more associated with rarity than normality.The idea that smart people exist could also be a myth. The correct term could be specialization, which usually does not translate into a broad range of competency.",

Only for the slave owner, the labor force is totally stupider than the \"employer\" I explain with a very simple example: A businessman is a person who implements IDEAS by finding areas on the market where you can earn money. Yes, no romanticism - and profit drives business. There are some other goals but they are not so significant.So. Take Elon Musk as an example We will not dig deep now, but let's be honest - a smart, cunning, purposeful businessman, and a public figure. But what would he do himself, without ENGINEERS smarter than him, PROGRAMMERS smarter than him, CHEMISTS smarter than him? So that we now see instead of Tesla, Starlink, SpaceX? His mind alone was not enough, moreover, in many practical areas, in terms of knowledge, he loses much to the specialists he hired. By the way, the recruitment in his companies is carried out by HR specialists who are smarter than him in the field of personnel assessment and selection",

Screening would really be not that precise if we do talk on being smart yet there are some smart but not really that productive due to some reasons.You cant able to determine if your employee is smart on direct point of view but rather it would really be that needed takes time before you couldable to point out if he's smart or not but in overall this is really just too much to ask.",
