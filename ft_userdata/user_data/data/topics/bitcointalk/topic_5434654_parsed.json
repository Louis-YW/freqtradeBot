  "content": "I stumbled on a topic on another forum about a table game dealer on an IRL casino created a thread and started an AMA(Ask Me Anything) type of thread. Some of his answer on the thread is kinda intriguing since he is giving info that is not common knowledge for us players. I get some of his Q&A below. Q: Are you instructed to report varying bet size increases or decreases in blackjack?A: If they flat bet table minimum for 3/4 of a shoe then go straight to table max I'm reporting that immediately. If they gradually go up and down from 15 to 20 to 50 to 60 to 45 to 30 or whatever, no issue.Q: Do you know any dealers who have ever cheated the casino? My buddy claims he said to a dealer I'll give you a $50 buck tip on an empty roulette deal if the ball lands in 17. It didn't, it landed another number but he put the roulette winning table marker/ pin thing (sorry not sure of the name) on 17 and paid him out anyway?? Is that bs or could it be true?A: It happens, sure. We had one that was cheating for like 6 months on double deck before they got caught.Q: I know tips Is a big part of your income, and the more players win the more hopefully they tip, but there’s has to be some players from time to time that you’re rooting against, right?A: Absofuckinglutely! There's this guy I deal to on craps- everyone hates him. Dealers, pit bosses, management, other players. We call him Soul Sucker. Dude just kills the vibe the second he gets to the table.Q:Also you feel like casinos care about money laundering where you are? I work in the Philippines and the games are massive. 100kusd max bet on baccarat ok the floor (not even VIP) I swear some of these people betting are just cycling money.A: Oh yeah. It happens. We try to catch it but obviously some people are just really good criminalsYou can read full AMA here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gambling/comments/10b444a/im_a_table_games_dealer_ask_me_stuff/I'm interested to know if we have our own dealer here. Having this kind of thread is interesting.",

      "body": "A friend of mine is a dealer in a casino but he is not registered on the forum. From what he has told me, I can say that at least where he works there is no money laundering but people who should pay taxes on winnings probably don't declare them because they don't keep a register of earnings by each customer. In other words, the tax authorities cannot know that they have made a profit and prosecute them. As for dealers cheating in the casino he's never told me any story like that, what he did tell me is that they are not allowed to gamble in the casino on their days off. Tips are extra income but around 10-20% extra and are shared between the staff. So when someone gives him a tip, he doesn't keep it for himself, goes into a common fund which is then distributed.",

I mean if he could play in the same casino which he works in, maybe his dealer friends wouldn't act as a fair dealer against him. When friendship and other feelings get mixed in the business, people tend to act non-professional and make mistakes.Another thing is, if he somehow discovered an exploit in the casino, then if he plays there he would be able to abuse that exploit for his own benefit. That would create a lot of mess.I guess the owner of the casino already knows about these so he put this rule in effect.",

Dude just kills the vibe the second he gets to the table.It is interesting to see the point of view of the dealers, because even if they are doing their job they also have their own preferences and I could not agree more with this.The game of craps is very dependent on the vibe, and the one thing that can ruin that vibe is when everyone at the table is betting the pass line or the come bet and then suddenly a gambler decides to go against everyone, makes a don’t pass bet or a don’t come bet and then they win, I always suspected that even dealers hated that guy as it takes the fun out of the game and it is nice to see I was not wrong about my assumption.",

In your case, you are Klidex here but no one knows who really you are and where you leave in case you want to share information. Besides the details that is asked is not illegal. I don't see the reason why it be hard to do so in case he saw this thread.",
