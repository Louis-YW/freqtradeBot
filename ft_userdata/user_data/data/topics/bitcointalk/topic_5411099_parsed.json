In this case, asking for others to help is the last thing you should do. You should have reported it first to your local police station or act according to your local regulation, if the incident information get through, there is a chance the scammed ETH address is being flagged, assuming cryptocurrency theft/scam is being handled by your own country.After all, I bet there isn't much hope, you better learn why you got scammed in the first place.",

Im not sure if there would be someone who can help you in this case since you are not even holding your crypto that means if your crypto is not yours for now but it has owned by scammers. Can you tell what site it is? that will be very help full to tag that site as a scam site or you can also open scam accusations against that site in another thread. Maybe that site has official announcement thread in here.",

If yes, then perhaps we can get into the details as whether it is really a scam site or just holding your funds for some other reasons. Did you read the TOS on why they are holding your funds and can't withdraw?I don't think you can find ethical hacker to 'get back what is yours'.  Sorry to break the bubble for you, but there are slim chance that you can get your funds back, to be honest.",

Its quite often that people get hacked due to these reasons and very rare to get their asset back.  What you can do is learn from this experience,  but there is no harm on trying to get it back and maybe the funds is huge then even me I will try all my best.  Bte how or what happened on your funds Can you elaborate how it got stolen?",

Those are definitely a scam and will just cause him to lose more if he deposit money to them. I also believe that those assets are not recoverable anymore since it happened on blockchain.I feel bad for OP but this should be a lesson for him to not believe in some \"too good to be true\" investment schemes. Don't ever attempt also to put your life savings in cryptocurrencies as they are very volatile.",

In the end, you want to respond to theft by stealing, that sounds bad in itself.if something like this would be a solution so that we could recognize which hack is ethically good? anyone who gets angry or feels cheated by anyone just hires good hackers and justice is served.I believe that you have been deceived, unfortunately, there are too many fake services that are only for that. the maximum you can do is to present the whole case and introduce us to the page/site where you lost money, and thus you can help prevent further fraudulent work of such a service.unfortunately, that's the maximum you can do against them.

I don't think that there will be ways to return it back if you're asking for a help of a hacker. No bounty hunter can help you retrieve that fund back. But I'll tell you some incidents with these scam websites that when they're reported to the right government agencies, the owners were tracked down and refunded to the victims. That's happened in some scams in the US and the authorities there has managed to put the scam owners into jail and has forced them to give back the victims money.",

You have probably been fooled into giving money to unlock a bigger amount and you fell for the greed and sent them your money. This has nothing to do with Ethereum, but your own folly.Sorry to hear that you was your life savings, but I hope you learnt your lesson and you should also post in the \"Scam Accusations\" section of this forum about this site so other users who are diligent enough to first check will get a headstart through search engines.Ethereum is only the medium of transaction, not the scammer. Just like fiat money is the mode of transaction in real life scams. Does that mean fiat money is at fault here?QuoteI'm looking for an ethical hacker/crypto bounty hunter to help me recover my funds. You will get scammed again, if you try this. Many scammers are going to appear as hacker or hunters and fool you again.

Being a hacker was not even an easy task. It's unlike when you are hacking a working platform but once it was going down and then it must be something that can't be done even by hacker too. What site? you must also mention the site here. Im sure that you may find others who have the same experience like you. if that was related with the garbage platforms and then why were you still using it before? Didn't you analyze the platform before try to send your money? That doesn't make sense.",

There are no such agencies that can revoke your lost Ethereum, but you can try to track them and know who is behind this scam.  But of course, another cost to pay because they aren't free.  Chainalysis.com will help and solve this if you want to track them down but this won't have a guarantee or better to move on and learned from those mistakes.It always has an advantage if you're knowledgeable enough.",
