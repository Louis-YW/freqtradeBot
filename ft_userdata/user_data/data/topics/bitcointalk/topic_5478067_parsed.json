Or maybe you have used the line to reg for telegram before, which you later wipe out, because it will be hell of a work for these scammers to go through and make some random username guesses just to send in some fake link to them. How I know this guys got their target audience is to visit a group or channel where you are either just a member or active in there, get the usernames of the members, and send them DMs bit by bit so they can be able to locate who was recently active and who was not, so I will advise you to run a back group check to see if you were on a channel before or not. Or maybe some Telegram username scrapper tool has been discovered, and usernames can be sold out to those who want to use it for marketing or scamming.",

This isn't something new, telegram is a well known place for scammers.its easier for them to catch potential newbies over there on telegram. For me, I had to exist all external groups on my telegram and archived those that were less useful, so as to avoid receiving such scam messages. The best thing is to create a new telegram account with a new phone line and avoid joining telegram groups with unknown participants. Most of them are just scammers looking for fresh fish to fry. Let's all be careful.",

I guess there are still some who fall to this uncreative fraud even if it only takes a little common sense on how to respond to it. If a stranger suddenly comes out of nowhere bringing gifts, that's a very obvious red flag. It should be discarded right away. You ask, what if it's true? What if there is indeed that freebie? Forget it, whether there's indeed that freebie or not, it isn't worth it. Taking a big risk for that worthless freebie? That's not logical. But what if the freebie is significant? Then it's an additional red flag; it's not something that should convince you to try it. There has to be a catch somewhere. If something significant is given freely, you're the product or the victim.",

I received the first message from a different Telegram user, and the second message from a different person whose account got blocked before the end of the day he sent the message. Not possible, you should be in any telegram famous group otherwise it is almost impossible to reach any telegram username. I know how this method works, there are some scrip used in this process. first of all the script will copy username from group and then bulk dm option is available where message sent to all copied username. You can store many telegram account so the person sending you messages from different telegram account and your username already saved with scammer and you will get almost every day this type of messages.

Yes safety is first priority when we do online business especially cryptocurrency. Why someone give you 10 usdt without knowing him and if it is a platform giving 10 usdt then instead of advertising why not promoter make multiple accounts and earn 10 usdt. This is common sense problem and greedy person will fall in this",

There is also a new trick that is almost perfect and if you are not careful you might fall easily into the hands of these scammers, have you seen where by a telegram group of an official project got copied with the same exact followers in the fake one? And somehow they will add you, saying they are doing some airdrops? If I don't have anything against free offers and airdrops already I would have fall for the traps. If it's a must for you to use telegram make sure you adjust the security, change > who can add me to any group to > Nobody and you will be safe from these criminals, also adjust your PMs too as people can send you malicious links on telegram as well.",

There you have your answer, what you said at first was yuh haven’t joined any telegram group and that’s why we were curious because it is the easiest place that scammers would get your contact. Being in campaign group from this forum doesn’t mean that scammers wouldn’t be there because even the campaign manager can’t censor the group members there and that’s why most of them put out the non link rule. Just activate the restriction to DM you by unknown numbers.",
