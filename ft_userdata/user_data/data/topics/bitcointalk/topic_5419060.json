  "content": "Hey there! So i've wanted to learn how to code/program for a while now, but I've never really had a purpose for it since i work in a different field and couldn't find a reasonable motivation for it. Until Bitcoin. I'd really like to get involved and learn how to code to help the protocol in any way i can. The obvious question I've always asked myself when thinking about learning programming is which language to choose, as i don't want to waste valuable time learning a language that's going to be of no use to me, hence the specific question: which language is the most useful to learn? I'd love to hear your opinions and hopefully get more insight on this for me and for other ppl out there having the same dilemma.Cheers",

      "body": "The best language to learn for bitcoin based applications are c and c++ at the moment. There are implementations of coins like ethereum that are done in go as well and other projects like electrum that use python and bitcoinj which uses java.I think c and c++ are two of the hardest mainstream languages to learn but are generally the most efficient and most predictable.I leant a lot from interactive course websites like codecademy (if they're not free anymore, somewhere will be). You can likely get all you need from online courses and YouTube videos too.",

I've been watching channels like Bucky and Traversy Media when it comes to any languages/frameworks.After you get a grasp in your picked language, try to build something out of it so you won't get stuck on the popular term we, as programmers, call it - \"tutorial hell\".You can learn the core languages first then jump into frameworks, but when I was still self-studying I usually learn the language as I go with the framework and it works for me. Not sure how fast you learn stuffs, but feel free to learn at your own pacing.",

I am very new to programing but find that I learn twice or three times as fast on YouTube than I would on some course platform, even on the interactive ones . And it's also more practical as you feel you have a personal tutor (which is the best way to learn imo).I'll check out the channels you included, thanks for sharing them.",

Those two channels I mentioned always explains what the syntax does and not just \"yeah that is the function you need to do this\". Sometimes Traversy Media also plugs other tutorials from other channels which would give you plenty of resources to learn from as well. When I learned Django (Python web dev framework) from his channel, I just found it was a tutorial from another channel (Dennis Ivy).",

All major programming languages including but not limited to C/C++, C#, Python, Rust, Go are good languages that are used for all kinds of applications and purposes. Sometimes it is only a matter of preference to choose a language to focus on. Also you don't have to learn only one language, in fact many major applications use multiple languages or packages from other languages. For example Electrum is written in Python and it uses the cryptography library written in C. Or bitcoin core is written in C++ yet it uses Python for some of its tests.I personally started with C# because I had a tiny bit of background in Visual Basic and Pascal from years before and I liked the style of it.",

      "body": "If you are a beginner, of course it takes more effort to learn it from scratch. But if you are serious and want to explore programming languages, then my advice is to start with the C++ programming language. The C++ programming language is often called a \"low level language\" which gives programmers great control in how to run code and manage resources. C++ has advantages in terms of speed, efficiency and safety, so it is widely used in “performance critical” applications such as computer graphics, games, and hardware that has few resources, including if you want to optimize Transaction Per Second (TpS) or blockchain speed. . But giving the programmer great control also means it's not the easiest programming language to master.and read more references on google about how you can master it correctly and quickly. it takes effort and hard work.",
