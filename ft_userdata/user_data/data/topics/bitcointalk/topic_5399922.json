If at that time I give you a 1DaveF address to pay me and it goes to binance it's pretty much a given that it was me who got the funds at the 1DaveF address. That was the point I was making. If you post an address in public it's one thing. Using similar vanity addresses does (IMO) chip away at privacy.Since this is not the main point of this thread if we want to keep talking about it, we should probably start another one discussing this.-Dave",
