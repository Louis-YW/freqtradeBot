  "content": "As far as I know, Binance proper is not allowed to operate in the US, so they licensed a third party to run Binance.us for them in that country.Also, Binance API seems to be inaccessible from USA IP addresses.This raises an important question when doing KYC. Binance just asks for your passport & selfie and some address data. What would they do when they see a US passport but with foreign country address? Will they request for a proof of address like a bank statement, or deny your application altogether? Has anyone here tried this?",

All I can say is that while trying to create a new account I contacted Binance.US support and this is what they told me:Question: \"So just to clarify.... Binance.US won’t do business with US citizens living anywhere outside the USA. And Binance.COM won’t do business with US citizens anywhere. I just want to be sure my understanding is correct. Thanks.\"Answer: \"Right, that is correct.\"Worst case scenario you will have a few days (14) to liquidate your positions and leave the exchange for the .US branch.",

If you live there they want you to give them your drivers license - now you must know how to drive a car to trade on Coinbase   If you don't live there then... you're screwed according to their FAQ (but they will report you to the IRS anyway, just because).",
