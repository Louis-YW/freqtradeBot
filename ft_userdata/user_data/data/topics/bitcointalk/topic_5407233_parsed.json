I had no luck in finding a way to \"exclude it\", but perhaps the solution to the above errors is in the following lines: 196 to 263",

      "body": "You could also roll back to a cgminer version older than the U3, or try to build with an Icarus driver older than the U3. The icarus driver which handles most USB miners from then uses pretty simple logic to tell one from another; along the lines of \"oh, XXX is the USB chip? Well send this data and see what comes back. Oh YYY is the return string? Eh, probably ZZZ miner.\" Not sure I've seen a U2 detect as a U3 before, but it's not unbelievable. U2 has 1x S1 chip, U3 has 4x S3 chips. We based the early Compac (1x S5 chip) driver on the U3 portion of icarus because it detected as a U3 by default also.",
