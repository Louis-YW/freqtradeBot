  "content": "I have been watching my friend very closely; he was very impatient with trading. And this impermanence keeps him at a loss most of the time, which is really very frustrating and sad for him. Because he spends his entire salary on trading, which over time earns him (supposedly 0.001) cents.   Not that he didn't know much about trading, but his elusiveness was the reason for his remoteness.Seeing my friend's behavior like this used to make me feel a lot of fear and annoyance towards trading or cryptocurrency.My reluctance to trade developed even though I had not started trading then. Again, I had no idea about crypto world.But I made this mistake after joining the community. There are frequent posts about trading on the \"Trading Discussion\" board in the forum, which is indeed very useful.From here, I can learn how to be patient while trading, control my greed, not spend all my money on trading or cryptocurrencies, and start trading with money that I can't afford to lose.Although I still have a lot to know and learn, I tried to teach and explain to my friend what I learned from here on how to be patient while keeping your greed in check in the world of cryptocurrency. and how important it is to be patient on this platform. But he avoided these words of mine with much mockery and showed reluctance, which greatly insulted and pained me.But a few days ago, he came to me on his own to learn about cryptocurrency and trading, which was a complete surprise for me.What's even more surprising is that he is now a registered member of the community. And l also read several posts on the forum saying that he is now much better than before, patiently trying to work on crypto, which I'm really glad to hear.",

Its never been easy in the first place but once you do have that good grasps into it then its a skill that cant really be taken from you on which you could be able to trade on your own and this is something that cant really be taken from you.It does really take up so much time and tons of effort and your friend should realize that this isnt something that could be be able to learn up on a very short span of time. This is why it would really be better you shouldnt really be rushing yourself.Just tell your buddy that he should be taking up some time or else he wont really be able to progress because he's rushing up on making money on which it is true that it could be possible or could happenbut we know that it isnt something that could be achieved in a short time. Time will tell and it would be depending on how fast you would really be able to make yourself learn.",

And as long as quitting was never their option, there are always high chances for them to end up making successful and profitable trades.The only time a person can be a failure is when he falls and does not rise again.Trading is very risky and most of the losses newbies incur are for the experimental purposes of gaining more experience about it. The friend of OP can only be a complete failure in trading if he gives up, many do this because they are tired of losing and I can't blame them. That might not be their calling at the same time, because if trading is their calling, no matter what they lose, they will keep on having the passion for it and finding better ways to gain from it, and not backing out due to losses, just like I did. My advice to those who are very new to the market is to make sure that they do not trade with a big amount of money unless they are well experienced, I don't think it's wise to do otherwise.Trading is such that will help people only when they understand it fully, and to understand it takes time even when you have been trading the live account, it doesn't matter. This is why wisdom must be applied in this sense and by using a small amount of money, you would have saved yourself from a whole lot of issues like resources wastage, emotion and discouragement. If a little money is involved, such a person could take his time to learn and train until a good system, management and psychology that can handle big money is achieved. I wonder what the fate of those who use big money to test their trading skills would be, just like me then, it's a huge discouragement and regret.",

As a trader, having a well-defined take-profit plan before entering a trade will mitigate impulsive and greedy decisions. You don't need to prove yourself to anyone in the trading community. Your sole focus should be on your personal goals as well as your emotional needs. Fixing these will automatically resolve an urge for revenge trading because you are trying to make up for previous mistakes.",

Dont make yourself in a rush because this is where people usually commit out mistakeson the time that they are expecting or anticipating something which is positive without even trying to look and realize on how things do works and how it do behaves.

Even into those old traders out thereon which there's still moments or times that they dont really know on what to do specially on the time that the price or movement of the market is way too volatile and unpredictable or simply making up those huge swings in price on which it would really be making up those kind of questions whether they should invest or get in or not and similar kind of questions on which this do proves out that learning process would really be endless considering this market does have lots of variations for you to learn on.Trading does really need a long time for you to learn it, just like on what others been saying that it would be always best that you shouldn't really be rushing up on learning itbecause it would really be making that kind of desperate on which it could cause bad decisions and approach towards trading which its never been that good.",

Because he spends his entire salary on trading, which over time earns him (supposedly 0.001) cents.  Trading is not something you can just start without having basic knowledge, you will end up wasting money. Since your friend really wants to learn about trading, they should just look for someone who understands trading and they can just put your friend through it. I think that’s the easiest way to learn how to trade. Your friend will find it difficult to learn all those things on YouTube. I don’t trust most YouTube videos. It's just better you get someone physical to teach you. If you can also read books and learn, it won’t be bad, but your friend is still going to waste more money.Quote from: Alana Arden on December 03, 2023, 05:41:49 PMSeeing my friend's behavior like this used to make me feel a lot of fear and annoyance towards trading or cryptocurrency.My reluctance to trade developed even though I had not started trading then. Again, I had no idea about crypto world.When you are learning how to trade, you should keep in mind that you are going to waste money. Trading is not something you can learn without losing, if you start trading, loss will definitely set in. Even professional traders do lose when trading, just that their profit is always more than their loss. So just imagine you trying to learn how to trade, you will be losing more in the process of learning, but with time, your loss will reduce.",

I get that it may not be too simple, but it should be something that will benefit everyone if you just slowly and gradually ease yourself into it. I guess the easiest way to do it would be using a demo account maybe? Just read up on how to trade, FA and TA and while learning those, use what you learned at some demo account, its fake money but the real market is there, so you see how what you learned would work in real life, but not risk any money.
