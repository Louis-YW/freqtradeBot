I think this would help you alot in developing your business and building a better business relationship with your clients globally as your capacity can sustain. I had to go through the link provided by you and I must say that your designs are unique. You are an expert at your field and you got some good designs to start with.I will suggest you also put some of the the design here for easy view because that is the output of what you have uploaded here for viewing. When people see the machine and they see the output, there would be some level of confidence they would have in your capacity and capability to deliver if you are being contacted for job.",

Feedback, positive or negative, is very important to know if you are going in the right direction with anything.I like your perspective and orientation about review and taking into account others opinion. This many people do not really understand. If one listen and does this, it shows that they are good at wanting to develop their capacity in building more and in learning more about their  strength.All feedbacks, reviews are good for the growth of every individual and organisations as the case may be. Only those that are willing to grow and develop accept their flaws and lapses to work on them.",
