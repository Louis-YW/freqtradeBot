We don't know who Satoshi really is, but the person who communicated using that pseudonym does not work for the government, neither does your 'experts' have any more knowledge than we do here.",

Since he tells you Satoshi wasn't the brain behind BTC, shouldn't he have at least pointed you to who he knows? Relating the origin of BTC to any government is a total joke caus no government would want to create a decentralized system that's going to ever stand independent of her control and then come back to try to control it at this time that it's already late. The USA and any other nation that has shifted her interest to BTC at this point have only done that because they've seen it as the next big thing and want to jump on it as fast as possible.It would have made more sense if you're mentioning names of those that are fully holder Bitcoin as the creators of Bitcoin and not someone that is still planning to hold BTC but hasn't put it to action yet.",

We all don't know if who really created BTC and many of us can agree that its real name may not be Satoshi.Some even says that it was only like a codename but since it was the name of the smaller units of Bitcoin, people only use this temporarily to at least gave a name to the ones who created it. I don't think BTC is from the governments because why it will have a decentralized nature then, when we know that it can only be against to them, though they might have created it to be used for their illegal doings. I am not sure if BTC originated on those American countries you have listed there because to me, I think it originated in Asian countries like for example Japan, China, or Singapore.Trump and others who are now rumoured to get involved in Bitcoin are not like that before but the main reason that people are seeing right now is because the Election is now close and they think that using Bitcoin is a good idea to gain more supporters. Despite these facts, some things are still not clear and still remains as a mystery for quite some time, unless maybe if the true founder have showed up and shed a light to all of us.",

The thing is, it's not substantiated by any evidence, and it doesn't quite make sense, as Bitcoin is open-source, so we know there are no FBI backdoors there or whatever. Moreover, in the US, Bitcoin is often seen as something that undermines the USD and its role in domestic and international trade. So I don't think the US would work on something to undermine themselves.In any case, of course people are free to believe what they want to believe, but ultimately, what matters is that Bitcoin is a very transparent and empowering technology, no matter who created it.",
