  "content": "Within a few years, a younger generation of financial services customers is going to be able to walk into a bank and gain access to credit products, savings accounts, and investments that can host both cryptocurrency and fiat purchases. The inroads that will permit all of this to happen are already smashing the ground....Clients will soon clarify a “full assistance” bank as one that proposes economic services in both crypto and fiat. The period to start cultivating the essential devices for the crypto banking trade is right now. Banks need to start adapting or get left behind. Make no mistake about it.\"Article: Crypto banks are going to swallow fiat banks in 3 years — or even lessWhat do you think about this topic, whether cryptocurrency banks can face off and soon replace traditional banks in the fate? I think this is tricky to occur because the current number of crypto banks is very tolerable described to the number of traditional banks. Even in the most optimistic scenario possible, if banks around the globe implement an efficient method of transaction (maybe Ripple), they will only accept stable coin rotation or CBDC to be able to Compliance with the monetary regulations of governments.",

Banks that utilize a business plan that successfully incorporates smart-contracts for a decentralized experience are definitely possible and are probably the way of a viable crypto banking future. We are on the way there already with DeFi but definitely no where near the finish line. I think you are thinking crypto banking in the traditional sense.

The company Celsius was supposed to work as a bank, but it scammed customers, so people just don't trust it anymore.There is still Nexo, Crypto.com and few other alternatives, however investors don't see it in the same manner anymore. People want guarantees they will deposit their money on those companies and will be able to retrieve it anytime. Unfortunatelly those guarantees don't exist.On the other hand, the government of my country guarantees banks have to retrieve funds back to customers up to 48,000$ per ID. So, as long as you have that sum in your account, you will be safe. However, these traditional institutions aren't going to adopt decentralized cryptocurrencies, just CBDC.",

But the beauty of these services would only be if it supports the decentralization goal of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently popular among youths but a larger number of the global population are not yet aware of this unique cryptocurrency. Most of them are only conversant with fiat and are very comfortable using it. There are other issues such as lack of infrastructure, illiteracy and unfavorable government policies that would continue to hinder the progress of Bitcoin in some countries. The bottom line is that fiat and cryptocurrency would keep existing side by side until majority of the world's population understands the importance of Bitcoin.",

Crypto exchanges are enough for the network, people should use them to trade their crypto, and they should use self custody wallets to hold their funds, engaging more services in the network would only confuse people the more and make them make mistakes as to how crypto should be used.",

The main idea of the article is that young generation will probably not be interested to deal with the banks that don't offer crypto services too. It is logical because young generation is more techy and more friendly towards it compared to the older generation that most likely prefers to stick with the old methods. I agree with this statement but there is no way that Kraken and similar \"banks\" will ever be able to swallow traditional giant fiat banks. When the time comes and the major banks sense that there is a time to implement crypto, they'll just do it and Voilà, everything will be alright.",

That's true, as long as those regular people are doing fine, living in their bubble. Canadians who went on to protest against lockdowns and covid restrictions also thought about themselves as regular people and then they started to get scammed from all sides.
