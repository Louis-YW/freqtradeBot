  "content": "GM Crypto fam. I was doing some research regarding BTC mining and I came across this article:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/10/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-surges-to-all-time-high-putting-additional-squeeze-on-miners/I figured that it's best to get the input from BTC mining community. So, my question is, given the electricity costs and the current revenue in the field - do you still think that it's worth mining BTC or would you shift your efforts towards another coin?",

If they have access to cheap electricity, can afford to mine at loss for a while, etc, then they'll keep mining BTC. If they don't then the most logical decision would be to stop mining or use their rig for another purpose.",

Thank you for your input joni, much appreciated. I was just interested in hearing other peoples opinion on the subject, assuming most people here know what they're talking about.",

      "body": "To still decide mining bitcoin in the current situation will now depend on how much you love, and how dedicated you are to bitcoin. Many miners will quit and start mining another for ease, but if you follow suit, what happens when mining that coin becomes difficult as well, will you jump to another coin and keep jumping, ask yourself?Â  You can decide to pause your mining activity now due to difficulty if it is becoming more than you can handle, but don't stop mining bitcoins, pause to continue.",
