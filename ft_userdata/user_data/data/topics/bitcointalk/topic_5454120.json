  "content": "25.0 Release NotesBitcoin Core version 25.0 is now available from:https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performanceimprovements, as well as updated translations.Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issuesTo receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/How to UpgradeIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run theinstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL ispossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Oldwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.CompatibilityBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systemsusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  BitcoinCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not asfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core onunsupported systems.Notable changesP2P and network changesTransactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above are now allowed by mempooland relay policy. This is to better reflect the actual afforded protectionsagainst CVE-2017-12842 and open up additional use-cases of smaller transaction sizes. (#26265)New RPCsThe scanblocks RPC returns the relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors byscanning all blockfilters in the given range. It can be used in combination withthe getblockheader and rescanblockchain RPCs to achieve fast wallet rescans. Notethat this functionality can only be used if a compact block filter index(-blockfilterindex=1) has been constructed by the node. (#23549)Updated RPCsAll JSON-RPC methods accept a new namedparameter called args that cancontain positional parameter values. This is a convenience to allow someparameter values to be passed by name without having to name every value. Thepython test framework and bitcoin-cli tool both take advantage of this, sofor example:bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=mywallet load_on_startup=1Can now be shortened to:bitcoin-cli -named createwallet mywallet load_on_startup=1The verifychain RPC will now return false if the checks didn't fail,but couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level. This could be dueto missing data while pruning, due to an insufficient dbcache or due tothe node being shutdown before the call could finish. (#25574)sendrawtransaction has a new, optional argument, maxburnamount with a default value of 0.Any transaction containing an unspendable output with a value greater than maxburnamount willnot be submitted. At present, the outputs deemed unspendable are those with scripts that beginwith an OP_RETURN code (known as 'datacarriers'), scripts that exceed the maximum script size,and scripts that contain invalid opcodes.The testmempoolaccept RPC now returns 2 additional results within the \"fees\" result:\"effective-feerate\" is the feerate including fees and sizes of transactions validated together ifpackage validation was used, and also includes any modified fees from prioritisetransaction. The\"effective-includes\" result lists the wtxids of transactions whose modified fees and sizes were usedin the effective-feerate (#26646).decodescript may now infer a Miniscript descriptor under P2WSH context if it is not lackinginformation. (#27037)finalizepsbt is now able to finalize a transaction with inputs spending Miniscript-compatibleP2WSH scripts. (#24149)Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.Build SystemThe --enable-upnp-default and --enable-natpmp-default optionshave been removed. If you want to use port mapping, you canconfigure it using a .conf file, or by passing the relevantoptions at runtime. (#26896)Updated settingsIf the -checkblocks or -checklevel options are explicitly provided by theuser, but the verification checks cannot be completed due to an insufficientdbcache, Bitcoin Core will now return an error at startup. (#25574)Ports specified in -port and -rpcport options are now validated at startup.Values that previously worked and were considered valid can now result in errors. (#22087)Setting -blocksonly will now reduce the maximum mempool memoryto 5MB (users may still use -maxmempool to override). Previously,the default 300MB would be used, leading to unexpected memory usagefor users running with -blocksonly expecting it to eliminatemempool memory usage.As unused mempool memory is shared with dbcache, this also reducesthe dbcache size for users running with -blocksonly, potentiallyimpacting performance.Setting -maxconnections=0 will now disable -dnsseedand -listen (users may still set them to override).Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.New settingsThe shutdownnotify option is used to specify a command to execute synchronouslybefore Bitcoin Core has begun its shutdown sequence. (#23395)WalletThe minconf option, which allows a user to specify the minimum numberof confirmations a UTXO being spent has, and the maxconf option,which allows specifying the maximum number of confirmations, have beenadded to the following RPCs in #25375:fundrawtransactionsendwalletcreatefundedpsbtsendallAdded a new next_index field in the response in listdescriptors tohave the same format as importdescriptors (#26194)RPC listunspent now has a new argument include_immature_coinbaseto include coinbase UTXOs that don't meet the minimum spendabilitydepth requirement (which before were silently skipped). (#25730)Rescans for descriptor wallets are now significantly faster if compactblock filters (BIP158) are available. Since those are not constructedby default, the configuration option \"-blockfilterindex=1\" has to beprovided to take advantage of the optimization. This improves theperformance of the RPC calls rescanblockchain, importdescriptorsand restorewallet. (#25957)RPC unloadwallet now fails if a rescan is in progress. (#26618)Wallet passphrases may now contain null characters.Prior to this change, only characters up to the firstnull character were recognized and accepted. (#27068)Address Purposes strings are now restricted to the currently known values of \"send\",\"receive\", and \"refund\". Wallets that have unrecognized purpose strings will haveloading warnings, and the listlabels RPC will raise an error if an unrecognized purposeis requested. (#27217)In the createwallet, loadwallet, unloadwallet, and restorewallet RPCs, the\"warning\" string field is deprecated in favor of a \"warnings\" field thatreturns a JSON array of strings to better handle multiple warning messages andfor consistency with other wallet RPCs. The \"warning\" field will be fullyremoved from these RPCs in v26. It can be temporarily re-enabled during thedeprecation period by launching bitcoind with the configuration option-deprecatedrpc=walletwarningfield. (#27279)Descriptor wallets can now spend coins sent to P2WSH Miniscript descriptors. (#24149)GUI changesThe \"Mask values\" is a persistent option now. (gui#701)The \"Mask values\" option affects the \"Transaction\" view now, in addition to the\"Overview\" one. (gui#708)RESTA new /rest/deploymentinfo endpoint has been added for fetching variousstate info regarding deployments of consensus changes. (#25412)Binary verificationThe binary verification script has been updated. In previous releases itwould verify that the binaries had been signed with a single \"release key\".In this release and moving forward it will verify that the binaries aresigned by a threshold of trusted keys. For more details andexamples, see:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/verify-binaries/README.md(#27358)Low-level changesRPCThe JSON-RPC server now rejects requests where a parameter is specified multipletimes with the same name, instead of silently overwriting earlier parameter valueswith later ones. (#26628)RPC listsinceblock now accepts an optional label argumentto fetch incoming transactions having the specified label. (#25934)Previously setban, addpeeraddress, walletcreatefundedpsbt, methodsallowed non-boolean and non-null values to be passed as boolean parameters.Any string, number, array, or object value that was passed would be treatedas false. After this change, passing any value except true, false, ornull now triggers a JSON value is not of expected type error.

You don't need to store the whole blockchain, all you need is the chainstate (ie. the UTXO database) so you can prune the chain. But you still need to download and verify all blocks to build the chainstate before you can discard the old ones in the process called pruning.",

Or do I add the rpc server info to the bitcoin.conf?Why nothing opened after you clicked in the GUI is not obvious to me, but it depends on too many not provided details.In the bitcoin.conf file you can have sections specific to Mainnet and Testnet, e.g.Code:# Options only for mainnet[main]...# Options only for testnet[test]#dbcache=2000#blocksonly=1maxuploadtarget=0# Indexestxindex=1blockfilterindex=1coinstatsindex=1# Network#listen=1listenonion=1proxy=127.0.0.1:9050bind=127.0.0.1onlynet=onion# Connections#rpcuser=...#rpcpassword=...port=18333rpcport=18332rpcbind=127.0.0.1rpcallowip=127.0.0.1# Options only for Regtest[regtest]# Options only for Signet[signet]This way you can keep the configuration all in one file and location and the appropriate options are read with whatever net you fire up your bitcoind or GUI.I would recommend to use the Bitcoin Core Config Generator by Jameson Lopp: https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/Github sources: https://github.com/jlopp/bitcoin-core-config-generator",

      "body": "Thanks guys. I was able to configure the bitcoin.conf to testnet and now the Bitcoin Core is running on testnet with the green logo. I did insert some rpc info like user/pw ports etc. I opened those ports. Does anyone have any info on how to set up a testnet pool to connect your miner to it? Thanks for your response. I also found another option to run a bitcoin full node via bitnodes. They have a one line command that you can run on your VPS or something. I just haven't figured out how to configure that one to testnet. I kept getting errors on it.",

But if it was easy to find, I would've found it. There's a difference between finding some out of date information that put you in the kinda right direction vs. actually finding the answer to your problem. In reality, there are not that many people in the world who mine mainnet bitcoin. So finding people who mine testnet bitcoin is even smaller than a needle in a haystack. I understand the the discussion is getting off topic. Ending it here. Thanks again for your reponse.",
