  "content": "With the problem of high fees and long transaction confirmation time faced in the Bitcoin network which is always associated with price rise, which is most evident during bull run season as seen during the 2021 bull market, quite a large number of Bitcoin users are now diving into the adoption of Bitcoin lighting network a layer 2 network on the Bitcoin blockchain that offers cheaper transaction fees and faster transaction confirmation time. This growth in the adoption of lighting network has resulted in an increase in the lighting network capacity from 1000 Bitcoin in a transaction in 2021 to up to 3600 Bitcoin in transactions in the LN, this increase has made many wonders as to how and where the layer 2 networks on the native Bitcoin blockchain network will work to harmonize it balance operation interacting an unchain network with the original Bitcoin network. This new processing capacity will eventually give birth to more network demands on the unchain network that has promised to provide a better alternative to the Bitcoin network.The chart below shows the growth of Bitcoin lighting networkSuch: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lightning-network-capacity-reaches-new-ath/",

So bitcoin on-chain fee is not high, only exchanges and some custodial wallet with high fee are making people to have such high fee misconception. But you are not wrong about lightning network, the fee is cheaper and the transaction is faster.",

Now that they see the usefulness of the lightning network, I'm sure there will be some new improvements and adaptations for it in order to work well in the future.",

It appears that you might have misunderstood network capacity. Similar to much of Ethereum's layer 2 platforms, Lightning's network capacity is also the same to the total value locked in Arbitrum or Optimism. I might be wrong, however, I am quite certain it cannot be 3600 bitcoins in a transaction.In any case, this news is good for bitcoin holders. We should hope that there will be smart contract functionality in Lightning's development roadmap.",

It's probably a better assumption to make but the lightning network might be similar to segwit in thst it takes a while to adopt (if it does see network wide adoption - segwit had the same uncertainty).(afaik lower fees and emptier blocks make the lightning network more secure).",

Just send BTC ones and you are good to go for LN transactions. No more running your own node or jumping though hoops to connect to another node. I think that helps people use it. I know I have said it about other things but for a large part here on the forum we are more willing to play around and run our own things and do whatever to use stuff.That is not the rest of the world, they for the most part don't care how it works, don't want to know how it works, they just want it to work. Now that more and more LN does that I see more people getting into it.-Dave",

While that is inconvenient if one wants to buy food in the supermarket or a cup of coffee, it is good enough for online purchases which don't require immediate payment processing. So it's good that the Lightning Network is getting more popular, but I am not sure it's needed in many cases.",

The fees are literally tiny, the transaction speed is pretty good. Usually it gets transacted real fast, it takes around 10 minutes for any transaction that I do these  days. This is also true for the transaction which are done on the high timings. So definitely I see no point in switching to bitcoin lightening network. Can I understand why there are peeps who has high fees and higher timings for transfer? Is it associated with higher transaction block?",

Confirmation takes around 5-10 minutes and costs a couple of dollars, from my experience. thats the thing though..american/EU developers dont care about fee's because their experience is based on the northern/western hemisphere pricing of fiat goods.. and so they are not really in the mindset to push for code changes to employe a good fee formulae in bitcoin to reduce fee's further.however lets take africans.. that 'couple dollars' you experience as being just a coffee or 6 minutes of minimum wage labour, thus not a problem..for you!... but is infact 5 HOURS (a few days groceries) FOR A BILLION PEOPLE in africaso while you think bitcoin is good for americans to still get their weekly wage and still have 99.9% left over to spend.. in africa. its like a spending a third of their weekly wage just to receive their wage.same goes for LNlets use your experience by translating what an african perceives into western experienceimagine if fiat cost a third of a weeks salary just to transfer money to someone else. whereby paypal was utopian dream offering a payment system that can offer it at cheaper then a slice of bread. but here is the issue. to use paypal you need to set up about 3 paypal accounts which cost 3x the third of a week wage to set up 3 acounts(a whole weeks wage wasted. where by you also then need to put in 3 months of your wage into those accounts just to have a semi guaranteed assurance that atleast one account will have a route to a destination you want to use a months worth of salary to buy your monthly living expenses with. and then to settle up at the end of the month is another weeks wage wasted to close the paypal accounts.yep Ln requires roughly 3 channels to have plausible amount of routing options to reach the majority of Ln nodes. meaning locking up funds in those 3 channels. meaning having enough value in each to possible pay people. which you have to have all pre-planned and pre set up for the month long lock.. enjoy the thought from the prospective of the \"unbanked\" population of billions of people.. they wont want to have to lock up multiple months of value for cheap fee's to use paypal(aka LN). and pay 3 fee's just to set up the arrangement with another 3 fee's to settle the arrangements next month.nor are they liking the normal payment system (analogy: wire transfer aka bitcoin payment) of being high too.the solution which helps both would be to have bitcoin fee's being less.. but then people would still need to think about are they doing more then X payments a month to warrant preplanning spending habits and locking up large chunks of value to use a cheaper network fee for regular/multiple payments above the X per month thresholdso people will still be questioning the utility of LN if they are not doing more then 6 payments a month using crypto",

I do really have wonder why many services implemented it like it's a revolutionary step toward the crypto innovation like twitter and many exchange platforms .",
