      "body": "Quote from: from OP linkWhen Daily Sun called to confirm from sources at the apex bank and traders, there was no response. However, official confirmation will have to come later in the day when data from the FMDQ is available.Daily Sun also understands official confirmation will be issued by the CBN.Which means this has not been confirmed yet. I have seen these all over the news. Quote from: from OP linkReports reaching Daily Sun indicate that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has given commercial banks and dealers in the forex market the green light to sell FX freely at a market-determined rate.If true that CBN influence on Investors and Exporters rate has been removed, and individual can decide what the price would be, I think this will later be like parallel market. I mean the I&E rate will become close in price with the parallel market price. I may be wrong, according to the news:Quote from: from OP linkFor instance, for a buyer of the US dollar and the seller of the dollar in the I&E window, this will have an impact on the parallel markets which might be obliterated if Nigeria eventually has a free exchange rate which will be determined by participants.Or maybe it means that the I&E price will be similar to parallel market price to the extent the parallel market rate will no longer exist, or people using it will significantly decrease.But let us still consider this news not to be valid yet until there is official confirmation about it that it is true.",

But if the FG approve di use forex trading by banks then later run they might accept Cryptocurrency in the banks. But as Charles-Tim said the news not yet verify and confirmed so the blogger published the news without the prior notice of the original Source. But I still believe that there is elements of truth from the news. And let us wait and hear from other sources because if really forex has been approved then there is probability of approving crypto.",

      "body": "Well, I can't really say for sure that there was any valid reason for the CBN to ban crypto in Nigeria, but since they say it was being used to commit fraud, I don't think they will unban it unless they feel they have a better way to regulate it and reduce the possibility of it not being used illegally, which is very impossible. In my opinion, I think they allow the trading of FOREX in commercial banks because it is not the same thing as cryptocurrency. FOREX is mainly on foreign currencies of other countries, like NGN/USD, EUR/USD, and JPY/NGN. I see a big difference between those two types of trading (cryptocurrency and FOREX). But well, let's see how it goes.",

All these signings by the president should not choke us o, because it looks like we would soon have an economic progression with huge funds passing under our very nose",

A unified exchange market means that the dollar which is the major currency for exchange will have it pegged to the Naira in a free market and the government will no longer fix the naira vs dollars exchange rate the market forces will determine how much the exchange rate will be.",

While Crypto on the other hand was just a new innovation which the government feared simply because they had no control over it and as such thought allowing it's citizens to use was a risk, But however, if eventually CBN now tell banks to start executing Bitcoin transactions, then such will be a welcome development to us all here on this forum and the entire Nigerian crypto community at large. Which is what we hope for very soon.",

The government might approve the use of cryptocurrency soon too but that’ll not depend on how they treat forex trading in the banks or dependent on its acceptance before bitcoin can be accepted. The new government might have interest in bitcoin but it is very certain that if the acceptance will come it’ll definitely come with regulations. I hope when the time comes for we all to be able to trade bitcoin freely in the country, the regulations won’t affect our dominance in crypto already.",
