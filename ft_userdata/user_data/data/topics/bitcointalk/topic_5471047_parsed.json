We all know that we can see the last reply in front of the topic and the time of the last reply as well in front of topic.  We have to open the thread to know about the date of a topic when it was posted on BTT. what you guys say if we wil be able to see this \"Time of creation of the topic\" along with the last reply section it will be ease for us to know the time of creation of the topic without opening the thread. we need not to open any particular thread jsut to know its creation date. Many thanks!Note: it is just a suggesstion.Like, i mean to say there can be a section of date of post after the line which i draw in the picture.-Snowpega-",

Just seeing the last comment date, it's enough to tell me that the topic is still very active and discussions are still going on there, so it's left for me to open it, and beside that, I will definitely have to read the thread and know what's in it so the date of creation will be seen. What matters is the content of the thread. Carrie's date of creation is really not that important; if we care so much to see it, then we can just don't be too lazy and take a bold step to click and confirm for ourselves if it gives us too much concern.",

To do so, just add \";sort=first_post\" at the end if the URL.To sort topic into descending order, add \"first_post;desc\" at the end of URL. For example, you can sort the topics posted in Meta into their creation time using the following URLs.Ascending order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0;sort=first_postDescending order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0;sort=first_post;descI hope this helps you.

That has been how I use to do it and I like it like that. I do not see any good reason the creation date of a topic should be beside the topic becuase all it takes for you to know the creation date of a topic is a single click on the topic link.The only suggestion I have that has not be done is to add report link to every post of a person in his or her post history page.",

When I was new here, I also came to get this thought, and I wondered: what benefit would it be to us to know the dates of the last poster on this topic? It would be great to know that when the topic was created, we could easily tell that it was old and must be out of date, like some news about exchanges or BTC. This might be saying that BTC breaks $30k while the news is old and we might take it for another (due to the date issue).I know this is not a big issue; anyone can confirm that topic by opening it, but that's in the second place, while this issue can be solved in the first place if a topic creation date is to be written in front of the topic.Overall, no doubt, if this is implemented, then it's a good thing. I hope they or other admins will look into it, but I also know that upgrading these types takes some time, so let's see if in the future a creation column will be added or not.",

And I doubt if any of the links that hosseinimr93 has provided can do that.Because the first post at the end of the URL will show the first posts/topics made on some board like that link showed all the first topics made on the meta board, it did not show the topics with their topic creation date, so we have to go pages to pages there and can easily find the page we want to see. But that second link will definitely do the work and it is really awesome to test it out. I will remember this code and might write it down somewhere, thanks for that descending order code.  But still, it would be great to get a category in that place OP has marked.",

But I think the most important application of your suggestion is to prevent bumping older threads and there is a mechanism to check that. If you are about to post in an old thread you would definitely be notified that the thread is more than 120 days old and as such you should consider starting a new topic.Secondly, when conversations start flowing in a thread, the emphasis is no more on the Op rather on the successive posts on the thread. So, the date of the most recent reply is more important than the date of the Op and this just helps much in sorting of the posts.",
