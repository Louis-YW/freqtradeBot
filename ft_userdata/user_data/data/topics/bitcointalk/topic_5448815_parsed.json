The driver will give you an envelope containing a mobile phone and a pack of play money.2. The cell phone will have limited functionality. It will have only one application installed, which will have the following menu sections:2.1. Story completion percentage. At the very beginning there will be 0%.2.2. Remaining time to complete the story. The countdown will begin only after the start of the plot, in the first game location.2.3. Next task(s). At the very beginning, there will most likely be your point of departure from the country (airport, port, train station).2.4. Location map. Game points will be indicated on the map. These will be bars, vehicle rentals, sales of equipment, game weapons, locations with riddles or extreme tasks. All these locations will be ordinary, accessible to everyone, but only for you there will be actors with whom you have to interact to complete the story.2.5. Help of a personal assistant. These can be questions about the passage of the plot, or problems associated with errors on our part.2.6. Health care. Doctors will work at each location.2.7. Help of the security service. At each location, a security service will work imperceptibly.2.8. The number of tokens you will receive after completing the story. Yes, if you successfully complete all the tasks, you will be able to return part of the funds spent on the plot. At the very beginning, there will be 20-50% of the amount that you pay for the plot. How can you lose them? Very simple:- did not complete the current task on time- Asked the help of an assistant in completing assignments- you were \"killed\" in armed conflicts- you \"died\" during the passage of extreme locations- did not solve the riddle for a certain number of attempts3. All major tickets and visas for moving between countries will be issued in advance so that you do not waste time on this.4. After you arrive in the first country of the story, a countdown starts in the app. The game has begun!Why invest in Heroic Adventures?We are creating a project that will work entirely in the real world, with real people, real estate, but in order to participate in it, the client will need tokens of our company.Distribution of funds.Before the appearance of the first clients, funds for the development of the project will be taken from the funds collected during the crowdsale. 10-50% of the funds will be set aside for a future liquidity pool.From each sold adventure, 10-30% of the funds will remain in tokens. 3-10% will be spent on marketing. The rest of the funds will be used to pay salaries to employees, expenses at locations, and taxes.Tokens of early investors and participants who received coins through airdrop will be locked for 6 months, after IDO(ICO). Further, every month 7% will be unlocked.Team tokens will be locked for 12 months after the IDO(ICO).

The more complex the story request, the more expensive it will cost. This makes sense. At first, we expect orders where only a slight modification of existing real locations will be required, with actors, adding mysteries and extreme events.2. The customer will be interested in the availability of tokens, because if the story is successful, he will be reimbursed in tokens. If the story will be bought exclusively for fiat, we will buy the necessary part of tokens from the market ourselves.",

Have you considered and think thoroughly the very possible scenario that will happen with your current proposal? Let's assume a client take an average scene, not too complex but not simple either, that put us on a 1,000,000 USD. I imagine your client --or you, if the client prefers to do fiat-- will buy 1M worth of token the close to the day they're about to sign a deal with you, and then when he managed to clear the story and got reimbursed, he'll liquidate the token back to fiat. Other than this scenario, the token will remains stagnant as there's no reason to hold your token if someone doesn't plan on buying a scenario --with MOC 10,000 USD-- Imagine the price fluctuation happened upon every contract signed.",

If someone wants to buy an adventure for $1000000, that won't be a problem.The main purpose of creating the token is to provide additional funds for project development. A secondary goal is to draw a nice equity graph. Investors will understand what the token is for.For traders I can only advise to calculate the mathematical expectation of cryptocurrency trading, taking into account all the costs of commissions, spreads and funds transfers.",
