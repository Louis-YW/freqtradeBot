  "content": "Hello,Recently I've bought a new Laptop (windows11professional) that came pre-installed with McAfee antivirus.I spent some time reading reviews online and decided I want to use Windows Defender instead. https://allthings.how/how-to-disable-or-uninstall-mcafee-on-windows-11/#:~:text=Now%20it%20is%20definitely%20better,imperative%20to%20uninstall%20McAfee%20antivirus.https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-uninstall-mcafee-on-windows-11-5-ways/To uninstall it I will use info from these two guides. However I still have some questions they haven't clearly or completely addressed.1. Should I turn off all McAfee services prior to uninstalling? 2. Should I set Windows Defender as the default AV before doing #1? 3. Should I be doing #1 or #2 or both online or offline?4. Will Windows Defender and Firewall automatically take over the tasks or do I need to do something?Those are the main ones for now.And also I would like to know if there is any Win11Pro Antivirus you would recommendthat most importantly can be purchased by Crypto or even Skrill/Neteller and preferably has a one-time lifetime payment option.I find that using credit cards online is super susceptible to fraud and am baffled as to whyany of these major companies don't have more payment options.I guess because they cant push auto-renewal on those.Thank You in advance for all your future help.",

      "body": "I think I will turn on Windows defender first then turn-off/Uninstal McAfee antivirus & its services, assuming having both Windows defender & McAfee anti-virus running at thesame time isn't going to cause any conflict. Otherwise I would turn-off/uninstal McAfee anti-virus service and turn on Windows defender, but not without making sure my laptop internet access is turned off & there are no possible way of letting data into the device. So, after making sure data doesn't get into my laptop via internet or other means , I will then turn-off/uninstal McAfee antivirus and turn on Window defender.For anti-virus that offers Bitcoin/crypto payments, you probably should check this out: https://www.avira.com/en/press/avira-selects-bitpay-for-bitcoin-and-bitcoin-cash-payments-processing I'm not sure if it offers one time payment. Be safe.",
