It's the exchange that try find the origin of the funds, not the mixers. Mixers don't really care.Exchanges do that because they have rules and regulations they must adhere to. ChainAnalysis's KYT (Know your transaction) is something a lot of exchange use for that purpose: https://www.chainalysis.com/solution/crypto-risk/This helps exchanges block transactions from darknet markets, exchange hacks (a hacker hacking an exchange, and then sending the funds to another one) etc.",

Do they?While some people may use Mixers to cover up their illegal activities, I like to think that there are others who use mixers more because want to the anonymity in every sense of the word and not because they are doing something shady. Secondly, I do not support tainted coins passing through mixers but then isn't it dumb that after using the mixers they go ahead to send it to an exchange? Why not send it to a decentralized exchange. Or will the government be able to trace it and flag it and then they lose their coins if they do?",

Exchanges that limit transactions from mixers will filter deposits regardless of the amount being sent, you run a risk be sending mixed coins there and more risk if you leave them there. Even exhcnages who do not have direct limitations can at any point change their policies and lock your funds.",

Before, exchanges could care less on where your money came from. However, since a lot of pressure is pressed on to exchanges due to their susceptibility to receive illicit funds and facilitate trades using their platform, they don't have any other choice but to freeze tainted coins that they receive and notify the authorities when it happen. They don't necessarily have the power to block transactions. They simply run some analysis on the coins they receive and check if it's 'dirty'. If it is, they freeze the funds, forward whatever information they have to the authorities, and that's it. Mixers don't really care what coins their end users receive. For them, once a mixing service is done, they've done their part of the deal, regardless if the one who requested the mixing received coins that are tainted by illegal activities.",

Very old bitcoins from Satoshi Nakamoto era can still be used today and coins can be used as inputs, outputs for anonymity sets in mixing process. After that, outputs will be tainted by chain analysis and centralized exchanges that are strongly against mixed coins. Because centralized exchanges have to obey laws, AML, and what happened with Binance, Kucoin recent months are big red flags for centralized exchanges to be stricter against their customer deposits.You can understand more about tainted coins with this video.Bitcoin Q&A: Blacklists, Taint, and Wallet FingerprintingIf you have questions, you can ask him on X, and ask him to update more information about this issue with recent serious changes in regulations in the USA. and globally.",

It’s usually centralized exchanges who are wary of where you coins came from and would most likely ask you to verify your account and do lots of complicated things. Mixers nowadays have a really bad image so it would be best to steer away from it.",

The funny thing (or not?) is that you, too, may find yourself in the place of that poor fellow (they will send you tagged coins from the mixer) and without knowing it you will lose (you may lose) money in a banned account of an exchange or other currency exchange service. Bestchange (as an aggregator of exchangers) has also become more attentive to incoming coins recently and provides the opportunity to check AML (aml and amlmarks), where mixers are also among the potential methods of money laundering.",
