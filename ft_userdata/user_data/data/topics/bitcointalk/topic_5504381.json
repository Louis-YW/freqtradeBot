  "content": "The speeches of Donald Trump, Robert F Kennedy, US Senators Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, and Tim Scott at this year's Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, received the spotlight in the Bitcoin community. Donald Trump and Robert F Kennedy spoke so well about Bitcoin thereby receiving applause and cheers from attendees. I was also thrilled by their comments because it will affect the Bitcoin space positively.Trump said Bitcoin is a wonder to the world and will soon overtake gold. He promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Kennedy also promised to apply the same strategy of Nayib Bukele of El Salvador by making the US buy 500 BTC daily until the country's reserve gets to 4 million BTC. Such a wonderful promise.There is no way we can verify the true intentions of these sweet talkers.But the greatest and the most truthful message came from Edward Snowden  and it reads:Quote“Cast a vote, but don’t join a cult\". “They are not our tribe. They are not your personality. They have their own interests, their own values, their own things they’re chasing. Try to get what you need from them, but don’t give yourself to them, even if you have to vote for them.”",

Let's not forget that he is not the only decision-maker who will say a word and it will stand as he pronounced it; everything follows due process, and if he wants to implement it without the support and vote of the house, I don't think it will go anywhere.",

If they follow what they promise to people then maybe this show good indication that they are really for crypto.But if they broke their promise and don't comply everything what they said on campaign period then again they cannot repeat to take the seat again since for sure that lots of people would remember how  bad they are on their last term. But let's give a chance for those people who show support on bitcoin since maybe they could really bring something good changes especially for adoption of this coin in USA. For sure those acceptance would able to open some awareness to people to acquire some bitcoin because many would think that this is good asset to have.",

By doing this, they easily break their promise when they finished their rally, got elected and were appointed to favorite positions. After that they will flip their faces, return to what they are and their management will mostly not satisfy people who voted for these politicians.Big political donors have stronger voices and normal voters and politicians will pay more attention and take care of these class in society because they think far that in future, they will need donations again.",

Just support moderately because Bitcoin has been there for us when they were still hostile to it. So stay within the limits of taking advantage of the political situation. Every year we are quite satisfied with their promises but end up with false promises. I support Trump in terms of vision and mission because there is Bitcoin in his program but don't completely hand over freedom to his policies later when he is elected.",

Attack countries like Kazakhstan to take their hashrate share? Crack down on any exchanges that are not in USA? ...Quotepromised to use fossil fuels to create “so much electricity that you’ll be saying, ‘Please, president sir, we have too much electricity.‘”Yeah, screw the environment But seriously, US runs (IIRC) a 8-9 million bpd fossil fuel deficit that they need to import and with the crazy things he has in mind (specially with his crazier VP Vance) fossil fuel prices could shoot up a lot more due to more conflicts he'd start. So US may both run a higher deficit and face higher prices which would be a good thing for Bitcoin because it spreads the hashrate to other countries more (means more decentralization).QuoteTrump mentioned that he believes he would be a strong candidate for the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin communities. Wasn't he president already for 4 years and did nothing QuoteIf crypto is going to define the future, it’s going to be mined, minted and made in AmericaYeap. I smell centralization...",

Trump replacing Bitcoin with a currency he wholly owns--something he could do at a push of a button as US president--would make him an instant trillionaire, and that is all Trump has ever cared about in his whole life.To stop the two million abortions occurring in the USA every year today, Trump needs to create the largest law enforcement apparatus in history, like they did at the time of the Prohibition--but much bigger this time.This is a perfect pretext for Trump to invoke the US to takeover the Bitcoin network by force and make it part of the US government, or to replace Bitcoin by outlawing Bitcoin in the US and offering his own currency as a replacement that (they would say) couldn't be used to pay for illegal abortions.There is an extremely short-sighted euphoria going on in some of the crypto community about Trump's pandering. Trump is a convicted criminal, and his election will tell him that Americans don't care about blatant criminality in the presidency--which will give him options no US president has ever had. Trump doesn't care about you, doesn't care about your Bitcoin, and is willing to break the law to get what he wants. Inviting Trump into the Bitcoin community is akin to inviting the Mafia into your business.Politicians should not be your tribe, and they should not be your... business model.",

Because some bitcoin enthusiast has already adopted a personalized do or die affair at the US election that Trump must win just because the bitcoin community users are of great expectations when he wins.So literally, this Edwards speech means politicians promised should not be diluted to hope on but being optimistic, we still have to give them some benefits of doubts and hopes for the best as they promises during their campaigns.I read on a thread here where a forum member wrote that we bitcoin enthusiasta should be careful in getting closer to Trump during this hot periods of the election because they are not worth dieing for.So then, since we are not bonded as a cult, we should not take our supports to a level of creating sentiments between the societies and the crypto communities.",

Ask questions like \"How did they perform in their past positions\". They're trained in the act of public speaking.I don't understand why the Bitcoin community will be so moved and impressed by what these guys said at a \"Bitcoin conference\". Do you expect them to go to a conference where they have potential voters and those potential voters as Bitcoiners and say, \"Bitcoin is shit; nobody should own them\"? Or say, \"If I become president, I will make owning bitcoin illegal\"? Of course not. They'll say positive things, things that will make you vote for them.I agree that people's views on things change, but a man like Trump becoming pro-bitcoin all of a sudden after being against Bitcoin in 2019 leaves a lot of questions. Bitcoin is going to survive with or without these people. In fact, it's doing pretty well without them. The is not a government institution or a big corporation that needs government contracts, government funding, or more shareholders to survive. So voters, please don't vote or support a person simply because he said he'll do this or that when elected; vote because you're convinced, based on your answered questions, that he/she is the best candidate.",
