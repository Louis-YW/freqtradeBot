I have explained some few details on how to receive payment from customers in cryptoAlthough you made good initiatives to launch two businesses that accept Bitcoin as a payment method, you did still not prepare enough for your businesses and your employees.Let's see Venezuela. Their government made Bitcoin legal tender but they knew that if it is only on social media, very few citizens will experience it by themselves. Therefore, they decided to distribute airdrop to locals. Even though their efforts, so far they have yet achieved big adoption after many months.Quotebut I think they still find that means of payment as not being convincing, so I want to take out time to teach themÂ  Bitcoin, advantage, users, how to receive and how to send Bitcoin. I want to give them a full knowledge about Bitcoin.You should show them the most necessary for them first.- How to send and receive Bitcoin via on chain transaction.- Next, you can teach them about importance of non custodial wallet- Next, you can guide them what are good non custodial wallets to use, how to install, etc.",

I think direct teaching or hands-on practice is the best way. like teaching them how to transact bitcoin. teach them to download bitcoin wallet. and teach them to accept bitcoin. then allow them to send the bitcoins back to your address.theory is explained while doing direct practice, it will be very easy to understand by your employees. so that when there are customers who will make bitcoin transactions, your employees will not be awkward anymore.then to further discussion. such as the advantages and risks of bitcoin itself. step by step learning. would be easy to accept.

This is a mini-adoption that utilizes bitcoin as a means of payment in addition to Fiat.and you currently want to teach your employees, of course, you need to provide the main guidelines or explain in detail what to do when someone wants to pay with bitcoin. Make sure you create an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for bitcoin payments so that your employees just have to run it.By the way, if you are using an Exodus wallet, of course, it already supports Lightning Network, I suggest including accepting Bitcoin Lightning to make it more efficient because the network costs are cheaper and faster than regular networks.",

Learning by a guided workshop will be a lot better than just giving them a list on what to do when accepting payments but that'll take more work.You could try to scope out whether some employees are already better with technology than others (but this might not help that much as the technology is quite different).What type of business is it you're running? Do you have to wait for confirmations before the person gets the item? Are the customers local? Is there potential to set up a prepay system for ones who regularly come in so you don't have to confirm the transaction straight away.",

You should mention that because it's easier to give proper suggestions when we know what we are dealing with exactly.I receive payment directly to the exodus wallet I created for my business.what I'm a little curious about is whether when you receive a payment with bitcoin, you immediately convert it to your local fiat (to avoid bitcoin price volatility)??by only using the exodus wallet, I think it's inefficient, you should be able to do that automatically because you are doing business and the profit from the sales you get must be for the operational costs of your business (unless you do it for a long-term hold).I've never tried it myself, but what I've heard is that Binance Pay can be used for businesses that accept payments via crypto including bitcoin, maybe you can find out more about that.",

It's much better if you're using electrum, but I would recommend to use Bitcoin payment processor e.g. BTCPay.The first thing is does your employees interested with Bitcoin? If they're don't like or interested with Bitcoin, they wouldn't use Bitcoin. They might use it at the first time or when you ask them to use, but they're use Bitcoin because they're getting forced by you. Any employees mostly agree and following what their boss command, it's not good for them to reject it.If you want to teach, it's better to teach from the beginning by comparing fiat money and Bitcoin.",

How does that work in practice, do they have to wait up to 10 minutes to see the first confirmation of the transaction?If your employees have trouble understanding how to accept these payments, I think it's best to just make it super easy for customers, so that employees don't have to do much. Something like a QR-code they scan to pay would be nice, and then I assume the job of the employees to check if the transaction received at least one confirmation?Aside from using a wallet, knowing that a transaction can't be faked and that there's a small chance it won't go through which is why waiting for 1 confirmation is usually reasonable, I don't think they need to know much.Maybe some basic safety of private keys, a little training of sending and receiving some BTC from one another would also help them get more confident about it.",

I followed your previous thread. Also, coming back to ask for more hints on what to teach your employees about bitcoin proves that you are committed to making it work. This is my two cents. First, have your employees sign up on Binance or on whatever platform appeals to you. Teach them to buy and sell bitcoin. It sounds crazy but unless they get to understand the importance owning and using bitcoin for transactions from personal standpoint, it will be difficult for them to see the importance in the business.",
