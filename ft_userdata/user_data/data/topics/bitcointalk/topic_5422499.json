The coins can then be sent to a BTC address of your choice (it doesn’t have to be an addy in Ledger Live). More information can be found in the Black Friday T&C.Anyone considering taking advantage of this promotion should know that the bitcoins are sent by a 3rd-party Ledger service provider. If this party determines a need to undergo KYC, the user might be required to verify their identity before receiving their coins.If it weren’t for the possibility of being asked to undergo KYC, I would say this is an interesting offer. But I’m not too fond of it. I also don’t know if Ledger can demask users and connect the names from order data with the codes that get claimed. It would be easier if they offered a $20 and $30 discount on their respective hardware wallets. My guess is they didn’t care to think of something better. They have already said they are getting 7x more sales following the downfall of FTX, so I assume they have already filled their pockets plenty.",

This is an interesting marketing. It's also worth mentioning that the information shared by OmegaStarScream in the OP from Ledger's shop is somewhat different from what is written in the promo's T&C that I shared in my post. Under \"How It Works\" in this source, Ledger says: QuoteBuy your chosen Ledger Nano with free BTC here on Ledger.com.First of all, what the hell is free BTC? But if we forget about the word \"free\", the explanation makes it sound like you need to purchase your Nano only with Bitcoin and no other payment methods. But in the T&C, there is no mention of having to purchase the devices with Bitcoin to be given a voucher.QuoteBy purchasing a Ledger Nano X or a Ledger Nano S Plus from Nov 21, 2022 to Nov 28, 2022 on Ledger.com, you will be able to benefit from the following Rewards:The terms only mention the fact that you need to make a purchase without specifying any payment methods. Since T&Cs have priority over other sources of information, it should work for any and all purchases.  Quote from: bitmover on November 21, 2022, 07:52:09 PMI agree 100% with you that doing kyc for 20 - 30 is not ok.

True. Still, the KYC verification (in case there is one) isn't done with Ledger, but with the 3rd-party service they use. Ledger is the connecting bridge between the user and the other company. It still makes no sense and is privacy invasive.",

And let's be honest, people don't care as much as they should on their privacy and KYC data, so even as it is now, many would see it a great opportunity. But, in reality, it's not. In reality, as said, there are great concerns on KYC and privacy plus Ledger's bad history on keeping KYC data secure makes everything even worse.",

On the other hand, it's arguable to say \"very small amount of BTC\", it's a 20% cashback.Of course, the fact it's not worth the KYC is another story. We already know that. And iirc it's also not the first time Ledger does that (making its users send their KYC to third party).",

All other hardware wallet manufacturers that have a Black Friday sale are dropping the price of their devices. It's simple: the client receives a discount, and the seller receives a sale. Win-win.With a Ledger company, it's different. They want to lure customers to them, but they make it difficult to get a discount, and as a result, many will simply refuse these 20-30$.They have some sophisticated methods that don't take into account the interests of their customers at all. I would call it a veiled swindle foul play. Either you make a discount, or you don’t, and not these tricks with a demonstration of a discount, but which you need to run after.",

But if you think about it, that 10% discount is like half the cost you pay for the shipping of the device.
