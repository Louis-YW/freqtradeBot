That is not a normal bitcoin transaction.* You are either participating in the ongoing spam attack by exploiting the protocol trying to inject arbitrary data into the chain. In which case you are part of the problem for the currently high fees and you have to pay the price!* Otherwise this means your transaction had a large number of inputs in which case you have to rethink what you have been doing. Stop receiving dust payments so that when you want to spend those coins you don't end up with such a huge tx.",

These were blocks that were mined after the halving block 840000. During that time the transaction fee was around 146$ for medium fee and close to 169$ for priority. Everyone knew that the developers of the runes were the cause of this hike. And everyone was upset but have to wait. A lot of persons kept complaining of which I told them to be patient as it will be back to normal as it usually has in the past few spike. There's nothing to worry about here mate. Bitcoin fee hasn't experienced what happened during this halving period but the spike in fee is a normal nature that come with bitcoins volatile nature. But it will usually return to normal. Just like others have said, you can get your transaction confirmation with 1$ fee as of now so there's nothing to be worried about.",

Right now it is certainly not more than $10, way much less than what the OP insinuated. Yes those batch transactions also reduces the fee if they use just one utxo( one input) for all transactions but still it will not be much reduction because the outputs will still be much in a single batch.

I don’t also think this things are gone. My advice to anyone holding bitcoin and possibly has multiple UTXOs right now is the best time to consolidate them. In the past I don’t take this consolation thing too seriously but right now it’s one of the little things to do to save fees in the future",

I don't see anything obviously wrong.If you are paying 200k sats for a transaction when the current fee is around 12 s/vb, then the reason is likely that you have received your BTC through a large number of transactions.I encourage you to learn more about how fees work. The best solution for you now is probably to wait until fees are very low and then send all of your bitcoins to yourself in a single transaction. It will probably still cost a lot, but less than what it would cost when fees are high.On the other hand, it also could be one of these: you tried to send when the fees were temporarily high oryour wallet is not very good at recommending fees, oryou are choosing a fee that will guarantee that your transaction will be in the next block.",

A reduction is a reduction and you missed a point.Centralized exchanges charge same withdrawal fee on all users and they don't take into account how many user withdrawal will be batched into their batch transaction. This means they use batch transactions to proceed withdrawals for users, but don't discount any % for their users.Reduction of transaction size, transaction fee will all make benefit for the exchange, not their users.The hilarious thing will come when Bitcoin mempools congested and centralized exchanges will raise their withdrawal fees. Again, their users will bear the loss, exchanges still get benefit just by processing on-chain transactions.",

There is nothing wrong with the Bitcoin blockchain. It's just that people raced to inscribe Ordinals within minutes of the halving event. The increased demand for block space, led to a substantial rise in network fees. Completely normal, imo. Right now, fees have declined to a considerable level. When the hype fades away, it's the perfect time to move your BTC across the network. As simple as that. But if you're in a hurry, then I'd suggest you check out the Lightning Network or an altcoin such as Litecoin or Dogecoin for fast and cheap payments. Hopefully, BTC Core developers will introduce a mechanism to prevent fees from spiraling out of control. As long as decentralization is prioritized, nothing else matters.",
