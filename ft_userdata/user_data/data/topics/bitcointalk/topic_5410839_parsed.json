Im thinking the suicide. I need your ideas. Best Regards,Heibosuicide is not the best way to solve the debt. I know the reason why you are writing here. ok. let me narrate brief story for you to understand your own reason. A man wanted to killed himself so he took a robe and went into the forest. reaching the forest, he hanged the robe a big tree for him to die fast. After tieing robe on a branch of the big tree, he took the remaining part of the robe to wrapped his neck, and in the process of wrapping the robe on his neck, he heard a gunshot which was very close to him and it was a hunter killing an animal in the forest. This man removed the robe from his neck and ran away. And came back to the town. What am I trying to say. If you really want to commit suicide you won't come here¬† to tell us that. You came here to tell us because you don't want to die. So I will advice you not to kill yourself although killing yourself is not in your mind. The best way to do it, it is to do minor works to pay your debt gradually till you see a big job to clear all. The Lord is your strength.",

Do not play on casino's that don't have that.Second step is somehow forget for 1-2 months about the debt even if it might hurt your credit score (if they are too high), you may ask the banks about a delay.Third step work harder on recovering, maybe this shall be a bigger step for your status to be increased and make more money after this, or continue what you used to do and work for the debt.DO NOT GAMBLE TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS! You won't!",

Best Regards,HeiboSuicide is a huge gamble.The down sides of doing it are terrible.Hell maybe.worse is nothing.or how bout you realize you close the loop on your life on a deadbeat song and are told you will repeat your life over and over and over again always ending with the same stupid move of suicide.I am a compulsive gambler.I did two intentional drug overdoses trying to kill myself.I also suffered with acute psychosis along with ptsd for 10 years. ¬†I had a bad life style age 15-28But I quit gambling.stopped using drugsmet a girl married her in 1986.still with her now in 2022.So if my life is like a vinyl record after some shitty songs the rest are much better.So you can help yourself. And make some good music üéº vs ‚Äúthey are off you lose‚Äù from a very old abbott and costello show.Try to find a gamblers anonymous group near you .They helped me get well.I would wish you good luck but you do not need good luck. You need to stop gambling.",

My fallback if I have a loan to pay I think will be driving a taxi which I could avoid while also making money to pay them later. This could be a choice for you too.Just face the problem dude, suicide is not a good escape. Just be a man and work it out with them. I don't think they will jail you, that won't be beneficial for them.",

Best Regards,HeiboLet me sound this loud and clear; when you try to make gambling as a source of loss recovery and source of income you'll rather end up becoming the source of income to others.While I say this I'll also advise you keep faith and hope alive go out there and source for a legit source of income that would pay your debt for it's not the end up of life but rather life for you has just begun.Even countries owe debts not talk of an individual. So calm down and be useful.The bottom line is, never see gambling as a source of living!",

      "body": "- Don't commit suicide. You might wind up paying eternally for the suicide in the resurrection.- Don't commit suicide until you find out if the banks or government will come after your family to make them pay the debt.- Find people you can trust, or if you are in the right country, form a trust or corporation without your name on any of it - let a relative control it - and place all your property that you own with these people or artificial entities. The idea is to get it out of your ownership so that the bank can't take it for the debt.Find out how long you have to wait, by law, until the new owner can't be attacked because the bank might think you are simply hiding your property. In the US it's 2 years. Simply make payments for that long, but after that, cancel your debt. If you don't go to prison - which you won't in many countries - live off funds you request from people who are running what used to be your property.- Often, if you go to court over the money, and the bank wins the judgement, depending on what you signed in court (don't sign anything if you can help it), make the statement that you can only afford to pay off a dollar a day. The bank may have to accept this, but don't fail to ever make at least this payment.- Don't gamble in the future. For example, some people call buying stocks and bonds like it is taking a chance... like it is gambling. But it isn't a gamble if you have looked into past performance and check out dividends. After all, you could trip on the throw rug in your bedroom, and hit your head on the table and break your neck and die. Life is always at least a little bit of a gamble. Do your due diligence, both regarding the rug, and regarding investing.",

That is if the him or his family people could not pay the debt indirectly he should commit suicide. suicide is not the best option, according to a saying \"when there is life, there is hope\", he still have hope to pay the debt. It is better for him to loss his property then losing his life. When the bank people come for the debt he should give his properties to settle the debt. Gambling is a game of luck and good predictions, he should should not use big money to play bet again but small amount to play games and win small and big to settle the debt and collect his things back. Or he should use the new wins to start new life. {If there is life, there is hope}. First of all, save your life then think a positive way forward.",

Best Regards,HeiboJust another case of Darwin at work...yeah you can go sparta and not go athensbut the truth is both ways are wrong.the biggest issue how to separate people and get rid of the bad seeds correctly.basically we as humans have been pretty bad at doing this.very likely we will continue to be this way for the near future and middle future and far future.it is likely hard wired in us to not be able to sort the troubled ones out and help or get rid of them.ie Charley Manson did not need to spend decades in a prison a ten cent bullet could have saved us some money.I find him to be a good example of failing to rid ourselves of anchors or rocks ü™® so to speak.As for the op I can tell him the last bet I made was in July of 1990 the last illegal drug I took was in Jan of 1991 and the last tobacco I used was on Feb 29th 1996.And the only person I have been with intimately since 1985 is my wife.And it has been a very good time for me far better then my partying and gambling years from 1972 to early 1985.All because i got Athens treatment for my fucked up behavior.I know lots of people treated ‚Äúeasy‚Äù with compassion and their failure rate was over 50%Personally I would of failed with hard treatment. But I can tell you my bro-in-law got easy treatment much like me and is a spectacular failure. He will continue to be a mess as he has past the point of no return.He gave himself dementia due to terrible diet and will not recover.",

Fentanyl is not the same as either alcohol or gambling but the parallel I am trying to draw is that an ex-alcoholic has the opportunity to drink again in a few minutes, especially if he lives in a city and not in the middle of the mountains. The gambler can also return to gambling in seconds with his cell phone. At the end of the day, the one who recovers knows how to live with it.",
