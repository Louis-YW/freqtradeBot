A  gift card means immediate inflow of money for the company, since many people buy but don't register them in online stores until they actually need to make a purchase, so a company can get the money instantly, but the actual transaction might take place a year later. It's like getting a 0% loan. They also use payment processors that convert your bitcoin to USD using popular exchanges like Binance. Nowadays there's almost 0 risk involved in accepting bitcoin.",

The volatility in price is really a challenge for small scale businesses. Not all of them are aware of usdt, they only hear about Bitcoin and their confidence is built around it but they dare not integrate Bitcoin into their businesses as they consider the volatility a possible disadvantage to the businesses they run. Who covers for the negative values that might be lost in the event of a drop in Bitcoin paid, most times, these negative values are significant in the net profit calculations.",

So this has really been considered beforehand when company owners want to make payments in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency within their company. You should also think that the company owners who are willing to accept Bitcoin as payment are not people who have no knowledge of Bitcoin.But they are all people who already have more knowledge about cryptocurrencies and are no longer afraid of the high volatility that exists in Bitcoin. Apart from that, companies can also get more profits when an increasing price trend begins to occur in Bitcoin, while when the market trend is worsening, companies can also make temporary exchanges with stablecoins so as not to experience a depreciation in the value of the assets they have acquired.",

Do they all use the gateway to exchange those for stable coins or do they hold that?Companies that accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as payment frequently put these digital assets' inherent volatility into account by implementing various strategies. Using payment processors or gateways that quickly convert acquired cryptocurrencies into stable coins or conventional fiat money is one popular strategy. This conversion happens practically instantly, protecting the company from possible losses brought on by abrupt changes in pricing. On the other hand, some businesses decide to hold onto some of the cryptocurrency they get in order to capitalize on their possible growth.On the other hand, some businesses decide to hold onto some of the cryptocurrency they get in order to capitalize on their possible growth. Stability and speculative possibility are balanced by this dual technique of keeping a percentage for prospective gains and converting immediately to reduce risk. To further protect their earnings, some businesses may also use financial instruments like futures or options contracts as a hedge against price fluctuations. In the end, the precise methods differ, and companies customize their approaches to accepting cryptocurrencies according to their risk appetite, the state of the market, and their long-term goals for digital assets.",

Do they all use the gateway to exchange those for stable coins or do they hold that?We can only speculate because we don't know how some of these businesses run their finance. But from the information I got from a friend who accepts Bitcoin as payment, he converts the coin to stablecoins like USDT. Converting the coin to USD helps him beat the volatility of Bitcoin. I also suspect that some business that has backup funds to run the business could also decide to hodl the Bitcoin they receive as payments. However, this might not be advisable for firms that depend solely on sales to run the business.       Quote from: Agbe on January 20, 2024, 07:41:04 PMAccepting Bitcoin is in their business is one of the core mandates of Bitcoin creation I think someone has Said this before.

But the question now is what happens if the price of Bitcoin depreciates? These businesses will definitely lose money and might not even have enough funds to restock what they have sold. The bottom line is that receiving Bitcoin payments is innovative but small businesses might not afford to bear the consequences.",

Some others, who are really interested in holding Bitcoin, accept it directly.

There are a lot of options when using a crypto payment gateway. It's up to companies which options fit for them. Nothing serious here.",

They would have adopted any method that suits them or there business model the best.",

Do they all use the gateway to exchange those for stable coins or do they hold that?Yes, it's likely that they use instant exchanges with the payments that they receive and it's possible with third party services like bitpay. Wherein, a person pays the businessman bitcoin and then the owner can easily exchange that to whichever crypto or fiat that it is being supported and favored by him. If they want to receive it directly with Bitcoin, they don't have to do anything but just accept it through their wallet unless they just want to take advantage of having another payment method.The former is what they have to do and many businesses are enjoying doing so like having to add the privilege the logo of having \"Bitcoin accepted here\" is like a cypherpunk business guy, right?  It is not requiring rocket science for them to understand on how to manage, receive and exchange payments in Bitcoin with the help of those services.",

Other users might have their own strategy, which might be quite different from my own, but I think that the best strategy for accepting Bitcoin payments is to convert from Bitcoin to Fiat after you have received the payment.Each time I receive payment in Bitcoin or in any other cryptocurrency like BNB, I usually leave my profit in Bitcoin and then convert the rest to Fiat to avoid losing some money due to volatility.For example, if I made a total sale of $3000 in a day and all the payment was received in Bitcoin, at the end of that day, if my profit was $300, I would then convert $2700 into Fiat so that if perhaps the price of Bitcoin falls, it will not affect my capital. Sometimes too, I don't just quickly convert from Bitcoin to Fiat; I can decide to wait a day to see if the price of Bitcoin can increase to give me more profit.",

Bitcoin is very volatile, it can increase 10%-20% or it can also decrease 20%-30% in value. So, don't always talk about price increases without talking about bitcoin price decreases. Just like when bitcoin ETFs were approved, bitcoin dropped from $48k to $42k in just a few days, if you were a business owner, how would you handle it to ensure profits for your business?  I'm also curious about this problem and hope someone who is a business owner and accepts bitcoin can tell us what the solution is. don't guess when we don't have experience with it.",
