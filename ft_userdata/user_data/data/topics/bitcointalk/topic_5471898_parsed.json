Maybe a misture of luck to the believe we have in the bet could make it work if we have done the most reasonable bet because you don't expect to bet on 20 soccer games on a slip and expect to win millions of dollars.",

By looking at this picture, I feel like I see someone showing off his stupidity and that's LOL...And I just want to ask actually \"which god does he worship\" and what religion does he follow..? because clearly in the Bible there is a statement that \"warns to abstain from loving money\" where meanwhile, gambling is one of the activities that brings you closer to it (loving money). But apart from that, gambling is about the enjoyment of some people, so regardless of whether it is halal or haram, as long as you like gambling, go ahead and if you don't like it, don't ever gamble. And never mix it up with religion because religion clearly prohibits this.",

Instead of talking about matters of faith in gambling, it is better for us to directly place a bet and turn the button or determine the amount of money and bet. Perhaps we will never reach an agreement about whether faith has anything to do with gambling because perhaps some people don't want to mix gambling with religion. Some people even say that gambling is prohibited in religion, some people say that there is no need for faith to gamble, and others.",

As atheists, first, prove the existence of God then we can explore the answers for his help regarding our activities. As theist. Good has a better job to do than monitoring someone's entertainment. Everyone has superstitious beliefs in one or another so this is some kind of belief not really thinking that God will help the person to win if he surrounds himself with bibles.",

If he asks for a sign from God if he should stop gambling, God will give him a sign right away that he should stop, God does now want us to be astray and addiction to gambling will keep us astray from God.Not because the Bible says that we should include God in everything we do, that does not mean we should involve God in our vice, we are just justifying our wrongdoing by including God in it.If you really God-fearing you should not include him in vices and man up to yourself you are responsible for all that you're doing, only ask for guidance to the Lord if you're doing it according to his laws and wishes not your wishes.",

All this are great questions that help us get some level of information and building a scientific understanding around those subjects terms,  I believe that in gambling and politics god is just a spectator.",

We'll all have one purse.\" 14 put thou lot with us, one purse be there of us all; (put thou thy lot with us, and let there be one purse for us all;) 14 Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of us.If I have to interpret it myself, its like poker where they have a money pot in the middle and one of them will win.And in Proverbs 1:15, it also says it is not allowed.Quote15 my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths; Amen!",

Do you think how much faith or not, we have in God (or whatever we serve as a God) has anything to do with how much we win or lose in sports betting and gambling in general? It is believed among Christians that God influences everything we do especially if it is good. The Bible is not against responsible gambling but it warns against being in a haste to get wealth because it could lead to loss of wealth or even criminal activities. So I will not criticise people that think God is involved in gambling.It is also funny for someone to believe that putting a bet app in the middle of Bibles will affect the outcome of the game. This behavior is born out of a lack of understanding of even the Bible. The Bible as a book or app has no consequences except you read and believe it. After believing, you can use it to pray to God and ask for what you need including protection against evil and gambling wins.In summary, Christianity is not against gambling and Christians believe that God controls everything. It will not be out of place to pray and ask God for protection and favor. But it would be foolishness to depend solely on God to make you win, hence it is important to learn and gain skills about your games. Quote from: Gozie51 on October 27, 2023, 03:29:36 PMI don't think God involves himself with gambling. In the bible, Jesus Christ destroyed the template of gamblers and chased them out of synagogue.Jesus pursued those gamblers and moneychangers out of the temple because they were gambling in the wrong place. They should have engaged in the activity outside the holy Temple.",

From my understanding of the Bible, Jesus chased away gamblers and money doublers from the temple which means it is contrary to his belief as a  Christian and from that perspective, I can deduce that Jesus does not support such activities in the house of God because it was in the temple such act was carried out but some people still believe what ever they put their hands in would multiple and that settles their faith and it works for them fine. So therefore, if the owner of the App does that with faith possibly it just might work out for them.",

That is the mistery of life no one can answer precisely. It's out of our understanding how God acts and why he acts one way and not another. Why do some specific people make huge profit from gambling, while others lose? Why a determined person is so lucky and the other totally unlucky? Is it all about randomness, after all? I don't think so...I believe not everything happens because God wants, but everything happens because God allows it to happen. It must be related to free will and what we can learn from our actions and decisions aiming our progressive evolutional and developmental process as individuals.Through a big loss or jackpot win, God may be trying to show you something that can contribute to your personal growment as individual.",

I cannot speak for God, but I think he has no dealings with petty things like gambling. Following the gospel, we are all children of God, and both the person that wins and looses are all his children, so spirituality or praying to God to win in gambling is useless because the other person who has placed an opposite bet to what you have placed may have also prayed to the same God. So who is he going to answer? There is luck in gambling, but no spirituality.",

Like while gambling you can involve in insults and fight which can lead to harming the body especially in off line gambling. While gambling you can be attracted by other things which can jeopardize your faith. I think it could fall in the category of anything that will lead you to sin. Some can get angry after losing a game and get provoked to beat his wife up and many more of the vices that will lead one into sin, you can steal to gamble. Some gamblers are not truthful, they can try to cheat the casino etc.",

There will be no accurate and even close response to that kind of question as we can't generalize that.We obviously know that there's no such thing as faith or whatever takes part in our gambling activities.However, if there's a gambler who applied their religious faith in gambling, just let them be like that.
