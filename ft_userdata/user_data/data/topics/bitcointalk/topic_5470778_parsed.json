Where these leaders are not being liable to answer for misappropriation of funds or budgets, monkeys and snakes do the utmost scam of swallowing or carting away  stolen funds meant for projects and urban development. President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan held himself and conscience in check at all times that even Dr Okonjo Iweala won the hearts and admiration of other giants in the financial sector for being conscientious and accountable in managing this countries finance.",

However, I can only say Goodluck Jonathan administration was trying to do its best to build the economy but it didn't do much in the east, only fearfully concentrated on the north which was why some channels for importation and exportation where not opened up in south south and the regions of east. The current administration have not shown proper direction to lead the way for economic growth despite generating alot of money from the fuel subsidy dey removed. They are still playing pranks and not serious on paliatives for the masses, penury everywhere.",

We need to diversify the economy to revive it, like go massively into agriculture and mineral resources and not solely depend on crude oil.",

Please lets discuss For me Nigeria has been long dying and it was only a matter of time before the whole situation escalated, one thing is to bear the name as the giant of Africa and have the numbers in your favor interns of GPD and all those shit  ass calculation and another thing is to actually live up to those numbers. Any nation in our shoes would probably be in same position as Nigeria in relation to amount of population in Africa and also with the number of natural endowed resources and I like to think that they can even do better than us but instead we only drag GDP numbers whereas the main thing that is actually needed in the country is very much in lack as the power,job, education and so many other sectors are so much in shatter and needs to be attended to but corruption and selfish greed won't allow the nation to thrive as it's supposed to, because with all the numbers and resources we have, countries like south Africa and the so called Egypt shouldn't be anywhere close to us but yet we see a great decline every day.",

The question that reverberates in my head is this; it's crude oil the only natural resource that is embedded in Nigeria  that the political leadership has beam their hornet nest all around it without thinking of diversifying the economy through other sectors making it an equal sources of earnings to the nation. In the 50's down to the early 70's we had agricultural produce and agriculture was what the nation depends on and Nigeria economy was booming with the local currency having value over the so-called dollar of today. We had groundnuts pyramids in the North, cocoa in the West and palm oil and yam barns in the Southern part of Nigeria all of which were produced in large quality for exports to other countries.Not until the late 70's that crude oil was discovered in Nigeria and the politicians  got engulfed and disarticulated by the oil boom and that was the beginning of this economy downturns we have been experiencing for decades and it getting worsening each passing year because the mistake is still in course.",

      "body": "Nigeria economy so far has been an issue, if proper care is not taken or if our leaders don't act right concerning our economy, I think the economy will continue to decrease.But from my paspective, empowerment can contribute to the growth of Nigeria economy.Youth empowerment could be considered as providing investment opportunities for the growth of our economy such as; information technology, agro_industrial ventures cash and food crops farming, poultry etc.In Nigeria between 2021_2022 the rate of youth unemployment ranked at 23.1% according to the national bureau of statistics (NBS) report. This portends danger to the health and stability of the country economy at large.In a county where citizens are not empowered and has no job how will the economy grow. Let me use my state for example, the previous regimes of the state had never done any concrete programme to allievate the issue.However youth between April 2018, the bayelsa state government sent about 300 youths to Abuja to undertake training of computer, after completion laptops were provided for them. Again another scholarship were offered for 150 youths to go to UK to acquire further knowledge on modern technology on e_banking.Subsequent on these the outcome are very poor and discouraging. Secondly unemployment of the youth can be attributed to bad government and poor economy.In conclusion the Nigeria government should redirect its attention for youth empowerment programmes to two critical areas such as; information technology and agro business ventures for the growth of our economy, these would also improve the gross domestic product (GDP) of Nigeria at large and this would enable the nation to compete with the rest economies of the world, and would also increase the incomes of the youths",

      "body": "Yes  I also agree on the incompetent economic team and uneducated Special Advisers and Selfish interest leaders plus corrupt leadership. This also remind me of a statement. According to a political Analyst, \"the real ruler of a country is unknown\". From the way I look at things Nigeria economy is under seize and that is why the leaders of the country cannot control the economy and do anything about it. Those who control the economy are beyond (powerful)  than the country's leadership so the leaders do things according to their well and not to the will of the leaders which might also benefits the citizens. In a capitalist state they are not interested in the welfare of the citizens but for themselves and the their immediately families. And politicians also apply that alienation approach the d the labour work force in the state by the capitalist. In the Nigerian State, things are not working well again because the new world is eating up the local economy very hard. Nigerian leaders thought that devaluation of the naira is the best approach to boost the economy but it is an irony of the it. The dollar is increasing everyday and the naira is decreasing everyday. As of today which I am writing or making this comment, $1 is equal to #1,100 which has been surpass the prediction of the two exchange rate of the year. Now some have predicted that dollar might reach up to 2k this year because of the way it rising daily. But if Nigerian government wants to make the economy very strong, they can do it because Nigeria is an autonomous country which has a say in her economic development. And if they want to make the economy strong then they have to take a drastic step have to be taken to cut off from the new world order which is not a beneficiary to the third world countries. Nigeria is a country blessed with abundance of natural resources but the international forces refused us to utilize them to develop ourselves but to them. So the question is always arise on this matter that how do we do. Because if the masses notice this and protest, the international forces will still use National leaders to fight against the masses which are the real development of the country. Like what I saw in IG today, the marketers are controlling the electricity supply and they told NEPA not to give constant light because if they do, the marketers will not sell diesel and fuel. That is nonsense and dis is the kind of country we found ourselves. We are in the Neo-Colonialism whereby our black leaders are used to colonist us. The economy is the base in any country and if they control the economy then your whole body is control by them. At that stage they will tell you what you will eat and drink. Because the food of poor is different from the food of the rich. And this is control by the world powers.So if bitcoin as finally adopted as the legal tender in the country then this economics drain will be over.",
