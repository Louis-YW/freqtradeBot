It's a menace because  when children are involved, they will be the one to suffer divided attention even though the law forces the parents to pay for their support. The question will then be: is financial  support all that it is to raising children?If these divorces  are base on the way its viewed as a contract then it must have an end surely  because no contract last for a life time. However,  if marriage is look upon as union based on religious belief, then there a bidding involve. Ironic bonding transform the individuals to one flesh. So, if any party think of divorce, they will as well reflect on the impact it would have on themselves. Can you separate yourself?",

It is a union because both agreed and with their parents to married and the scriptures made it to be more the union.It is also an agreement because when there is a disagreement which must have led to an irreparable damage, there is no other option than to end the contract. It is not nice to call a divorce a menace. If they fall out of love and eventually does not divorce, such a situation may lead to murder. Would you prefer that someone dies or they go their separate ways. If you do not want divorce, simply correct those things that lead to divorce.",

Money often divides people and I've noticed that couples that are rather poor or of average income work together to achieve something, but people who both have a lot of wealth tend to look at marriage like a business deal. Before they start living together they already divide assets to know who takes what if they split. Quote from: uchegod-21 on September 20, 2023, 10:34:10 AMMarriage is both a union and a contract.

If the reason why Mr A marries a woman and he no longer see that which attracted him to the woman anymore, he will ask for a divorce because he didn't marry because of love.What I mean is this, I might get married to a lady because she is rich, this means that I got married to her money and not her, and the moment inside the marriage, something happens that made her to loss her wealth, you will see it that I will no longer be interested in marrying her again, because the wealth is gone. If couples allows love to lead in their marriages, no matter the challenges that they are facing, they will tolerate one each other and stay strong to overcome it together as one. Another thing that can help again is to always have time to listen to your partner so that both husband and wife can know how to solve whatever issues that is before them.Marriage is a union and not a contract, but when two persons that are not meant to be joined together as husband and wife, it will become a contract because divorce will be the case.",

In Africa it was initially regarded and known as a union between man and a woman called husband and wife, and to further tie the union, it extended to the inlaws who are also seen as family. In Africa, we also regard an inlaw as simblings or family. However, all these have changed. The union is tearing apart for different reasons and that is why people are now confused how to regard marriage.The truth to your question is that people now contract a union in form of marriage because of certain reasons to survive in the system or country they find themselves. Marriage is suppose to be a union based on the intent of what it was meant for, procreation in the name of having a family but this have been changed. Change is constant and modernity keeps operating on the influence of change.",

It's a menace because  when children are involved, they will be the one to suffer divided attention even though the law forces the parents to pay for their support. There's no more respect in unions and marriages these days. The justification that they're having is that there is this law of divorce or annulment wherein they can simply restart and find another partner. Yes, even those couples that have kids, they don't mind separating since they can just co-parent to their children.Quote from: Mophymac on September 20, 2023, 10:03:06 AMThe question will then be: is financial  support all that it is to raising children?Sadly yes. But the emotional impact on the kids is high when they see their friends have their complete family and they don't have one. This is what they don't understand. But it's much better than to live together and suffer with each other's disagreement.Quote from: Mophymac on September 20, 2023, 10:03:06 AMIf these divorces  are base on the way its viewed as a contract then it must have an end surely  because no contract last for a life time.

So, if any party think of divorce, they will as well reflect on the impact it would have on themselves. Can you separate yourself? Separation needs to be agreed upon and there are laws that can declare that these separations are needed to be done for the sake of both parties. That's why before getting married, everyone should be prepared financially, spiritually, mentally and emotionally.",

There was no real chemistry between them, they were together because they were bored alone and didn't really want to be in a stable relationship, which is why they split after more or less 10 years and both never married again.I met my wife when we were in our 20s and we were together more than 10 years without marriage. We felt good with each other and never needed any paper to seal that. We did that for our families, to make it official for them and so that we'd have it easy if one of us gets into an accident, or dies, because a spouse has all the formal rights to visit you in the hospital, to inherit everything after your death, but a partner doesn't. You need wills legalized by a notary for everything like bank account access and all that, so it's just easier and cheaper to get married. Anyway, we're together for more than 15 years and it's the same relationship we had before the contract.",

Is it really your country among the few which do not recognize divorces? Because I would have assumed most of countries around the planet had a relatively flexible set of laws to allow people to separate each other.Of course, I was aware that in the case of countries which follow the sharia law or those who are mostly muslin, did not allowed couples to separate, because the obvious religious implications those divorces would imply. In the case of my country, getting a divorce is relatively easy, one just need to pay for a lawyer to take care of it.",
