There is already quite a few lenders on the forum with high reputation, competing with them is a challenge, more so for an unknown newbie.Quote from: Newyork777 on June 04, 2023, 02:31:26 PMHow much i can earn ? Depends on your interest %, it ranges for different services. And how many people actually use your service.Quote from: Newyork777 on June 04, 2023, 02:31:26 PMShould i ask collateral always ? If you are asking this question then do so. Appraising those requesting a loan to determine who to offer a no collateral loan and who not to would complicate your service, you might also not be able to recover from the loss of a defaulted loan.- Jay -",

How can i improve my service ?If you want to make a business with that, you need to build a reputation first, because people can be scammed by you with their collaterals, so they need to trust you. A good way to build it, is to offer loans(with collaterals) with very low rates first, or loans with normal rates but without collateral. In this case you will need to assess the risk of defaulting from the borrower in order to offer an appropriate rate. Usually active users with high ranks not red tagged are less likely to default, especially if they are doing signature campaigns.",

Here is a list: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=276897.0I suggest to get familiar with the trust system first (ideally, the whole forum) specially if you'll be doing no-collateral loans since you'll be basing that on overall account standing - basically just an assessment on how likely are they to pay you back/not run away.",

It is advisable to ask collateral since you do not know the person who will ask  for a loan here in the forum.  But some old lender had given and exemption to the account that is enrolled in signature campaign paid weekly in BTC.QuoteHow can i improve my service ?You can start by planning and creating terms and compare them to the existing lending service here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=65.0.  Of course borrower likes smaller interest so try to think of a competitive interest that can entice borrower to taking your service.Also, please take not of many scammers that will take advantage of your service.  Many had been recorded that after borrowing huge amount of money, they defaulted on the loan and abandon the account they used for borrowing.",

How can i improve my service ?This is a very vague question- but I will take it literally as your post title suggests that you want to engage in a loaning business.I do think that the best way to start with this kind of business is to establish yourself first in the forum. Along with the capital, you should also do some research about the forum users who would loan with your services. Avoid forum users who are newbies and instead, transact with high-ranking and well-reputable members for your security.You should also have different kinds of cryptocurrencies at your disposal as different people want different cryptocurrencies. Lastly, remember that this is a risky business- expect to somehow lose some money at the first year of doing it.",

How can i improve my service ?I suggest that you don't focus on loans that can be made in this forum, because first of all you are new to this forum, and you don't have the proper requirements to borrow. The requirement is in the form of a good reputation, which you can get after you contribute well and are useful to this forum or to fellow members. So now you only need to make a good contribution to this forum, by participating in discussions, providing useful knowledge or information for others.so that you can get a good reputation and after that you will most likely be able to apply for a loan in this forum. But to get a good reputation in this forum, it will not be done in a fast way. Requires a fairly long process, until you get that reputation. Although long, but that's the truth. Because if you don't do that, I'm sure you won't be trusted and won't be able to apply for a loan. Because you are still really very new to this forum, and you certainly won't be too trusted if you apply for a loan.",

How can i improve my service ?Welcome onboard OP.  You are on the right track identifying with this platform as you would get to know more and have good knowledge of what you have signed up for. My advise to you is that you should not be in a haste to do something that you would regret in the nearest future. I would say this, take your time to gradually building your account while working on your reputation because what you have in mind doing here would need you such efforts as I have said earlier because no one would want to identify with such am account conducting loan and lots more and it would make it more difficult for members to attend to you when what they have already reputable loan giver here. It would take you extra efforts to be able to making sure you get the attention of a customer.So therefore,Secondly, how much you can earn should not be a thing of concern to you when you have not started it yet. What I would suggest is the you check the loan board to study how it works there and the rates and percentage of return borrowers request for loan with when making refund.However, asking for collateral as I have seen in other loan board is not inclusive although if you want to ask, that is your own policy but as much as I know I do not think collateral Is involved as it is collateral Free but whom ever wants to default should be ready for  a red tag and negative trust. You should know yourself that this is highly risky to do.",
