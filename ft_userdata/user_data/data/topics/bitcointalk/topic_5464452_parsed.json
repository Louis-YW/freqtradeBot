Altcoins can be vanished at any time but that won't be the case with Bitcoin and ETH. So whenever you have some money to invest, invest in these coins and nothing else. But if you are willing to gamble with your investment, then it's fine to buy anything.",

Did you invest anything for keeping long?I'm yet to do that presently, even though I bought some altcoins when the market was a bit stable(bitcoin around 30k). You can imagine what the price of some altcoins I held in my portfolio, what their price would be, now bitcoin is trading at $26k. Since the dip in price started 3 days ago, I haven't thought about adding more altcoins to my portfolio since I don't want to gamble with my spare money on coins whose survival in the bear market before the bull run is uncertain. It is better for me to keep investing in bitcoin because I am confident that its price will rise tomorrow compared to altcoins.",

I am sorry to say but you have made a wrong move by investing at this moment and that too on a random coin which is ranked at #37 wherein we cannot even invest into top altcoin now, nevertheless take a chance as no one can predict the crypto market as I am criticizing your investment now may end up praising if it pumps.",

Experience they say is the best teacher. Most altcoins are pump and dump. People buy it because of the prospect of profit by the time it increases in price because of the numbers of unit but before you finish clicking the order to buy it starts to drop in price and won't recover and that is because those whales and early buyers had already seen the opportunity to dump by your orders. It is only better to buy bitcoin and very top altcoins like Ethereum and BNB.",

Because at this market i see ARB as overvalued when you realize that only use case for it is basically voting. So unless you vote more airdrops for yourselves to devaluate it even more, i don't understand how it would be a good thing to ask from some random holders on any code decision votes. That should be left for most talented coders, not hacks hoarding votes for their hype ideas.",

Did you invest anything for keeping long?The last all-time high of that coin was about $8+ this year, and the price has really dropped, so you bought at a low price, but the thing is that you don't know if the price of the coin can go high again or even hit a new ATH. I am more consistent in accumulating Bitcoin because I feel more safe investing in it compared to some altcoins, and the reason is because I have a lot of altcoins that have died out in my wallet. When I also invested in them, I thought I bought them at a very low and cool price, but those coins never increased in price again.",

However, if someone has faith in any alternative cryptocurrency, then I would suggest that there is no issue in purchasing it, especially if the intention is for long-term investment. On the other hand, if the intention is short-term gains, then this might not be the appropriate moment to make a purchase. Different individuals perceive the market in varying ways; I too have invested in 2-3 coins ‚Äì XRP, Matic, and Quant. These investments have been made with a long-term perspective in mind. I made these purchases because these coins are significantly below their all-time highs. Despite the likelihood of the market remaining sideways for around 3 months or potentially even dropping, I am aware that opportunities like these might be rare. Hence, I am taking a calculated risk to seize the moment.",

I have an eye on some altcoins but now is not the time to buy yet. Also if I buy an altcoin, I don't plan on keeping it for a long time. Once I make money out of it, I will quickly sell it and buy for another coin. You shouldn't be loyal in any altcoin and keep it until it goes up. That might make you bag it for a long time instead of earning with other altcoins.",
