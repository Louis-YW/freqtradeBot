  "content": "1. When the control board cannot be turned on, when there is no voltage or low voltage. First, determine whether the power supply is faulty. The voltages of the power modules are 3.3V, 1.8V, 1.5V, and 1.0V, respectively. Therefore, if any voltage in this area is abnormal, check the corresponding components for damage.https://www.zeusbtc.com/share/share/control-board-power.jpg3.3V is the front end voltage. If the circuit is shorted, remove U8 before testing. If it is still shorted, it may be caused by damage to the CPU, and you need to remove the CPU and test again. If other 1.8V, 1.5V, 1.0V are abnormal, it is recommended to replace the corresponding voltage conversion IC.Damaged CPU or poor soldering can also cause a 3.3V short circuit or a situation where the control board won't power on. It is recommended to reheat and repair the CPU, and retest after cooling. If the fault still cannot be solved, it is recommended to try to replace the CPU. At the same time, it is recommended that you check the circuit on the back of the CPU for damage. Note that when replacing the CPU, the CPU is BGA ball mounted, so it cannot be pressed during soldering.If the voltage is normal and the indicator light on the board is not on, please check whether the 25Hz crystal oscillator is in good condition. If the 25Hz crystal oscillator element is damaged, the control board voltage display is normal, but it still cannot work, cannot read the IP, only the DDR light will flash.If the voltage is OK, the DDR LED is OK, but the external LED is solid red; you need to check the Flash or CPU. It is recommended to re-solder the flash pins or check if the CPU gets hot.2. The hash board is incomplete and the chain is dropped. First of all, it is recommended to replace the control board data cable and re-test. If the problem still, please check whether the electronic components around the data interface of the control board are normal.3. The network indicator light is faulty and the IP cannot be viewed. Please check if the network transformer is not soldered properly, it is recommended to re-solder and test. If the fault persists, it is recommended to replace the component. If the fault persists after replacement, the Ethernet transceiver must be checked.4. The control board cannot be upgraded with an SD card.Please check the SD card slot and rear resistor; if damaged, it is recommended to replace it directly.https://www.zeusbtc.com/share/share/control-board-sd-slot.jpg",
