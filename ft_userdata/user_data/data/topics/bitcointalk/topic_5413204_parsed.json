We have thousands of cryptos today in the market but no one could beat bitcoin or ETH. So if I have to hold on to a crypto for future gain, that will be bitcoin and ETH for me and nothing else to be honest.",

I would never recommend anyone to sell their property and invest in cryptocurrency.The top 10 cryptocurrencies according to the market cap on CMC have a bright future ahead. As @avikz said Bitcoin and Ethereum have a bright future which is true but I would like to add BNB also on this list. Backed by the biggest crypto exchange it has a big ecosystem like Ethereum. In this space, it is always advised to do your own research as it is your money that you would be investing, so choose wisely rather than following recommendations from other.",

You can still borrow some money and invest in the share market but in crypto market if you do the same you will get duped. Unless you are someone who can forget what he invest i wouldn't recommend investing in crypto market. Apart from Bitcoin I don't think any other cryptocurrency is worth the time and money. Start with small monthly amount like a self made SIP and continue to hold until you think you have achieved your profit margins. I am a believer of long time hold than trading and i would say you do the same as it is less risky.",

Second there are other cryptos in the market that have good potential. Bitcoin certainly is a good investment option to begin with and it is not the only option left at the moment.",

Well, if I am to answer your question I would first of all ask you what you mean by cryptocurrency. If you're talking about btc when you say crypto then I will say it worth it but not actually selling physical properties due to high volatility of crypto. But if you are referring to some other coins when you say crypto then I will say no and no. It doesn't worth selling physical properties for at all.",

The idea is not good for someone to invest his/her hard earned earnings into cryptocurrency. But the perception about cryptocurrency in India remains the same. In India a lot of people either understand it as a quick way to get rich. Thanks to a lot of MLM companies that have used Bitcoin as their primary product. Eventually it is a scam but as a Indian I would believe it if one of the MLM leader had a discussion with me as I am a newbie.This is happening to date and I know how it is happening. The problem is I we cannot report it as their is a long struggle to just get an issue debated with the sick indian judiciary system.",

While ETH has evolved into a POS currency. Bitcoin continues to be a POW currency. It will be great to see how these currencies now perform on 2 divergent paths..They both are totally different and yet unique in their own ways now. While the Ethereum ecosystem has been growing for quite some time now but its fiat value has not. Bitcoin on the other hand has grown because of its USD value which made many think it might be a way to become rich quickly. But in general, both have a chance to become the decentralized currency of the future.",

Anyone who does so does so at his own risk. Instead of selling your physical assets, invest in what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies are the only ones that guaranteed us a secure future provided we made the proper investments. By diversifying our investment plan, you achieve that. as 40% altcoins and 60% of bitcoin.",

On the other hand, investing in cryptocurrencies can be very volatile, the value of a particular currency can change rapidly and significantly.It's important to consider the relative stability and potential return of the two investments, as well as your personal risk tolerance before making a decision. Additionally, you should be aware of the taxes and legal implications of selling physical property, as well as the tax implications of investing in cryptocurrencies.It is always recommended to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to understand the implications of selling a physical property and investing in cryptocurrencies. And also, to diversify your investments, not putting all the eggs in one basket.Quote from: pakhitheboss on September 14, 2022, 02:41:23 AMThe important thing to remember when you enter the cryptocurrency space is that invest what you can afford to lose. I would never recommend anyone to sell their property and invest in cryptocurrency.NOTE the Point!",

      "body": "My advice is to never sell anything of value, physical property or even end up borrowing money to invest in cryptocurrency. Cryto is risky just as much as it can benefit you so it is never safe to be in a haste to invest because you see people making money from it. Invest with the money you feel you can afford to loose. Remember investing in bitcoin is much safer and offers less risk than investing in alt coins.",

Converting physical property into cryptocurrency can be risky, but some people have succeeded in this area. However, success in this field often depends heavily on luck. Even though I had my reservations, I converted physical property into cryptocurrency and ended up making a significant profit, around 5 times the initial investment, from BGB. Moreover, I also gained substantial profits from various meme coins..... Not financial advice. Always DYOR before making a financial decisions, especially in memecoins",
