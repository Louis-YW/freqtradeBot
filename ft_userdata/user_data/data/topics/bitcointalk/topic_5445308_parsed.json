If you are interested, please write PN.You are free to share the site name in a normal discussion, I wouldn't consider that advertising at all. Tons of people post their projects here to get feedback and discussion. The catch is that you'll have to be open to criticism on the project as well. When we can all talk freely about your project, then it's a discussion and not just an advertisement. So what's the site?",

The rate you are asking for just a banner space is too much in my opinion.One can easily get a lot of better ad spaces if one simply uses Google ads. What's so special about your website?

I have now forwarded all domains to this. In addition, advertising measures.You will have to operate Google yourself. Then you know the average.Why should I cheat someone if I can simply publish the advertising? It's not that I could book ten at the same time.

Your rates are too high compared to other legit and genuine advertising services.No, these are completely unrealistic assumption that show me that you have so far neither marketed an ICO nor have been able to switch any crypto advertising at all. First, Google does not accept such advertising. Second, you cannot simply calculate a normal Google Ads price of $ 0.20 to the clicks and compare with normal advertising for an online shop. As an ICO operator, I sometimes get bids over 15K for such an advertising. Larger portals much more. And it's worth it for both.",
