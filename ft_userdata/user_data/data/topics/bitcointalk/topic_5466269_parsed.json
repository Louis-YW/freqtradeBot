It is always necessary to do a self-check concerning any, especially sensitive, matter. One point to note, the way this scamming scheme works is cheeky. As far as I know, it seems there is no outrageous claim and promising returns or offers in the tweet, it is just simply a link to claim free NFT. So I don't think it is considered as lucrative offer or return.",

We should check the offers posted especially if that person is not actively posting any promotion so that we would know if we are been deceived or not.",

Oddly enough, they did not go for the usual \"doubling your ETH\" scam, because they probably knew it was too obvious in the eyes of the community, so decided to steal NFTs and tokens as well.Even if those hundreds of thousands could be easily paid back by Vitallik, I doubt he will, it would start a precedent which could be used to abuse his generosity in the future.",

My assumption is if twitter has poor security. The access to the account already restored by X and vitalik has been removing the phishing tweet from hacker. twitter and discord have very poor security.

There should be a investigation as of now. This might be a inside job or just a tuphical hacker attack. We know that vitalik is a smart person and probably think that he wouldn't be hacked, this is why people think that the link he just gave which is labeled as free is legit. People should have learned into not trust everyone even if it came from a verified and a smart people who hold the account. It's a sad accident but we know that it will be up to vitalik if he will be give back to the victims which is another risk since scammers will use that kind of trick to scam people again.

I agree with what Act said is easy to believe any information coming from a well-known influential person's account and also if the followers are most gullible enough to jump on an offer coming suddenly from those accounts you may make the worst choice since it is likely that the owner of the account is not the one you directly are dealing with so the bounce of the blames goes to the account owner who failed to protect their accounts most especially the verified accounts. X is one of the most targeted for recent attacks,  and users of that platform have been scammed severally due to this form of practice and at that just like we red flag most telegram deals,  same way we should stay away from such offers coming from Twitter or other social media. Everyone is busy losing money on Twitter since it changed to X and updates done,  even Elon musk carried out that his investment on x os in decline and negative mode right now,  x is not the best place to be right now not to consider any investment coming from their.
