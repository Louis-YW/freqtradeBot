      "body": "You might not remember how years ago everybody googled Dorian Nakamoto, but one of the reasons for every scammer claiming to be Satoshi is exactly that - popularity. Dorian wasn't a scammer, but his case showed these people how you can use people's curiosity. After all, we'd all want to know who Satoshi was. Have you noticed that whenever someone claims to be Satoshi, the press writes about it? You can be John Doe from Farmerville claiming to be the founder of Bitcoin and suddenly you're on Coindesk, CNBC, and so on... If you're notorious like Craig, you're going to be on Forbes, Wall Street Journal and invited to TV interviews. It allows these people to make money because their social media get hits, projects that list them as founders or advisors amass more followers, they can promote all the scams they want because they have a popular name that comes up when you perform google searches.",

By making noise and get attention of many people, they can become influencers, try to cooperate with scam projects and run scam fund raising, steal money from many victims.Being famous by claiming as Satoshi Nakamoto is only a very small part and small reason why they want to take spotlight. They are financial incentivized to do those invalid claiming even they know they will fail. But by making noise, it's already enough for them because they think with noise, they will open some new gates for their career in blockchain community.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and not one person can rise up to say they are the founder and would be taken seriously. They want the money, the fame, the accolades and the donations. They can't have it.They all have one thing in common a mental illness called Delusions of grandeur. QuotePatients with delusions of grandeur believe that they are wonderful, successful, more important than others, or even miraculous. They make assumptions that they have exceptional talents, possessions, or powers despite lack of evidence supporting these beliefs.https://www.medicinenet.com/what_is_a_delusion_of_grandeur/article.htm",

Those project will get media attention and investors due to satoshis fame. There is nominal chance that original satoshi will reemerge from the ghost so i assume he is dead or has no interest in going public.",

Fortunately, the Bitcoin protocol allows messages to be signed using the private key, so it is easy to prove the falsity of their claims, since no one among them or anyone else was able to sign a message from one of the addresses proven to be owned by Satoshi.Quote from: alastantiger on October 03, 2023, 03:12:55 PMRonald Keala Kua Maria Pakastani Bilal Khalid and his PR firm Ivy McLemore   Debo Jurgen Etienne GuidoJörg MoltCraig WrightPaul Calder Le RouxI think it is also possible to add Elon Musk to the list, since doubts were also swirling around him before it was confirmed that this was not true: Elon Musk Probably Invented Bitcoin",

Which other faketoshis do you know? And have you ever taken any of them seriously? Money should be the reason for these claims. They want to get attention so that they can become famous. After that, they simply monetize the fame by either founding a shitcoin, publishing a book, giving speeches and lectures, and sometimes getting funds from anti-bitcoin forces to attack the industry. I have read stories about some of them but I stopped giving them any attention because it is clear they are big-time liars. Charles Hoskinson claimed that he was Satoshi and when he saw that he had no proof he made a U-turn and said that he thinks Satoshi is Adam Back. Craig Wright is not yet tired of disgracing himself by his childish claims.",
