  "content": "Hello! I would like to do this small research in order to learn more about a small app I am working on.. Feel free to vote! Â People use twitter for many things. Most of the people who use twitter would like to have many followers.In order to get more followers, an user should post good content by interacting with other big profiles in order to get more exposure. (i.e replying to other big profile tweets)The problem: It takes timeOne who wants to be successful in increasing its followers count must be creative also...Here is where my app tries to connect people and solve this gap:Let's say you have a Twitter profile and want to focus it on Crypto niche. You enter the app, connect with Twitter (must be the profile account) and register a profile in the app.That profile you will register in the app will have information about how much you will pay for a tweet that you accept and the extra per likes, retweets and impressions.Lets say you register a Profile for 25 cents a tweet and 1 cent per like or retweets.Users who want to make some money will search through Twitter looking for good reply spots (or even plain tweets) and send a tweet proposal to the Profile above.The profile creator will see others users proposals of content and can accept or not. As soon he accepts the tweet proposal, the app will create and post the reply or tweet.Lets say that user A created the profile, user B sends the proposal to replying on Elon's tweet. User A accepts. User B gets paid once the payment cycle finishes.User B can make money by creating tweets. User A can acquire more followers and is fully responsible for its account posts, but don't have spend time looking for content to tweet.What do you guys think? I am already working on this for some time, but have never heard about what other people think. I will be my first client by the way haha!Thanks",

You would need to raise 2 Twitter profiles. You would also want to interact with people of this niche, right?If you use the app I am proposing, people who send the tweet proposals (replies in other tweets for example) will make sure that they are interacting with people from the niche you asked for, so the chances to get followers of this niche increase.",

I will be using stable coins for users spending and earnings. I take my profit by taking some % over paid tweets.Btw, Thanks for pointing out steemit! I once saw a forum based on it and people would earn from posting and getting their comments likedThat's not my app main intention though... I see that they have something called Smart Media Tokens, but still, I think that they are not comparable..In my app, people will pay for other users use his/her profile.Notifications will come through Telegram.. so if you have a profile registered in the app and someone wants to reply for elon's tweet, it is just a matter pressing the \"accept\" button on Telegram.Note that you will be shown Elon's tweet and what the user proposed as reply. Obiviously, you can reply it yourself, but by doing this, you will have to search tweets to reply for and think in something creative.The app delegates it for other users so you don't have to search tweets to reply nor tweet content to post.",

User who pays for tweets have 1 hour to accept reply proposals. Indeed, its similar to a shared virtual assistant haha.Btw, the user who accepts proposals is still in charge of his account and can interact with his replies.Regarding timing, actually, it will be a good idea to develop tools for users who propose as well. Like, \"notify me when Elon tweets\" in order to improve reply timing.",

But in general, it is very safe. I am using Django which is a solid Python web framework also.Quote from: SFR10 on November 15, 2022, 04:04:58 PMHow are you going to handle the users that intentionally reject good proposals [through your app or Telegram] while also using the exact same content directly through Twitter?Great question! It is a free market. if you propose it and notice that you got rejected, but the user is using your text manually, you can stop sending him proposals.. I will also create a score system based on how much the profile owner has paid for its proposers..There will be also another score system for proposers based on his metrics.. Lets say you have in total 1.000.000 impressions as proposer. your score will be higher than someone with 10.000 only. Some profiles will be able to only accept proposals from users with some good score. Aaand, proposers with higher scores will prefer to profiles which pay more.",
