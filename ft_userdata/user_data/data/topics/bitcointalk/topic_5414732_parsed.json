We publish updates on our twitter daily and also on our website. we had 165 participants in our latest draw and someone won the NFT valued at 0.8 BNB. So they done well.  what we are finding is people are reluctant to sell any sweep even though we have small holders for now.We are up 18 holders since yesterday. if we can build on that each day we will be in a good position. Our project is very new. we are in this for the long haul and will give it 100%.
