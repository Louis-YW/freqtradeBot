Can you please tell me what's the best decentralized casino out there? I have won on several non-KYC casinos and received the crypto withdrawal, but you never know what happens when you win a big amount. If you use a VPN while winning a large amount of money, they probably will ask you to verify your identity in case you use a VPN. Just imagine if you are a casino and you have the choice to pay a player 10K or let the person verify himself first and have a possibility to forfeit the withdrawal amount from the player. But maybe there are actually players from the Netherlands here who had personal experience with online crypto gambling. I still would like to know if that's the case. Thanks for your answer tho!",

That's why, never trust any centralized casino who are offering \"no-KYC\". Most common mistake newbie who don't want \"KYC\" they never read the term & condition.It's simple you just open term & condition and search with (CTRL + F) then type KYC. The topic will be show up not really take 5 mins.Back to the topic you're asking. I only know https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1492457.0 (Chain-bet) it's on chain betting for guessing the last digit block transaction. But they have a small bankroll only \"24 LTC\".However, until now there is no a scam allegation against them. Feel free to tried with a small balance, because I don't have experience with on-chain betting.",

The casinos i'm looking for are those that have Netent and Play n Go slots.It seems a little difficult to find a casino that has the criteria you said because even though there are some casinos that don't require KYC, when the user wins a large amount, it is certain that when making a withdrawal, the casino will still ask for KYC as proof and guarantee that the withdrawal transaction is really the original account owner, so it is not recommended to use a fake identity in a KYC.If you have found what kind of casino you want and later manage to win a sizable amount of money, it is better for you to withdraw in stages so you don't ask for a KYC.To use a VPN, there are actually several casinos that can be trusted and they allow their users to access by activating a VPN, but not many casinos provide such a policy.",

He can choose decentralized gambling sites to avoid KYC but there might be some centralized gambling sites who doesn't ask for or mandate it. Reading the Terms of service and asking a question in the casinos' ann thread is the key. He can also inquire directly inside the casinos customer support.",

And most likely you will not find among trusted online casinos that will not require you to confirm your identity and your income with a win/withdrawal amount of $10k, so it's better to try decentralized casinos, such as blockchainbets.club, which is actively developing and accepts USDT and ETH, and also does not require KYC, but I don't think they have there is a big bankroll.",
