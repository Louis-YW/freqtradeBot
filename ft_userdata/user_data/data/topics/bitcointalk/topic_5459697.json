  "content": "Hi to all,I hope to be clear and understandable in what I write. WHAT HAPPENED : A ban evasion charge has been filed against me (HedgeFX - https://bpip.org/Profile?id=2221175 ) regarding my \"Business\" account (P2PFinder - https://bpip.org/Profile?id=1047338) - Here accusation: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5394559.msg62537818#msg62537818 WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT P2PFinder: As i wrote, P2Pfinder was created as a \"Business Account\" just with the hope to promote a trading service. The kind of service offered wasn't appreciated and results wasn't good too. P2PFinder never scammed anyone (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1047338), but trading results was bad, and this idea was abandoned. Account Was Banned in 2020 - So about 2 year after i registered and started to post with HedgeFx. I don't know the real reason for ban, but i think it was due to some PM i sent to some users or plagiarims (maybe against HedgeFX???) - No message or warnig was sent about ban. I discovered this only at early 2021.WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT HedgeFx: HedgeFx was created as personal account. For a while it offered the same service as  P2PFinder, but then due to poor results the idea was abandoned and all service was suspended more thand 3 years ago. When I created HedfeFx account I could have chosen any Usermane, but I chose HedgeFX precisely because I didn't scam or fool anyone and and I liked to keep my name as promoted on P2PFinder. Account was registered on June 2018 ((https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1047338) and it became my only account, as I preferred to use my name directly to offer my trading services.WHY HEDGEFX SHOULD NOT BE BANNED Simply because HedgeFx registered his account and started posting on the forum long before P2Pfinder was banned. No intention to evade or circumvent the rules has been placed in the behavior of Hedgefx. If HedgeFx had wanted to evade the ban or break the rules, it would have been enough to choose another name instead of Hegdefx. PROOF THAT THE BAN HAPPENED AFTER HEDGEFX REGISTRATION Here a screenshot in wich you can see clearly the reference year of the Ban and the possible reason. I have obscured the second part of the email code for privacy reasons and to prevent other people from using this email to make requests.CONCLUSION  There was no intention to evade the BAN. The accounts posted at different times and before the BAN. I hope I have been exhaustive enough, and I remain available for any advice.",

It does not matter which account was created before the other as long as two accounts were linked together and one of it was already banned from the forum, then it's an automatic ticket for ban evasion, it's not the account that was being banned but the person in charge of the control of the two accounts connected, i expect you to have known this that ban evasion is not a negotiable business on the forum, but you may try you luck by sending a ban appeal to the provided email displayed.",

You admit the ownership to both account which means the two account is connected and will share ban punishment. You are now posting outside the Meta and blatantly breaking the ban evasion rule. I think you are just attracting the mods to ban your current account with this ban appeal request since you already commit the violation before you file an appeal. Still Good luck to you.",

Try contacting cryptios via the mail given in this topic. But don't expect a reply, I don't think they has access to a 3 years old report.",

If one of your accounts is banned, then all the others are automatically considered ban evaders—regardless of when they were created or which account was registered first. If your account has been banned due to plagiarism, I highly doubt that there will be any possibility of having your ban lifted.",

I think it's sending unsolicited PMs. I don't see any posts that are plagiarized on P2pfinder's post history. Maybe OP forgot about negative tags and how it is used when someone found a scammer. I am quite surprised when OP explained why HedgeFXl shouldn't be banned when using different account even when you have other account that is banned is considered as ban evasion even no matter what forum name or username someone use.",

Even first offenders don't get banned if there's crystal clear evidence. Basically, P2Pfinder / HedgeFX got his initial punishment already by getting P2Pfinder banned and after that, HedgeFX learned from that mistake. In my opinion, there's enough punishment already by banning P2Pfinder. I'm not a friend of this ban evasion rules anyways, especially because it has been enforced on a very irregular basis and it's pointless for this autoban bullshit anyways. And with all those first offender accounts still not banned, banning HedgeFX and basically giving a double punishment to OP, would be very inconsistent in my opinion. My position: no ban for HedgeFX.  Just my 2 sats.",

Even first offenders don't get banned if there's crystal clear evidence. Basically, P2Pfinder / HedgeFX got his initial punishment already by getting P2Pfinder banned and after that, HedgeFX learned from that mistake. In my opinion, that is not consistent with the ban being to the person, not the account. That's why banned people are only allowed to create an alt to appeal their ban.What do first time offender cases have to do with this one of someone who has already been banned?In the case of this thread we are talking about a full member account, which at a good pace can take 4 months to return to that rank with a new account, so we could understand that he has received a temporary punishment of 4 months. However, following what you say, being banned would take no punishment, especially for low-ranked accounts. So a newbie or jr member who is banned, to escape the ban they would just have to create another account. What would be the punishment they would receive?",

Based on my observation, there was no scam, cheat, crime etc that related with unethical or illegal activities. You've ask many loans and paid it accordingly. Currently, I see you're a good person and could be trusted.I think permanent banned isn't really a fair punishment, I'd say temporary signature ban for 1-2 years are enough.",

From what I can tell it all started with him coming to the (incorrect) conclusion that you are behind or involved in some kind of TRON Ponzi scheme, which he made from needlessly digging around in the affairs of lenders. When his conclusions were proven to be baseless, he started looking for other ways to assail your character, eventually digging up your connection to this P2PFinder account. You've been very upfront about the nature of your former business and what happened with it, and it seems to have very little to do with what you do on the forum now. You're not part of a sig campaign, your alt appears to have been banned at least a few years ago, and you've maintained a good reputation since then. Granted, continuing on with an alt account after your first account was banned wasn't an ideal course of action, but I don't think casual forum users should be expected to have intricate knowledge of the forum rules in that regard. Hopefully your first account will be unbanned even if you have no further plans to use it.",

It took us (the Croatian board) 2 years to successfully appeal a ban for one of our quality members. On the other hand, other users who committed the same mistakes got reinstated quickly or weren't bad at all. I am guessing knowing the right admin or having contact with them over whatever social media they use can speed things up.",
