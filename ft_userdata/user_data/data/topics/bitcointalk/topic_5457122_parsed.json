  "content": "In this topic I will tell you about two camps; people who like Bitcoin and people who like Gold. So, Hold Bitcoin or Hold Gold ?. We will see from several aspects; Historical, Creator, Supply, Environmental Issue, and Monetary Function.Between Gold and Bitcoin BTC First, let's look at the historical side. Of course, Gold's history is much longer than Bitcoin's. Gold has existed since this world was created. Even thousands of years ago. Gold has been used as money and a medium of exchange since 550 BC in Lydia. While Bitcoin has only existed since January 2009. So Bitcoin historical data is not as far and long as gold.  The second, we see from side of the creator. The creator of Gold is the universe, and the scientists believe gold came from meteorites that rained down on the earth 200 million years after the earth was formed. While Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto , we still don't know who this Satoshi Nakamoto really is. He could be very smart person, It could be an institution, it could be a community group, or even it could be a creation of AI or Artificial Intelligence (My wild thought). We never know who Satoshi Nakamoto is. Bitcoins are man made, it's man-made. But Bitcoins cannot be re-created or increased in number (The Supply). The third we will compare the amount of supply. Exactly how much is the maximum amount of gold supply?. We don't know, It could be suddenly find so many new gold sources that can be mined, so when there is additional supply, the assets will no longer be rare and worthless, so in the end the price goes down. While Bitcoin, the maximum supply is only 21 million coins and cannot be added again forever, This is what makes Bitcoin become so rare.  The fourth is environmental issue. Well, environmental issues are becoming an important issue in the 21st century. Many parties (included some companies or firms) are vying to reduce their carbon footprint. For example, China has a carbon-free target by 2060. Mining gold from deep within the earth has a tremendous impact on the environment. And this is irreversible damage, while Bitcoin when compared to gold is more environmentally friendly, Because Bitcoin can be mined using renewable energy or cheaper energy. Bitcoin mining does not permanently damage the environment. In fact, there is no damage at all to Bitcoin mining activities. Because it happens on a computer network.  Fifth, let's look at the monetary function. Even though gold is real money, money from the universe. And it was once considered money. But in the 21st century, gold has no monetary function. In the 21st century, gold is impractical, not portable ( as I said before in my last topic in Bitcoin Discussion) , and instead of making transactions easier, if we use gold , it makes transactions in this digital era more difficult. Wealth in the form of gold is not easy to move, especially across countries, during disasters, or wars. While Bitcoin makes transactions easier, because it can be done quickly through the Lightning Network, it can even cross countries. Bitcoin is also easily broken down to 1 satoshi, 1 satoshi is 0.000000001 Bitcoin, Zero by zero eight times behind. Bitcoins are also portable, Very easy to carry everywhere, because it's digital, can be accessed anywhere, the important thing is that we know our phrase. The price (value) of Bitcoin everywhere must be the same around the world, and as I said, the number of Bitcoins is limited, while the maximum amount of Gold supply is still unknown. Then about the risk, If this risk context is financial value, Gold is definitely very safe, Because the price is more stable and less volatile, but that doesn't mean there's no risk in saving gold, The risk of storing Gold is that the first is a thief, Yup, gold is very easy to steal. Why in ancient times did many kingdoms attack each other? Of course they were looking for gold. For example, in 215 BC, Rome stole gold from Macedonia, or after the Nazi fell, the gold was divided equally between America, Britain and France. Hmm, isn't it kind of theft too?. Gold storage is also difficult, to store large amounts of gold, you need a special place, tight security, and other thing, it's hard to move Gold in large quantities. Bitcoin is here as a solution to all of that. Bitcoins cannot be stolen. The Bitcoin network also can't be hacked.Well, I think that’s all information about Hold Bitcoin VS Hold Gold. I really want to give you more informations, But I think it will be boring if the thread become so long to read, So I stopped, but also I think it’s a good way too for opening a discussion. I hope this thread could be a good discussion to expand our information and knowledge (well, inspite of there are people also said that News isn’t a Knowledge, I dont agree with that).I also have a long answer of these questions : - Why Bitcoin can't be hacked? - So when is the right time to buy Bitcoin?

      "body": "It is not one or another imo. Gold and bitcoin both have their place in the financial system. (or outside the system) Bitcoin is fundamentally better than gold but it has one flaw. It is still digital. The problem with this is, we still live in a physical world (no metaverse isn't going to change that and the internet hasn't changed that.) and when/if everything goes down, believe it or not, bitcoin will go down too. The chance of that happening is pretty slim but if it happens, gold will still be up and running.Bitcoin has almost every layer of safety to protect you from a financial crisis. Gold on the other hand has one more. Gold goes to eleven.",

      "body": "I think this topic is very essential to discuss because I saw some users here are taking about investing in Bitcoin by selling gold or Jewelry.Here I am adding some points which should be noted before making any decision.1. Obviously in Long term Bitcoin is much profitable and it has a limited supply. So day by day it's demand and price will increase if no extreme situation happens.  Bitcoin can't assure you a safe and profitable investment because if you invest when it's price is at ATH then you may see a very bad dump at the bear market. But if you buy in deep market then you may have a unbelievable gain than Gold. Again if any major exchange or online wallet have been hacked or any major bad news arrive then market can be cashed extremely.2. Gold is much valuable and precious and day by day it's price is also moving up but slowly. And there is no limited supply of Gold. It's not much volatile as like Bitcoin and can't be. Again here is lower risks and lower profits. And there is no risk linke dumping Gold's price extremely at a sudden period.So what I will choose? I will obviously choose Bitcoin investment as it's much profitable and secured but not all the funds or selling all the jewelries. I will invest in Bitcoin a specific amount of total assets. And obviously I will try to choose the right time to invest in. Though it's can't be predicted accurately.",

Especially nowadays, technology is very much prioritized, so if we want to send or exchange assets, we only use computers and networks.

However, I believe that Bitcoin would be the preferable choice or at the very least, it has the potential to make greater profits.

Bitcoins are also portable, Very easy to carry everywhere, because it's digital, can be accessed anywhere, the important thing is that we know our phrase. The price (value) of Bitcoin everywhere must be the same around the world, and as I said, the number of Bitcoins is limited, while the maximum amount of Gold supply is still unknown. Then about the risk, If this risk context is financial value, Gold is definitely very safe, Because the price is more stable and less volatile, but that doesn't mean there's no risk in saving gold, The risk of storing Gold is that the first is a thief, Yup, gold is very easy to steal.

Bitcoin is here as a solution to all of that. Bitcoins cannot be stolen. The Bitcoin network also can't be hacked.Well, I think that’s all information about Hold Bitcoin VS Hold Gold. I really want to give you more informations, But I think it will be boring if the thread become so long to read, So I stopped, but also I think it’s a good way too for opening a discussion. I hope this thread could be a good discussion to expand our information and knowledge (well, inspite of there are people also said that News isn’t a Knowledge, I dont agree with that).I also have a long answer of these questions : - Why Bitcoin can't be hacked? - So when is the right time to buy Bitcoin?

That's why gold bugs are mostly older people, in contrast with Bitcoin, which is mostly being held by the younger investors. Gold, silver and other precious metals' prices are very stable, doesn't fluctuate a lot, by far not so volatile as Bitcoin, therefore less opportunity for huge growth and gains. Just my 2c.",

I want my money invested in the technology and you may already know how gold works and if you are around bitcoin community for long enough or if you just can see the potential of bitcoin you will also pass on gold. Bitcoin is the future for me, gold is not potential but rather a piece of jewelry for women.",
