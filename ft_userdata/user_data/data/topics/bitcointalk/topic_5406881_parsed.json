  "content": "QuoteGambling is part of Chinese culture. It is seen as the right way to test luck, especially on holidays like Chinese New Year, as well as to get rid of bad luck.link-I was quite surprised when I read this article for the first time because they gamble not for money or pleasure but because of the culture to test luck.this does sound funny but what do you do if it turns out that your culture requires you to play gambling?slightly diverting from the topic above, I'm interested in Mark Griffiths' research;QuoteMark Griffiths, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University who specializes in addictive behavior says that gamblers have a lot of motivation for their habit.In a survey of 5,500 gamblers, the prospect of ‚Äúwinning big money‚Äù was the strongest factor. But then followed by \"because it's fun\" and \"because it's fun\".\"Even when you lose a gamble, your body still produces adrenaline and endorphins,\" he says.‚ÄúPeople buy entertainment.‚ÄùNot much is known about the design of these machines on player behavior, but, for example, many machines and casinos use red or something similar ‚Äì which is considered more stimulating.And interestingly, there are examples of cases where gamblers develop ‚Äúshadow-skills‚Äù as a justification for earning those possible rewards.Griffiths gave the example of a game engine in the UK which was designed with the adaptive logic in mind that the device would deliver more than the consumer was given over a period of time, and after that the device would return to the normal system.This means that some players will try to find (or ‚Äúskim‚Äù) machines that have not hit the jackpot, hoping they will be there when the machine hits the jackpot.All of these research findings conclude that gambling is not always about winning, but rather the process of betting ‚Äì and the other factors surrounding it that make it fun.Although gambling addiction cannot be explained simply ‚Äì sometimes there are many reasons that lead to addiction in a person ‚Äì but it is certainly interesting to see how the fun is related to the structure and style of the game played.And even when gambling isn't a problematic obsession, it's still entertaining for those who go home with empty pockets.link-I am interested in making this topic because the debate between gambling for money or entertainment is still very long, now I add that some people gamble to practice skills and also because it has become their culture (like the Chinese people)btw, if you have a lot of free time you should read this topic too;The Gambler's Fallacy (The key to unbiased gambling)Psychological Technique - Play without PressureKeeping A Record Of Your Losses Will Make You Realize To Stop GamblingGambling and health ü§ïsymptomsThe Paradox of Gambling behaviorGreatest Gambling Losers",

So obviously, I will agree that it is part of their culture already. So I'm not shock by the article, they've been into gambling that really someone will what to test their luck to see if they are indeed going to get rich through gambling or have some money. And yeah, we've also discussed the entertaining aspect of it, for pure joy and fun, like playing roulettes or slot machines.",

That is a detail to the story i am interested in knowing. For me, my culture says nothing about gambling and doesn't require me to try anything to prove my luck. For the Chinese, I don't think it is a must for everyone. You will be inclined to try out your luck gambling if you subscribe to your culture and it's practice, but if you have been westernised, and do not subscribe to culture, even if you gamble still, your intentions will be more than juat wanting to try out your luck.",

They avoid eating hot or cold food depending on the time of day. They have a number of quirks that are interesting.The biggest revenue stream in video gaming is micro transaction based coupled with loot boxes. Many game developers were forced to abandon lootboxes due to it being regulated under gambling. But casinos and gambling institutions have no such limitation. I like the idea of expanding on small cap gambling for those who wish only to \"test their luck\". Its very negative when someone loses a life changing amount of money gambling. If a person loses $20,000 that is terrible. Small cap gambling involving very small amounts of money are a healthier precedent. It may also be more profitable if people know they will be protected from losing larger sums of money under a micro transaction and extreme low minimum wager environment.",

Unfortunately most of the people gamble because of that hidden subconscious thought that they will make a \"big hit\" and they will win big money without any efforts. This is basically your \"monkey mind\" playing tricks on you. I remember that the subconscious mind was called \"monkey mind\" by buddhism and keeping your monkey mind under control is the most important part of growing as a person.I'm no expert in Chinese culture and we have to ask some Chinese guy about the theory of gambling being a big part of Chinese culture.My culture definitely doesn't require me to gamble.

Plus, it is still understandable if others considered gambling simply because they enjoyed or just trying to test out their luck. People have different backgrounds and kinks just like the Chinese. Heck, there are even lots of POGO here in our country where the majority of them are Chinese owners.- https://www.pagcor.ph/regulatory/offshore-gaming.php",
