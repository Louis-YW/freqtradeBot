Thank you in advance!Still the same for altcoins bounty campaigns but if you're talking about services and platforms that pay Bitcoin do check the respective campaign rules and qualifications, casino based bounty campaigns should be active in the gambling board, based on your post history you are a good and balanced poster but you should know the best section to create your thread I don't think this topic belongs in this section unless you are offering your signature space for rent.",

You should start by giving contribution here in the forum instead of aiming the signature campaign participation because no manager will accept you with your current status.  Your topic should be move to servce discussion you are asking about a service and you are not offering one.For starter, Start to earn minimum required merits in able to be qualified to apply.

Thank you in advance!I understand that you are back after a long time so you may not know that you need to be active poster and need merits in the last 120 days etc but you should know \"Where to get the signature campaigns?\"  Being a hero member, you should be aware in which section you would see the signature campaigns and in which section you will find bounties. Nothing changed in that part but your asking this question makes me surprised and i wonder many suspicious things in my mind:Quote from: lucifur on August 09, 2023, 03:52:11 PMEither this account is hacked or newly bought by someone new to the forum and doesn't have an idea on how things work here.Has the password been changed for this account?

I see no password changes, which is a slight positive for him.OP first focus on contributing in the forum. If you dare apply right now for any Bitcoin paying signature campaign, chances are almost zero that you will get a spot if a campaign manager looks at your post history.",

To the OP I would say that in order to participate in signature campaigns you should be posting on the forum regularly, every day or almost for a month, I would say. And with posts of a certain quality that earn merits, as many campaigns require a minimum of merits earned in the last few months in order to join.",

If the funds are returned he survives a red tag for now IMO. The funds were sent to a wallet that is more than 3 years old and would show me he controls it if the funds are returned.

Like is he for real!I haven't been in the forum for that much of a long time but am sure the service board precedes the introduction of the merit system (someone can correct me if am wrong) and a hero account even in that era ought to know where to look for signature campaigns wether or not it being 5 years away from the forum.  QuoteCan some tell me what are the current qualifications to join some campaign and how/where to get them? Anyway, welcome back to the forum I don't know how long you've being away,  not much has changed and as an old member getting back on track for you shouldn't be of a difficulty. Check the service board for signature campaigns, depending on the CM the rules differs but at least you must attain 5 merits in the last 120days for you to be eligible to apply for a signature campaign. You can help yourself with other rules that applies by going through the different signature campaigns. Good luck mate!",
