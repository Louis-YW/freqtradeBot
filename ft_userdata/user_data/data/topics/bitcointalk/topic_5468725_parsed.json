Tron was charging very low fee, This is true.

I have not used for some months and not aware now how much fee Tron charging for one transaction",

The bridge swap service itself can be paid for with a token; and if I remember correctly, there are only a few bridges through which you can pay the commission with the native token of the blockchain in which your token is swapped. This is terribly inconvenient, but these are the realities of cross-chain transfers/swaps.",

On ethereum, there is cowswap which allows some tokens to be swapped and fees be paid in token itself, I am not active in trx ecosystem, and if there was any such possibility hence the question. 10 trx is not enough for anything. At first I had 21 trx, went to sunswap and initiated the exchange, it took away all balance and transaction failed. The fuck? So I converted other crypto to trx via instant exchange, and went to exchange again, for approval transaction it again took 21 trx (~1$) and for actual swap transaction it needed 110 something trx ($10) to complete it which ofc I would refuse to do. So then I converted my usdt to matic via instant exchange now I'm at peace.",

Have said in one of comments prior I had 21 trx in wallet, went to swap on sunswap transaction failed and all my balance were deducted, at least dapp should be considerate to say what's minimum required beforehand. Regarding faucets, they are useless, literal pennies they give and headache extra with all ads and shit. I created thread in altcoin marketplace requesting funds, however eventually solved it on my own.
