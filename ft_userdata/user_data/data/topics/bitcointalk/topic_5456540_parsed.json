Today we don't only have ETH and BSC as blockchains with smart contract functionality. We now also have projects like Polygon, Solana, Arbitrum and others which are all fast, have low fees and they are all offering smart contracts.",

Im not seeing a lot of benefits offered by tron. Indeed, Tron' ecosystem hasnt been all sunshine, has it? The allure of low-cost transactions doesnt fully offset the high ratio of dapp failures. Without flourishing projects, whats a blockchain worth? Regarding the Oikos-Justin Sun feud - it does cast a shadow over the platform's reputation, no?Lets not forget, a blockchain' worth extends beyond its native token. USDT on Tron is handy, but its only a fragment of Tron' potential reach.True, Tron isnt flawless. The intricate wallet activation versus ETH', for instance, is a challenge. But, dismissing Tron outright? Even giants stumble, wouldnt you agree?",

Negligible transaction feesThat's the only advantage of Tron I know about and  that's not because I am a regular Tron user. It is because binance has the lowest USDT withdrawal fees when you use this network. So I used it many times while withdrawing my USDT to another exchange. However I am not familiar with the other points which you posted but if it is as good as you said, then tron will be a major player in crypto in the future. In the end Justin Sun is a billionaire and he is not going to bet on a losing horse. More competition is always better. ETH shouldn't be the only game in town.",

Without it, we might not have heard of that blockchain, so with the decrease in transaction fees on the Ethereum network, I expect USDT to move to that blockchain, or rather, that the trading volumes there will be higher, and therefore Tron will slowly die after that.Quote from: coinremitter on June 16, 2023, 10:40:03 AM1.

Scalability to manage a higher volume of transactionsDo you know about all these benefits or any other you want to add on? and which payment processor are you using to transact tron?I guess it's just some basics, most of crypto have this capability or capacity already, and what you mentioned, all of this thing they are competing against each other. As for the fees, not sure though, it seems that Tron is also getting expensive as well as compare to other cryptos.Used them though because of USDT, and again my only complain is that sometimes the fees are not consistent.I know that there are alternatives, and so yes, I will have to look into it and maybe ditch Tron. But for those who invested on it, then I hope that it will have a good run in the next bull cycle.",

I believe the Tron team should invest more on establishing the longevity plans for this platform for people to have confidence in holding this coin for long-term purposes.",

There's no contest about its usage and demand with USDT transactions on TRC20 and that's one advantage that you mentioned which is like a combination of most of all.",

There must be something that I haven't seen and not be able to do, maybe it is going to end up with something that is a bit more different and that could be the issue, but for the time being I do not really see it change all that much.
