Financial institutions with trillions of dollars might just seize this opportunity to step in. We all know that the Halving will happen soon. And remember when the price of bitcoin crashes, the SEC or other institutions have arranged it all to get a cheap price. and now is the peak, where everyone together buys Bitcoin and causes a bull run. Bitcoin is decentralized, no one can fully regulate it even the government. There are still many mysterious big holders and they are not controlled by anyone. We'll see how the game ends, I hope the ending will be beneficial for Bitcoin. Ahead of the halving, there is a lot of manipulation that will happen",

There are asset managing companies, and they are seeking institutional approval. On its own, it's a totally normal, natural thing. They might get their approvals or get rejected, but the government isn't taking over anything if the companies themselves apply to be regulated. Also, asset management companies being regulated doesn't give any control over Bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency to the authorities, I think.This idea only works if one believes, and I think the op is stating, that big corporations are actually controlled by the government, but I don't believe in that.",

My thinking goes in the similar line. Because the current movement of the US government shows their two different faces. They are approving the ETFs while grilling the a long standing and reputable exchange. So it's not very surprising to think that the government is playing games to assume control over crypto market in US. But fortunately, this is very difficult to execute due to the decentralised nature of the bitcoin network. So I would say let the game begin and we will see who's the winner.

Although they can't really control Bitcoin they want to make some money off of it and hold as much money controlled as they can. Luckily, the market is too large so they can't get hold of much outside their 'range'. I personally do not trust any kind of government or people 'above' but we will see are these speculations what we think they are.Hopefully, they wont get what they want so we can at least have Bitcoin used freely and uncontrolled(which is why we use it), like we have had it for years.",

      "body": "Well, the government and their political nature are always applicable to every area that they want, as long as it contributes to their strength and gives them more power. Bitcoin can never be controlled; the only way they can try and stop some circulating coins is by creating a centralized system, allowing people to trust that system, and then they will strike. I feel that's what the government is trying to do. Since they have tried quite a few means to regulate Bitcoin but have not succeeded, they will keep trying until they achieve success. I don't think they care about any business they destroy just to archive their desire; they don't even care how long it takes them. Bitcoiners just need to trade cautiously, avoid centralized platforms, avoid KYCs, and trade your Bitcoin on a P2P Dex platform.",

What I mean is, Bitcoin or entire crypto space is decentralised meaning any sort of infrastructure that is built will be using decentralised power thus creating that perfect GAP between them and their controlling methods. They might be able to impose the rules and regulations but they would be limited and within the boundaries of jurisdiction they are in. Whether they bring in big companies, whale investors and bankers, at the end they will reach a border of decentralisation and realise that they can’t do anything here. The point is proven.

They could have banded together when bitcoin was low, so they didn't have to spend a lot of money just to gain control.

Which in not surprising as this is very common. But if the government is involved in this, then there has to be a master plan behind all of it. Their main goal is to get back the control over what they are unable to control. If that's the case here, then we will see more allied countries to join hands and do the same. Then again, why should anyone use something that is not in their control? Binance, SEC, government - None of them puts any threat towards Bitcoin. If you are a Bitcoin hodler, then what seems to be the problem? Take a hardware wallet and store it in there. Your key, your coins. Do you think Binance is any good? It is also centralized. So staying away from something like this is the best choice in my opinion.",

It's not about getting your own exchange that gives these people control over bitcoin and cryptocurrency adjacent, it's the fact that they are slowly buying out large amounts of cryptocurrency from regular joes and exchanges that's concerning here. They basically are vying for the 51% power dynamic which will work so well with decentralized assets like bitcoin in this case. If they were to buy a significant portion of bitcoin on the market they basically have full control over its price and can very well pump and dump it however they so please. You can't be so sure about these entities not being able to control bitcoin in the future since we even have whales here who the price of bitcoin is tethered to. If they suddenly power tripped and sold their assets a significant plummet will happen and we'll be affected by it. The same could happen with these shadow people buying off large portions of bitcoin in the process.",
