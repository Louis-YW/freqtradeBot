The problem is the trading fees as jackg mentioned but it shouldn't be a big problem on networks like BNB Chain and other Ethereum alternatives.",

Obviously, CEX will ask for you to do a KYC, but they have liquidity.On the other hand, DEX, no documents to produce, pure P2P, and you have control of your coins as you have the PK.So it's really just a matter of which one you prefer, and it's really very difficult to pick I would say. Others wanted to protect their privacy, but it's very very hard to trade on DEX.",

And different exchanges should also be considered as a tool to see if users can easily access them, if only looking at the quality of ex to find opportunities, I find it very hype.I see nowadays most projects are easily accessible to different exchanges, so if there is no good product, listing and pumping is only a short-term trend.",

Just that Centralized exchanges would probably offer a lot more QOL at the cost ofc of some things, such as KYC, which I think a LOT of people don't mind, or regardless if they DO mind, they'd still use it just because it'd probably be a lot easier on their part compared to using DEX. There's also the issue of fees which vary so take that into consideration as well when picking between two.",

So, if there is a solution for high gas fee it could solve half of the problem of decentralized exchange. I personally mainly use Binance and Indodax (Indonesian Exchange), the only dex I used is PancakeSwap and thats like once in a month or two.",

So far, Binance is the best, very suitable for investors who really want to keep assets ready to invest. It's good to save more money since they charge less fees than decentralized exchange, but centralized exchange is never a safe place to hold your coins. Actually centralized exchange is the worst place to hold your coins including Binance or other top exchange.Quotewhile dexswap is a simple exchange but vulnerable to security, here we have to be careful with what is connected to our wallet, because it could be a virus to gain access to the wallet.Not all DEX is actually DEX, I'd say those DEX which run beside BTC network is still centralized since it can be hacked.",

To reiterate, I as a user prefer decentralized exchanges...Decentralized exchanges give you more freedom. You own keys of your coins but with decentralized exchanges, scams are more common with rug pulls. Scam teams can raise funds, add liquidity on DEX, and after they sell their team token, they make rug pulls to exit. You can not find them and your token will have zero value after a rug pull.For centralized exchanges, you can have better trading volume and less risk of rug pull. However, one of worst things on centralized exchanges is you don't own keys of your coin. If a CEX exits, you lose your coin too.DEX: rug pull.CEX: scam exit.And on CEX, you might lose your personal documents from KYC too.",
