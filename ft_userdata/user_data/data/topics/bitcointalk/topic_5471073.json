Each card of this edition will have a BTC face value equivalent to 50‚Ç¨ (0.00196186BTC for this edition), allowing you to track the progress of this magic internet moneyThis edition is also an opportunity for artists in the crypto community to express themselves and share their vision of the crypto universe. Every quarter, we will collaborate with a different artist, offering a diversity of styles and perspectives over time.Each month during the quarter, a new design from this artist will be featured on a series of cards, making each edition limited and collectible. The Timeline edition will be buyer funded. You can load your card if you want to. There is also a special feature with the cards. These were exceptionally created for october with the polymerbit hologramFor this first quarter, the supply will be 42 cards per month. In addition to that, 1 artist proof card will be produced per design, and offered to the artist. We reserve the right to modify and adjust the supply for next quarters, if we see that too many people are not able to get a card. This quarter, we have the pleasure to work with mx12.levins and release the first Timeline card edition for Q4 October 2023.Icarus Timeline Edition 10/2023 (designed by mx12.levins)üîêüï∞Ô∏èCode:TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.1 ¬† ¬† :bc1qkfmd5u3alc7c207mfjjmxs05yhrku0nt785r6rTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.2 ¬† ¬† :bc1quezdwh9wq7d7gcxwqgvafdgalyyqy3glj6rc0cTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.3 ¬† ¬† :bc1qvattj0azq4n90jqt37yh28u5n5aqx2c8kt7c60TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.4 ¬† ¬† :bc1qq7ys7djdnsjpttu3nrwanrjurmcn38h6d6lyl9TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.5 ¬† ¬† :bc1qxka85m9tap54essvaw2vu70mgencvjplh90rkqTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.6 ¬† ¬† :bc1qe52s64a8nwq34r33g4aaekjr7hpg4rhljvwqesTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.7 ¬† ¬† :bc1qvgl7cuk0v4ajpscufpnghe422uscx0pq6hkxfpTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.8 ¬† ¬† :bc1q8tzqjrwu6229xd2dts7lq5vrl85gnsn604pramTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.9 ¬† ¬† :bc1q7qczl9vwezn0n69p70w4n2k25e4qqqlrm5etp9TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.10 ¬† ¬† :bc1qarahxl67fw4tnvpt3zcu0f06vh5pnvdvnaqwk2TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.11 ¬† ¬† :bc1qlt3txpqschgxs0q9f4nccutkz4apqlf2x7j9zgTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.12 ¬† ¬† :bc1qeklgy5y0sq70k00sr75pg7lujvlsdfqg28laezTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.13 ¬† ¬† :bc1qy4tk24xkx872s9pu02ha60p06fe45xpshjsxf9TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.14 ¬† ¬† :bc1qpsqa0gd37hr0wg8e6qekns3udgey2fdfuwrdm5TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.15 ¬† ¬† :bc1qn42crfwylz3gwxmq356avuc7hxfaxghd2knhnmTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.16 ¬† ¬† :bc1q2swxl2ka42qwhrszw6wluw096s24z7640dfvvwTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.17 ¬† ¬† :bc1qzhm665l28qmaharz30vjwadtkeajf237aywty4TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.18 ¬† ¬† :bc1qczah7yt3feafvr4vph26nxeer0p0zm5tua8mysTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.19 ¬† ¬† :bc1qy05qt2sgvyz4ajm2h58kyy20cetrylps03729nTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.20 ¬† ¬† :bc1q9ug0rvkguwkj4vw4zqp0gah5hqp0u98u4u6409TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.21 ¬† ¬† :bc1q7wnmzrhlneazgwee0wxvjrd8kfyfc33hxzsglzTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.22 ¬† ¬† :bc1qh38r6dd6z2r7fx4y7vtnxz59j2a6hd203ja5nhTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.23 ¬† ¬† :bc1qmuvgggpup4dyssefahwmgvyal38x7efcp3rnjyTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.24 ¬† ¬† :bc1qxgz8v2jt6gtyqamzejqluwec28uh36ndxw4ng5TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.25 ¬† ¬† :bc1q7gcdpuhte65nz9x9a6qu47tj58l37dfqwpupshTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.26 ¬† ¬† :bc1qf7qrtzczq6rfmrzap4k2sdpsjsp6h6qhzn4752TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.27 ¬† ¬† :bc1qv0xgq287n40nwsha85h4d6c9szgwt8y0lfh5eeTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.28 ¬† ¬† :bc1ql5pnvrkfljfnnnvw77c5ja4ghy5yqryk83zc54TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.29 ¬† ¬† :bc1qt64vuacz5j9gga3ajrcw58nd3y7u9w9p74mnrlTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.30 ¬† ¬† :bc1q28wrehg5p4dyx5vf0vl3t7nfxpw524ml7wfhk6TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.31 ¬† ¬† :bc1q793gp0kyag88lsrsn9mezwr9j5aq4dqu3a09stTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.32 ¬† ¬† :bc1q26837dpu05slx548j6sj32avj7lg6pjh8m5wnzTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.33 ¬† ¬† :bc1qksl4pzcf4v3dz6ej0lk774huzxk4y4wvjy5vu0TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.34 ¬† ¬† :bc1qm4e4a3za7ke9r288eengmzgu2pa3ytymzgqtudTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.35 ¬† ¬† :bc1q24d764flnca3s6d858tpv5z78f79pvvwz3r4xgTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.36 ¬† ¬† :bc1qt7zk0rw84qkek9zdmk99uun9taad4ptf5mj326TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.37 ¬† ¬† :bc1qlmtk7kmlu4eruyeyjsc8se6yvryu5pksnmmknpTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.38 ¬† ¬† :bc1qdenhfr6qkkdv9vzyqaw56kas8us7khxlas38wtTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.39 ¬† ¬† :bc1q9chcgy5gh249tyz3p7v8jd4lu0qe2h62jp2a4cTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.40 ¬† ¬† :bc1qkpcffay2arnjhzf0ajd0m90fqs8ynupu8pww2gTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.41 ¬† ¬† :bc1q74wml3292ydzkvp7jtgjm32ngpk6hda82f08uhTIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.42 ¬† ¬† :bc1qsjr5ft5xu9zr27lkkgv4c7je7s86pdlxvfgw8pthe following users have priority on the following serials:Code:krogothmanhattan------ #1sunnybwoy------------- #2chronicsky------------ #4LitLitBit------------- #5seek3r---------------- #6minerjones------------ #7MrDipBuyer-------------#8geophphreigh---------- #9Agrawas--------------- #11Mitchell-------------- #15Humble Bitcoiners----- #17Hookzup1-------------- #19Hookzup1-------------- #20Hookzup1-------------- #21MrDipBuyer-------------#24MrDipBuyer-------------#33MoparMiningLLC-------- #76 (When available)  Sales list:TIMELINE-Q4.10.2023.1 -
