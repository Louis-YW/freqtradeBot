  "content": "Alik Bakhshi  Armenia on the road to war       Armenia ignores the fulfillment of the obligations stipulated by the peace treaty following the war of 2020. Three years have passed, however, apart from signing the agreement, there are no real actions on the part of Armenia that it must perform without fail, otherwise the peace agreement as a legal document becomes invalid. For some reason, Prime Minister Pashinyan decided that his signature was enough with Baku, and one can forget about such important points stipulated in the agreement as the delimitation of the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the restoration of the previously existing road linking Baku with Nakhichevan. From which it follows that, having lost the war, Armenia does not renounce the initial territorial claims against Azerbaijan, however, in words, Pashinyan clearly said that Karabakh is Azerbaijan. But, even if Pashinyan’s signature does not oblige him to anything, then his words should not be taken seriously.    As for the construction of the road passing through the ancient Azerbaijani geographical region of Zangezur, seized by Moscow and transferred to Armenia in 1920, Armenia refuses to fulfill its obligation, arguing that the Baku-Nakhichevan highway will violate the territorial integrity of the Armenian state.     This road is of great economic importance both for Azerbaijan and Turkey, and for the Turkic countries of Central Asia. Moreover, Russia is no less interested in the Zangezur transport corridor, since the North-South direction through the Zangezur corridor makes it possible to carry out trade with the countries of the Near and Middle East. Thus, Azerbaijan becomes a transport hub for all four directions North-South and East-West. By the way, the recreated Great Silk Road is already functioning through Baku. (1)        For the Turkic world, the Zangezur corridor is also of great strategic importance, because it will put an end to the territorial disunity of the Turkic countries.       The Zangezur corridor will also open transport links for Armenia, which is in isolation, with Russia through Azerbaijan, and the EU through Turkey. However, Armenia, refusing to fulfill the peace treaty, preferred the dangerous road to war instead of the road to peace. The insane leadership of Armenia, blaming Moscow for the collapse of its plan to create a chimerical “Greater Armenia”, and therefore abandoning its patron in the hope of finding a new one, will ultimately lead the Armenian people to the position in which they have been throughout their entire history. It may well be that at the last meeting in Sochi, Erdogan and Putin discussed what awaits Armenia in the near future, and I believe it is unenviable.        It must be said that this is not the first time that the Armenians repeat the historical mistake, this time betraying their patron in the person of Russia, which gave them a state on the lands of Azerbaijan that they never had (2,3) It seems that the artificially created state was doomed from the very beginning, and then the circumstance that Armenians are leaving Armenia in large numbers for the sake of a better life is a direct evidence of this.1.
