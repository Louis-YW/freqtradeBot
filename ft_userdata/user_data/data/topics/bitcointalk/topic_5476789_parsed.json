The US cannot stop the introduction of cryptocurrency, otherwise they would shut down Coinbase. The US authorities want everything to be according to their rules and citizens to use only the \"right\" exchanges and blockchains. And all other companies that were unable to lobby for their interests will be thrown out of the US market.",

Many of them will be discouraged to join or continue in the crypto sector if the government that making and enforcing strict tax policies. The government of the US message is clear: \" Be regulated or move out of the US\". There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to cryptocurrencies, and one of them is certainly that by investing in them you can avoid paying taxes - which is somewhat true if you know how to stay under the radar, but if you use CEX with KYC, then it's only a matter of time before the authorities can request this information. The US has always had a very strict tax system, and some of the biggest criminals in the past have been convicted and sent to prison precisely because of the IRS.However, I would not agree that moving from the US is a solution, unless a person renounces his citizenship and obtains it in another country - if I am not mistaken, US citizens are still obliged to pay taxes in the US even if they live elsewhere. In any case, paying taxes is something that almost cannot be avoided, but some countries have very favorable laws when it comes to taxes on cryptocurrencies, so they have 0% tax if you sell the cryptocurrency 1 or 2 years after the purchase, which is for many something they can only dream about.",

The requirement was the person had to invest $1,000,000 into that country. So unless you're a millionaire, don't even think about becoming a citizen of another country.

I think that the comments on that \"offer\" are quite negative, because most say that they would spend $1 million in a much better way, which is a completely logical choice. In addition, the guys from the Tether team and the Bukele team made an agreement a long time ago -> El Salvador Bitcoin: Tether buys itself a country; and why Chivo sucksRegarding taxes, I would disagree that the average American wants to play cat and mouse with the IRS, because I believe that most are guided by that old saying \"the two things everyone has to do in life are pay taxes and die\".",
