      "body": "There is no calculators for it. Because every blockchain have different gas fees and change everytime. If you wants, you can makes an average coz, how to do is, you can mint 1 NFT and make it available to sell, and then check the fees from each blockchain. Let say, 1 NFT for Minting and Sell order need BNB 0.01, So you can calculate 0.01*10K, this the best way to calculate so far.Once again, this is not final cost just estimation, and depends on gas fee rates when you mint and put sell order. May be this one can help you: https://metaversist.com/nft-minting-gas-calculator/Just google it for other chain",

The problem is if you are minting/uploading 10k collection to the open sea which is a lot. This is also making the transaction fees are so high when you are ethereum and it may cost more than it. You can calculate it based on the average transaction but i think that when you wanna mint your own NFT and this will cost you a lot when you are using ethereum. You shall pick polygon to decrease the fees. this will make even more sense when you are uploading thousands of NFT. So many people are using polygon right now caused by the cheapest fees",
