Sure, there are other options out there but nothing is want to touch and even if you were planning to invest in a different sha256 coin, you’d still be better off mining BTC and then using that to buy BSV or BCH or whatever other shitcoin you might have your eye on.",

This is the challenge with ASICs, you only have a specific algo you can mineUse this too to make approximations, but things are not good at the moment - https://whattomine.com/minersIn the last 24 hours, this is the approximate profitability of the top 3 SHA-256 coins as shown in the last column provided the power cost is $0.1 per KW",

There are already large farms which are doing the same to maximize profits. So you will make the same as mining Bitcoin directly.Yes profits are bad. There was a BTC difficulty reduction even because mining lately is very unprofitable. You need to mine at a loss and sell during the next bull run.",

As you say mining for the long term can be really profitable when the next bull run comes,many predict it to come in the 2025 year although for me it may come even earlier and I would not be surprised.If you can afford to mine at a loss go ahead and do so,other than that there is not much else you can do.You can buy the coins but it is more difficult to hodl them for the long time when you buy them rather than when you mine them because mining is a continuous process while you buy them once and just hodl.",

It's pure gambling.Well a lot has changed since last year. We were in a raging bull market. BTC miners were making killer profits. So where ETH GPU miners. Keeping money in the bank yielded less than 1%.So people and companies were lending out money to Bitcoin miners. And they didn’t realize that say a $10000 ASIC can very quickly become a $2000 asic and it won’t take long.Bitcoin falls, so your collateral is worth less, when Bitcoin falls you need to sell more Bitcoin to pay loans and electricity, and when Bitcoin falls and difficulty is huge the ASICs are worth less. Hence why so many of these lenders got burnt.",
