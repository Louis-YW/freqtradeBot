  "content": "Hello EveryoneWe are a new over-the-counter brokerage desk (OTC desk) with personalized, trading service to individuals and institutions for the buying and selling of bitcoin and other crypto assets, thanks to our global network of liquidity providers.No differences between price order and execution priceOur services help traders and investors handling large funds to carry out large transactions by avoiding price slippage, the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order is actually executed or when the price of the cryptocurrency changes while the order is placed, resulting in a different price than expected due to insufficient liquidity on the exchange.There are no limits on how much you can buy or sellTraditional exchanges place a limit on the maximum amount users can trade per day, as well as the amount that can be withdrawn from an account in a 24-hour period. These limits vary by the level of account verification completed, as well as transaction methods used or how long the user has been trading on the platform. In many cases, they may be insufficient to meet the needs of large traders and investors. OTC trading provides greater privacy for both buyers and sellers, also strong bank agreements that allow fiat settlement in USD, EUR, GBP, HKD (CryptoRolla also offer direct USDT - BTC swap) and other major currencies without restrictions or limits. We will provide you with some of the most competitive discounted prices on the market and you can trade as much as you want, every day of the year.- The minimum amount for executing a transaction in CryptoRolla is worth of $50 000/€50 000Your funds are with you until the transaction itselfThere are also numerous examples of traditional cryptocurrency exchanges that have fallen victim to hacker attacks with total or partial loss of users' funds. Executing an OTC trade will allow you to avoid this risk.- CryptoRolla does NOT store its customers' funds. We buy or sell on behalf of our clients, but we do not hold our clients' funds long-term.Lenient regulatory thresholdCryptoRolla offers its brokerage services with a low regulatory threshold, customers must prove their identity (KYC) by identifying themselves and signing a declaration that they are not involved in terrorism and money laundering (AML).Safety firstCryptoRolla and its liquidity providers work with licensed attorneys and tier 1 law firms as escrow. The protection of our customers and the smooth execution of transactions are of the utmost importance to us.We welcome all- investors- traders- strategic partnerships- hedge funds- exchangesContact usTelegram: CryptoRollaWhatsapp: CryptoRollaE-mail: info@cryptorolla.comWebsite: www.cryptorolla.com",

You are not under the jurisdiction of the European Union?Thank you for your interest. Of course, Bulgaria is under the jurisdiction of the EU, but let's start with the fact that we are not a wallet provider or a custodian bank. We can also serve our customers from a third party without these \"measures\" affecting us. We can guarantee if the client is REAL and RWA, we will do everything with our power, control and network to help client achieve their end goal.Kind regards,CryptoRolla team",

We are not saying that we will be unnoticed or hidden. There are various loopholes that can be used to get around that are NOT breaking the \"measures\". We have one bank account which is outside Europe, one in Asia/Singapore. We can also fulfill the client's request by mediating, for example connecting our seller with a potential buyer through tier 1 law firms like Baker, Norris, DLA etc. or licensed attorneys, which in no way violates the EU \"measures\". There are different options, if the client is REAL and RWA we will get him a comprehensive program. Kind regards,CryptoRolla team",
