In 2020, well you can say that Elon and Saylor has influence the market and so is El Salvador making it legal tender. For the billionaires or whales, they have been in the market for many years and so they know the drill when to push and put their money and when to sell, just saying. So it's not just about them, average joe to can contribute to your definition of pump and dump.",

And he also quit early when he began spreading FUD about Bitcoin, and despite of that the price reached ATH.If you're looking for correlation, it seems like bull-bear cycles are tied to halvenings. Shortly after the halvening the market turns bullish for a long time and reaches new highs, and then crashes and drops to a new floor, that is higher than the previous floor. This has been happening even before the billionaires got involved.",

We haven't seen pumps in bear market, and if they think they can manipulate the price then they will obviously jump on every opportunity. On the contrary, they are just doing what we ordinary investors are doing right now, accumulate and buy more because it's quite cheap. Elon Musk  is lucky that he join just in time for the bull run and it seems that he is pumping it but that is not right as well.",

In this cycle in which there has been institutional takeover and more millionaires buying than in the previous one, which was known as the retail cycle, there may have been a greater influence of millionaires if they have bought or sold but in the short term. Quote from: mk4 on October 12, 2022, 03:19:59 AMNot necessarily. The previous bull runs — especially in near peaks, mindless retail \"investors\" who just jump in on hyped assets had heavy participation. Them panicking is what cause the heavy drop as well, as it causes a domino effect.I agree, and what we saw in the previous cycles is the norm for a highly volatile asset, without a major influence on the price of millionaires or Hedge Funds. In this cycle we did see the influence of billionaires, like when Musk bought and sold, but the drop in these months is more due to cascading liquidations of leverage positions and panic selling when it was revealed that Celsius and others had problems.",

If I say that the sun is out during the day that doesn't mean my statement brought the sun out That is exactly what people like Musk, McAfee and the likes of them do. They see there is something trending on the internet and they jump on board and try to become the leaders of that thing or at the very least be seen. In reality they just advertise themselves and make money from that publicity. For example McAfee used it to run a side business where he was paid millions to advertise scam ICOs and made a lot of money that way.",

A couple of things are involved in Investment and Investing in Bitcoin is no different. People still haven't understood that what you put on investment in terms of capital shouldn't be what you might need in the next few years so whatever is happening to the market would really affect you even if they FOMOd in during ATH. Those that were able to hodl from the 2017 ATH to the last ATH would have been in profit because the funds were not needed and I think that part is really important.",

Elon was there yes, but his popularity basically brought him to the spotlight, this by no means meant that he was the one driving the wheels for the market, he's just a gear of many other gears, albeit bigger (maybe).
