I never heard that the forum will ask for the fee to recover your stole account or are you talking about an exchange account with stuck BTC and they ask you to pay the fee to withdraw the amount?That is most likely a scam if they ask for a fee.",

Looks like you posted in the wrong board. Try to move this top to Service discussion. The option to move top is aty the bottom on the left sideI believe you have ab account with an exchange or wallet? Can you tell us the name of the service?Never pay any money to receive the \"Bitcoins\" you have in an account. There is a possibility that you are being scammed.",

If it's a custodial account or an exchange account you could try to change your email or perhaps write to the support of the exchange to help you recover and secure your account. I doubt if it's a non-custodial wallet since both of you have the private key any one of you can send the funds out. It really is confusing most especially the \"fee\" part.",

We are left speculating about what happens if the complaint is incomplete like this one, if complainants do not get back within 24 hours to follow up their complaint, there's a lack of seriousness on their part to get their issues resolved.We cannot just give advice if these complainants cannot complete all the details we do not know what kind of advice to give but to complete the details.",

What account are you referring to? since there are so many of it if you didn't give any clear explanation about your case people will just speculate about your post then might no clear answer will be posted in the thread you created. So best to give more clear question because thus could help people on how to determine your case then possible help you and give proper advice on what to do regarding on your issue.",

However, such behavior seems to be very irresponsible to me because if you really want to report a service or a scammer then one should at least reply to the members who are trying to help out. OP, if you really want your answers then you should be active on the forum when you created such threads because members often try to help out users in such situations as soon as they possibly can. From your style of asking the question, I got an idea that some service or an individual is doing some scamming activity with you, and you want to have a solution for the issue. But, my friend we can only help if you clearly reply to our questions so that we can find out a way to guide you to get your coins or if that's a service then we can at least consider them as a scam to make others safe from such shady services. I hope you can understand that without proper details it's hard for us to know that what's the real issue with you.",

More realistic is that he has already solved his problems and this thread is not relevant for him.",

Possibly, OP account must have been compromised for it to have had transaction without OP knowledge but OP has failed to inform us with concrete details what happened and which of the account OP is talking about we have no idea. If you decide to peep into this thread created by you OP do well to give us proper information of what really happened as there is nothing tangible here to hold onto.",

It is clear that the OP only created that account to ask this question. The account in question must be his alternate account that he wants the problem to be resolved. Maybe he feels insecure using his main account to ask this question but rather safer using this new one. I’m sure he’s following up with the replies here to help him with the solution to his problem. If he doesn’t find a solution to it, I’m sure he’ll come back here and ask more questions about it.",

This is some how confusing, before you talk about your account being stolen then you have to give us at least a name/username for those who knows how to get it to you. Who are you paying those fee to? And who asked you to pay a certain amount of fee?You have being going through this for over two years and no result, why not change your password through your email?",
