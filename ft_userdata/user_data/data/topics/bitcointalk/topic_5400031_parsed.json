      "body": "You are all over the place my guy. First of all, KYC is the black sheep of crypto and there have been many articles on this forum citing evidence of data-stealing from KYC, so that is definitely not the answer. Regulating too much is not good for business, but crypto is not all about business, we need to keep that in mind. And Luna was not the exception, but it very well could have been partially the victim of foul play, however, its business practices left it open to such attacks.",
