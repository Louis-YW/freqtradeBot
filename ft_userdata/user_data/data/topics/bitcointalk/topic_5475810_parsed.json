  "content": "I do Â not see any further reason to derail their thread:Quote from: StackItUp on November 28, 2023, 04:43:02 PMQuote from: MoparMiningLLC on November 28, 2023, 03:12:16 PMas for the feedback thing - really? you have 3 transactions with me - 2 of them in the past 60 days. I leave feedback after several transactions and time have elapsed. Now I am forced to leave feedback based on your time line preference? I don't think so.YES REALLYimagine that you would give that reply to someone who would be asking \"did Stack really bought those cards from you 2-3 years ago\"Let's pretend what you see i have not bought from you. And lets pretend i have a perfect provenance of how i acquired these items/cards. Really helps me as collector. Thanks \"after several transactions and time have elapsed\" WTF? Nobody is going to marry you. You are rating actual trade, not picking your life partner dude. What if new people see that you rated old member \"paid on time\" , what the f*ck is that mean? is that mean that newbie paid \"not on time\" or what is EXACT reason of why newbie was not rated of making a successful trade? What do you think the feedback is actually for? is it for \"life\" ? Feedback in the trade is a provenance that the goods were achieved by the successful trade, nothing else. YOU ARE NOT GRANTING THE PERSON WITH YOUR LIFE. You only saying that \"he paid\" , because you know why? BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BUYER HAS TO DO - JUST PAY.Or do you think you are responsible for someones actions , and if yes, point me to someone who took full responsibility for another person just because they had feeback to him on a random trade .All feedback system is true monarchy scheme. Not rating others means less opponents to have higher ranking or eliminate you from DT. we are not idiots, again.Let me address your concerns:First off - no one has gotten feedback from me for a single transaction - no one. edited to add this: the feedback system is based on whether you can trust someone - and a single transaction does not always mean you can - this is not like eBay feedback where it is based on each and every transaction. that is why you cannot get 20 trust ratings and it count as 20, it will not count like that here. Also funny you are complaining I did not give you \"feedback\" for that transaction from 2 years ago - if you go look you did not do that for me either - nor do I expect you should or would. Just funny to see the hypocrisy. I do periodically go thru (usually every few months and give feedback to people with numerous transactions - 2 of yours are within the past 60 days - 1 within the past week.It is funny how you do not want people to put rules on how they do their raffles but you now insist that I must give you feedback?as for someone asking if you bought those cards - they can review the OP where they were sold.as it stands now - I will do no further business with you, you are excluded from bidding on anything I raffle or even that I auction or do group buys for. I am here to serve the community and to enjoy myself. Not to banter with a half wit who wants to argue about how people handle their raffles and/or when/how they give feedback.I am not trolling - I never troll. Now simply GFY",

      "body": "If I'm to weigh in after reading both of these threads, the solution seems pretty simple from an outside perspective:To stackitup:- Leaving positive feedback is optional, no matter how many trades are doneTo MoparMiningLLC- A neutral is most appropriate - the user might not be posing a trade risk, but the community might need to know that they ask for feedback. Especially considering that you have done successful trades with the user, a neutral seems most appropriate.(Edit - seems you have already done this, though in StackItUp's thread it mentioned negative was left)For others...If you don't trust someone anymore because of asking for feedback, go to your trust settings and add ~Username, leave a neutral if you think the community should know...but if they don't pose any trade risk to others or haven't shown you any kind of red flag at all, a negative trust feedback might be harsh.This is based on my interpretation of the trust system anyway.",

We are hobbist, passionate both with collectibles and bitcoin, so we are here (probably) only to have fun and spend quiet time together. Trust feedback and trust list it's a personal choice.My 2 satoshi: I would never force anyone to left a trust (+) on my profile or to add me in a trust list. If some one will ask something like this I am always a bit suspicious since we have seen in the past people building trust and then become scammers (No! it's not referred to anyone involved in this discussion/topic)...",

I would have left positive if he didnt insuniate that I somehow was treating him different than others with the part about \"what is different about the coins they pay with\" or something along those lines. up to the middle of last month, we had one interaction. now all of a sudden when he blasting people for running free raffles - it comes up that I never gave him trust for the deal from 2021? when I explained how/why I dont do it off of single deals, he further insulted me. Mind you he also never gave positive trust for the same deal (nor did I expect him to) to me. Kind of hypocritical of him, no?I simply do not have the time to deal with such individuals so I choose not to. made the post to leave it at that.I agree with you on that bitbollo and that is why I usually wait until several deals have been successfully concluded.",

Or another fake feedback?Thing is that i have much better reputation, collection, trade history or volume than Mopar.I am not a newbie.I offered him to bet the money where his mouth is.asking again. does anyone of you want to bet the money on your words and find out if you can prove it?Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on November 28, 2023, 09:42:48 PMI simply do not have the time to deal with such individualsOh really?Then next time do not attack such individuals or you will be demolished.I will catch you on telegram one day.I can bet there is no person in BTC collectibles or counterparty that doesnt know me on telegram.They will hear my version of story too, not just yours.Quote from: bitbollo on November 28, 2023, 08:58:55 PMMy 2 satoshi: I would never force anyone to left a trust (+) on my profile or to add me in a trust list. Let me be clear, i never asked his feedback.BUT INSTEAD i asked questions to find out of how he buys his trust.Mopar is a fool, who has converted my words of telling that he is corrupted and he is chasing for DT in a shady way, and used the situation against me like i was asking something.Quote from: StackItUp on November 28, 2023, 02:30:17 PMedit: not to make confusions i was not pretending to this free item and i do not want free stuff. i just want new comers to be threated same as anyone else.There is no extra requirement that somebody should have. And if person \"a\" paid and if person \"b\" paid, this doesnt mean that \"a\" is better than \"b\" or vice versa, because all they have done: bought/paid.Filtering people is not very ok. Or then expect them to notice that they were \"filtered\" and then expect them to be less active.Hope it makes sense.

Not rating the others means less opponents to have for yourself, less , members of higher ranking or less chance for yourself to be eliminated from DT. we are not idiots, again.\"your time line preference\" - You could have died in those 2-3 years. Let's be realistic. And yet i am happy collector waiting for the \"receipt\" that i did that trade and i paid on time or at least that i paid/bought at all. I can bet if the DT member would be buying from you for the first time he would be rated in few minutes after the payment. This is a light version of \"buying back\" the feedback.So let me ask you yourself: Really?All or none, should be the right mindset. Sadly you don't have such.I wish next time when you will be buying groceries and willing to get the receipt they would tell you \"Sorry ser we give receipt only after several transactions and time have elapsed\".And do not forget to go and check if every hotel that you visited and rated well to be still operating and, also, Â i wish you not to find that they served some of their customers badly, because by your logic you would be responsible for that.JUST A REMINDER THAT FIRST OUR TRADE BETWEEN WE DID ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO, NOW GO AND READ MOPAR FEEDBACK ON ME WHERE YOU WILL FIND THAT HE USED WORD \"IMMEDIATE\" ON A FUCKING `3 YEAR OLD TRADEWhat a fucking disaster all of you are.Mopar comented and everyone without getting in to the real situation, started rating me or telling that i am bad person.CHILDISH.THE EXACT REASON OF WHY MOPAR ATTACKED ME WAS THIS:Quote from: StackItUp on November 28, 2023, 04:43:02 PMI can bet if the DT member would be buying from you for the first time he would be rated in few minutes after the payment. This is a light version of \"buying back\" the feedback.So let me ask you yourself: Really?All or none, should be the right mindset. Sadly you don't have such.Where in my words i forced, asked, insisted of leaving me feedback?It was irony of telling that he is corrupted AF and he didn't liked to hear that, so he decided to start topic about me telling where i asked something lol.SHOW THOSE FUCKING POST OR QUOTE ME WHERE DID I ASKED YOU FOR A FEEDBACK. IF YOU WILL NOT SHOW THAT POST MEANS YOU OPENED THE THREAD WITH FALSE STORY AND LIES.Quote from: BenCodie on November 28, 2023, 08:50:04 PMTo stackitup:- Leaving positive feedback is optional, no matter how many trades are doneWho told that?Let's be simple. If i would be on DT , why should i be leaving feedback at all? Isn't is better to be better secured and not give feedback to anyone?You have to be idiot not to understand that such rule is a DREAM to DT members.I also do not care of what personal rules you have and that you believe its OKAY. no, its not.And what you think, doesnt matter to me.It is all about if I TURST HIM, and only about that.IF HE TRUST ME, plays ZERO role in our trades.so for me to trust him, he has to adjust to my needs. or else he has an option to FUCK OFFAnd me , collector, who buys expensive items whant to have a provenence of where did i got them.PERIOD.Quote from: Plaguedeath on November 29, 2023, 07:21:08 AMFarming trust   ME? farming trust - user spending 6 digits amounts. \"farming\"BUT YOU - look at yourself fucker. All you do is rating people negative, A FUCKING DETECTIVE? whats the purpose of that? FREE LABOR? OR BUYING TRUST BY \"good\" actions?which one of 2???You sent me feedback without any proof, any knowledge and not hearing my version.THIS THREAD IS CORRUPTEDWorst that you who have replied or left feedbacks - took Mopar words as granted.since when we do not need a proof on the words?his delusional thinking is just his opinion.Â what ever he said - not what i did.and most funny that he has avoided every question that i asked and chosen to attack me to get my questions to be not that important as now i have to spend time defending myself.now tell me this thing isnt corrupted Quote from: BenCodie on November 28, 2023, 08:50:04 PMbut the community might need to know that they ask for feedbackLeaving you a chance to correct yourself providing EXACT post or PRIVATE MESSAGE or what ever other source its was OF WHERE DID I ASKED THAT.Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on November 28, 2023, 05:05:35 PMLet me address your concerns:First off - no one has gotten feedback from me for a single transaction - no one. Is that mean that trade partners has to respect you but you will not do the same?or is that mean that you are very great?Who the fuck you think you are you tiny worm?You have to learn how to respect people. THANKSLESS fool.And you believe after such attitude people will keep buying from you?  oh my....YOU ARE THE WORST TRADER AND SELLER EVER.YOUR ATTITUDE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS IS SHIT.YOU ARE GOING ONE WAY DOWNQuote from: MoparMiningLLC on November 28, 2023, 05:05:35 PMthe feedback system is based on whether you can trust someone - and a single transaction does not always mean you canWhat a BS.Take any feedback left on me, any positive feedback. You know whats that mean? IT MEANS EXACTLY OF WHAT THEY WROTEIf they wrote \"successful trade\", MEANS EXACTLY SUCCESSFUL TRADE , two fucking words and nothing else.And no need to tell me that it means \"they trust me for life\" , THEY NOT. If someone leaves feedback about a good trade, its means nothing more but that they had a good trade in the past.You pretend that you are so great and your feedback should be such a valuable that makes me want to ask you;Tell me names of what people you have sent positive feedback Â and guarantee and grant their every action.tell nicknames of people that you promise to compensate any loses or bad actions done by them.IF YOU THINK YOUR FEEDBACK MAKES YOU RESPONSIBLE, tell names of what members you will be responsible for.i would use it as a reference if any future troubles.Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on November 28, 2023, 05:05:35 PM- and a single transaction does not always mean you canI can bet that DT member would be rated by the single transaction because you are idiot who thinks we don't understand what you do, and what attitude you have to people.

You reference asking why I never left feedback for a transaction 2 years ago (one you never did either) which is funny that you even brought it up acting as though I did something wrong by not providing you a positive trust. No I do not trust people on one transaction - do you know how many people have made dozens of transactions in the right way then to make a huge transaction and then run off never paying? It happens a lot. I usually wait for 2-3 sometimes 4. We only had our 3rd transaction last week. I may have waited for one more or I may have given positive in the next week or so. But when a person goes off unhinged questioning my integrity simply because I did not leave positive trust 2 years ago on a single transaction (again note, neither did you - so hypocritical to even question me for what you yourself did as well) and then attacking every free raffle that you do not qualify for because one wanted a review (good or bad) of their design with the entry, another because he offered it only to those that did translation services and then attacking them because the only way to get their item is thru the raffles vs a direct buy. Trust me, I rather just direct buy as well. But that doesn't make them the bad guys or that they have done something wrong - you simply do not like how they do things - you act as though everyone needs to do it \"your\" way. There is no one way to do anything here - there are some things that are not allowed by the forums - the rest is up in the air and at the discretion of the giver/seller.Get off your high horse - stop slandering me - stop retaliating for something that was justified - stop attacking all the givers/sellers. Move on.edit: what are we betting on? what does your collection size/volume (whatever that means)/ and all that other spewed nonsense have to do with anything going on here?Quote from: StackItUp on November 29, 2023, 08:00:16 AMI offered him to bet the money where his mouth is.asking again. does anyone of you want to bet the money on your words and find out if you can prove it?Quote from: StackItUp on November 29, 2023, 08:04:03 AMOh really?Then next time do not attack such individuals or you will be demolished.I will catch you on telegram one day.I can bet there is no person in BTC collectibles or counterparty that doesnt know me on telegram.They will hear my version of story too, not just yours.I did not attack you - You kept going on about me treating you differently than others and lamenting over your lack of \"feedback\" (positive trust rating) So, I left you \"feedback\" (neutral). Then decided that dealing with you is simply not worth it so told you I would deal with you no further. Your pettiness is enough to warrant that. and \"catch\" me? Why do you keep threatening me? Am I supposed to be scared? My reputation of being fair is known. I have never stolen, cheated or wronged anyone. Yes, I have blocked dealings with people who are just too much drama. That is my choice and right to do so.and version? what are you talking about? there is no version - all of this is public in the collectibles sub forum. All of this is because you attacked me with your petty insinuation that I \"buy\" trust ratings because we had one transaction years ago and you didnt get a positive. And then when I gave you a neutral stating that others should beware because if they deal with you andÂ  dont give you a positive, you may do the same to them - it is a fair feedback. You have already proven that you do that.You are petty and I have no more time to devote to you. I wish you luck in this life and hope you eventually grow up.",
