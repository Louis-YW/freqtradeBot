The main board can cover general issues/matters which aren't related to the child boards. For local boards, I think we don't need too many child boards, it is unnecessary. We have limited members on local boards. We can discuss it in global boards which are related to the topics, we already have some child boards about games in the marketplace board.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=71.0- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=207.0",

Also, developers and companies will come here to advertise their games. It is true that nobody here on the forum will want to be left behind in time. And I think that in general this has not happened.Now, the issue with NFT games is that almost all that exist, the focus is not on the game but on making money with a token. Ending up looking more like a system to earn money than a game.Nothing against the money making factor, what I regret is that they use the term game for this purpose. When most of what exists has little to no gameplay. And that's why they are only really profitable when new players are coming in, when that's over, the game almost disappears.Therefore, it is difficult to distance these NFT games from other altcoins. And while it is like that, perhaps the emergence of a new board dedicated to this topic is more difficult.",
