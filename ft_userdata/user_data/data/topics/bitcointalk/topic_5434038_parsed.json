  "content": "How to keep a resolution for the new yearSimilar to last year, we have made resolutions for the new year as it is the beginning of the year. Due to the fact that you failed to keep your resolutions from prior years, you may have stopped making resolutions altogether. You weren't unable to keep those resolutions because you were unmotivated or incapable; rather, it was because you never gave it much attention.Here are some strategies for sustaining ones New Year's resolution.Make resolutions that you can actually achieve. You cannot set goals based only on your desires.Write down your resolutions on a sticky note or in your diary so that you can remember them every day. Even better, set a calendar reminder.Every day, make progress toward that goal. For example, if one of your goals for the new year is to read two books every month, start by reading at least one page each day.To check off everyone you managed to do, use an app or calendar.Finally, keep going; whether you skip a day or a month, it makes no difference; just pick up where you left off.You can add your own suggestions.",

Way for me to keep it is a mind trick.I need to want more not to smoke then to smoke.That sounds weird so let me explain: If i view my promise as a task that's going to take lots of work i am going to view it as in negative light.I will see it as a hard road, and that makes me think smoking is an easy road.When in fact it takes more effort to smoke then not to.I need to buy it every week, i am controlled by it and my free time is controlled by it. It makes my energy levels low and i can't train as efficiently.It makes me need to use more money.So i won't view quitting as a hard task. I will focus on the future and now where i am free of it. Now when i think smokng it i don't remember it something i can't do but something i don't have to do anymore.I can rememer the nausea, bad breath, possibility of lung diseases, that i was constantly tired and felt bad.Now why would i want that.",

This is because you would always face triggers that tends to push you or motivate one to go back to the past negative habits. I have once made a new year resolution and broke it the next day because I was indiscipline. Keeping to your new year resolution takes a lot of willpower and discipline.One of they ways I try to stick to my new year plan is to outline the advantages and disadvantages of my decision. Someone that decides to quit smoking might derive benefits like improved health, increased savings, reduced societal stigmatisation and improvement in personal hygiene. This benefits cannot be commensurate with the temporal and harmful pleasure that smoking offers. Weighing the benefits and demerit helps me to hold on to my decision regardless of the temptations to break the resolution.",

For those who started Last year, the resolutions will be easier for them to keep. If you just started this year to act on your resolutions, discipline is key and you just have to always remind yourself why you taking that step.",

Resolutions should not only be made by mouth, they should be put into practice.I agree with you, many people talk about new year resolution without even knowing the meaning, that is to say many people get it all wrong. New year resolution comes in different ways depending on the area of your life you want to improve on, like what you said about smokers, some people new year resolution may be how to save, while for some people new year resolution is about the beautiful places they want to visit and go spend their money. for instance, my new year resolution may be to buy a car and to do that I will have to cut off my expenses and start saving for it, while your own may be to travel to one of those countries just for visit. But what I can say about new resolution is by setting a new goal for the year and things to achieve and things to cut off.",

Yes I agree with you, and you also need discipline in order to keep up with that resolutionBecause without discipline you might be tempted to break or go against the resolution and by so doing the set out goals won't be accomplished.You have to keep up with every process involved in that resolution physically and mentally just to make sure the process are followed in order to achieve the set out goals so discipline is Also very important in making new year resolutions.",
