  "content": "So TrustPilot is complete shit at this point,    Forgive me as I don't know that a popular rating and review platform like TrustPilot can be this blind or maybe it's all intentional I don't know. My advice to all new gamblers on this forum, do not use Trust Pilot to fund good-rated online casinos, they can't be trusted. I have been seeing TrustPilot for a long time and I don't even know that I will end up using it one day, I was looking for a platform that rates casinos base on good records and good reviews online, that's when someone recommended this TrustPilot.I was like oh I have been seeing TrustPilot for a long time, just never used them, until I grabbed a cup of coffee and decided to do some surfing, then I found out that the most popular scamming casino on this forum called 1xbit was rated well on TrustPilot. So if I don't know about Bitcointalk forum and 1xbit I would have though the online casino is a good one. There is no single bad review about 1xbit on TrustPilot and I was like how the hell this is happening? To cut this topic short, stay the hell away from TrustPilot, I think Coinguru is still a better choice.",

It is key to check these benchmark to know if it suits your standard. It will also be a mistake to rely on a single rating by platform to evaluate the reputation of a casino, we should always check other rating platforms. Most reviews are arranged to suit some casinos. Some review websites are secretly owned or financed by these casinos so you don't expect them to publish a negative review. In most cases only reviews that favors the casino is publicized. I don't trust any of them which is why doing research is cardinal.",

But we cannot rely what the words posted there since as stated trust pilot seems biased on the reviews they posted. Much better to locate this forum since from here we can read real feedbacks came from different group of people which have real time experience to use those sites or casino.",

But I'm not surprised because doing positive reviews on TrustPilot can be done by paying some users to give high ratings. In this forum is one way to find out the truth. I'd rather muddle through real human resources than bots who are purposely actively assessing casinos or projects on TrustPilot.",

The best reviews you can get are reviews from people who you know at times. Reviews from this kind of forums can also be taken because you will be able to read different opinions from people, and if it is a casino that has been able to bribe their way to get good reviews on other platform, they will not be able to bribe everyone on this forum who have used their services.",

It is now very clear that trust pilot reviews are one of the most shitty review site that you will see online. If you check the rating some other reputable sites here in Bitcointalk on trustpilot you’ll see that they have a very low rating but those of a proven scam site you’ll see high ratings. Once you have enough funds to pay people you’ll be able to get a good rating with high number of reviews so it.",

In forum, when some member who has a high rank gives a review, then that can be a valid review. Whereas on the website, chances are the alt-account they use to give a positive review is bigger.People ease to register and making a lot account on review websites. If the sites not open a review from user (internal reviews), I believe, when they got money from company or organizations who wants to get a positive reviews, of course it will be easy for them to get it.",

For this instance, I'm glad you dug deeper to check whether the reviews online were actually true or just paid reviews. It's not really that much surprising that there are paid and sponsored reviews online. After all, it's a way of living for some. They get paid just to make a positive feedback or for campaigning for the said site/s. Players should practice researching and verifying info before actually believing them. That way, you will avoid being trapped into some kind of scam that is painted to become pleasant and encouraging to the eyes. It will take you some time by doing so, but it will be worth it because later on, it will save you time from the trouble that may arise if you didn't do a background check. Remember, almost everything nowadays comes with a price. If it is too good to be true, then it probably is because it's paid by those scam casino websites to gather more victims.",
