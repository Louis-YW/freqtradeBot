Btc fees are high atm, even when they were low it would take ~1 USD for each individual transfer, why not then just adopt LN? I don't think the BTC transaction fee was up to $1 for each transaction since the payment is being made using a multi-sender-supported wallet, in which the entire transaction for all receivers is being processed and confirmed all at once. If the fee were calculated individually, it would not be up to $1. Even when I run a single transaction to another wallet, fees are usually below $1, sometimes 0.5, 0.8, and so on. Just a few weeks ago, I started spending up to $1 and above when sending out BTC to another wallet.QuoteI may potentially be ignorant to why LN is not being used, if it's so please throw light on it. Thanks. LN is good, but not all exchanges support it either for deposit or withdrawal, and I think signature manager's decision to start accepting LN deposit addresses for paymen might definitely kill lots of people's desires and the true definition of adoption since one can no longer spend his or her BTC where and when they want unless on a specific exchange that only supports you to exchange them.",

If a transaction that contains one input and several outputs (which is the case in most Bitcoin transactions) and many of those outputs are bc1 addresses, then the cost of the transaction will be much less than $1 for each individual transfer.On average, these campaigns pay between $3 to $20, which is much less than the amounts you pay to users.As for the Lightning Network, transactions here are not done on a daily or hourly basis, but rather one transaction per week, and many people send that transaction to a CEXs or put the address of that platform as a deposit address.",

I remember that a signature campaign tried to pay via LN payment, but there was no update on them.Perhaps the reason is the fee costs for the amount of campaigns, some of which pay more than $ 3000 per week and can pay TX fees.On the part of the users, some of us spend those payments and convert them into the local currency periodically, so using the lightning network means more fees for us.",

So, if the manager decides to pay in LN, the participants just need to have those wallets that supports LN and then sell and swap it through fixedfloat and have it received with another altcoin as they wish or even back to bitcoin. It's not really needing a lot of effort but this is going to be a big adjustment for most of the managers. While looking at mempool, I guess we just need to wait a week or two until we see if the fees will stabilize.",

However, the idea is promising and eliminates the frustration of waiting for payment on the designated day (I recall those old days). But it's important to note that converting BTC received through Lightning Network channels requires an on-chain transaction, which means users may have to bear the fee, and it's unclear whether this is good or bad from a promotional standpoint.",

I saw few exchange which also supports LN deposit but I never tried that because I am not pushed into such situation like we are now have to pay 10 or 20x times as transaction fee due to spam on the network as of now I am looking for those because being a trader I can't really spend that much huge amount for transaction fee because I do convert crypto to fiat and vice versa on daily basis.Don't get me wrong on using that grammar betterment, I just saw it from a thread on Meta and just wanted to try it.",
