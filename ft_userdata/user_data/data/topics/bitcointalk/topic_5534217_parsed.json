You may want to say \"by increasing interest rates\", and although that is correct but it is only one of the tools they use. They control the inflation by controlling the amount of money people have in their pockets. Increasing interest rates means taking loans (loan means people have more money to spend) becomes more expensive and paying back the loans they already have become more costly as the payments go up. So people end up having less money to spend on other stuff which means demand comes down which means prices can potentially come down which then translates into decreased inflation. (that's right, this is how stupid economy as a science has become!!!)Of course there are other usual ways to take peoples' money like taxes all of which are taking money out of people's pockets. But there is another way to basically \"rob\" them and that's by market manipulation. If the government can make people invest in something (eg. stock market which they've done before) and then they can crash that market in a way that a large number of people lose a significant amount of money, the end result is going to be the same.

It was recently I got to know that the recent pump in price during the period we were experiencing was actually a planned stuff. Basically I found out that there was a sudden buy with a very huge amount after which the news spread and then the pump happened.Shortly after this price dumped which shows a clear indication of manipulation in the market. This is the main reason why I always insist that one of the biggest problem faced in the crypto ecosystem is FOMO.",

You have narrated the picture in the mind of many and logical crypto enthusiast. Yes your theory is trite.Elon musk over the past years have manipulated doge coin and bringing in such expert in this business with high tech knowledge in the Trump administration heading (D O G E) is really going to put crypto minds on their toes with high and low volatility. So will this discovery actually put more money in the pocket of investors or take more money from them because Trump might keep pumping his coin and who knows where the pendulum swings with Bitcoin.",

In fact politics can influence many things - including the crypto market, stocks and so on. After all - market manipulation has been talked about quite often, so it's nothing surprising. The most important thing is - every investor and holder should be realistic enough about the future and they should not put all their eggs in one basket.",

After Donald Trump assumed office, we expected that Bitcoin will have been name among the US crypto strategic reserve but we saw different cryptos get shot-listed which clearly shows that they're in for big manipulations since they can control liquidity of these named cryptos as those coins are not decentralized, they can easily rig their supply and demand. I thought I was the only one noticing what is happening, pump the price and dump it immediately,  but I believe crypto enthusiasts will soon get more focused on Bitcoin than what is happening with these listed coins on the strategic reserve.",

Crypto market is definitely the best market for them to manipulate with and I have that fear too. I'm afraid that if they create a Bitcoin strategic reserves, the situation might be very good for a while but I think that in the end, their aim is to significantly increase the market cap and then tragically destroy it (i.e. pump the money out).I think that Elon must will pump Doge coin and then dump it again. Crypto became an easy way to collect billions of dollars from different people. You create a token, promote it, then people invest billions of dollars into it, then you sell it and the coin goes down to zero. You basically get billions of dollars from them and they receive useless thing in exchange.

You should look at the timing of the Trump's reserve announcement and compare that with pumps on assets that were mentioned by him in that announcement. The markets started pumping before the announcement, which means somebody knew and took advantage of that knowledge. This is called insider trading, but crypto markets don't have rules regarding this, so you can do insider trading all you want without any repercussions. Do you believe Wall Street gamblers wouldn't take advantage of this? Musk knows how to do it. He bought bitcoin in 2021 and tweeted about it once he had a position open, then told that Tesla would be taking payments in bitcoin, then sold and tweeted that Tesla is dumping bitcoin because it's suddenly bad for the environment. Then he said that Tesla would again accept bitcoin when 50% of its mining is from renewables. Bitcoin reached it a year ago and Musk ignored the fact and still doesn't accept it.

For example, we have a national currency in my country but everyone measures the price in USD. Do you sell a car? The price is written in dollars. You sell an apartment, the price is written in dollars. I asked one person from the government about why we need national currency if our population tries to buy and sell everything in US dollars. He couldn't give me a normal answer but I know that they need national currency to make people poorer. Officially, you can't buy or sell anything in USD but since we import everything, we need to buy USD with local currency, give it to a foreign country and then sell our stuff here in local currency. The government often changes rates of local currency/USD/Euro pairs. Our people hold money in USD and Euro because no one trusts the national currency long-term because of its high inflation. The government often increases the USD exchange rate, then people immediately buy USD, then they lower the USD exchange rate, and people then sell at a loss with the fear of losing money and that's how it goes all the time.",
