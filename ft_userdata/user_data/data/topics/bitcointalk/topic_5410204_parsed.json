This official versionWu Blockchain:Conflux initiated the CIP-102 proposal: change the PoW mining algorithm to Ethash, the motivation is to make it easier for Ethereum miners to switch to Conflux after the merger, but the specific details are still pendinghttps://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1557665083349557248?Most miners mine ethereum and it will be easier for them to mine another coin on the same algorithm.

I have never mined this coin, but maybe after the completion of ethereum mining I will try.Most of the miners used only the Ethash algorithm, and this will attract more newcomers to the mining of this coinhttps://bitproit.com/gpu-mining-profitability-after-ethereum-merge/",
