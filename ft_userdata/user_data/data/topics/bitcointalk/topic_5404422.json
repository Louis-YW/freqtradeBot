  "content": "I bought a couple thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase on June 18. Some of it was available to send to my hardware wallet immediately, but $1,000 of Bitcoin was kept on Coinbase. They sent me an email claiming that I would be able to send or trade the remaining amount on June 28.Well, it's now June 28, and I tried to send the remaining Bitcoin from Coinbase to my Ledger wallet, and it tells me that I can send $0.00. It's bad enough that Coinbase holds your Bitcoin for several days after you purchased it, which they should have absolutely no right to do, but it's downright enraging when you can't even send it when they claim that you'll be able to. I'm now reluctant to buy more Bitcoin from these shysters (who haven't changed their antics one bit since they went public). What do I do now to withdraw my remaining Bitcoin?",

I don't think I've come across a case where a particular user is restricted from making transactions with no reasons giving. But they do have the right to hold your Bitcoins as you agreed to their Terms of Service. Not your keys; Not your coins.They essentially let you use your Bitcoin as you do not have custody of it.Quote from: Crypto Bull on June 28, 2022, 09:57:57 PMWhat do I do now to withdraw my remaining Bitcoin?Only coinbase can allow you.Have you tried contacting their support and maybe calling them out on social media?Try the first option and wait for a reply and if that's not a satisfactory one, then you can call them out publicly.",

Bank transfers on Coinbase is always problematic due to bank and Coinbase regulations.And based on their Coinbase terms usually, they complete the deposit or purchase after 3 to 5 days if it's more than that there is a conflict between the Coinbase and your bank. That's good news since they already replied to your Email let's hope that you can now able to withdraw your funds from Coinbase to Ledger nano.
