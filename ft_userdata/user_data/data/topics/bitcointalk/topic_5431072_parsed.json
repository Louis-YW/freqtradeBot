Do you think with so few MH/s will it ever be able to catch a block?? or should I keep it undermining a pool as I have done so far? Thank you in advance.",

Thank you in advance.I don't think that amount will be able to bring you 10.000 Doge as that is the reward for a block because the difficulty of Dogecoin is to high right now and with only 330 Mhsh I think it will not be possible to get a block so easily.The only device which would have somewhat slight chances is L7+ that 9.5 Ghsh power efficiency,however I advice you continue milking your devices as that is the best you can do,get small amount of Doge coins every day and add up to your wallet.",

Getting equipment for free is always good if you know how to repair it. But I think you will soon get tired of paying electricity bills.",

He should mine at least 4 days on viabtc as pps. Maybe 5.And mine solo for 2 or 3 days.No energy issues means 0 cost. It seems he is saying he has free power. So why not take $3.41 a day 5 days a week. or 3.41 x 261 = 890 usd for sure.and maybe he gets lucky with the solo on the 104 days he mines solo.To toss a certain $890 makes no sense to me.He would need at least 2 solo blocks to do better.My way he gets the $890 and could still get some solo blocks. By mining the 104 days solo.",

Thank you in advance.Yep solo mining for mature coin only for hobbies or just testing. For money go to pool and you wont losing many electricity for nothing, except you want hunting new coin each day and try to soloing for new baby coin lol….
