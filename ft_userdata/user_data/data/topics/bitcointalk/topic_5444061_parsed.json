However, that may be bit hard, so I'd be satisfied with bonus that player can play with, one can at least have fun without depositing real money. I don't mind wagering requirements as long as you can fullfill those requirements with bonus given.",

But I have also received a deposit bonus but for this one, it requires wagering several times before I can get the bonus and I rarely get it because the wagering is too big.Maybe you can give a Free Spins bonus for depositing a certain amount or bonuses like in other casinos. But I hope there aren't too many bets because that could be too difficult for us to achieve. Well, at least just betting 1x or under 10x is enough.",

While the prospect of receiving a bonus is enticing, the high wagering requirement makes it challenging to unlock and access any potential winnings. Instead, I prefer bonuses with lower wagering requirements that offer a fair chance of winning without requiring excessive playthrough.It seems that many players prefer bonuses with low wagering requirements or no wagering requirements at all. A no deposit bonus is also a popular choice for players who want to try out a casino without risking their own money. A daily claim bonus with certain conditions can also be an attractive option for players who enjoy receiving bonuses frequently.",

Freespins before are the catchy ones to encourage new players in this industry. But nowadays, bonuses are in form of rebates and invite incentives. The biggest ones I encountered are during holiday seasons wherein I managed to get a thousand bucks for a total of invites and cashback in one platform, if I'm not mistaken. Haven't visit the site for a long time and I only engeged because of that bonus. Which I think implies for other platforms as well. Casinos won't afford giving consistent bonuses on a daily basis. Therefore bonuses alone won't be enough to make a player stay; other factors should be considered such as overall maintenance of the site concerning delays and lags.",

How do you want to apply the biggest bonus.* In the form of your gambling tokens or in game types, high payouts.If I may advise you to implement some big bonuses in your gambling industry later, maybe you can place in Pragmatic Play type slot games, the highest RTP is 96.51%, poker or Bonanza slots and so on.Or you can promote it like one of the online casinos that I've seen.Example:Quote0.8% Daily bonus, 0.3% Weekly Bonus, 0.3% Rollover Bonus, Win Lose Bonus Get Money, First Deposit Bonus, 0.2% Member Get Member BonusBottom line: whatever bonus you offer to users in any way, users who want to bet on your gambling site will certainly be well received, as long as it's not a fake bonus, aka a display/advertising bonus.",

That was the first time I won an amount that I had never experienced on other online gambling sites. Thankfully it's paid in just a day but according to their terms, it should be 3-5 days before it will reflect. Instant bonuses like deposit bonuses are not really the things that I like, those types of things are more prone to scam attempts. I like it more when it's done with a grind. Wager amounts. Waiting for events. Taking advantage of it when the day comes. If you are thinking about creating one, I'd focus more on that kind of offer. There's a chance your loyal patrons will increase on this type of event.",

Only VIPs and big-time bettors get huge bonuses from casinos like doubling their wagered funds and offering lots of perks. Some casinos have events in which lots of gamblers could benefit but if you are planing to offer bonuses, you must first consider the capability of your casino and be sure to establish your TOS because some players are just taking advantage of the bonuses but won't stay on the site.",
