That's because they aren't produced anymore, so their rarity makes them fetch higher prices in collectibles marketplaces like this board.",

If it is qr code, click qr code icon next to the import button.Scan QR code is only possible if you use Electrum mobile, and with Electrum for desktop, you can not scan QR code.Mobile devices are suitable for hot wallets and with small funds. If you want to store big fund, at least big fund with you, you have to use a computer, laptop that is safer than a mobile device. Best if you can have an airgap computer or laptop for your Electrum wallet.Quote from: hero_the_bossman on December 20, 2024, 06:47:39 AMAnother question would be then what makes a physical copy more \"rare\", so to speak - and what would make its price higher in the eyes of the others who collects them?The older it is - the better the odds of getting yourself a good deal? It's about physical stuff that is used to attach Bitcoin private key. 0.001 BTC is always like this, and value of that collectible can change with Bitcoin price and with that physical stuff value.Collectibles are risky, if the issuers are scammers, they will sweep private keys and steal your bitcoin.",

No way. Trust wallet is a closed source multi coin wallet, there is no need for op to take the risk of using a closed source wallet, when there are many recommended open source BTC wallet to use.Quote from: UserWithQuestions on December 20, 2024, 06:03:33 AMDoes anyone have a specific tutorial available for this use case on for example YouTube?You have already gotten your answer from users who have posted before me. I just want to add that you should be careful importing your seed phrase or private keys into an online device, if the device is infected with malware, your funds would be stolen as soon as you import your keys.",
