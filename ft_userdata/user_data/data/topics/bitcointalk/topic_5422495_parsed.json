And should have a nice graphical image placed (see how it's done) on the main topic instead of all these texts.2. You need to brand the product in the community. Hire a campaign manager and plan for a signature campaign. I can help if you want. I am currently managing sinbad.io mixer signature campaign. We can plan for something similar depending on your budget of course. If you reach out then we can discuss.3. The site looks nice and simple. Very minimal.

Moreover the principle of CoinJoin does not require at all a sending at the same time and at the same amount per user, otherwise no service could ensure it given the impossible amounts to predict. It is only when we receive different transactions from users that CoinJoin and our methods take effect for sending. Hence the variable delay. Maybe not developed enough on our first post.You are totally free not to trust us but we are absolutely not a \"scam\" just a new service and obviously it is difficult to find its audience. However, we don't ask for big amounts now, we even advise trials with small amounts, and then the first criticisms will be useful to improve the service.When we talk about a non-secure blockchain, we are talking about users' transactions that are traceable and absolutely not about security flaws. If it was the case we would not launch a service on this same blockchain!Thank you for your comment and I hope I made it clearer.",

As I said, just not explained enough in the first post. \"-Our mixing protocol is not a simple CoinJoin\" is a proof we doesn't use it? It's the proof we use the CoinJoin with our own methods that's all.And how do you want a signed message on 100 BTC now? You are surrealist, that just the amount maximum you can send, we know that by all the development we did. So you ask other mixers signed message about 1000 BTC ?And again, no, the CoinJoin is not users sending the same amount at the same time as you said before, it's easy to guess that it's just not feasible. Everything happens once the different amounts are received. The image you have shown is a CoinJoin that separates exact amounts but does not receive them at the same time nor at the same amount by the users, among the images you have seen on Google you have seen that the principle you state is far from being the only possibility. In the same article you took you can see your image is really not the only way to use CoinJoin... The following is the exact function of CoinJoin, it's not a division concept... \"In essence, a CoinJoin involves the combination of inputs by multiple users into a single transaction.\"The image you select shows how a CoinJoin works once the different amounts have been received, in fact it separates them into exact amounts, a good method but not the only one, the important principle is a mixture of the different amounts before sending them back. Making exact divisions will not change anything, it is just often the case because an exact division is easier to implement, we even use it at one of the transaction stages, but as already explained we mix it with other methods.But in this case all mixers are wrong if we follow your reasoning.This will be our last answer to your comments, we are not here for a knowledge war, we know what our service is worth. We prefer to focus on the constructive like all comments here.Good evening to you!Quote from: Royse777 on November 24, 2022, 02:47:44 AMQuote from: Mixero on November 23, 2022, 07:34:51 PM-Indeed a letter of guarantee is available when you send your BTC and you can obviously send it to our support address, unique intermediary for all your questions or possible problems; [banned mixer]@protonmail.com.Having the PGP public key available somewhere on the website (may be on the footer section) liked or allow to download will be a good addition.

It is only an error on our part based on our explanation either here or on the website.

We don't change the version, we just change the precision of the explanation thanks to the first comments.We know that this is a mistake and that it looks like a version change to get customers but it's not the case.And all the services that use CoinJoin do it with their own added methods, all the services are different, so that's the case for all the services that use CoinJoin, that's just a bad way to explain, sorry about that.Thanks !",
