  "content": "So it seems this is a really new one on the block, so really simply looking for the one guy who either has one or has tested one, or knows someone who actually tested one, and see if this is all legit? It is being sold by some of the best online retailers, which some say, means they have somehow been vetted and approved by their process. I remember someone said the 10.3T is legit, and even Vosk said it is risky but did not say it is a scam or horrible.Seems like the Antminer KS3 9.4T is a much safer bet (Iceriver I heard has some issues, customer complaints) but the number long term after ROI is really big in K9 favor... So if someone knows anyone who has actually used the K9, please let me know!",
