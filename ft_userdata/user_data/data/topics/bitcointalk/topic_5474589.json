      "body": "I can't believe this artwork is still available. Sometimes, I create pieces that amaze even myself. It's astonishing how I can produce such varied styles, yet they still feel interconnected. And then there are the memories each artwork holds, they're like snapshots of my life. That's why I enjoy revisiting my art, picking them up one by one, lest I forget. It's a challenge I must face living with brain damage, the memories don't always end well.",
