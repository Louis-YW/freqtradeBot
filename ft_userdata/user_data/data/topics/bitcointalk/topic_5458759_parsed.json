I think people are more curious about digital assets such as Bitcoin. Gold is no doubt a store of value and one of the top financial market players but currently, according to recent developments, the crypto market seems more attractive, especially Bitcoin. Still, I will stick to the thread maybe some of the forum members can evaluate some good things for me in this domain.",
