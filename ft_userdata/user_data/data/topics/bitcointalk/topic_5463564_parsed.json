  "content": "I am making this topic out of curiosity to know more, what actually driving all the powerful and non-powerful countries to be in the competition and why there is a competition in the first hand. Why just people cannot live together and care for each other not like by doing each other's bidding instead without fighting. If, i took my own example then we used to rule subcontinent for so long then Englishmen and Indian took over, so we have to fight for another nation which is Pakistan (my history lessons do need sub retouch but as for now just take it as an example). Why we fought for new country the reason is same for each and every other country for which they fought to be independent and so they could follow their norms. Those norms could be based on many beliefs but most those are religious beliefs because we fought for religious beliefs so we could worship with full freedom. I am not going to mention any other thoughts that could lead to many religious riots because in my time here i do understand that this platform does not tolerate that.So, the point i was trying to make here is, even after getting our own country other countries are still interfering in governments rules and taking things over. I don't like to mention names but many already knew. And just to clear i am not saying these statements to put my problems (my means my country) in front of you guys instead i am just using it as an example.The Thing that drives one person, or nation, or governments to make such bold moves is Desire because even when we were living together in subcontinent, we could make civilized nation and still follow our norms, Englishmen could follow their norms, Indian could follow their norms and Muslims could follow their norm. But the only thing that excites everyone to move ahead of other was DesireNow what that desire is about that could of getting power in terms of Army, Nuclear Bombs, Economy, Central Currency mass adoption (etc.). and control over people's life.Means if there were not riots and no financial recessions were occurred back in 2008 then i doubt today there would be any Crypto exists. But downfall of one lead one person to make another innovation in place of that. In today world people are working there ace off but still few are living a healthy and wealthy life. Those few are those who are only paying:Governments taxes.Those people do not pay:Black Taxes. What do you guys think really drive all the government and platform like this new Platform vanguard, BlackRock and some other companies which holds 88% of the market in US and they are almost in every market and now these platforms are coming into Crypto too. I know i started the topic from history lesson and end up at today's problems, but I have to link something to make my point clearer. Why Corona Virus made some people rich why there is a monopoly in the whole world civilization.One thing is thirst of money because making millions is easy but making billions is not easy and we all know that how big the difference is. So, are these platforms and governments being only after money, or other power to control people's life they are already manipulating people's thought through internet like news of Fire in Lahaina and fire in Dubai and fire in Saudia Arabia. These might be consequences but back in time Ford Car company also took loan before 2008 recession and all other companies go bankrupt why they attract money just few months before recession and why big companies are after BTC and trying there hard best to collect BTC and still delaying the process? That's all my confusions are if anyone love to share their thoughts then i am grateful to you all.",

After a year and a half, everything changed for me, I saved my brothers life when my parents couldn't, because they reached their limit, there was no family to help, it's just my junior ones, father and mother.  Answer to Your Question.There is something called SIN, right from the beginning, and that's why we can't always think the same way, there will always be evil and selfish thoughts amongst us, brothers will betray other brothers, son will plan evil against his father, some will forcefully take things from lands that doesn't belong to them, it's how the world is created.War gives birth to PEACE, there is Good and Evil, since the days of ADAM and EVE it's how the world is created, but we are all given the chance or let me say the WILL to choose a side, Religion isn't even doing shit right now, it's just a bit better that religion exists, because this is what's keeping some people from going really bad. As Evil as the Nuclear Bomb sounds, it's what is keeping some countries safe from other countries that can start their selfish interest in what other countries possess at any time, and when they think about the Nuclear Bomb, they will kill their inner selfish interest immediately, to protect your fence and walls from invaders and keep your people safe, you need to have some scary weapon of mass destruction, it keeps the invaders away.",

I have to agree with this. People tend to adopt new decisions because they want to take an edge over power and money. Whether we accept it or not, with money and power, our aims or desires will be most likely become feasible. Money and power can give us the freedom to do everything with our desires to control our own lives and its happiness. And with the type of government we have at the present, if you don’t have the money that makes you powerful in the society, you will never live your life to its fullest.",

Why just people cannot live together and care for each other not like by doing each other's bidding instead without fighting.Are you sure that the devil and lust exist in the human body, that is why humans are given reason to think which is best and which is bad, the economy / money is one of the causes / factors that can create divisions and wars, If a human uses the devil and lust as a companion in his life, the worst things can happen and be done, that is if reason is used as a means of regret only. Use reason in every problem, surely peace will come true.You can see animals, they only have lust and they only care about themselves and fight each other over territory, they have no sense to think which is bad and good and which are theirs and which are those of others.but if humans have the nature of animals, meaning you can think so, their common sense is absent, divisions occur in every country.",

Each and everyone of them want to make profit for themself while at the same time maintain the government and the nation to survive and keep running. Government won't make a huge policy that will sink the nation, kill most of the citizen or make them very poor and stop working, they need to make the citizen able to work so the economy is not stop. Most of their decision will be made to increase productivity and nation income thus increase their own income, those decision will most likely dictate by the stakeholders or some of us call them Oligarch, some of the decision will be based on good research, but then again even if the decision is based on research the goal is still to increase productivity and income so the stakeholders get richer, and the government get more bonuses. In some special case, like in the country where I live, the Oligarch is also the government, most of the new laws that made are actually benefitting their business.",

But the only thing that excites everyone to move ahead of other was DesireI think what motivates a government of a nation or a citizen to make bold decisions is the willingness to acquire and keep power. The urgency to acquire and retain power, I think lies in any government of a nation. With power in your hands, you could control the narrative to favor your agenda. It’s a hard pill to swallow but the wealthy elites and sadly, the government wants the general public to remain majorly dependent on them. With dependency, whatever control you’ve got begins to recede. What government wouldn’t love a controlled, obedient citizenry?",

Once you get to the top you do everything possible to maintain the position or some other country or someone takes it from you.When you get to the top you rule over the rest. And those at the top tend to be more knowledgeable or see clearer those those below them. But it doesn't mean they are good people. No one is good in the Matrix. However, the top dwellers tend to be more moral than those below them, so it's necessary that they conquer and lead those below, but it's still the blind leading the blind phenomenon, as the morality is not genuine or reliable .. it's what they were programmed to be.Now, there are few people outside of the system who greater than those in the system. They work like vigilante group, more like watchmen with the ability to come into the Matrix to influence things & then leave..Those below the system are typically third world dwellers. Sometimes few people are taken from there to the top of the system and then used to rule over or influence their fellow third worlders after being brainwashed. It's part of the reasons migrants are brought to certain countries and then later used to convert their people to move up the Matrix rank(by being modern), or to evolve, otherwise be destroyed.",

It is not one reason the derives all and it definitely is not always power and money.For example from the little explanation you gave it sounds like you are in a region of conflict like Keshmir; almost all the conflicts in West Asia (our neighborhood) is the result of the past 300 years of colonizers meddling in our region and seeking their own interests. Otherwise before that for thousands of years we never had this kind of conflicts at this scale with these many complications and radicalism.",

All they care about is Money and to live a life they dream of. TBH, i have no dream of buying sports cars, living in big houses in fact i fear big houses because there is so much loneliness in them. But i love games, love to sit in friends, love to talk with them how we can become rich one day (hehe) yeah but without dreams. Other than that, i am just passing my time here.

And i do know about sin and the biggest factor behind SIN is also desired to do things. You mentioned Adam and EVE, i have belief on them. DID you know what was the first murdered in this world it was the child of Adam and Eve one killed another for desire of girl if i am recalling the story right? Sorry if i did not recalled it right because i read it a long time ago. And in the last paragraph you talked about Atom bomb like you just watched Oppenheimer movie. Hehe i did not watched it but i think the answer is relatable because what urges Oppenheimer to make Atom bomb and what actually urges Nolan to make that movie which will work as salt in injuries for those who have bear pain and lose a lot. I did not watch the movie but from short clips on social media accounts i can say, they manipulated movie in a way that Oppenheimer did not actually want to make and instead he was forced. I might be wrong here too as i said i did not watched the movie.",

Why Corona Virus made some people rich why there is a monopoly in the whole world civilization. Money and power are the two reasons why companies invest massively in a particular sector. BlackRock, Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Bitwise, and Fidelity applications for Spot Bitcoin ETF are because they want to make profit from the bitcoin market. Some of them might also have the intention of having some level of control in the market. It could be a rush to have a level of control over a part of the Bitcoin market.

So, are these platforms and governments being only after money, or other power to control people's life they are already manipulating people's thought through internet like news of Fire in Lahaina and fire in Dubai and fire in Saudia Arabia.

That's all my confusions are if anyone love to share their thoughts then i am grateful to you all. There seems to be a kind of misconception here. Private companies like Black Rock and others are the ones applying for approval for Spot Bitcoin ETF and the SEC is the one that will do the approval. They have just started the process of considering the applications and have fixed next year for approval. From the current happenings, it is assumed that Biden's government is anti-Bitcoin. The administration is during everything possible to undermine Bitcoin.",

At a point in reading your essay, on this paragraph I was seeing the creation of bitcoin in my mind. Are you saying \"necessity is the mother of invention\"? Are you saying it was apt for satoshi to begin the creation of bitcoin at the time or he had the idea earlier? Well apart from recession that is looked at on the paragraph, making analysis of the whole post, I see the interplay of money (that is fiat) and the control over people and their situation and overall well being including war. Fiat was identified as a major necessity to life and death, which is why when a country goes to tribal war in the past, the seizure of their fiat was as good as winning the war because there won't be other means of buying and selling or other financial transactions and that will cripple the economy of the weaker opponent. So the creation of bitcoin is indeed a liberation of human society in general. A scenario like that happened in Nigeria during the #Endsars saga, the conveners of the rallies across Nigeria used bitcoin as a means of payment to get necessities to endure protesters got food, water and other necessities while on the streets for days spanning to weeks. This same scenario is happening in Russia and Ukraine war when Russia began to prepare for legislations about legalizing the use of bitcoin while prior to the war and attendant economic sanctions, they never saw alternative payment system like bitcoin as an option or priority.  So it is necessities that drives people and government to take certain bold decisions and the importance of robust financial system will not be overemphasized. Quote from: Jawhead999 on August 17, 2023, 07:22:48 AMWhen you have money and power, In actual fact, when you have power, you can control people or money. That means with political power then you can make policies that can increase people's wealth or reduce it. Therefore a government (head of government) can decide to roll out policies that will affect some areas of business because of certain individuals they want to pull down. So power rules over money, that is why some people gun for political power after they have made money because they want to also protect their business.",

The English East India Company was incorporated by royal charter on December 31, 1600 and went on to act as a part-trade organization, part-nation-state and reap vast profits from overseas trade with India, China, Persia and Indonesia for more than two centuries. Its business flooded England with affordable tea, cotton textiles and spices, and richly rewarded its London investors with returns as high as 30 percent.“At its peak, the English East India Company was by far the largest corporation of its kind,” says Emily Erikson, a sociology professor at Yale University and author of Between Monopoly and Free Trade: The English East India Company. “It was also larger than several nations. It was essentially the de facto emperor of large portions of India, which was one of the most productive economies in the world at that point.”But just when the East India Company’s grip on trade weakened in the late 18th century, it found a new calling as an empire-builder. At one point, this mega corporation commanded a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of the standing British army. That kind of manpower was more than enough to scare off the remaining competition, conquer territory and coerce Indian rulers into one-sided contracts that granted the Company lucrative taxation powers.https://www.history.com/news/east-india-company-england-trade",

Government will do anything just to have power over any countries as much as possible, to have control over and to have so much money. In people, the reason is because of hard times, they need to make a bold decision to change their life, either it's going to be a bad change or good change. Sometimes we need to get out of our comfort zone to have something more, or to grow even more, for better future.",

      "body": "Quote from: Dictator69 on August 17, 2023, 06:52:07 AMI am making this topic out of curiosity to know more, what actually driving all the powerful and non-powerful countries to be in the competition and why there is a competition in the first hand. Why just people cannot live together and care for each other not like by doing each other's bidding instead without fighting. If, i took my own example then we used to rule subcontinent for so long then Englishmen and Indian took over, so we have to fight for another nation which is Pakistan (my history lessons do need sub retouch but as for now just take it as an example). Why we fought for new country the reason is same for each and every other country for which they fought to be independent and so they could follow their norms. Those norms could be based on many beliefs but most those are religious beliefs because we fought for religious beliefs so we could worship with full freedom. I am not going to mention any other thoughts that could lead to many religious riots because in my time here i do understand that this platform does not tolerate that.So, the point i was trying to make here is, even after getting our own country other countries are still interfering in governments rules and taking things over. I don't like to mention names but many already knew. And just to clear i am not saying these statements to put my problems (my means my country) in front of you guys instead i am just using it as an example.What do you expect to happen? The world to stand still and not adapt to new technology? Should the government still mandate that everyone use a horse and cart instead of motor vehicles? The most successful countries in the world arguably have the fairest rules which are enforced equally, but are adapted to new conditions or moral norms. Many countries in the world had criminalized being gay many decades ago, but have obviously abolished these awful laws since. The government is not deaf and will often build their policies based on changing public opinions over time. Now, you mention religion but that is a whole other area but can often, usually for the worse, influence government policy and can take much longer to change.",
