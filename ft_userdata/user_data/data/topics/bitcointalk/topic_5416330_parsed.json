  "content": "I uninstalled my PC,and then sent bitcoins from another wallet to my Electrum wallet. That was before i restored my Electrum wallet with the 12 phrase seed that i have written down on a paper. I took for granted that my previously bitcoin addresses would be intact.To my suprise,the usual Electrum bitcoins address that i normally use,was gone and my saldo is 0. I watched the blockchain and obviously the transaction went trhough and the bitcoins got in the wallet address,but i cant acess the bitcoins after reinstalling my Electrum wallet. Obviously,someone now have the bitcoins i sent. Is there a way to retreive them to my restored wallet,or are they lost forever? Can anyone explain how this could happen,please?",
