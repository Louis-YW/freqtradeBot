Again, the hurdle of carrying cash is almost obsolete to some people but for conventional systems but enabling bitcoin payment is just a life saver.To get more people to inbibe this, you might consider using the payment option as a great deal on your ads and see more offers coming in, it could translate to business expansion for you if you decide to dwell in that are of business.",

I may have to check this out when I go visit the Sphere. My questions are as follows. Do we have to use AirBnB or could we go through you directly to cut out all the crazy cleaning and website fees? Is the EV charger free to use? Do you accept escrow on the forum for these stays?",

Yes, you're welcome to book directly with me if you'd like to bypass the Airbnb fees only not the cleaning. Once payment is confirmed with a deposit (damage deposit is required) sent back once housekeepers gives us the clear (24hrs or less), I will block the dates on the Airbnb app.q2. Is the EV charger free to use? a2. Yes, the EV charger is free to use! There are two levels available: the normal charge, which is free, and a fast charge, which is 7 times faster and comes with an extra fee.https://www.airbnbinlasvegas.com/ev-chargerq3. Do you accept escrow on the forum for these stays?a3. Sorry, but payment must be confirmed and cleared before the stay.",
