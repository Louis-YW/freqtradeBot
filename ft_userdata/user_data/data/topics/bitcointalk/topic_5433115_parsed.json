  "content": "I'm owner of a small cryptocurrency exchange, working for 4 years in gambling sites (currently in Stake.com and Primedice.com), as CryptoGamblersPub since 2018, and then as Dinabot since 2021 after redesigning.It's a good and profitable website, but it's stucked in current state and loosing opportunities to earn way more, because I can't fund it as much as it needs to grow. It needs way bigger working balances for exchanges, and more coins supported. Lots of users simply can't exchange amount/coin they want due our lack of funds for that.I'm willing to split all Dinabot earned profit every month among investors, accordingly their investment size, till full initial amount and +20% of it paid. According statistics of previous years, it could take somewhere between 10-12 months. For bigger investments it can take longer time, so we can disccuss about higher interest rate.No, I don't have a colateral, only Dinabot, it's reputation, earned in years, and it's potential. Please, do not judge me too hard for such brave post  I'm open for any other ideas, which could help Dinabot to grow, and investors to earn.Â I would accept donations, but simply don't know what's a proper place ask for it.I'm not sure, what exactly more info I should provide, so will just wait for questions.",
