There are videos circulating, not sure what Canelo fight they are watching, but you can clearly hear him saying that he can beat Canelo.Now is his chance though, he is going to fight the cash cow and skip Tim and go up and jump to 168 lbs just to fight Alvarez. So this is good as compare to his brother who is inactive. I haven't check the odds though, maybe it will be just the same as his twin. So regardless, it will still be Canelo becoming the favorite in this fight.",

But I do agree, at least he is fighting a Charlo that at least is active, although he will be coming from a injury. He is supposedly to fight Tszyu early this year. Hopefully Tim will be elevated as full champion now since their fight in not happening as Jermell chooses to fight Alvarez for his biggest payday. I'm excited about it, as we can see a lot of fanfare and thrash talking as well as brothers have a big mouth too. Or will they let respect because they know they don't want to wake up Canelo and put a fire on his belly regarding this fight as it's going to be very dangerous for him. So let's see what route Jermell will go here.",

Perhaps he has read the backlash from the boxing community about him and PBC choosing Jermall as Canelo's dance partner as Jermall is inactive. So they look for the best opponent for Canelo at PBC outside of Benavidez and that is his twin brother Jermell. Weight might be an issue as he is fighting at 154 lbs. Nevertheless he will have all the time in the world to bulk up to 168 lbs and most likely this could be his dream fight or at least both of the Charlo wanted to fight Alvarez. But I guess majority will still favor the natural super middleweight champion in Canelo here.",

Both fighters have a comparable chance of winning, but only one can be triumphant. I'm a fan of both fighters, but I'm obliged to support only one of them. Who will it be? Canelo Alvarez or Jermell Charlo? I'm rooting for Canelo. A challenging bout with no definitive winner in which but the strongest combatants emerge triumphant.",

This could be very well be a competitive fight. Only problem I see is that he will have to go up in weight, but we don't know if he can do it or maybe it will be just easy for him as naturally this twins are bigger boxer at 154-160 lbs.",

Doesn't really make sense at all because Jermell have to jump across two weight class just for this fight and I actually agree with you mate, comparing the two, Jermall is much more suitable as he got more talent and just one weight class away from super-middleweight. Although, he is inactive for 2 years but I reckon that he can at least make a difference compared to his brother who is also inactive for more than 1 year.QuoteWhoever of the twin brother he will face, surely for me this is cherry-picking at its finest, how come they can't come up with a fight with Benavidez where that would generate more gate revenue than this one?With Canelo's recent situation that got his wrist in a surgery, he is no longer sure if he can defend his belts against Benavidez.

Canelo will be aggressive in this fight and would score a stoppage. David Benavidez and Jermall Charlo are probably next after Jermell. I doubt there are any other popular names PBC can offer to Canelo's 3-fight deal. WBA regular, David Morrell would've been perfect together with WBC interim David Benavidez but the former's market can be a problem knowing that PBC invested a lot of money to get Canelo and it needs to make marketable fights in order to profit from the deal.",

Canelo got all the plans set and fighting Charlo is included in it, and I can tell that he will not let go of Bivol until he can get that deal done because it is still a win-win situation for him.As per Jermell Charlo, no offense but I don't really see him winning against Canelo because he will face a very tough challenge for jumping two divisions and facing the strongest boxer in SMW directly. He will have no time to adjust as that will literally take some time off his clock.",

So the heavier your opponent, the chances of him going down are slim unless you soften him up which Canelo can't accomplished because again, Ryder is very game opponent for him and did take Canelo's best shot.",

I speculate that he also does not want to fight Benavidez because it is risky and Canelo will lose his opportunity for Bivol if he is not the champion.Canelo vs. Charlo is similar to an altcoin ICO. Hype it then take the money. Fans go home shaking their heads after watching an ordinary fight hehe.But Canelo is no longer with Eddie Hearn, he has moved to PBC and Al Haymon, and maybe it's very tough to do the negotiations for the rematch for Bivol. If he really wanted a rematch then he could at least agree for a 1 fight deal with Hearn. But Canelo doesn't want any of that, Bivol is too fast for him to deal with.Now, facing another Charlo, this time is the active now. So yeah, 3 fight deal and the first fight is going to be easy for him.And as you have said, just to collect money and in the next 2 fights, probably the bigger Benavidez but we will have to wait and see.",
