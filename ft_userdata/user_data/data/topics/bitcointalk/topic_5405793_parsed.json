  "content": "Hello guys. I decided to run full node over Tor and after many tryings I succeeded to do that.But I get only 1 inbound connection, and rarely 2. I guess that's a problem, it's too low.Here are my config: https://prnt.sc/gE51xIc-2uRuDoes anyone know if that's okay or what should I change? PS: I use only Tor (not the browser); on bitnodes, my onion address is green.",

My node is hosted on a fast network, so it's probably the case that more IPv4 nodes are connecting to me than Tor nodes. Seeing as Core will run about 110 inbound peers max to a node (the other 10 are outbound peers), I'm not really surprised at only having one or two tor peers.",
