The first thing you need (and it should run into months) is to acquire the basic skills for trading. You can start with learning about Price Action, candle patterns and Money Management. Babypips is a great site that teaches such stuff. It was a major part of my learning curve.",

This doesn't mean you must learn everything before starting off as even the most experienced traders still learn regularly, but you should have a grip of the fundamentals.Also, trading is not for everyone. There are many skills that one can learn and if you do not really have the interest in something but only want to do it cause you heard it's profitable, chances are you would not be successful at it.",

While it may seem easy at first its actually quite hard to be in profit in the long run and only those with years of dedication manage to be among those few. Quote from: Fuso.hp on February 06, 2023, 03:58:19 PM I have no idea how much money is needed to trade or what coins I can currently profit from trading. About the money, its simple: as much as you can afford to lose. Regarding what coins to trade, there is no guide about that as situation on the market changes constantly and you will have to figure out these things about yourself. To sum it up, be ready to lose quite a lot of money and invest a lot of time into education. Unless you are willing to do that, you won't be among those few % that are actually successful at trading.",

But in addition to knowledge, you will need experience that cannot be obtained in a few days. The easiest way to gain knowledge would be paid training, but as a rule it requires material expenses, which beginners usually do not have. So the only way to gain knowledge will be self-learning the basics of trading, using a forum and free training videos on YouTube.",

QuoteI have no idea how much money is needed to trade or what coins I can currently profit from trading. There's no minimum or maximum. Just note that you will maybe earn 5% on a trade so if you start with $100 that's going to be $5. There's a number of gambling methods. Some people play with leverage but I recommend you don't go over x3 as this is the fastest way to lose it all.

As you expect to gain, expect to loose money too.
