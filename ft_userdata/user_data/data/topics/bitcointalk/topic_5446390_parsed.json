  "content": "Sumber gambar : theredepic.comthis time I want to know more about altcoins in the Games and Metaverse categories.Because it seems that this category of Altcoins is always hotly discussed. And in the past years some projects have even experienced quite a lot of hype like Axie Infinity ($AXS), The Sandbox ($Sand) and others.Even though the price of tokens for games and other types seems to be normal, when the hype always experiences very high spikes and slowly decreases because the hype is over when people are getting bored with the games being played. Or because none of the updates are interesting enough. Or maybe because of something else.For example, like $AXS, which had reached its highest price of $165.37 USD. But today $AXS is trading at around $8.39 USD. And it seems that there hasn't been any interesting news about Axie Infinity yet. So there hasn't been a price hike yet.I want to know if there are currently any Altcoin projects in the Games and Metaverse categories that are worth monitoring because they have pretty good potential going forward. if you have information about this category of Altcoin projects and if you are willing to share that information here then I would really appreciate it.As information, the names that appear in the top 12 are based on searches on CMC about altcoin games category are as follows: 1. Apecoin (Ape) 2. Decentraland (Mana)3. The Sandbox (SAND)4. Axie Infinity (AXS)5. Enjin Coin (ENJ)6. Render Token (RNDR)7. MAGIC (MAGIC)8. Gala (GALA)9. STEPN (GMT)10. BORA (BORA)11. WAX (WAXP)12. Illuvium (ILV) (Maybe this data will be different when you check back at CMC. because CMC keeps updating it in real time.)Of the 12 token names for the games category above, I saw several names that were quite foreign to me. An example is Illuvium (ILV).Source of the article : medium.datadriveninvestor.com by title \"Illuvium: The Most Promising NFT Metaverse Game So Far\"I also tried to search for ILV and found that ILV has a fairly high ATH of $ 2,868.95 (2 years ago according to CMC) while on binance the ATH is around $ 1900 and now it only has a price of around $61,45 . And in the past few months the price has shown a pretty good comeback. Or not because in the pump.And it turns out that there is really good news for ILV in the next month about some sort of upgrade. (At least that's what I read) I read in this source (Binance :Illuvium (ILV) Surges By More Than 30% This Week Amid a Flurry of New Upgrades  & illuvium launches overworld provate beta.)And it seems that the game from Illuvium Over World is getting a lot of attention.But I can't analyze with certainty whether this will be a good potential or not for the future. At least until the event takes place.ILV is just an example of an older project I've been monitoring recently. and this is not a solicitation to buy. and please do your own analysis. because maybe friends here also find an altcoin project in the Games or Metaverse category which is also being monitored and might want to share the information here.I personally am still looking for other potential projects. I hope there are friends here who want to share information through this thread.Thank You-------------------this topic is a topic that I translated from my own original topic on a local board ([DISKUSI]Altcoin Kategori Games & Metaverse (bagikan proyek yang patut dipantau)",

      "body": "Honestly with you, those projects are not failed ones but their tokens fell a lot since 2022 and 2021 bull run. Their token falls are impacted by a general bearish market in cryptocurrency last two years but it is not all and biggest reason.A biggest reason for inverted exponential falls of those tokens is caused by their bad tokenomics design. Their in-game economies are unsustainable by initial designs which harmful impacted their cash inflow and cash outflow with outflow outperforms inflow. Therefore, unavoidably their tokens have to fall under huge selling pressure. In last two years, they tried to changed their tokenomics to balance their in-game economies but I don't know will their changes are good enough to revise broken initial ones.They will have to wait and hope that in next bull run in 2024 and 2025 likely, there will be new huge cash flow into cryptocurrency and Game & Metaverse projects.",

It has the potential to change the public's perception of NFT games from being viewed as Ponzi schemes.the current gameplay is similar to Dota Underlords and I can't wait when we can actually capture Illuvials in the game.",

For me they should be in the list like ILV, its also worth noticing project since they made a lot of partnership even in the esport industry.For now they only got the nfts sold out from their sales and tokens listed on some tier 1 exchange but once their game has been release surely the community will watch out for them.",

      "body": "Honestly, I'm done with my enthusiasm for these games and metaverse projects. Although I'm not closing my door on them, for sure that there will be some of them that shall be up whenever we are back at bull run. Too many good games to play but when there's money involved, we're looking at it as an investment and we're missing the fun. I guess it's hard to find a game that's truly fun and we're not going to think of our investment there because that's losing the purpose of it being a game. But can't blame also our minds since we've placed on with the money that we've worked hard for so, it can't ignore that fact. IMO, just try to follow maybe at least 2 or three or even 1 and look if they've got still the potential by having a good community that's supporting the game which makes the ecosystem, tokenomics and everything revolves around that project's survivability.",

Even, AXIE who have a big community the developer failed to delivery a good burning ecosystem for their token.Since, their project are collapsing other games project are following.

I'm always seeing when the will be releasing the game, but the P2E hype has went down already and yet, they still can't deliver their game to the public. They released their coin, listed it on exchange, but their game is still not playable. At best, I guess they will release this game on or before the bull run, so whenever the game released, and people liked it, most probably the price of it's token will rise. Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on March 27, 2023, 05:38:20 AMHow about guild of guardians? They also launched their tokens but still their game is still in development and not yet tested out.

This one as well is the one that I'm waiting back when the P2E games is still at hype.I can still remember the time where I'm constantly waiting for new updates for the game, and yes until now they are still updating on their discord, but with other events whatsoever, and not the release of the game. They've been selling NFT characters on Immutable X already for a long time, but the game is still in development stages. I've seen also the gameplay online, and it seems pretty good at least since there's an adventure aspect on it which I often play the most. I wonder when they will release the game... or will they release the game. :X",

      "body": "Games & Metaverse projects won't be so much promising until they could really build a perfect ecosystem that made players spend much time on the game. For example just like axi infinity, people play the game just for earning money like they have multiple accounts and do their dailies and stuff just to earn the tokens instead of enjoying the game and really into it. So i think those projects could be promising when they launched a high level entertainment which can gather a lot of players and users.",

Perhaps we need time to reposition the scale and potential of this field in the industry, some of the game statues that I have tried only provide a temporary experience in terms of graphics and features. features in the game, and moreover it is related to monetized content, we need more of quality. A number of projects Enjin (ENJ), The Sandbox (SAND), ... have all received great growth recently when people talk about this field.",

From my perspective enjoying gaming in crypto game is a bullshit, because most of us care only about the source income earning + revenue.",
