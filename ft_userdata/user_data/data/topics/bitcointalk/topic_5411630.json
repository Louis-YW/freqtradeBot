      "body": "Are you worried about how you will have to declare that $2 of profit? In this case, obviously, it is not going to be worth your while to pay a tax advisor. See if someone who knows how it works in the US can help you.As far as I know, in most countries in the world, if they don't have an IRS or equivalent body that is inquisitorial, nothing will happen if you don't declare that $2.Another thing would be that the legislation counts as capital gains every trade in which you make money, but does not deduct the losses, so that, despite earning $2 net, you would probably owe hundreds of dollars at least to the IRS. But it sounds to me that in the USA they are not so imbecilic as to count it that way.",

The tax rates varies from states to states and also from countries to countries so better refer the local auditor for accurate information.",

Usually it is helpful to just call the tax agency since they can tel, you in one sentence what you are supposed to do.You are required to declare any profit, if it is written in the law. There are licensed accountants in the US and companies that do it for you. The tax office may not check your declarations. I listened to stories from people that they have not been called to the tax office for more than 15 years, and the period of verification is limited to 3 or 5 years, I don’t remember. But for so long, people are required to keep supporting documents. Therefore, declaring small profits can be a good expense for the taxpayer if he uses intermediaries, but not for the tax.",
