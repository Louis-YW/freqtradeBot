But it will be interesting if the market has a surprise because I often find that the market always reacts against the crowd. When people think that 17k is the bottom of the bear season, bitcoin continues to find the bottom of 15.4k, and this time, it will repeat even though it is not known whether it is up or down.",

      "body": "The price of bitcoin will still be where it is now and not go anywhere. There may still be fluctuations but it's not likely to go down too much or up too much more. But if it is after the New Year, there is a possibility that the price will surprise us, whether it will be an increase or decrease. And right now, it's still at $16k and we'd better wait until the end of the year and see what happens. I didn't expect the price to drop further, even though it was an opportunity to buy more bitcoins.",

After all that has also happened in this month so that makes me confident in that price range although it is still very possible for a higher price than that. Just because considering that this year is only a few days away, so I chose on the basis of what Bitcoin has achieved this month, namely ($16K - $18K).",

One of the worst weeks to trade is the week between Christmas and New Years. Honestly surprised the markets aren’t closed then.There won’t be any big moves unless there is some bad or very good news being released, which is unlikely.

This time frame is too small imo for us to expect a miracle so I guess it's now safe to say that this year 2022 is mostly compose of a bearish market but lets hope that next year 2023 and onwards are going to be a good year for the cryptos.The only thing that we must be happy for this year is that we already filled our bags with different coins. Not just any random coins but of course, only the best because their values are also cheaper this year. For those who haven't done a shopping yet, they can still do a last minute of it.

The market value would be really have a harder time to recover if perhaps its market price would cross the $10k mark. At this moment, there are still nothing such as factor which could boost the interest of people towards investing on this industry like positive news. As far as I know, the biggest expected leap on its price is being anticipated at 2024 which has something to do with the next Bitcoin halving. But it would be one long year for 2023, for sure it will be difficult for investors if there'll be no increase with its price for a whole year, except for those who can afford to endure such situation, which are more likely big investors of this industry.",
