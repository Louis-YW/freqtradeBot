Sometimes it's so frustrating to use TOR.I assume you are using Windows. This is because of the last Windows update, many applications are recognized as malware by Microsoft Defender. It is necessary to manually restore quarantined files in MS Defender Antivirus.Check here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/restore-quarantined-files-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide",

It's a Windows side problem. Specifically speaking, the latest Windows 11. Uninstalling and Installing isn't fixing the issue for me. I haven't tried the defender part, let's see if it works.One thing I couldn't understand, previously everything was fine even with the latest win 11. Now it just won't connect. Weird.",
