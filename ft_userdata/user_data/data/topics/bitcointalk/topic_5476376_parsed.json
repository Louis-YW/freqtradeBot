Don't you know no order will be filled at those prices less than $20000. It may also not be possible for your order to fill at $30000 because bitcoin price is having more probability to go higher than going down because of the bitcoin spot ETF that United States SEC is about to approve in coming month if not this month.",

I use big exchanges like Binance, OKX, Bybit, MEXC and other big ones. What I noticed on big exchanges sometimes but which is not occuring to bitcoin like before is the price iyf bitcoin to increase or decrease significant like you said, but not on spot market but on derivative market. This may still be common to some altcoins but not bitcoin. Market will become more volatile again, I will see if this will happen again.",

Now $37,900-36,600 is a pretty strong support, to get under $30k is certainly still quite difficult, unless there is a big FUD that hits Bitcoin.But we will see how Spot ETFs are received, it will be a strong bullish starter and could even break through the $50k price. At the moment the market is indeed high and there will be some corrections, but not as far as you think, and you should place orders above the nearest support.",

      "body": "Well, although there's nothing wrong with setting a buy limit setup, I think you're exaggerating too much. I don't think $20000 is nearly impossible for bitcoin to go down anyway; it's your own trading strategy, but why don't you set a buy limit on small margins? Because what you've provided has a big gap or margin with the current price of bitcoin now at $42k, you could simply put a buy limit at $41k or between $42k, which is the current price, and $40k. It's sure that you will soon have a live trade or buy limit being active, because if you wait based on the range you've given, it will take some time, and you will also miss the opportunity now. Anyway, this is just a mere advise; it's still your own decision on how you execute your trade. As long as you are earning, then it's fine.",

      "body": "If the flash market crash prepares there's no way you're going to achieve anything with the buy order limit you set for Bitcoin if we're talking about 8months ago I would say there's a chance for the flash dump to meet your request but now that investors are the greed of getting more BTC before next year no. I will advise you to change it to a possible 40K now that we're within the range of 43 - 44K price.Quote from: LoyceV on December 06, 2023, 09:33:35 AMIt could be. If the bad guys were in charge of Sinbad, that explains why they were quickly trusted enough to send them millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Pretty much anything can be used for good or evil, but starting a business for evil is very different than a legitimate business being abused.[/quote]Agreed but is it hard for the authorities to know those in charge just like they did with some mixer that was shut down?",

Haven’t tried this one and maybe its a good idea if you have extra funds most of the time to close that order and of course if you’re too busy to trade and monitor the market, this can be a big help. Bitcoin is rising that much again, lucky to those who bought at a cheaper price and did a great strategy especially with DCA. Its not too late yet, we still have time to buy Bitcoin and set your buying price realistically so you will not miss this opportunity again.",

Secondly, you didn't tell us the name of the strategy if peradventure someone could get it online and learn more about it if it's worth using.Conclusively based on my trading experience, you have no strategy at all, you are just gambling. This is one of the ways people gamble in the market and would think they are trading. The psychological number trading is as good as regular lines, though in crypto it could be worth it at times when the market is very sluggish. Regardless, it can never exonerate the fact that the trader is gambling as there are no good factors to back the trading style up.What if the market is so active enough, will you still use it? Imagine you used this strategy for Bitcoin when it was at $44,000, by now you would have lost money. It's just a style I will never advise anyone to use.",

Keeping it simple with limit buy orders can indeed be effective, and it's smart to cover a wide range just in case. Peace of mind while trading is priceless. 😌The solid coin in the crypto market over a decade was bitcoin and Ethereum build his own world by the assuming themselves for the transaction fee,this made the Ethereum demand equal to the bitcoin over the huge years and both of the coins won millions of people hearts in the recent years.",

My mind asks, can you wait until the price drops to the limit you mentioned? How confident are you of a decline?Everything is your decision, but in my opinion you should not set the buy price order at a price below 30K. If you want to buy, why not consistently use the DCA method which is familiar among investors.For me, applying DCA is a form of precaution so as not to continue falling asleep so that the dream goes too far.Okay. Up to you. Good luck.",

I think with this set you could average your balance in a good way in case theres a sudden market crash. Anyway its gonna be hard to predict the bottom or market downfall a dca is good but if you could lower the gap may also give you advantage cause sometimes its noticrable if the down movement will continue or not.
