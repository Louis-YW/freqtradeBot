  "content": "Currently, many Nigerians are hedging against collapsing local currency the naira by accumulating cryptocurrencies, particular stablecoins and bitcoins. According to  recent data,many Nigerians traded over $5 million worth of Bitcoin on the popular P2P trading website Paxful, and LocalBitcoins saw a 258% increase from last week’s data. Despite the fact that banks are forbidden by the central bank from aiding cryptocurrency transactions, many Nigerians nonetheless exchange the digital currency in the peer-to-peer market.How would people keep investing in a currency that recently lost almost 70% of its value against the naira that just lost 35% of its value? Why would people choose to invest in a currency that has been banned by the powerful central banks? Why would people still have confidence in a currency that has faced countless media wars by powerful nations, corporations and individuals depicting it as a bad investment? There have been speculations and projections that Bitcoin price would keep falling until it would soon become worthless, yet people still trust it. Bitcoin would not stop amazing me.",

The trick is to zoom out on the charts.The naira as with many other fiat currencies have been getting devalued, due to inflation, while Bitcoin has been progressively appreciating in value, making it more of a hedge within a mid to long-term time range.Of course, there would be intermittent price drops due to the speculative value, but the value always recovers. This is not the same with NGN and many other fiat currencies.Quote from: Die_empty on August 10, 2022, 01:15:59 PMWhy would people choose to invest in a currency that has been banned by the powerful central banks?

I think all of these are just an individual pushing a narrative on others that just accept it, think it'll be good for media coverage of their company or just have fear of the technology. I don't know if it's the same with a lot of people but particularly older generations get annoyed at younger people using phones until they realise how well connected it's made people and have had to embrace it themselves - crypto might end up in the same category as that.",

If you look at the short term, let's remember that just a few months ago 1 BTC was worth less than $18 000, and today it is worth $24 000, which could have resulted in significant profits for some investors.Quote from: Die_empty on August 10, 2022, 01:15:59 PMWhy would people choose to invest in a currency that has been banned by the powerful central banks?

There have been speculations and projections that Bitcoin price would keep falling until it would soon become worthless, yet people still trust it. Bitcoin would not stop amazing me.I assume that in a country like Nigeria, the average person does not live even close to the standard that exists in most developed countries, and accordingly, the average person blames the government, politicians and banks for that. In such an environment, people are more inclined to look for an alternative, and it is more than obvious that they have found it in Bitcoin. Moreover, bans in such cases are even more counterproductive because the more you prevent people from doing something, the more resistance they show, especially if they understand that they want to take away their right to free choice.Quote from: Die_empty on August 10, 2022, 01:45:46 PMThe deputy governor of Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said to BBC, “Their price can vary quite considerably and [bitcoins] could theoretically or practically drop to zero.\"This is the well-known position of the Bank of England, but also of many other central banks around the world, especially in Europe.

If Nigerian Government refuse to adopt bitcoin and  with the way I am seeing the massive inflow of users of bitcoin in the country, very soon the users will use it to render the services of selling goods with bitcoin and accepting goods with bitcoin but for now everyone is changing the bitcoin to the fiat currency for the exchanging of goods and services. And why people are still tripping in to bitcoin even in the midst of the bear market because Nigeria currency is worthless to the dollar. And as it is now. The inflation in the country is very much high that the Fiat currency can not buy a reason thing to anyone. A shirt that was sold $3 in years back now is about $15 to 20 dollar. No reasonable youth will see such thing and stick to the Fiat currency to suffer.",

And funny enough, Nigeria (a banned country) happens to be the country with the highest Bitcoin transaction. But however, here are my view on these statements belowQuote from: Die_empty on August 10, 2022, 01:15:59 PMHow would people keep investing in a currency that recently lost almost 70% of its value against the naira that just lost 35% of its value? It is very simple, because thou Bitcoin fell by 70% in the past few days, it still has the tendency to go another 100% to 1000% in the future compared to Fiat currency whose value is stagnantQuoteWhy would people choose to invest in a currency that has been banned by the powerful central banks? Because this currency has the potential to be a better option for long term investment compared to Fiat currency investmentQuoteWhy would people still have confidence in a currency that has faced countless media wars by powerful nations, corporations and individuals depicting it as a bad investment?Because it saw the tough times and yet still survive with mass adoption and pump in priceQuoteThere have been speculations and projections that Bitcoin price would keep falling until it would soon become worthless, yet people still trust it. This is Bitcoin and not Luna Terra that could be worthless anytime soon because it has got the massive community always ready to invest there funds",

There's no hope that it'll recover. It's a hyperinflated currency that will worth even less tomorrow, and even less the day after that. Bitcoin gives a hope to escape this fraudulent, centralized system. They don't \"invest\" into it, in the same way they don't invest when they're buying other currencies. It's just a trade. They switch from one currency to the other.

Let's say Russia is currently under a lot of post-war sanctions, RUB suffers from the lowest inflation rate of up to 17%. In fact, a drop of 35% is a pretty severe inflation rate for a country's currency. Internal conflicts seem more dangerous to the country's economy.On the other hand, cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin have proven to be a currency of freedom with high volatility. So the concern about inflation has been accepted and becomes a normal risk even when the value will be zero.",

Bitcoin is valid in almost all countries, while local currency is only valid in certain countries. Belief in Bitcoin is emerging all over the world, and trust is born naturally.Trust in fiat currency is caused by the state forcing to use the currency, and prohibiting transactions using other currencies that are not authorized by the state. That trust will disappear naturally if there is inflation in a country.If a country collapses, then the local currency will collapse. If a country collapses then Bitcoin will not collapse.To tear down Bitcoin is just to tear down the world. Lol And it's a dream that's still far away.",
