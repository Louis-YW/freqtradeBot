When it comes to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, I think any language it's being presented in can be easily understood, provided that the person reading it can understand the language very well. The only place I see a special technique on teaching with a native language is where the writer gives an instance and an illustration of things that are being found within their surroundings for better understanding.",

It depends on the level of English we have and when our English is not that good then the respective local council is a better place to discuss or analyze crypto. The local council clearly makes it easier in all aspects because we speak our mother tongue so many things make it easier for us to focus on learning. The combination between local councils and global discussions will be much more diverse with the many thoughts each member can contribute, so that we will gain a lot of knowledge and make it easier for us to understand.Quote from: Jocuserious on August 26, 2023, 02:46:02 PMThere are many high level members who discuss crypto in their own language or this forum. If you follow their discussion carefully you will progress very quickly. It is an honor if we can make a real contribution to local and global councils because many parties will be assisted every time the discussion takes place and it is possible that everything we make or share in posts can be used as reference material for discussion. If a lot of high ranking members are active in the locale, it will be much better because many questions can be asked in their own mother tongue. That is the extent to which we are willing to learn and try to improve the pattern of discussions that are more focused by integrating the knowledge that we continue to develop.",

We understand that, many doesn't know English or understand it properly. So if you don't understand part it you can simply ask in your local thread. For me it was very helpful.

Don't forget to read the set of not allowed rules embedded by local moderators.Since I'm still a beginner, I think the first thing I need to do is understand all the forum rules before entering to share something that I know about the content of the ongoing discussion topic.In addition to the local language being easy to understand the direction and purpose of the discussion for learning to analyze crypto and other technical matters, there are difficulties if you try to learn by activating yourself when listening to discussions that use languages outside of the locale.Many of the posts made in the discussion come from people who are not native English speakers so that when interpreted they are confusing. Moreover, I was very serious about learning about wallet security before analyzing crypto.",

Learning and being more active in the local board for someone who is joining this forum for the first time and doesn't have enough knowledge and if they have problems understanding the language will really help beginners to adapt to this forum more quickly and so they understand more and get to know developments about crypto in accordance with a language that is easy for them to understand, namely their respective national languages.But keep in mind that if beginners are only active and contributing continuously to the local board, I think they will never develop and will never gain more knowledge, they must also follow and add to their insights about crypto developments from various points of view including from general/global threads in order to have a broader and more complete understanding and knowledge. For the problem of a lack of understanding of English, which is an international language in my opinion it shouldn't be a thing that prevents them from being active and contributing to global threads because they can use an automatic translator at any time in the device browser they have.",
