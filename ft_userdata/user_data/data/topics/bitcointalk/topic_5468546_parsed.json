It is also a good idea to leave a neutral tag on their accounts with a reference to a post containing evidence, just like this one.Quote from: Gladitorcomeback on September 29, 2023, 02:32:50 PMIn Utopia weekly review bounty I found many accounts which created in same day and all accounts have the same posting style( Posted UTOPIA #POA in 4 other bounties thread to increase activity).

If you have some solid evidence that these are alt accounts, it is definitely a good reason to slap on a negative tag because that is an abuse of the bounty campaign rules.",

I used to tag those sock puppet farms, but eventually I got bored of that whack-a-mole game so I rather report them to mods and ask for perma ban which often happens when account is brand new.

You should definitely report them to bounty manager and if you have time, you can create a topic and provide the evidence that those accounts are indeed connected and controlled by the same person so at least they might end up with negative tag.
