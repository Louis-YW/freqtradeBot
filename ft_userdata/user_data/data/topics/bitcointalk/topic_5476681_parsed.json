If it is a wallet or someone offers you a wallet, then he is a scam.5 million is a large amount and you need to either make p2p transactions, which may end up with you paying crazy fees, or go to one of the platforms that provide OTC and buy from them.",

Like what other poster said why not involving himself with p2p than looking for someone to have such outrageous deal with sometimes it often ends with scamming each others.",

Just take a peep at his profile – OP was registered on 5th December 2023, made a single post on the day of registration (that's this one) and disappeared into thin air till date. Anyone who decides to deal with OP should be mindful of the type of risk they're setting themselves up for.",
