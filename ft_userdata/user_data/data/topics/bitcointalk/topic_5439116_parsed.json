  "content": "#CATENA_Network#CMCX_CoinConsensus Protocol is a set of rules that are used to validate and verify transactions on a blockchain network. It is an agreement between all the participants in the network to reach consensus on the state of the ledger. The most common consensus protocols are Proof of Work (PoW) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).The Practical Proof of Stake (PPoS) algorithm is a consensus protocol that uses a stake-based voting system to validate transactions on a blockchain network. In this system, users who own tokens or coins can “stake” their coins in order to become validators. Validators are then rewarded for validating transactions and maintaining the network.The Cormultichain project will be greatly appreciated with this algorithm as it provides scalability, security, and decentralization. The PPoS algorithm allows for faster transaction times, lower fees, and more secure networks than traditional PoW algorithms. Additionally, it allows for more decentralized networks as it does not require large amounts of computing power to become a validator.➖➖➖➖➖CORE MultiChain Media:Web (https://coremultichain.com/)Wallet Web (https://wallet.coremultichain.com/)Twitter (https://twitter.com/COREMultichain) YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/c/coremultichain)TG Channel (https://t.me/COREMultiChain)TG Chat (https://t.me/coremultichaingroup)Github (https://github.com/COREMultichain)LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/coremultichain/)Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/coremultichain/)➖➖➖➖➖TOGETHER WE GROW ⚡️➖➖➖➖➖#CATENA_Network#CMCX_Coin#COREMultichain #CMCX #COREWalletApp #COREWallet #blockchain #CORE #cryptocurrency #cryptowallet",
