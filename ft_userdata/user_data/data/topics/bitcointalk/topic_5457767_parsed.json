I have categorized bitcoin people into Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin Core developers, Bitcoin institutions(like Microstrategy), Bitcoin Noobs. I know there are many more but pardon me that is the best that comes to mind. Of these categories which do you think are do you think are the most bullish.My personal opinion are miners. Because as a miner, you are constantly mining Bitcoin from the network in exchange for electricity and you constantly have to be mining Bitcoin otherwise you have to shut down your operation and when your operation consumes as much energy, well then you have to mine a lot of Bitcoin.I know you may disagree but like I said it is my personal opinion and I would like to know yours?",

There are bitcoin maximalists and altcoin maximalists. There are Bitcoin haters like Faketoshis, Roger Ver, ...QuoteI have categorized bitcoin people into Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin Core developers, Bitcoin institutions(like Microstrategy), Bitcoin Noobs.Even they are doing things related to Bitcoin from mining, coding, investing, learning, you will always see weak hands and disbelieved people. They can have belief in Bitcoin but not all people keep their thinking the same year to year. Especially in bear markets, when lot of things happen and mostly negative, some people will give up and switch to do other things.QuoteI know there are many more but pardon me that is the best that comes to mind. Of these categories which do you think are do you think are the most bullish.Miners are people who have to invest capital and you can consider them as most bullish because they take risk that they will have to mine for a while till a break-even time that is not a short waiting time. But there will be miners who give up, capitulate in bear market. Same with Bitcoin investors, coders and noobs.",

      "body": "It’s a question with no definitive answer. There are miners who are only doing this as a business, institutions only buying Bitcoin for short term profit, devs maybe doing this just for the sake of their job (there were rumors before that Coinbase will hire Bitcoin devs but idk if they ever did), etc.On the other hand, the opposite of all the above exists too. After all, it’s all about who believes Bitcoin can succeed.For the sake of this thread though, I’d say generally it’s the miners and devs being most bullish, followed by institutions and finally the noobs. Noobs deserve last place because they’re only bullish when Bitcoin’s bullish.",

Noobs deserve last place because they’re only bullish when Bitcoin’s bullish.Noobs join the market when the market is very bullish and they are attracted to join with dream of getting rich quickly.They don't have anything regardless of greediness so they will change to be bearish, very bearish and will be shaken out from the market when it turns to be bearish or just with corrections. Noobs need times to get familiar with this market, understand more about Bitcoin, its network operation and digest FUDs without considerable fearful feelings. Many noobs will fail to mature in this market but we will always have new noobs with each Bitcoin bull run.",

Because as a miner, you are constantly mining Bitcoin If you're to consider the list you gave, you will discover that bitcoin miners has the most demanding aspect of them all as it both requires the mining technical skills, requirements for setting up a bitcoin mining rig and also the difficulty into solving a complex mathematical equations to be the one to appear first to finish this minig task to be rewarded with bitcoin, so bitcoin miners are the most demanding of them all and the sole basic background that creates an avenue for us all to have bitcoin to trade, hodl and invest, miners also have their little way of facing a serious challenge under regulations except for those that have learnt to remain independent of the government approved energy source.",

They do not rely on lobbying efforts, investments in mining equipment or electricity, or seek patronage from others. Instead, their approach revolves around promoting the concept of purchasing Bitcoin while keeping their selling activities undisclosed.",

But this is a topic that really has nothing to do with someone's holding or belief in the market. Miners will always be there because it is profitable, the bitcoin core devs of course are also bullish too and want to see bitcoin to succeed more. Whilst for the noobs, count me in there as it could be someone who's just in the market and buys bitcoin and holds it for the long term. As for these institutions, they're known that they're here to make money and that's why no matter what the market situation is, they'll find ways to capitalize the situation and make money from it. You see what they're doing right now, they're all hungry to take advantage of the situation and no one wants to get left behind.",

I don't really see the miners or developers being that bullish, as either way they are generating income from Bitcoin's existence, so generally speaking speculating on the price isn't necessary, even if remains profitable. As for the institutions, sure they can be bullish to some degree or another, but generally it's about wealth preservation as opposed to wealth accumulation, so they allocate their % or two into Bitcoin in order to maintain the wealth they have already accumulated.",

The developers don't care that much about the price, they are focused on making Bitcoin better because it's their passion. The miners and institutions are first of all focused on profits. They don't need Bitcoin to go up and up to profit, they just need it to not crash too hard. As long as the price is not too low, they will be collecting fees and making profit.So, only noobs here are the most interested in Bitcoin going up, because that's their whole strategy - getting rich quick.",

The dev don't care about profit but to make sure the network is working perfectly as they are not doing it for money.",

I have categorized bitcoin people into Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin Core developers, Bitcoin institutions(like Microstrategy), Bitcoin Noobs. I know there are many more but pardon me that is the best that comes to mind. Of these categories which do you think are do you think are the most bullish.My personal opinion are miners. Because as a miner, you are constantly mining Bitcoin from the network in exchange for electricity and you constantly have to be mining Bitcoin otherwise you have to shut down your operation and when your operation consumes as much energy, well then you have to mine a lot of Bitcoin.I know you may disagree but like I said it is my personal opinion and I would like to know yours?Bullish means: the one who thinks BTC will break its ATH in the next bull run after halving. (it is my opinion so) If we take this definition into account and try to select which of the above option is more bullish then i think the Noob category might fall into this. (like me, yeah i am also nooB). The point is, Noobs can easily fall prey to market sentiments just like the current situation.I wrote a post yesterday, about how HSBC bank's enabling the BTC ETFs is not big news but media outlets are showing it like big news and many newcomers are taking it like \"Oh wow, BTC is going to adopt globally now\" but we all know that such news made no bigger impact until they play their role in manipulating investor's and trader's mindset.I also read a post in which OP shared his thoughts about a halving of BTC. As most of the people involved or new to crypto think that in this halving, the BTC will going to reach $100k easily. But the Op's idea reflects different things. point is if that becomes true then what are the people's mindset will be in 2026, will their trust halving? (TBH, my idea is maybe not as when many people know the secret, then the secret ingredient becomes useless).",

Bitcoin miners get new coins, and overall I don't think they are a big part of those who closely follow the market. It's often costly to stop the operations and then restart them, so if miners probably push through the tough times if they can. Bitcoin Core developers are the farthest, I believe, from the pricing and stuff, as they are focused on the technology and maintaining it. Bitcoin institutions aren't bullish enough, clearly, because we'd have a much better market situation if they were. The newbies, on the other hand, are often very hopeful and misguided, thinking that Bitcoin will bring them great profits pretty fast, so they are probably the most bullish. That being said, they're probably also those who panic the most when Bitcoin starts losing value.",
