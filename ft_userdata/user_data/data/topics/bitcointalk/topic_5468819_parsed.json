Chadon50Why would get fooled by a newbie account with only two activity points. Worse still, they were providing a service that is banned in the forum. Please always read the sticky threads in the different boards or else you are going to lose more moneyThe profile you are accusing has already been permanently banned from the forum as of today.",

Since no one knows the kind of business deal you did with the above-mentioned proclaimed scammer, I will advise you to be very careful with the kind of person you chose to deal with on any kind of business that requires money, as there are people who appear to be real on the internet but are scammers.Quote from: tetaeridanus on October 02, 2023, 11:53:56 PMMan, how do you get scammed by people who have less iq than monkeys; I don't understand...Are you insulting the OP or the scammer who scammed the OP? The money might appear to be little to us, but we don't know how much it might be worth to the OP, and I believe anyone can be scammed, unless for most of us who already have many scam ideas and can't easily be moved by them again. It's not about having little IQ; it's just about trust. I believe the OP trusted the wrong person to deal with here on whatever kind of business they went into together.",

Did you see the thread he got scammed? One dude was selling 100$ worth cloud space for 9$s. How on earth can he do that, didn't OP think about that; that's not even trying to scam. The dude just asked for donations in the thread imo, who believes in that donated money to him sadly.",

It is probably deleted already, either by the mod or himself. If you have an archive for that you can post it here to help OP's case. It is unfortunate that OP didn't do it in the first place. Kinda hard to verify if there's nothing to begin with.",

The accused person already locked his thread and I think if OP is true then he will never comeback with the same account and will try different trick to cheat. OP took risk because 9$ is not big deal and hacker succeed to decieve him. Now If OP you wishes for a DT member to took action then you should provide the screenshot of telegram conversation and also the transaction hash .It will help clarify ,what happened actually.",

And again you need to use the proper scam reporting format with a solid evidence.",

With all you dropped here how can anyone help you on this? I don't think he's CIA station where you just drop a blanket piece of paper and expect a miracle to happen.I'm not sure you can get any help from here concerning what happened on telegram, why not report that user to telegram instead.",
