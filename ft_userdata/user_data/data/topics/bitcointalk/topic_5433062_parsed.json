There's no workaround, just check your dbcache is as high as it can be (in the 4000-8000mb region if you can spare that) and wait for it to catch up. The issue is when core loads it tries to load as quickly as possible and checks only a handful of blocks. It'd make some sense if it stored a way to check double the number of blocks, run the second check and then rewind only to the first detected corruption but that might be harder to find and manage.",

AFAIK nobody create up-to-date bootstrap.dat anymore and nowadays it'll make sync process slower[1-2].Quote from: Jason Brendon on January 15, 2023, 04:21:49 AMSo does it mean that deleting one .dat file and its rev.file takes the same amount of time as deleting say 100 .dat files and its rev.file?I tried to reproduce what OP did with Bitcoin Signet[3] on Bitcoin Core 23.0 which has following files.Code:128M blk00000.dat128M blk00001.dat128M blk00002.dat128M blk00003.dat 64M blk00004.dat 21M rev00000.dat 24M rev00001.dat 22M rev00002.dat 24M rev00003.dat 13M rev00004.datI deleted blk00004.dat and rev00004.dat, then run Bitcoin Core on Signet mode. I got error message \"Error building block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database now?\", so i re-run with additional -reindex parameter. I observe what Bitcoin Core is doing and here's the result,1. It attempt to sync block header.2. Bitcoin Core indeed re-process all blocks from beginning which still exist on your storage.3. Bitcoin Core only download missing block. Bitcoin Core shows my Signet node was 15 weeks / about ~15.5K block behind. First Bitcoin Signet block was mined on 2020-08-31[4] and current highest block height is 125798[5].The conclusion is, deleting 1 blk/rev file pair and 100 blk/rev file pair takes different time due to amount of block needs to be re-downloaded.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=986676.msg10753296#msg10753296[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2234542.msg22524484#msg22524484[3] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet[4] https://mempool.space/signet/block/00000008819873e925422c1ff0f99f7cc9bbb232af63a077a480a3633bee1ef6[5] https://mempool.space/signet/blocksthanks a lot and i really appreciate your time and effort here. Can you also help me check one thing please? That will save me opening up another post here.what is the permission you grant for .bitcoin/blocks?During the whole process, i am afraid i screwed the permission. I wanted to make sure if it is 700 or 600 and also all the permissions for those .blk and rev files under the .bitcoin/blocks/thanks!",
