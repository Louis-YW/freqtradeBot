      "body": "I think it is safe to say that no one will be able to answer this question objectively, unless one of us comes back directly from death I guessPersonally I don't believe in reincarnation, it doesn't fit my culture or my beliefs. It's all about beliefs, people need to follow their intuitions and beliefs, I guess if reincarnation were made to match yours, it would be immediately familiar to you and you would believe in it without needing to think about it.There are probably users on this forum who will know how to develop the subject, because there are certainly users from regions where this belief is shared by at least a part of their population.I had met a man who was trying to always do good things around him (at least in his personal conception of goodness). I asked him where he got the strength to stay positive even in difficult times, and how he managed to remain courteous and friendly, even when he was confronted with rude or unfair people. He told me that he tried to keep a positive relationship with all people and animals, because he was afraid of being reincarnated as a rock in his next life. I still wonder if he was serious, or if he was joking, but in the end, it doesn't matter what the belief is, as long as it directs the believers in question to a healthy relationship with humanity, it is a positive gain for all humanity.",

      "body": "Many people believe in reincarnation based on personal experiences, spiritual or religious beliefs, or anecdotal accounts. Some also point to research on near-death experiences and past-life regression therapy as evidence for the existence of reincarnation. Ultimately, whether or not reincarnation is real is a matter of personal belief. While there is no scientific evidence to support the concept of reincarnation, it is a belief held by many people around the world and has played an important role in many cultures and religions throughout history.",

Forgive me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that you are arguing that the probability of existing during a specific finite period of time approaches 0 when the range of time is infinite. So, in order to justify our existence in terms of probability, we must be reincarnated an infinite number of times (or live forever).However, the probability of existing during any finite period of time does not approach 0, so reincarnation is not a necessary condition. Furthermore, you argument overlooks the relevant fact that we are alive now, so the probability that it is currently the time when we are alive is 1, and reincarnation is not a necessary condition.",

I want to know if there is any sure thing, because I don't believe in such.I don't believe in reincarnation because that is part of a certain people's belief system. It's 21st century, and even till this day no one has reincarnated in this world or somewhere else. Even if someone has got another life in the form of reincarnation, but no body has ever been able to prove that.According to my beliefs, we have got this life for one time only, and it depends on us that how we can utilize it to do good things for humanity and for our loved ones. If we make something that helps humanity then we will live forever even after death. Death is an experience everyone has to go through, so always be prepared for it, but still enjoy every milli-second of this life.I also believe that life can exist in other planets, and I believe in all those things that my culture thought me as a child. But, I've always been excited about exoplanets and astronomy, and that's why I believe that there can be some planets just like earth where life could exist.",

All these belief though are practiced to make those people behave. Kind of a reward for them. Its not so bad to see people very civilized though.",

If you believe in religion then you better believe in it, if not then forget it. I think this is a religious dogma. It's hard to explain unless you die first to find out and return to this world, but that's impossible. However, my advice is, if you believe then you have nothing to lose if after death there is no world anymore, but if you don't believe and there is a world after death then that will be bad",
