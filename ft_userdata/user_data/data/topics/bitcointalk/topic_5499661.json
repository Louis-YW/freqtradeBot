With 3 years it does not appear on top of the list, we can see these years are bearish years for Bitcoin market.The yearly candles chart show these three years in red as visually bearish years.Bitcoin is unarguably the best investment asset. From what you've just explained, I noticed something quite interesting. During the three years when Bitcoin didn't reach the top due to bearish occurrence, it shows that many people are drawn to Bitcoin when its price is doing well. This also indicates that the FOMO is still very much present even since 2013. Just imagine for 11 years which is more than a decade, Bitcoin made it to the top spot due to the less bearish experiences in those years. But for the three years that Bitcoin didn't make it, it ended up at the last spot. This proves that the bullish trend of Bitcoin's price gains the attention of new investors.There is no longer a debate about which asset is worth investing in. The rise in the price of Bitcoin since 2013 is already enough evidence for everyone to see. And as for this year (2024), Bitcoin has already won the top spot even before the end of Q1. We just can't forget the year of the ETF approval.",

If you observe the chart properly you will notice it is the only with more consistency and it was able to maintain the consistency for years. Despite all the negative energies and backlash it has received it is still able to do well and still showing more potential to surpass itâ€™s current achievements.

Well if they keep doubting they keep missing out on the opportunity to be part of the best investment in the world. Some people have realized their mistakes and hopefully these doubters would too i just hope they realize it soon enough because bitcoin waits for no one.",

But I do believe it matters that it was also the worst-performing asset in the other three years, and with a huge difference between it and the closest worst-performing competitor. It's probably those years, in which Bitcoin loses over a half of its value, that are scary to some investors and make Bitcoin seem like a very risky asset. Unlike some other options on the list, it can lead to huge losses in an unlucky year, and some just can't handle that pressure.",

By this, they might exit earlier a little bit, miss the ATH of a cycle, but they will avoid a worse year in each cycle. Then they will get very good ROI with rest 3 years of the cycle, I emphasize, even in bear market can last 2 years, the last one will be profitable because market will warm up before a next bull run of new cycle.",

So those who are reluctant and hesitant to invest in bitcoin, think again. You are missing a great opportunity here. It is still not too late to enter and invest in bitcoin.",

Those who will say that investing in gold is profitable are somewhat right, but if we take 2010 as a reference, then we can see that in that year the price of gold was on average around $1200, and today it is around $2300. If we add inflation to all that, then those who invest in \"safer\" assets don't have too many reasons to consider themselves successful. Nevertheless, even today you will hear people fiercely defending investments in gold, stocks, government bonds and similar things, especially if you mention Bitcoin to them in the context of all this.",

The growth of bitcoin over the years of its existence already giving us a hint that there would be more good growth to come with this asset in future and we already notice that demands rise up together with its global exposure so I will not be surprise if bitcoin price would reach for many digits as predicted by those self proclaim experts. Many institutions are following on what is the latest development of bitcoin so maybe in future we could see them participate and try to grab something what bitcoin could able to offer on their businesses.Although bitcoin is famous still there are people doesn't know its existence, but we should not worry about that since once bitcoin would able to reach more achievement especially with acceptance on legal side then provably the information about its existence would able to reach to those people who doesn't know about bitcoin.",

Since the approval of Bitcoin ETF, it now competes directly with Gold ETF. This is reminiscent of a time when Bitcoin was frequently compared to Gold in the mainstream media. However, now Bitcoin is getting more attention than any other asset it used to be before. There is awareness and then their is the need to secure oneself by anyone in those countries where Bitcoin has already started mass adoption.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on June 12, 2024, 06:00:30 AMHow is the 21 million bitcoin cap defined and enforced can help new Bitcoin investors to understand about Bitcoin total supply, new supply in future till 2104, and have more proper investment strategy from purchase to take profit.I agree a proper investment strategy will always help anyone interested in Bitcoin. In my country, we always had an option known as SIP (Systematic Investment plan) from 2021 that was being promoted by our local exchanges to invest in Bitcoin. It was later known as DCA in dollar terms and I am aware a lot of small investors used to invest in SIP till the government came up with a new tax regulation for investing in Bitcoin and altcoins.",

Therefore, we should focus on accumulating bitcoin for ourselves instead of expecting everyone to change their opinion about bitcoin. Those who are always skeptical and refuse to accept new things need to receive a proper lesson and they will have to buy bitcoin at a higher price when it is recognized worldwide. Those who have the courage to take risks and invest early in bitcoin deserve greater rewards. I find everything very fair, so we need to focus more on our bitcoin investment because we deserve it.",
