      "body": "This happens because the division operator gives you a float which can only have so many bits of accuracy. You circumvent it by using //.Example:Code:>>> 1966507701910865760267104647776684/29.832538509554329e+32>>> hex(int(1966507701910865760267104647776684/2))'0x307a688aba7af000000000000000'As you correctly noticed, all those trailing zeroes are wrong and due to the rounding done by Python floats.By dividing with //, you force it to stay in the integer realm and you get the correct result.Code:>>> 1966507701910865760267104647776684//2983253850955432880133552323888342>>> hex(int(1966507701910865760267104647776684//2))'0x307a688aba7aef7724cb0ecb04d6'The second division is mathematically wrong (the modmath output, that is), it seems to have overflown. I don't know how many bits a modmath number has, so I can't tell you how to replicate the result in Python. But the method from above (with double //) will give you mathematically correct results no matter what.",
