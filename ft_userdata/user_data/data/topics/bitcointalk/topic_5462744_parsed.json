  "content": "Hello Friends,Â Â I am creating this post to showcase an artist who has produced some amazing art over the last year. He was featured in Cardsmiths Currency Series 1 with cards number #12, #32, and #44. I have included a picture below. He is currently selling his Hand painted Monero/crypto bills. Each bill is legal tender from various countries. The bills are then hand painted and signed. As can be expected these are time consuming and limited in number. He also has a variety of full size paintings varying in size and price. I purchased the Monero painting in the picture below entitled Vibrant revival. I have to say it looks amazing in person. His work has been featured in some exhibits and interest in his work is growing. The Monero girl is part of a series of maybe 6 paintings featuring different girls in varying Monero poses. I also paid him a fee ($70) to sign my 3 Cardsmiths cards so if you're collecting Cardsmiths this is a great opportunity if he is still willing to do it.Â Â I am not running this sale only pointing you in the direction of a great artist and cool art. His email address will be provided at the bottom. I told him he may be getting emails. He was very professional and my artwork came packaged appropriately and fast. Best of all his prices are reasonable for 1/1 original works of art. He will provide his BTC address at time of sale. I receive nothing from these sales, just love this guys stuff, think hes going places.Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Original full size artwork is variable, He can provide pictures and pricesÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  He will also negotiate prices for multiple itemsÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â  EMAIL- Â 5idarta@proton.me Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Last of the art he still has for sale, until he paints more I guessÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â All of the Monero girls have been sold except for the one in picture belowÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Double bill XMR- $ 120 plus shippingÂ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Paintings are $300-500 except for Obeywatch which is his colaboration with CMOR",
