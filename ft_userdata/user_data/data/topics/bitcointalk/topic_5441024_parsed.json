It may just be related to the Automated market maker that adjusts prices quickly for the liquidity provider to benefit inside the platform.  The arbitrage traders are not the priority of the DEX for you to stay and keep trading, it's those who provide liquidity. How much would you earn per transaction with $100?  If it doesn't motivate arbitrage traders, you just hope they can read your post for they may just need to do something with it.",

Lack of liquidity is the reason why you can push your trade limits to higher amounts but beware while doing arbitrage trading its almost gambling and price changes too quickly since its the nature of cryptocurrencies.",

Maybe the price does reflect higher in there but when someone take out a high portion of liquidity it revert to a lower price to tie up the liquidity pool eventually going back to normal rate.",

      "body": "I think, from what you've said, it looks like the opportunity was present for investments under $100, but once you tried to invest more than that, the opportunity disappeared. It's hard to say for sure why this is happening, but it's possible that the liquidity on the platform is not high enough to support larger trades. In other words, there may not be enough sellers or buyers on the platform to handle trades of a certain size, which could cause the arbitrage opportunity to disappear when you try to invest more. Alternatively, it could be that the market conditions have changed and the opportunity is no longer available at larger investment amounts. I would recommend doing some further research and analysis to see if you can identify any other factors that might be causing this issue.",
