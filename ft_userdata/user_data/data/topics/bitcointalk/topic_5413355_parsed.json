      "body": "I believe it is truly sad what happen to the rapper PNB Rock, he was so young with a great future ahead of him. I was reading the news online, police said that the shooter demanded jewelry and other valuable items from the rapper. Witnesses inside the restaurant said that a struggle took place resulting in PNB Rock getting fatally shot multiple times. The shooter took a chain along with other things from the rapper bleeding on the floor, the shooter was able to flee from the scene. Investigators are still investigating whether the robbery was a targeted attack or a prompt attack.",
