Which means 2023 was a bull run year.

Just hold and not sell, bitcoin price did increased after halving in the past. If spot bitcoin ETF is approved by United States SEC, this can also be positive for bitcoin.",

As you can see from the chart after the bearish trend in year 2022 November it started to recover in year 2023.This month it reached $45,001 marking a new all-time high(ATH) from 2023 to 2024.This means it's already recovered from the bearing market and I believe this is not the final price point we will see a huge price surge after the upcoming event(block halving), similar to historical trends every after the block halving event.I suggest read the historical value of Bitcoin under the link below.- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin#Prices_and_value_history",

When the price drops it gives you an opportunity to buy more at a discounted price.Hownlow do you think fiat will drop in 2024?",

The bull season is when the price of Bitcoin usually spikes and Bitcoiners will begin to see profit from their Bitcoin investment, while the bear market is usually when the price of Bitcoin dips which gives investors the opportunity to buy. The year 2021 was the bull season for Bitcoin, but 2022 was a bad season. If you are wondering why the price is recovering so quickly, it's because we are in the Bitcoin halving season, which will give rise to another bull season.Just like every other person in the space, I am very optimistic about the price of Bitcoin this season. I believe we may see an all-time high in the price of Bitcoin, either this year or by next year.",

In 2024 we expect a better price increase than 2023 because of the much anticipated bitcoin halving. I definitely agree with your comment.With the BTC halving happening around April 26, 2024, expect its price to significantly increase in the market. Miners will definitely receive half of what they can currently mine which thereby increases the general price of BTC in the market. In fact, there are some threads that are speculating that the price of BTC may even reach $400,000 by the time the halving happens 1 but still, there can be no accurate forecast on this.With this information, it is now definitely recommended to HODL your coins in order to take advantage of the coming halving. For BTC's current state this 2024, I really expect its price to increase which is definitely a win-win situation for everyone.1 https://www.coinspeaker.com/countdown-bitcoin-halving-2024-106/",

As far as 2024 is concerned we have entered new year with positive notes with just one dip we have seen so far and hope this year would be better but I think this year we should accumulate Bitcoin until we finally enter the bull run. My predictions for 2024 is neither bullish nor bearish rather it would be last opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin.",

Please share your thoughts.Unless some weird things happen, everything should grow in favor of Bitcoin. The infrastructure, the user base, the number of parties watching Bitcoin closely, the number of people familiarizing themselves with Bitcoin, the number of countries legalizing it, the wallets generated and many other things that would all be supportive of the Bitcoin network. This does not mean the price can't drop, it can as we have seen several times before. Despite overall growth of many of the important metrics, the price can do its own thing, but I think only temporarily. In the long run metrics will align with each other, price included.",

Please share your thoughts.Bitcoin did not continue falling from 2022 to 2023. In the year 2023, we ended the year with a very good percentage increase in bitcoin, so bitcoin price was not even close to worse as of last year. Bitcoin is already recovering since last year, so I don’t think of any slow recovering this year but rather a more rapid growth for it that will be faster than that of last year. A lot of good happenings will occur in the market this year as many speculators have envision how the market will farewell this year.",

Yes,  in the past years, bitcoin experienced a great fall in price, but still, the price is not that low, and even when it falls, there are times or events that the price spikes sharply, giving investors or traders a good profit. It's a matter of how you manage yourself and your investment in bitcoin. It's normal that the price will drop at some point; in fact, it's a blessing because the investors will have the option to buy bitcoin and wait for the increase in price. The volatility of bitcoin is what's making us a profit, so we should take advantage of it. We can't hope and hope that the bitcoin price will always increase and increase. There will be a balance in it. It's fine that the price drops sometimes, so we investors will take advantage of it and have a good profit.",

So, there's still a need to move and recover if that's what you think to be reached and be back there. But honestly, the market is good as of this time and it will become better after halving, etf rumors, etc.",
