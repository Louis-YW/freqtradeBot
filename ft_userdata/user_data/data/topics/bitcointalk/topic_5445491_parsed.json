  "content": "Have been seeing Freebitco ad's on few reputable members signature space lately, have been wondering where I might have seen the name before now. Click on the link and I realize I have an account with them which I created since 2017. I just reset the password now and logged in the account, I realize the account was kind of active back then. Made few clicks and few SATs which I wager most of them on lottery which i can't recall ever winning. Still saw some few Satoshi in my account and about 90+ lottery ticket. It's seems my time there was just fun no good earning was achieved though. Want to ask is this site still rewarding users? Believe back then that I can raise so what could have worth something by just solving some captcha and roll free after some few minutes. .",

Freebitco further expanded their capacity and capability in running a casino or online betting/gambling platform if you may wish am it did not just end there, they have their own token as earlier was mentioned here by Maus0728 and currently trading at a good price. You can stake it on their platform to earn more, use it as well to play games on their platform. From what adbitco had said, I have not really heard any complaint onboard this platform before from any member about or against freebitco. They seems reliable and trustworthy to deal with.",

      "body": "I also recovered my Freebitcoin account two years ago, which contained a few thousand satoshi. It's one of the oldest, if not the oldest, faucets around and probably the most trusted one. I personally like its simple design and layout, which has stayed the same throughout the years. I still use the faucet and often their multiplier as well. I've never won a significant amount, though despite using the platform for years, the most I've won is 5,000 Satoshi, twice, in their daily wheel of fortune, and 820 Satoshi, twice, two days ago. It doesn't consume any time, so I occasionally roll the hourly spin.",

Unfortunately, the good ol' days of faucets have ended. I remember Freebitcoin giving as much as 1,000 Satoshi per roll. It wasn't worth much back then, but the amount of Bitcoin you could receive from just a faucet with almost zero effort and a few minutes of your time was impressive. Moreover, you're having a bonus, so you're receiving 7 satoshi per roll; the normal payout is 2 satoshi. It's certainly not worth it anymore, but it doesn't require any effort, so I may occasionally use it from my phone, hoping to get lucky sometime in the future.",

Indeed, i remember back in the days i start doing faucets first for several years as i started bitcoin in 2015 then just got introduced in this forum after few years. The price was something like $300 and the highest i can get in famous faucets that day were 0.003 it is indeed a memorable experience unlike now faucets are considered as waste of time either for newbies and OGs.",

Great, if you have found and regained access to the FreeBitco account that you have, that's a good opportunity for you to increase your winnings on the FreeBitco gambling site.Yes, FreeBitco still monitors and rewards its users, who bet and win there.You see in the quote below, to this day it is still active for awards that bet there.Quote from: wetsuit on April 01, 2017, 12:27:42 PMRecently I have started asking users who win $20 and $200 at FreeBitco.in to start posting about their wins in the forum for a small reward in addition to their prize. To keep the place clean, I'll be asking them to post it in this thread. Since FreeBitco.in has a lot more users than this forum, these posts might be from newbies but I have also asked them to post their winning seeds and a screenshot of their win to get the reward. Hopefully we get a lot more people posting about their wins now!You can review here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1850855.2580Well, if you are active again and want to use the FreeBitco site, definitely don't lose contact in their thread: FreeBitco.in-$200 FreeBTCüèéWin Lamboüî•0.2BTC DailyJackpotüèÜ$32,500 Wager Contest., whatever the problem you can discuss there, awards, bonuses, bets and so on.",

I was really not thinking straight when I started this free spinning. In the past, I had such experience too and spent a handful of time spinning on different faucet sites until I was fed up, as I didn't come up with a tangible amount. Though some faucets paid out good BTC that was in the early days of bitcoin. On the other hand, your screenshots reminds me that amongst the faucets I used then, I must have came in contact with freebitco. But, I can't recall if I still have the email attached to the account. Between it was fun to use those faucets, at least during leisure. Paying time to earn BTC.",

So even though it will spin 24 times every day it will not add to that potential luck.The amount of money it returns per roll hasn't changed throughout the years; that was generally standard. I always remember the maximum reward being $200; correct me if I'm wrong. The \"issue\" is that the value of Bitcoin has risen so much that the corresponding payment in Bitcoin has severely lowered, but the payment amount has remained the same. Faucets were never a means to generate money, or Bitcoin in this case; they were supposed to introduce you to cryptocurrencies. The increase however benefited those who had acquired Bitcoin through faucets in the earlier days.",

At least this faucet still working and evolved to full size casino.
