But however, the campaign a person joins, also dey among the reasons why some people hardly post for here, which though they may not have love to ignore here, but they are forced to do so by virtue of their campaigns. So on that note, I will also like to join you choke mouth for this matter to help encourage others not to forget our local board, because if you don't come to make here active, I don't think it's angels from heaven that will come do that for you. So thank you, as we strive to make our county proud.",
