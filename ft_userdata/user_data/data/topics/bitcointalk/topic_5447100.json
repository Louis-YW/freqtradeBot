  "content": "In a distant dystopian future, or not (maybe today), the financial institutions (banks) and culture is failing us.  The people are questioning if their hard earned wealth and worth is safe, and where to keep it.  \"Who is John Galt?\" is the rhetorical question as to why things are not working.   The banks are failing, and the government has only answers which involve sacrificing our liberties and properties in exchange for the philanthropic ideals of 'the good of the majority', which is at the cost of the wealth of those who actualy make things work.It is a long and boring read.  Ayn Rand did not boil down her ideas at all, and it is hard to grind through 1,268 pages of her great ideals, which are long winded.  The three movies on Amazon are easier to endure.  The ideals and principles are true though.  Nobody should live at the obligated expense of another, for any reason, and the ideal of individual interest trumping any and all collective interest really does produce the greater good for all.   IMHO.We are living through a time of change, by those who want a \"great reset\", and those people want to change human nature to not be oriented towards self interest but instead 'we will own nothing, and we will be happy'.   The NAZIs and the Soviets tried to change human nature, from the idea of self interest to the interest of the collective... -It didn't work, and I doubt it.\"Who is John Galt\" has similar parallels to \"who is Sotashi Nakamato\".  Both disappeared and became legends, and both changed their respective worlds.  Both will deny the robbers of their stolen wealth from us, if we just wake up;There is a way out, with gold in certain situations, or a decentralized cryptocurrency like BTC.  Like John Galt, we don't know who Sotashi Nakamato is,, he disappeared,,, or where Galt's Gulch is,,,,(perhaps El Salvador?).  And the movement is spreading world wide.  It (BTC) is, even with it's wild volatility, proving to be more of a store of wealth than our present financial institutions.Like that dystopian world of Atlas Shrugged, we have to decide if we want to continue to trust and invest into a system that will rob us of our energy, our intelligence and our wealth, in order to benefit the 'greater majority good'.  Like in the movie, when confronted with government dystopia of false philanthropic ideals, at the cost of innovation and individual liberty and freedom, at what point will we wake up to choose freedom over slavery?",
