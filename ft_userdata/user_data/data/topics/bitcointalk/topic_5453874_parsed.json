  "content": "as we know that the price of Bitcoin and market conditions are currently not good (down), but that does not apply to the price of ARPA, because the price of ARPA in these 7 days has increased very high, ARPA - $ARPA [274]Price [USD]: $0.0967H: $0.104 | L: $0.06511h: 4.23%24h: 44.85%7d: 101.36%Volume: $329,131,926MarketCap: $95,198,039so can the price of ARPA continue to increase and reach its ATH price or even create a new ATH price this year? because I see that ARPA still has a very big chance for the price to increase very high and I even believe if ARPA can become the top 100 on coinmarketcap in the near future, therefore I will still hold ARPA and wait until the next bullrun comes (I hope at the end of this year).",

      "body": "i'm neutral on it, but to be honest with the OP about my thoughts on this coin i think it's similar to some of the other cryptocurrencies that have been hyped for the past period and more realistic when looking at the market landscape Currently it is not really clear about a future that will soon push projects in the market. The mainstream still depends on bitcoin's performance, I think this year will be difficult, but in the long term we can completely be optimistic about it hitting or surpassing the old ATH, because this It is also a place to discuss speculation, if you do enough research and believe in it, then continue to put your faith because no one can judge for you.",

Is it possible that June tomorrow can still have a good impact on altcoins. maybe the ARPA coin can make ATH again in June.",

      "body": "I will choose neutral because it is really difficult to predict the exact future performance of ARPA, even if there are a few tools to support it. Recently, the market has had a significant recovery, and positive developments in ARPA's project are likely to lead to an increase in prices. Although it is not possible to confirm whether ARPA has really reached its peak, with the economy still struggling this year, thinking about a bullrun at the present time makes me think it is a bit far away.",

Am always afraid of this kind of cryptocurrencies that will be hype a d you get to discover that they are down the following day, this almost occur whenever you have invested on those kinds of currency to discover everything was only done to generate more investor on the coin if care is not taken, this period should not be the ATH of any cryptocurrency because we are already on the bear season for the crypto market, let's wait for more time to come if the coins can go more dip before the targeted investment on them over the coming bullrun.",

It's likely that if a slightly increase to come again for ARPA. Im now watching the chart on binance and everything seems quite stable at this moment for arpa. Seeing the old chart makes me believe if real correcting will come around 1 or 2 weeks later from now. ATH is still possible to be achieve by ARPA caused by it breaks 10 cents. I remember when there has been a lot of people said in the comment section about this shitty coin would not even surpass 10 cents but ARPA did it. ATH quite easy to be achieved as long as the hype will be staying in ARPA even longer. The whales have not yet sold their stack to the market.",

But remember, cool heads will always prevail.Sure, ARPA's been soaring like a rocket recently, but there could be a whole bunch of reasons for this. They might've struck gold with new partnerships, unveiled some shiny project updates, or perhaps the market's just playing a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Crypto'.

But let's remember, folks, market spots are decided by market cap, and that's a dance between the token price and the circulating supply. It's not a total long shot, but it'll need to be full of sustained, high-octane growth.",

I just noticed this year that there have been coins who are performing well despite of the situation of the market. 2023 is surely a unique year.I wonder how the investors of these coins find it? But they are lucky that their coins are now pumping heavily. They should only control their temper and not too hold on for too long because we still don't know what the future of these coins awaits. For those who are late too enter, they need to be cautious as they can fall on the trap prepared by a greedy developer if the aim of the project is only to grab money.",

I see there has been a surge in price recently but this seems to like a whale action than a strong fundamental backing for the project. For every action, there must be a reaction. Please who can tell me why the price has pumped recently? I can't find any news on this. I have seen many times where whales will accumulate tokens and pump then dump on retails when they think it is going to the moon",
