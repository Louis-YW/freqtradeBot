  "content": "I've been a member of this forum for a while, but I spend the majority of my time in the bounty section because I was introduced to the forum to take part in bounty campaigns, which I won't say have been very profitable so far. When I informed this person that I wanted to learn about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies so that I could someday earn money for myself, he misinterpreted me, therefore he continued to educate me about bounties so that I could earn some free token. I am aware that some people make significant profits through bounties, but from the start, I was aware that I wanted more than merely taking part in bounties. I was interested in learning everything there was to know about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, but I had no one to teach me. I tried searching online, but some of the concepts were too complex for me to understand, so I needed some guidance.Without anyone's help, I began studying the forum and gradually, I began understanding some things, and I learned that bounties are no longer as profitable as they once were and that they are simply a waste of time and also I figured that I can learn more about bitcoin here. I've been a little busy lately, which has reduced the amount of time I spend here, but I believe I'm finally prepared to embark on the path to becoming a bitcoin expert. I desire a new beginning and am hoping that my prior participation in bounties was not improper. In order to accomplish this aim of mine, I will need all of your help and guidance. Please From where do I begin?",

Since you are looking for another way to earn money in the future then have you considered buying Bitcoin and hold it for as long as you want until it js sure to sell for profit. The one who introduced you to this forum is surely a bounty hunter where you ask that person another way to earn but still that person taught you about bounties when you already know that it's not fruitful for you.",

Well, good luck with your journey, just always follow the rules and guidelines in the forum and you'll be alright.",

It all requires frequent research and reading of the bitcoin technology. How to do it? try to adjust some moments to read few stuffs about bitcoin. Take those terms you can understand, and practicalize your learning progress by opening threads on unique topics you feel or wish to be discussed here. The discussion aspect of the forum is what breaks down the learning process for everyone to understand. Because of diverse circulation of correct information, and the termination of wrong ones. Such that nobody gets misled.  Try to join discussions, and further read to understand an interesting discussion. It'll help you understand the way bitcoin works and how the forum does work, indeed. The bounty lane which you left, as you said, may have delayed you from learning, but the process never ends. Start now and make decisions on what you feel should be done in the bitcoin ecosystem and check if someone is already thinking about it too. This will help you stay on the edge of the discussion as it'll be an important role to share new ideas on the thread.",

I suggest you change such a mentality because you might not be able to earn anything for a long time. Your main focus now should be how to learn and contribute to the forum. Invest time to go through different sections of boards in the forum and read the contents that interest you. If there are areas you don't understand you can do research on them and learn about them. The forum also has a search option that can assist you in seeking for information you desire. You can also use other search engines to seek vital information. You also need to read the rules of the forum to avoid violating any of them. I am sure you have heard that plagiarism is a capital offense that leads to a ban. And if you get banned you cannot come back to the forum with another account until you are unbanned. To avoid plagiarism always reference the source of your information if you copied or from somewhere. The use of chatbots to make posts is closely related to plagiarism so it could also lead to a ban. Ensure you also check the rules of each board before posting in the section Although you spent so much time chasing shadows in the bounty section it is never too late to be right. Bitcoin is still at its early stage which mean that you are early. There are still many people that are still blinded by the peanuts they get from the bounty section. Just be focused and you will be happy you took this decision.",

I initially thought it was all about Bitcoin until I understood and learned that there is so much more to crypto as a whole. At first, all I knew was how to earn, especially through signature campaigns and other free opportunities, as well as completing tasks for pay. Like you, there have been many times when I've taken breaks from my Bitcoin and crypto journey for various reasons, but I'm still here, continuously educating myself with the help of our fellow members and staying updated with the evolving crypto universe and its underlying technology. We all need guidance, especially when seeking help. For me, this forum is the primary and major Bitcoin community for learning about cryptocurrency. You can join the discussion and ask questions. There are also free learning materials available on the internet, such as videos, online courses, tutorials, books, and more. Good luck with your new beginning and your journey to becoming a Bitcoin expert.",

Because after I saw your posting history, and when you were registered on this forum, it seems like you already have a good basis to start studying Bitcoin and investing in it. The date you registered on this forum is more than a year old, so I'm sure you basically understand a little about Bitcoin. Because even if you enter this forum, you only struggle with bounties. But usually, people like you, to some extent, already understand Bitcoin. So I think, to learn about bitcoin, you really just have to keep doing it. No need to repeat and start all over again. Because basically the crypto world doesn't have many or striking differences. Maybe the difference lies only in the cryptocurrency itself.As is the case with wallets, chances are you already understand a little about this, because even if you take part in the bounty, you definitely need something called a wallet. So therefore, your path to learning Bitcoin, I don't think will be too difficult.But if you want to learn about Bitcoin from the very basics, and also about its history, you can read about it on this sitehttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp#:~:text=Bitcoin%20(BTC)%20is%20a%20cryptocurrency,party%20involvement%20in%20financial%20transactions.",
