I tried electrum, and exodus and both wallets failed to read the private key. Private key is presented with a QR code as well as a hash that begins with an \"S\". Please provide any educational resources or help. Thankyou. Sounds similar to a Casascius key, which is considered a \"mini-key\" https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mini_private_key_formatI would recommend using Ballet app... will also grab any forks automatically for you",

It won't keep track of it or nothing. But for simply checking the funding or importing it's great. Ballet has thought of almost everything. Almost.",
