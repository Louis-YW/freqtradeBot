Personally I don't advise multiple trade especially when you're not familiar with tradeNope, I don't think multiple trades reduce the trading risk, Bitcoin price drop is another thing to discuss because crypto market capital is always dominated by Bitcoin with almost half of it if Bitcoin feels any type of sudden changes the whole market faces the consequences but in the natural trading days single Trade in one asset can be dangerous I would say take multiple trades in a single asset or multiple assets it will diversify your profit and market risk. I am going totally against OP's recommendation because I can't feel anything worthy in OP's opinion, he is recommending single trade whether its newbie or an experienced market player, on the other half I always recommend diversifying risk management is more important and this is how you learn and gain better experience in the market.For your friend, I would recommend that he should learn management skills If he really wants to be a successful trader.",

Trading multiple coins is not the problem, the problem is to know the direction the coins are going because if one coin is falling, other coins are most likely falling too. I also thought trading just a single currency is the best before, until I traded multiple coins that go towards my direction.Tell your friend to learn risk management and also use a better strategy to minimize losses.

Because he wouldn't lose that immediately if he's on the spot but as you've said that when the price dropped again, he's at total loss. Well, if your friend is a long time trader, he probably know what he's doing.That's why for him it should be enough to understand that the risk he's taking shouldn't be ignored. Otherwise, he should quit futures and stay on the spot trading.",

Personally I don't advise multiple trade especially when you're not familiar with tradeIf he's into futures trading, then I guess that's okay. As a long-term trader, people experience losses, but they should keep holding until the green days come. These days are sure to come when the price of Bitcoin increases, and of course, the market will follow Bitcoin and turn green. Most crypto follow Bitcoin's price pump. So, in my opinion, it's normal to experience losses, as this can be a valuable learning experience and an opportunity to manage one's assets effectively.",

You buy ETH and BTC against USD and there is a chance that both will go up or down by a similar percentage.Same with buying alt coins. Very rarely do some go up while some go down. Most go the same way. Especially if it’s against a stablecoin. Hence why the OP is right, you shouldn’t enter a whole bump of one direction trades like that because they will either all work or won’t.",

If they were just beginners and started by trading a lot then it would be disastrous. Your friend may open a lot of trades without knowing what the risks will be. There should be backups to do when prices start to crash. If you split all the funds with many trades and have no reserves, it's stupid. However reserves are very important when the market crashes unexpectedly. If your friend trades futures, it will be an even bigger disaster, everything will be liquidated and of course you won't be able to return, it's different if your friend only opens a lot of trades in Spot trading, it's still safe enough to hold him.",

Trading on the same pair won't be a wise decision since if the prediction were to be wrong you lose all trades but when you're trading in multiple pairs you could be at an advantage because you'll be getting profits from one of those trades.",

Personally I don't advise multiple trade especially when you're not familiar with tradeTraders need to be incredibly careful when they open several positions on the same market roughly at the same time, and this is because with each trade they open not only they increase the chances to obtain profits, but they also increase the risk they are facing and the potential losses as well.So what to do? From the books I have read opening multiple trades in a row is not recommended and it is only allowed when you are opening positions at different markets, but be careful I said different markets not different assets, so opening several positions on bitcoin and ethereum will be forbidden, but opening a position on the market of cryptocurrencies and the stock market will be allowed.",

It's hard to do multiple trades actually using a single monitor, in my opinion, or if you're not that experienced when it comes to futures trading, it could really increase the risk of losing your trades. My only suggestion is to never enter a big trade with multiple entries per coin if it is your first time since you're only after for experience, don't risk it too far.",

Personally I don't advise multiple trade especially when you're not familiar with tradeLosses is inevitable in the market but we need to do proper risks management inother not to estimate our losses to our gains. Even pro traders record losses in trades, but they always make sure that they bounced back to the market with enormous profits. Triggering multiple trading positions is very risky because one doesn't know the next move of candlesticks in charts. I only recommend trading with pairs that one is already used and examine the criteria before trading. Different trades will only bring confusion and emotion instability because s trader will panick when the trade is going against the setup plans and would want to hurry to close the trade, therefore resulting in loss.",
