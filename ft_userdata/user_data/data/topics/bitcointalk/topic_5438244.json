While they did sponsor the 2022/23 UCL pool and paid up in full, I feel this warning is appropriate to prevent further potential for victims.Betnomi.com Champions League PoolLedger Nano X Giveaway***Open only to paying participants of the Betnomi UCL PoolParticipants of the Betnomi UEFA Champions League Pool 2022/23 are now invited for a chance to win custom-made Betnomi-branded Ledger Nano X!Bitcoin block #777,777 -- estimated to happen in ~20 days from now -- will be used to determine the raffle winner. This coincides with the Last 16 round of games.Rules1. The last 2 digits of the total fee in Bitcoin block #777,777 will be used to determine the raffle result. This means the two digits in the 7th and 8th decimal places. e.g. a fee of BT 0.12345600 means the winning number is \"00\". A fee of BTC 0.12345678 means the winning number is \"78\".2.
