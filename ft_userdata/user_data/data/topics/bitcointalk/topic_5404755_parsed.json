You do not have to login before you make use of bitcoin ATM, but you want to make a high amount of bitcoin transaction, some ATMs will request for KYC, but if low amount, your phone number would be requested for, for verification message.",

Like the ATM that is mainly used to dispense fiat currency in my country, the charges per transaction is the same but your charges are increased when you have done more than three transactions in a day. I was thinking the BItcoin ATM will be the same in terms of the charges.",

Buyers will typically scan a quick response (QR) code corresponding to their own bitcoin wallet address, to which purchased coins are transferred. My discomfort with this machines is how fat their percentage are. It only require customers with reasonable amount of Cash to pay for this high percentages.

Do you have to login on the atm before doing any transactions on it just like logging in on blockchain or coin base app to make  transactions ? Actually, coinatmradar.com is the best site to give you more detail information about Bitcoin ATM's, because with this site you can locate nearby ATM machine, the name of operator, fees and e.t.c so how a Bitcoin ATM works is that it enable you to buy your BTC using Fiat or withdraw your BTC into Fiat, which you will have to pay some fees which varies from one country to another and one operator to another. But YouTube is a nice place to watch some video clips to know how this actually works because it always varies from one company that produces it to another",
