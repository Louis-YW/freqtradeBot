Thank You1. Lots of ways and methods basing up on the market condition.There's no specific strategy does work out all the time.2. Always manage your finances well and be mindful about risks management and of course with your emotions3. EMA,MACD,FIB,BB4. Move on, market prices is always been volatile.It could fucked up your TA so easily5. When my TA's does have that confirmation and does give out that point its a good entry then im doing it6. Take it slow, dont make things in a hurry.Try to familiarize everything from those trading methods until on observing on how this market behaves.Rest of learning would really come through real experience.",

      "body": "speaking from my experience, trading in short term basis incur losses more often, since the movement of the markets usually out of the prediction, heck even there was saying that the general trading analysis strategy exists just for the whales to determine how the individuals traders are gonna be making their move which does make sense if you think about it further. I'd say i agree with those that saying holding or investing in general would be a lot more profitable and easier too, usually it can't be denied that sometimes opportunity arises if we're patient enough in waiting until the next cycle of bullrun after accumulating hugely around bearish. but one could always say that holding in general require too much time that sometime for some people it just doesn't cut it. but if i were to be trading around short term and limited amount of time frame, i'd say try to find some coin that has lost its valuation hugely due to some silly events like airdrops and then accumulate around bottom, you could figure out the bottom relatively easily with these coins and there's bigger chance that it will recover within days.",

As for my niche it is swing trading so it is the most effectively for me I buy at support levels and sell it in resistance or whenever there is a selling signals 2. I only have a maximum of 30% of my overall capital in a specific assets, in that way I can manage my risk and I usually allocating only 1% - 2% for my Value at risk, meaning it is the maximum percentage of I will lose if my bias did not work.3. I only use volume and I purely rely on charts4. By sticking to my plans5. Whenever I already created the plan, I stick with it and.order with no hesitation and have supreme confidence6. Allocate 1 hour daily to improve your trading skills if you want to achieve new heights and improve your overall performance. Remember that your success depends on how you work hard in trading.",

It's a type of trader and these are scalping, swing trading, day trading and more. Swing trading is when you leave your trades open for several days. If you are a swing trader, you can employ a variety of strategy. By the way, the major strategy I employ is SMC, which some call it as a concept. I also know candlesticks, EMAs, Fibs, and many other strategies, but SMC is my main one. They're just use for additional confluence to increase the probability of the trade.",

Basically the common one only. Its just a guide anyway.4. Avoid market trading or swing trade. If the token is highly volatile then set up a stop loss.5. How to set orders? Using cex like Binance. But if you are using dex, its automatically swapped. But some dapps have this kind of cex feature.6. Learn everything first from terms, concept, and do simulations and not just go for live trading. Practice first before going hard on betting your money.",

They should not be an hurry to sell their coins without verify if the market price is good at the moment or not before supply to the market, because many traders has lost huge amount of money in the market because they sold when the price of coins are low in the market. Now that the price of Bitcoin is still low in the market, I think it will be effective if all those new traders can buy and hold for the price to increase higher to their satisfaction before they can sell to make profits.",

Based on market condition, it changes. You need to have multiple strategies ready for that kind of changes. Buying low and selling high. You can set multiple order at different price point. It will be filled automatically if the price limit is met. This is a good strategy in spot trading if you are good at market analysis. Still works for me.
