Feel free to share as he has been a huge road block to good regulation.This post is stupid:You can’t even spell Gensler’s name.Online petitions on Change-dot-org are meaningless noisemakers.  A “real petition”?  Is that like “a real blog post” or “a real tweet”?  Are you so dumb that you actually think a change-dot-org petition does something other than assist surveillance of people’s opinions? Change-dot-org is using Cloudflare to block no-Javsacript Tor users.  Archival link and quote are below, for reference.The petition itself cites no sources of information about its allegations.  It simply makes bare assertions.  A brief search of the Web finds “news” articles on ridiculously corrupt and unprofessional “crypto” sites (really altcoin shill sites), riddled with obvious inaccuracies (e.g., referring to Gamestop as a “crypto stock” (!)), and referring to the petition as a source of information (for example).  It also reveals that Gensler has been taking aim at at Citadel, at dark pools, and at pretty much everything else the petition accuses him of.Quote from: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/secs-gensler-speaks-wednesday-market-pros-will-listen-for-clues-on-these-rule-proposals.html#headline2[2022-06-07]More trading on traditional 'lit' exchangesGensler has also been a critic of the growth of dark pools and other off-exchange trading, which now constitutes about 40% of all trading volume.Quote from: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gensler-zeroes-in-on-citadel-securities-as-sec-considers-payment-for-order-flow-ban-191715790.html[2021-09-14]Gensler zeroes in on Citadel Securities as SEC considers payment for order flow ban...etc...Insofar as I am aware, Gensler has not been anti-Bitcoin—well, “not anti-Bitcoin” for an SEC regulator.  He has said some things very worrisome to shitcoins.  In general, I do believe that Ethereum and other altcoins are in for a world of hurt:  POS is an illegal unregistered securities scheme, and I predict that it is probably just the type of scam that Gensler will want to bite into.XRP holders seem to hate him.  ETH holders should probably fear him.  LOL.  Is there any bad news here?I am not generally a fan of the American SEC.  To the contrary!  But some of the things that Gensler has recently said actually seem sane; and I do not appreciate bunch of emotionalist accusations presented without facts:Quote from: https://web.archive.org/web/20220802140109/https://www.change.org/p/retail-investors-fire-gary-gensler-as-sec-chairman-for-obstruction-of-justiceSEC Chairman Gary Gensler is complicit in criminal activities perpetrated by Citadel Securities, Citadel the Market Maker in naked short selling and dark pool abuse. Mr. Gensler is guilty of obstruction of justice due to his lack of enforcement of the laws pertaining to naked short selling and lack of competent oversight of market maker activities. Due to Mr. Gensler's crimes, millions of retail investors were defrauded of countless MILLIONS of dollars. I'm referring to working class, middle class and poor folks as well as institutional investors. Mr. Gensler needs to step down as the chairman, and a thorough, detailed , forensic analysis and investigation into Citadel Securities and Citadel Market Maker. This cannot go unpunished. Rise up and sign![citation needed]If you can substantiate those very serious allegations, then please go right ahead.",

In our country, accusations like this can be directly reported to the authorities, because making accusations without evidence will be charged with the libel law.",

Ignoring the fact that a petition which was probably written by some illiterate money on a website will not do shit, it took it 8 months at least to get 25 000 votes, 1/4 of the votes for saving the turtles in Haliburton you can get yourself a pretty image on how much this means.Quote from: mk4 on August 03, 2022, 03:55:11 AMWhen did a change.org petition actually achieve anything?

First thing, when two people in the topic point out that the OP hasn't been able to even write the guy's name right and you come here and baptize him \"Gentsler\", you're definitely starting with the wrong foot here.Second, what did Gary Gensler  do to put as you claim discomfort on the crypto space in the first place? So, can someone present (and with proof of it actually happening)  a thing that Gensler did and it was anti bitcoin? He is anti shitcoins for sure but I don't see him anywhere near as critical of bitcoin!",

He is anti shitcoins for sure but I don't see him anywhere near as critical of bitcoin!Poor Mr. Gantslir.  He shall suffer the slings and arrows of “crypto Twitter” tweeting furiously at him, when the SEC runs through shitcoinland like a bull in a china shop.  It shall hurt Mr. Gonslear terribly, because... um... I dunno.The funny thing is that decentralization matters.  And one of the only coins (arguably, the only coin) that is sufficiently decentralized to have some chance of resisting regulatory interference is—Bitcoin, the one coin that Mr. Ginslar affirmatively said is not within his agency’s jurisdiction.  Amazing how that works.I will illustrate with only one example of what I mean.  Beneath is marketing veneer of fake “decentralization”, the whole Ethereum ecosystem has a practical dependency on a single U.S.-based company:  ConsenSys, the owners of Infura and of the vertically integrated Metamask wallet.  If Infura were to go down, it would cause ecosystem-wide disruption in Ethereum that could not be caused in Bitcoin by eliminating any single party, or even any small group of parties.Another funny thing:  After my prior post here, I posted in an Ethereum thread a substantive argument that POS ETH will be deemed an illegal unregistered security.  I quoted from a law professor, who reached the same conclusion that I have been saying about that for awhile.  The topic starter, who has an admitted history of having “disliked” Bitcoin, insulted me while dodging the substance of I said about the issue of POS tokens being illegal securities offerings. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Poor Mr. Genßler, needing to deal with that.

But it's good addition when it's used properly (only mention facts with source/proof, regular update, started by reputable group/organization, etc.) and someone actually do impactful action.I think that the essential nature of democracy is to fool people into believing that they do something useful, while they uselessly dissipate their energies.  It is probably the most effective strategy that has ever been invented for a régime to prevent a revolution.An online petition is only an extreme version of that; for unlike participation in the official democratic process, it does not even theoretically have any authority.  For organizing impactful action, I think that blogging and tweeting should have more practical effect—i.e., usually-negligible (rarely-high) instead of always-none; and that does not pacify people by fooling them with a mirage that they are directly making some sort of an actual change.",
