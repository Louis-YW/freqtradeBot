Another lesson for those who think exchanges are the best option to secure their funds. Not Your Keys, Not Your Money. Do Not Forget. As I already said in my previous post on this subject, the role that exchanges play has been vastly overstated by the media and the business community, who would have you believe that a companies like Binance, Coinbase or FTX \"holds\" all our bitcoins. That is simply not true if you own your private keys (which is what true ownership entails). The vast majority of users had never heard of Alameda Research or FTX Ventures before they started hearing news of the latter's insolvency. This is why I keep repeating this mantra: do not use an exchange if you want to truly control your BTC! And, as we have seen in this example, local wallets are indeed the safest option.",

For example, banks. I hope we have not forgotten the Russian incidence were cash were so short that they halted the ATM and also restricted cash withdrawals. Then in crypto XRP, LUNA, then binance hack, KuKoin hack and now FTX falling, but all you need is BTC to stay in your own control.

Probably another good self custody/cold wallets out there, but once someone recommended me this one and I am enjoying to use it. I am also using Electrum.Since I store my sats and I started my self custody journey, I am a lot more motivated to learn about the bitcoin network, and to buy and store my sats properly. Bitcoin really empowers people.Of course, devices like the cold card have a learning curve, at the beginning, it will seem difficult, but after you learn about it, you will realize that is simple. What I did it was make very small transactions, withdraw very small amounts from exchange until I felt comfortable to withdraw all my sats from the exchange.Not your keys, not your coins.",

When advices like this come up, there is a silent 'centralized' before the term exchanges, so it becomes, do not keep your bitcoins in a centralized exchange, cause with them, you do not own the private keys and give up custody to the exchange platform and are subject to their terms and conditions.P2P platforms on the other hand, have an open and decentralized model to mediate between transactions, without the user needing to give up custody.",

DEXs aside, it is impossible to get in or out of crypto without using an exchange. But, you know that some people leave their cryptocurrency in exchanges? They probably do so because they want to save on some transaction fees or they are too lazy to go through the process of withdrawing their funds. It's like going to the store to get groceries, but instead of taking them home you leave your bags at the cash register. It's a big risk. Exchanges could be hacked or they could go bankrupt, and you are exposing yourself to a lot of risks that could result in loss of funds. If you want to hold your Bitcoins and use it as a store of value, then the best advice is to avoid using exchanges as much as possible.",

These theories had always be there, a few occurances as to what could be when things go wrong but, it was mainly due to hacks but in the FTX exchange situation, it was just an ambitious CEO, trying to take so much advantage of centralisation to benefit himself and crew but, it back fired. Destroyed his exchange, reputation and is deep in debt.Centralization has not been the idea of bitcoin. That's so fiat and having it otherwise sort of removes what we might treasure about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. A lot of lessons is sure to have been learned from this but still, I don't expect everyone to play it safe.",

Another one is if you are trading without stop loss (perhaps you forgot to do so) wherein other money in the bag could be lost with it once liquiation has been reached (I've experienced such thing in Binance Futures, but that's my fault).
