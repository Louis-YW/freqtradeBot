Can anyone tell me the name of some best sites from where I can earn.Based on your post I can only provide you with faucets and PTC you can check the Micro Earnings.But if you add in your post that you are good at writing or had good communication skills, or had a lot of social media followers then I can recommend bounty projects, you have to provide what you are good at like if you have a coding skill you are a designer then Fiverr and the service section is best suited to you.",

Do you know how you can earn cryptocurrencies from this forum or outside it ? There are many ways to try for a passive earning but all aren't much worthy. I can advise you to join Bounty Campaigns in this forum which is a very popular way to make passive income. You just go to this Bounties (Altcoins) board and you will get the list of every running campaigns. Just follow the rules and instructions for every bounty. Just remember that every project will not pay you so you have to find out potential projects or you can join escrowed projects. There is a another popular way to make passive income is to join Airdrops. It's very hard to find out legit airdrops because most of them are scam and not worthy. If you follow some reputated YouTubers then you may grab a good amount of passive earning by completing airdrop tasks. There are many ways but I think you should start with them and be experienced. Later you will have knowledge about others worthy opportunities of earning.",
