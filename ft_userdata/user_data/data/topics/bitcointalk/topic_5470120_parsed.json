  "content": "I believe the [banned mixer] mixer is either a fake mixer or potentially even a scam. From examining transactions from their service it's easy to spot that their bitcoin configuration always sets bitcoin transaction fees below the network minimum. This is a very serious problem for a bitcoin mixer service as it creates two very serious issues:A. Drastically reduced anonimity. With a simple filter of transactions anyone with half a brain could identify transactions coming from YoMix. While their mixer is new, bitcoin transactions are forever. In short notice, mainstream services will see all their transactions and potentially even block you retroactively if you had ever touched coins related to YoMix. B. Reduced functionality. Setting fees wrong can result to your transaction getting stock for an indefinite amount of time. This uncertainty of course makes any transaction passing through YoMix pointless as it's uncertain if it will ever arrive to its intended final destination. This should have been the most basic functionality to program when creating a bitcoin mixer, but it just shows that yomix developers were really inexperienced in programming bitcoin. Moreover, YoMix is a bad mixer overall. Out of respect for what migh have been victims, I'll be deribelately vague with this just so whoever had sensitive transactions \"mixed\" by YoMix can have time to re-organize and disengage his finances from this ordeal (I'd personally recomend using just monero this time). But it all boils down to YoMix basically reuisng the same addresses over and over. This is a very bad practice for a mixer. This leads to situations where it's very easy for even a basic block explorer to group their addresses. For instance, here's a main family of addresses YoMix uses on walletexplorer:https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/2584d8142e542ff5Another thing that's very suspicious about YoMix's funding is the high proximity it has with Kraken.com. It's obvious that from every \"mixing\" transactions many of the feeding addresses are directly funded from Kraken. This normally would be a very bad practice and is something no real mixer does. This is actually evidence that YoMix might actually be a FED honey pot. Because of course a honeypot mixer would only have the purpose of de-anonymizing users instead of providing actual mixing services. Therefore the ones running it would look to get coins as fast and easy as possible and wouldn't mind withdrawing from an exchange account with full KYC. Anyway, I'd just recommend stepping away from YoMix and trying another way to hide your funds before it's too late. If you find that it's a honeypot via twitter or better yet through a sealed indictment it's already too late.",

I hope the yomix you are talking about is something else. For your convenience, Yomix is a BTC mixer, you can visit it, either by clicking the Sig below this post I am wearing or by visiting there ANN https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432724.0I am just trying to clear this confusion of exchange, shitcoin, profit, loss, mining, ASIC idk (I don't know) what else you have just shed light on.

By checking them on Arkham Explorer, for example, or any other AML/Chain intelligence provider as there are plenty.A stunning clarification, but we perfectly see the difference in nicknames, and we were not mistaken when we addressed this problem to the OP.This is the same person, or a person’s friend with the wrong destination address problem.Firstly, they flooded our ticket system with RBF question (they asked to RBF low-fee transaction with different address), then, in the same hour, after got rejected, they began to write on the forum. But in general it even doesn't matter.Specifically in this topic, we see nothing but baseless accusations. The whole text is from the category: “There is nothing complicated to hack google, even the child knows this,” but of course this is complete nonsense. So much words like scam/honeypot/fake/etc (even in thread title) makes us think this topic especially created for search engines, it's obvious .As for low mining fees we've answered in service announcement thread. In short: we're ready to help and accelerate transaction with partners mining pool, but not RBF it. OP asked to RBF with changed destination address.We remind that we're traditional mixer, and, if you're tracking your input address and see money gone to exchange it means other client wanted them to be there (same for receiving coins, if client sent them from kyc exchange to us), it doesn't mean we use exchange addresses  . And we don't reuse addresses as we said above, it's insecure and we never did it.When OP provides more information (if ever) we'll return back with answer personally to him, but for now good luck everyone and stay safe .",
