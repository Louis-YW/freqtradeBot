What's the point of accepting the other cryptos if we can choose Bitcoin?Anyway move this thread to altcoins discussion section.",

      "body": "It depends.If you have customers and they are asking you if you are accepting crypto payment, there would be a particular coin most of them will be asking for, that is the coins you should go for. Likely most of them will ask if you accept bitcoin. If you are a leader in a country that wants to make crypto a legal means of payment, the coin that you should consider is bitcoin, because it is the most decentralized, altcoins are centralized and most of them have just very little or no utility.Quote from: Apocollapse on March 07, 2023, 09:19:26 AMIt's not 12,000 anymore but 20,000+ and still counting.I still remember when Binance has not bought Coinmarketcap, coins listed there were less than the ones listed on Coingecko, but only 12309 coins listed on Coingecko now as of today while over 22780 coins are listed on Coinmarketcap, which means there are many shit coins listed on Coinmarketcap. Did you still know there are over 22000 coins? Just that they are not listed. The more the coins listed, the more the shit coins.",

If I own a business that requires me to buy and sell every single day, I will prefer to be paid in USDT so that it can be converted immediately to my local currency. But if I am running a business where my earnings can be held for a long time, I can also accept other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin; it all depends on which of those has a free network at the moment. Sometimes we encounter network confirmation delays, and I wouldn't want that to slow down my transaction with my customer.",

Share your thoughts about it.Honestly I would be fine to accept payment in all the major crypto currencies, as long as there is an active market we can always convert the coins to our favourite coin. For simplicity I would probably choose bitcoin as its also the coin I want to hold long term. Assuming that I don't need the money any time soon I would put it in my hodl wallet and just forget about. The thing about accepting payments online is that you want to reach the largest number of consumers, that why I would try to accept as many different coins as possible. And if you don't want to hold a particular coin just make sure to convert it immediately.",

A small observation that I see most people accept crypto in this forum is, of course, bitcoin. Another option is they use Binance Pay. Ease of use and transaction fee rates become a concern for some merchants or services as far as I can see right here. Though, don't generalize it, because I only saw the one who tells or make a post about it here.Although a centralized payment gateway is not ideally recommended, it seems that they are truly helping those who want to accept cryptocurrencies, the varieties of crypto that are accepted and easiness of payment make them became the choice for some people.",

Share your thoughts about it.When it comes to accepting payment, I would not have a specific choice of cryptos. I would rather choose a payment gateway which will settle the payment in fiat on a real time basis. Business is no joke and majority of the businesses need working capital which is usually taken out from the revenue.So as a business owner I won't really take the risk of volatility as it may affect my profitability. So coin can be anything, but the payment gateway should be the most important factor for me.",

Share your thoughts about it.When it comes to the question of which is the most reliable crypto for payments, only one answer will come up and that is Bitcoin. It is true that many are now choosing stablecoins due to volatilities. But Bitcoin will always be the best in terms of security. Moreover, many people are now running towards some alt-coins like: litecoin, Polygon (matic) etc. for low gas fees. And in my case I always prefer bitcoin as payment But if volatilities are too much for you then sometimes using stable coin is not bad.",
