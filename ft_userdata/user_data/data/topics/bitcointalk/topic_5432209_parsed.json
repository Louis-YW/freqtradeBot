The prices seems a bit high. whentomine.ioLooks like this is just a site that tells you when to mine and specifically at only the time when mining is profitable.I don't think miners need such a service as anyone from us can check for themselves when is a good time,I don't think that is a relevant website even for newbies,most of us have already bookmarked whattomine.com and check there all the calculating that needs to be done and choose which coin to mine.It just shows that,how profitable a coin is and from the domain this website looks like is trying to replicate the whattomine website.",

      "body": "What is required to use WhenToMine?You need a supported smart plug. And a IFTTT account (free for 2 rigs) and 2,5â‚¬ per month for more than that. And that's it! https://www.whentomine.io/On the one hand, an interesting service that includes your mining farm at night, when the electricity discount reaches 50%, but I can do it without this service very easily. In my country, if I transmit monthly readings of 100 kilowatts a day rate and 3,000 kilowatts a night rate, this will cause unnecessary suspicion in the electricity company.There are 24 hours in a day, and my night rate is 8 hours. If mining is not profitable at the daily rate, then I will not mine at night either.",
