Please if you get my point answer, Â thanks. You can just quote the exact statement from the OP to comment it if your main purpose is to emphasize it to the post that you are replying. This way you will avoid spamming your own thread through repetitive statements that is already written on your thread.",

      "body": "As Beparanf says, the best choice is to quote the part you want to emphasize. you will certainly not have a problem with plagiarism there. I remember that there were a couple of similar cases where a member (reputed at the time) was banned, in the end, the ban was removed after an appeal, but it is a complicated and unnecessary process.if you ignore the forum rules for a moment (which are like that for a reason), think about how other users will see your thread where something is often repeated. It becomes boring and uninteresting, certainly not constructive. I know that such threads easily end up being ignored by many users.I hope this helped you.",

As easy as that. Posting and reposting what you have posted before on this forum word for word is not making any sense in my opinion. Just quote yourself just as Beparanf commented already about it.",

I it can be possible provided it is in that same thread, but why can't you just quote the main write up instead of we writing it as a comments?, I think it will be more easier and easier and understable.",

I have seen people get into troubles in this forum by plagiarising themselves. So, it is not worthy to be given as an advice to a newbie. What I really understand in this forum is that, the punishment for plagiarism is not to reserve or preserve the idea of the original owner, rather it is to avoid cheating (presenting yourself to be more intelligent than you are, maybe in order to earn merits.) In same vein, copying yourself verbatim will make you have duplicate post either in same thread or different threads, which could also be regarded as cheating, especially if you are wearing a signature.",

Please if you get my point answer, Â thanks. Simply quote that particular sentence you which to make clearer and lay your emphasis about it , in that way every member would have an understanding about it and may likely draw more points from it. Unnecessary editing may give a wrong signal of spamming despite it's your own thread as OP.",
