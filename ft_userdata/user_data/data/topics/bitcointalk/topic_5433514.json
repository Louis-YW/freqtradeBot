You will need two different data with time frames including block counts and Bitcoin price history and put it into the sheet to sort them.I suggest maybe you can find some useful tools under this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5287823 about what you need.",

It's probably easiest to use generation_usd, and divide it by the block reward.So import those 2 files into a spreadsheet:https://loyce.club/blockdata/generation.txthttps://loyce.club/blockdata/reward_usd.txtQuote from: davidkierz on January 08, 2023, 06:38:20 PMthat matches up at the exact block time.. This is for taxes..Note that there is no \"one Bitcoin price\". It's probably a good estimate, but different sources can have slightly different values. My data comes from Blockchair.com, which didn't exist in the first years of Bitcoin and I have no idea where they got the data from.",
