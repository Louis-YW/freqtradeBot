      "body": "I won't say that the early initiatives of El Salvador was a total failed experiment. Do remember, when they first announced about btc being their legal tender, crypto people were being optimistic and enthusiastic about such move. I believe a lot of people also got curious with btc, and in the process, they became crypto users as well. So in my opinion, there were some positive things that have had happened owed to their early initiatives towards bitcoin market.With El Salvador's initiatives, some countries followed thru like Central African Republic. And for sure, there are some positive developments that have happened owed to their move. If not, they can easily go back to their traditional financial system. So for me, there's nothing to worry about El Salvador's change over btc, because they need it to get their loan and that's for their economic survival. After all, the use of btc in this country is not banned but they can continue to use it.",

The lesson is; bitcoin is simply money that has more value than every other money. Bitcoin is simply a currency that is better than every other currency. I understand it's more technical than this, but in this context, that is what it is. Adopting a new currency doesn't fix every single wrong that's going on in that country. Adopting bitcoin doesn't mean there will be no security issues, inflation, unemployment, etc. Bitcoin is simply money and if you don't work for money you won't get it. Let's say the government has a bitcoin reserve and they make a profit after 10 years, there's no amount of profit bitcoin will give them that can help them eradicate poverty from the country or turn the economy around. They still need to do the needful if they want to have an economy that flourishes. They have to create jobs to battle unemployment. They have to make their environment investor-friendly and make sure citizens have money to patronise foreign investors before foreign investors can come into the country. Adopting bitcoin as legal tender is just one thing out of a long list of things that they need to do. Unfortunately, the body (IMF) that's supposed to help them grow sees things differently from them and has its own agenda.",

It's kinda funny how it seems like no one is talking about them and focusing all their attention on El Salvador.We should not fault Nayib's over-excitement over the prospect of including Bitcoin as a means of payment in their country but I guess it's his over ambitiousness that brought him to this point. Just as the others have said, you can't solely rely on BTC to revive a failed economy because after the whole dust have settled down from the announcement of being the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, the challenge of making it work lies in wait.I feel that El Salvador were too in a hurry to heed the advice of the IMF that's why they had to discontinue use of BTC since they needed financial aid do badly.",

And for this change to happen in just two or three years? I imagine that the experiment in El Salvador is still in its early stages because we are supposed to see good results in the relatively long term when more countries recognize Bitcoin. Obtaining IMF loans and freezing the purchase process for a certain period does not mean stopping the Bitcoin adoption project or that El Salvador will abandon its goals. Yes, there are regulatory and socio-economic problems that hinder the course of financial policies in general and not only with regard to Bitcoin.",

They are all getting it wrong including you because the economy is not bad than before.As far as I know, El Salvador's economy had been struggling for decades before Nayib Bukele took office and since he took office, the economy has improved significantly but is still not completely out of trouble.  Tourism is considered one of El Salvador's strengths and contributes up to 15% to the country's GDP, and since bitcoin became legal tender, their tourism industry has increased by 30% in 2022. So it can be said that bitcoin has contributed to the improvement of their economy over the years. But what people are spreading is that they think El Salvador's bitcoin investment has been a huge success and that this is the main factor that saved El Salvador's economy. But in fact, the main factor that has helped El Salvador's economy improve rapidly over the years is thanks to Nayib Bukele's economic policies. He has improved the crime and gang situation, seen as the biggest problem causing economic instability in the country, sought to attract foreign investors and promote the country's strengths such as remittances and agriculture...It can be said that the greatest credit belongs to Nayib Bukele with his economic policies, not just relying on bitcoin investment to save the economy as many people mistakenly think.QuoteEl Salvador was not a failed experiment.It is considered a failure because people had too high expectations for bitcoin and thought that bitcoin is a magic wand that can save any economy just by adopting it.",

You seem to have a totally wrong perspective about El Salvador's Bitcoin policy. The project was not designed to lift the country out of a financial mess, neither was it paraded as a means to shield El Salvador from IMF loans. The country has been in bad shape and Nayid Bukele is trying to fix it. He managed to reduce the crime rate of the country, which was its major problem. Bitcoin was just a program designed to diversify the economy of El Salvador. Don't also forget that El Salvador is the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender, so they made some mistakes because they were doing some experiments. Other countries can learn from the mistakes of El Salvador and improve on them. Now, we should also take note that a President would always make hard decisions when there is an emergency. Bukele taking a loan from the IMF and readjusting the Bitcoin policy is not a bad move if the economy needs the money. Afterall the country didn't sell any of its hodling and it is still buying more coins. El Salvador is a pride of the Bitcoin ecosystem and should be appreciated for being bold enough to be the first country to make Bitcoin a legal tender.",

IMF is not right but El Salvador got no option. If possible the country can do without the loan, bitcoin served its purpose.El Salvador was not a failed experiment.I think you made an excellent point here, when I looked up the impact of Bitcoin on their economy, I found proof to your claims. El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin is proving to be a game-changer for its tourism and investment sectors. At the recent Plan B Forum El Salvador, Minister of Tourism Morena Valdez highlighted the positive economic impact of the country’s adoption of digital currency. According to Valdez, more than 500 tourist establishments across the country now accept Bitcoin, and many of these businesses are seeing a 30% increase in their income.The country’s promotion as the «country of Bitcoin» has not only attracted cryptocurrency enthusiasts but also generated a boost in both tourism and investment. Bitcoiners are eager to experience how a Bitcoin-based economy functions, and many have recommended El Salvador as a destination. As a result, the number of Bitcoin-related investments, including real estate transactions using the digital currency, is on the rise. For example, condominiums and apartments in popular areas like La Libertad and El Zonte Beach have been sold through Bitcoin.https://www.google.com/amp/s/elsalvadorinenglish.com/2025/02/01/bitcoin-boosts-tourism-and-investment-in-el-salvador-minister-reports/%3famp=1.From the above, you'll see that Bitcoin impacted their economy positively, but you'll not leave everything for Bitcoin to do especially since they were not very early adopters of Bitcoin when Bitcoin appreciation was over 1000000%. Their country was messed up earlier, Bitcoin only helped as much as it could from the time of their adoption. It really was not a failed experiment. Their issues was more than Bitcoin can singularly handle.",
