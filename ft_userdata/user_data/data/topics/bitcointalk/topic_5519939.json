The government is not your ally.A very valid advice. For the past years, it has been a story of ban and restrictions by different countries. Bitcoin and Bitcoiners have suffered this fate for a long time, this seems to be the moon our ancestors prayed for. Now, we are witnessing it, we should enjoy in its entirety. We are living in the future of our ancestors. You never can tell if bitcoin has won all the battles.A few dedicated bitcoiners who value privacy and decentralization should hold on and increase the campaign. The worse scenario of this global adoption would be attempts to centralize the decentralized bitcoin. This can only be achieved by the government if we all become profit orientated and forgetting the real legacy of bitcoin.",

Bitcoin has hit a new ATH and will reach the 100k threshold soon enough. The Bitcoin reserve bill passed by Donald Trump is 4th most viewed bill in the US. But it looks somehow impossible for it to be implemented. One million Bitcoin for one country in a five year period is massive.",

Stay alert and keep an open mind. The government is not your ally.Bitcoin is decentralised and when last I checked the government doesn't fancy Decentralisation or decentralised projects to be precise. Now here you have a nice write up with a smart reminder at the end. Firstly let's evaluate the whole crypto pump. Why has bitcoin been pumping? Well yes big firms are buying more and of course FOMO is making smaller retail holders sell of their coins. These days governments seem to be adopting bitcoin in most countries first it was El Salvador which was very rational as they are a small country and next it was the US and now even Poland.The questions are is the government supporting bitcoin or they are just aiming to profit off it and fix inflation in their economy. Big firms buying more puts the market in tension and if you ask me FOMO is one of the biggest problems currently.",

However, Elsavador has been there, and everyone was glad about the President's adoption. On the other hand, US is not to be trusted, but since the opportunity will be great for the ecosystem and more users from the nation venturing into Bitcoin, their regulations will mainly stand on her citizens.

Just curious, is the strategic reserve you're referring to the same deal as what was in the article I posted about in a recent thread, or is it something different?   Because from what I've read, the 5% of the total bitcoin supply the US government would apparently buy should that proposal go through would be earmarked for debt repayment over 20 years and wouldn't really be a true reserve fund like gold used to be many years ago.If we're talking about the same thing, I'm guessing someone in the government is expecting the price of bitcoin to skyrocket to a point such that the enormous amount of debt the US has racked up can be repaid....but I still think that's a straight-up gambling fantasy that ought not be funded with taxpayers' dollars.  Anyway.OP, you're absolutely correct that the government isn't an ally.  It shouldn't be that way, but that's the harsh truth.",

The cypherpunk movement originated in the late 1980s and gained traction with the establishment of the \"Cypherpunks\" electronic mailing list in 1992, where informal groups of activists, technologists, and cryptographers discussed strategies to enhance individual privacy and resist state or corporate surveillance. Deeply libertarian in philosophy, the movement is rooted in principles of decentralization, individual autonomy, and freedom from centralized authority...so with all that said are you now ready to defy the government regulated wallstreet sponsor deals with core devs, used to influence the bitcoin governance.. or do you still support and dont want to stop/change the controllers of bitcoins politicsin short:are you now ready to care and be concerned with protecting bitcoin from centralised governance, or do you wish to continue ass kissing their agenda(core roadmap) thats sponsored by the fiat bankers and regulators",

Some might feel tempted to take out all their holdings and use it for other things but this is not the highest yet and we need to be patient and believe in bitcoin. Some may feel scared that this may be the only time for them to take profit which is why taking at most half of your holdings can be ideal since you would have gotten some profit already but at the same time you still have money to monitor and use to earn from. These are the times where a lot of us investors will learn a lot from. All the things we have read and learned this is the time to apply those and hopefully we get to become successful at the end.",
