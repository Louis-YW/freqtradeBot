  "content": "Merry Christmas and happy holidays!So i decided to start this short thread to speculate on BTC Christmas price cycles pull back, if you study Bitcoin market chart in 2017 the present Bitcoin price is the same, but in 2017 Bitcoin before the month of November 2017 was on a bullish market trend and some form of sell pressure hit the market during the Christmas holidays.But this year, 2023 Bitcoin hard a strong resistant price level during the period of 20th to 25th which is Christmas most activities and time for family shopping and family spending where the banking system may pause a constraint to effective transactions and alternatives are sort after, Bitcoin and other digital assets become the order of the season which make Bitcoin price to pull back. This year Bitcoin price is stabilized at around 16,000 + which is a good resistant level and a benchmark that represents previous years' bullish all-time high price. Is this an indication of the bullish market in the year 2023 where Bitcoin will break 20,000 in the early weeks of the year?",

So it seems holders don't really took their cryptocurrency savings for short term happiness like shopping and gifts, the new era is moving forward with goal of achieving financial stability.We are at the 16K range for too long so it maybe a sign that we reached the bottom so if the right time comes then possibly next year the bull season may begin.",

Take FTX bankruptcy as the major bad wave for the year 2022 and you will understand why is not right to conclude that every December will have the same pattern of movement because every year has its own peculiar problem that faces the market.",

However, as soon as there is a FUD on Binance's reserves then the price goes down hard to $16k++ and that's where we are right now.As far as going bullish this 2023, I highly doubt it, maybe a few occasional runs to $20k, but that will be the biggest resistant for now (usually whole numbers are), so it will be interesting a break out that could happen next year and so if it goes to $22k, we might be in a bullish phase, but let's see, really hard to predict as there are factors that can really affect the price movement.",

However, despite the recent volatility and slump in prices, many experts are still optimistic that Bitcoin can reach $100k.Even Tim Draper , a well-known American investor, believes that Bitcoin can reach $250k in the middle of 2023 regardless of the FTX bankruptcy news.https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/bitcoin-price-prediction-tim-draper-250k-02498939",

If the economy of many countries started to rise again, Bitcoin will also follow that and yes I also believe the current news with FED has something to do with the current trend of Bitcoin.

You said that Christmas will affect the price of Bitcoin, in my opinion it will not have a significant impact, because indeed people are more selective in selling their assets and most of the crypto holders are now holding back from selling their assets. We just have to wait for the good news in the next few days, because there seems to be some news that could make the price of Bitcoin go up, but we need to be aware that the possibility of traps still exists.",

How much would Christmas gift be compared to holding? Also someone working, receiving fiat weekly or monthly, I do not think that kind of people will sell their bitcoin for gift. Anyone that is receiving income in bitcoin will sell just little.Quote from: retreat on December 26, 2022, 05:59:24 AMWe just have to wait for the good news in the next few days, because there seems to be some news that could make the price of Bitcoin go up, but we need to be aware that the possibility of traps still exists.As the price will be increasing would be worth a good news, it would be seen on news that time how bitcoin will increase (I do not believe those analyses, but many people do like it), that will make some people to buy too.

But the market will run as usual and will not have such a big impact on Bitcoin and its price in the market.$20k may be bullish if we are talking about the previous years and this price was also one of their all time highs but we shouldn't apply that to the current year. $20k this year is not considered to be a bullish price but it was bearish. Bullish price this year can be $50k or above. $20k is easy to achieve because we are almost $17k now and besides, we went there many times before.Christmas is finally over and as we can see, the price of BTC merely moves. I think this only shows that the majority of the people didn't touch their BTCs as opposed to the previous years. Well, we already know why. I expect the same thing is going to happen in the new year (dec. 31).",

You remember when bitcoin was at 18k-19k for a long time and people started to believe that we had bottomed and we were going to go up from here, and then the crash of FTX caused bitcoin to drop below $16k, making everyone's speculations and expectations completely wrong. Bitcoin has been above the $16k resistance for too long, but that doesn't mean we've finally bottomed out. Let's look at the outside situation, the economy, war, inflation... all are still negative so it's hard to expect that we have bottomed and the bull season will start from here.",

I know hardly only 5 days left. But still If Bitcoins anyhow manages to cross this mark, then definitely next year will be big for Bitcoins. Bitcoins have already seen it’s capabilities and during this Christmas week, it has also shown it’s resistance level. So definitely crossing 20k usd mark wont be any difficult for Bitcoins. I would say that we need to watch and wait meantime and observe the first week of January, before any further investments.",

The same thing happened in 2017 when bitcoin made the all-time high in December and prices were going down near the year end.The situation in this year December 2022 is different. The bitcoin prices were already near the bottom and there was no further selling pressure that could dump the bitcoin price further down after Christmas.",
