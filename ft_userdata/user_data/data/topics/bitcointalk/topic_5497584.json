The judgement against him only ever talks about the white paper, so making Bitcoin Core not available seems like he did more than was necessary.Quote from: JeromeTash on May 23, 2024, 09:33:14 PMWhich begs the question, do this mean that the UK users also have access to the Bitcoin whitepaper via Bitcoin.org?This is more complicated since Cobra wants to remain anonymous. There's basically 2 ways about this: 1) Mellor (the judge in the COPA case) finds some loophole that allows him to rule on the previous judgement, or 2) new litigation is brought against Craig by Cobra and/or \"bitcoin.org developers\" to reverse the previous judgement.For the first, it would be really weird though for Mellor to rule on a basically unrelated case that was decided by a different judge. However, maybe there could be some wiggle room with wording related to the fact that some of the developer defendants had contributed to bitcoin.org in the past, and could therefore be part of \"the person or persons responsible for the operation and publication of the website bitcoin.org\" so he may be able to make a ruling on this.For the second, Cobra wants to remain anonymous so that seems like it probably wouldn't happen.",

The claim was for infringementof copyright in the Bitcoin White Paper. Dr Wright secured Judgment in default ofacknowledgement of service and defence by the Order of HHJ Hodge QC dated 28 June2021, which includes an injunction preventing the defendants from infringing copyrightin the Bitcoin White Paper, whether by making the Paper available for download or inany other way.

Maybe his sponsors will look for other means to continue with this clueless litigation. When I read the news that the downloading of Bitcoin white paper have been blocked in the UK due to litigations, I thought it was a calculated effort by the government to attack Bitcoin. But this current judgment is a glimpse that the judiciary is really independent. The judgment is a big win for the Bitcoin community.
