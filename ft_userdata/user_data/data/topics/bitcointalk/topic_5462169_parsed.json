Probably not this since it should pop up other errors, but you never know.-Dave",

But as far as I am aware just use the search bar in finder.I cant even find the data file, yet my drive shows that there is roughly 500Gb data floating around somewhere!",

Keep in mind Apple / MacOS likes to hide as much as possible from the user since 'they know better' so you might have to jump through a few hoops to find things.Obligatory also, make sure the machine is fully updated and running the latest version of the OS there have been a couple of very severe vulnerabilities patched this year, and yet I still see people running older builds of the OS even as it's popping up the 'update now' warning.-Dave",
