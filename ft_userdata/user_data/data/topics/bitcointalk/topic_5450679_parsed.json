Meaning that when people should sell they are in denial instead, and they sell when they are desperate, and stay away from the when markets are depressing or look for the pump of recovery to exit on that. And obviously buy because of the hype and the greed. They rarely follow trough their plans if they keep looking at the charts.That being said i trust on my insticts too. Meaning that i try to do opposite of them. That doesn't necessarily mean that i hold if i am scared. These days i might even sell before i am scared if my target has been hit i will sell 90%But if i would trust my feelings, i would say that we would go sideways in near 30k for few moths and after that the real bull market starts. And that btc might even hit 50k this year. The fact that memecoins started to gain attention tells me that new people are believing crypto again.",

But I also have a suspicion that if price reaches this level, ie breaks above around $32K, then the target would be nearer $40K-$50K than $37K imo. The $30K level was previous support for around 18 months, so if it can be reclaimed and price move higher, then I think it's likely price will move higher quite quickly in a parabolic manner, even if there is initially a pull-back from the price range you mention back towards $30K in order to re-confirm as support.There was also the logic that if $6K was broken to the upside back in 2019 then $8K would act as resistance, as it was previously resistance in 2018. But due to the momentum shift and increased volume, price merely consolidated around $8K before moving considerably higher. With $30K broken we could see the same result, as it's the last line in the sand for the bears to defend.I know many considered breaking back above $25K as confirming the end of the bear market, but for other more conservative traders/investors this level is more like around $30K/$32K.",

Because history may still be repeating itself, but that doesn't mean it will repeat itself in detail, things will be a little different.I accumulate bitcoin monthly, and I am not too concerned about bitcoin price in the short term, even if bitcoin goes up to $50k, I will accumulate as it is still below my sell target.",

The market you see that performed most excellently from January to March might make a bearish turn for the rest of the year, so it doesn't matter.As it is now with Bitcoin, I believe that inflation should be our focus, also, the news of regulation, liquidation and adoption by big volumes should be our focus.Quote from: adaseb on May 01, 2023, 04:14:20 AMWell you need to realize. Who is there to buy Bitcoin at levels higher than that.This is a very good consideration judging by the widely speculated cycle of Bitcoin moving lower before halving. And at the current levels, people are hesitant in committing their money thereby waiting for purchases at lower levels.",

People knew that Bitcoin performs well on economic crisis. This is a good opportunity for them to escape inflation and invest to Bitcoin which is proven performing well when fiat market is crashing hard. I think we might see more since the price moves very strong towards 30k level a week before the monthly candle close. This is a good sign that the confidence on buying Bitcoin is already there.We might see another big movement both down and up since a pull back is required for bulls to have better entry price. I think 40K+ this December or more is what I’m sensing due to the negativity of US market. More bank crash means less trust to fiat.",

I even still believe that $40k can be broken in 2023 and possibly higher before the halving occurs.I tend to check charts and get very basic reasons before predicting prices, not just on instinct. I observe that we still have the same pattern regarding bitcoin price ahead of the 2024 halving, this makes me optimistic to hope $40k can be broken before the end of the year. It is true that there is a lot of pressure in the market that makes it hard for the bitcoin price to break through resistance, but that is normal as price volatility is to be expected.",
