But you will still probably earn more by selling electricity back to a distributor and using the earnings to buy bitcoins. Depending on where you live and the price of electricity, of course.",

Thanks.If you are a beginner, I would recommend that you build several mining rigs on NVIDIA RTX 4060 video cards. This is not a hot video card and has a standard 8-pin power connector. This means that it will work well in the cheapest open mining case, which you can even assemble yourself for 5-10 dollars. Video card consumption on many coins is 80-100 watts.You will have the opportunity to mine any coins. Unlike mining on ASICs, the video card has a 3-year warranty. And this video card will be in demand in the secondary market.",
