  "content": "If anybody has been paying attention in the last week, you probably have heard about the Epic and Massive Crash of one of the Biggest Top Digital currencies in crypto called Terra Luna. Within a matter of seemingly hours it dropped from over $100 to meer pennies. Bringing a mass amount of people a little bit closer to death and despair in the matter of minutes. Life savings, thousands of dollars invested and even millions just wiped away in a blink of an eye. Needless to say the question for most people would be \"What Happened\"? People are still trying to put the puzzle pieces together and they still can't come up with a reasonable answer. This epic debacle seemingly has also been blamed for almost unraveling Bitcoin and other major cryptos as well. Some people think it was an exit scam, a fraudulent project, an inside job and also just bad technical management of the project itself. Let us know in the comments below what you think of One of The Biggest Crashes In History.",

Safety mechanisms were set up to maintain price but it remains a bad attempt at creating a stable coin that is basically backed by another volatile asset. Some even blame LUNA's TPS and exchanges suspending deposit/withdrawals but when you think of it, why would it depend on those factors?",

I think we have the same scenario with this thing when the so-called squid game coin has crashed after its first impression to the public. the investors thought it was also an opportunity where in reality it's just another pump and dumps coins. same as this one where people got fooled because of the fake dumps.",

Even though the crypto world is full of risks, I think it's an exaggeration if we look at LUNA as a big project. although currently they are still trying to fix their problem but i think it is not possible to recover for the original asset owners when they hold their assets for tens of dollars per coin.",

The most stupid team in the crypto history. No reserved funds and the team can't execute the proposal to propose the refund to the small investors. Many people are still blaming the team right now and LFG twitter is still very crowded as this moment. The new report said only less than 300 millions USD left",

However, my take is, that investing so much money on any other coin than Bitcoin is a major RISK in the skim of RISK.",

But what we can expect from any POS coin anyway, 99.9% are all scam.Yup, that's why they should never switch ETH to POS also. Mined coins are way better than these shitty stuff. They have some sort of indirect phsyical presence and they can be felt by mining powers. I do mining of RVN, I know how stable that coin is even in the bearish market. Its dropped to pennies but it's not shattered like Luna, but following the current bearish trend. Definitely the coin will survive huge dumps as the time passes. There are halving steps so rewards drops and prices are increased for the Mineable coins. Luna incidence was terrifying. There is no official comments from the project devs regarding what happened. Or could be just work of purely one person holding the major amount of it.",

The regulators are still investigating this case and i hope that when they will find something and this will be published to give clarification to the all of luna and ust investors.

Let us know in the comments below what you think of One of The Biggest Crashes In History. I don't own any Terra (Luna) myself and therefore i did not follow the project that closely but of course i also have heard about the events around Terra as it was a major happening within the crypto scene that basically put the whole market down with it. What i read so far about the crash of Terra is that there was a massive sell pressure for the stablecoin of Terra UST, which is not a 1:1 backed by reserves stablecoin likes USDT or USDC but a stablecoin that keeps it's value via an algorithm. The sell pressure became so high though that the algorithm could not maintain the price of UST and once that became obvious the panic sells of people began which made things even worse.So i don't think it was an inside job or a exit scam or something, it was just a badly designed stablecoin in my opinion that was not ready for such a scenario.",

From there i can speculate if luna team is making the biggest mistake that i have ever seen, it's makins vc, retail investors and many parties are loosing their money even cz and binance as well.

If you see thousands of people trusting into a project, you trust those thousands of people to be right and invest because of it. Of course, this is not something that you should be doing but at the same time this is how people fall into ponzi schemes as well. When you see a ponzi scheme where thousands of people join, you do not look at the project and research it and think if it is good or not, you look at the thousands and ask them and they tell you great things about it because so far they have been getting paid. In this context when they start to lose money, you do too, and that's when everyone realizes it's a ponzi.",
