Unlike fiat, you have other options to increase the chance that you get your funds after you finish your job, utilizing that feature would be a great idea. Especially after the recent collapse of many centralized platforms due to bad management, lying about their operations, etc.",

Disappeared from view if it's available. Anyone aware of?",
