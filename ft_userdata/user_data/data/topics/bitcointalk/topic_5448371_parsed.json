If yes, then how you can offer up to 30$ to a voice artist while a full member rank can earn more than you and while need to spend only a little time which may take to discuss your project? You are doing nothing but underestimating voice artists.",

That $30 is so small compare on the earnings you can get per video. I doubt there will be a voice actors gonna take this offer since for sure they might think about creating their own youtube videos use their talents to earn more decent income from the masterpiece they created.Don't exploit talents and take then for granted. Pay them up decent amount so it will be fair for both parties and everyone is happy to the compensation they get.",

You are doing nothing but underestimating voice artists.I don't think that it makes much sense to compare his offer with how much someone can earn via signature campaign since not everyone is interested in spending several hours per day on the forum. After all, there are campaigns that pay Full Member $40 for 25 posts and I don't know about you, but for me it takes quite a lot of time to write that amount of posts. I also don't remember anyone bashing lightlord for paying peanuts in his signature campaigns. Its anyone's right to offer as much as they want, and its people's right to refuse that offer if they think that its not worth their time. By the way, you would be surprised to see how cheap voice actors can actually be. Just check Fiverr and see for yourself, there are guys that are doing it for $5 per video.",

You are doing nothing but underestimating voice artists.you can't compare writing on the forum and recording or voicing a video. Even full members can join in the signature campaigns and apply to OP's job offers at the same time. $30 for someone can be enough money for a little effort, don't underestimate someone's workQuote from: Taskford on April 11, 2023, 02:03:06 PMDo you think this is a nice offer? That $30 is so small compare on the earnings you can get per video. I doubt there will be a voice actors gonna take this offer since for sure they might think about creating their own youtube videos use their talents to earn more decent income from the masterpiece they created.You are in the Roobet signature campaign, and they pay you up to $100 weekly. I can say it is a small amount compared to the earnings which they made. Is this the same comparison?OP need to design a video and do what needs to be done on it. before that, he has to find a buyer for it or a way to monetize it or make it valuable. Isn't that worth some money or should he give everything he earns to someone who will only read a few lines of text?Quote from: Rikafip on April 11, 2023, 04:41:02 PMBy the way, you would be surprised to see how cheap voice actors can actually be.

You are doing nothing but underestimating voice artists.I wholeheartedly agree with OgNasty and Rikafip on this matter. Comparing the earnings from a signature campaign with the offer that the OP has made is completely unfair. It takes a lot of effort to reach a certain rank in this forum, after that someone will be eligible to join those signature campaigns. The majority of signature campaigns only accept ranks that are above the member level, and some only accept senior member and above ranks. Another fact is that writing of those posts isn't an easy task, only those posters will receive good earnings whose posts are of really good quality and those posts require a lot of time, knowledge, and consistency, to produce. In third world countries there are thousands of voice artists who would be willing to do the job for way less than 20 dollars. For many of those artists an extra 20-30 dollars would be more than sufficient. It's sad but truth that many of these artists are unable to find any such jobs and freelancing sites are extremely competitive these days. I believe that the OP will easily find someone who will do the job for him.",

People shouldn’t criticize others who are looking to employ people. I understand it may be a small amount, but in some countries an extra $30 a week would really help out. While there is offered a lower salary than ever I don't think it is anything except trying to destroy talent or appointing people who are not skilled in the required field. And finally, convert that into a bad quality person. While anyone who offers low value can not demand good quality. Everything should have the lowest value and the offer which OP has offered is overcome everything.Quote from: examplens on April 11, 2023, 05:28:38 PMExactly. similar things came to my mind first. from that point of view, it can be said that the OP is very generous.The offer on Fiverr is 5$ per video and on the details, you can see the extra charge.
