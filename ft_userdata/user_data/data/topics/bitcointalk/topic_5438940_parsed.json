If you do I would go ask them because their answer is going to be as accurate as anyone else here. it will be 1 of the only times a fortune teller will be as accurate. No one on this forum or in the world can accurately tell you when to buy or sell btc. That comes with experience but you are not going to do it at the perfect moment. If people knew how to do that all the traders on WO or the Economy board would be rich. We are not. We look at charts to the best of our ability but we only speculate. Anyone that claims to know the best time to sell is lying and should not be trusted. I recommend that you set a goal like $30000  and sell when that has been reached. Do not worry about losing out as long as you have made a profit that you are happy with. Set a goal that you will be happy with selling at. if you do not want to sell all your btc and want to keep some in it set a goal and only take 10%, 20% out. There is a method called dollar cost averaging that a lot of veteran traders will recommend because it is the safest way to accumulate btc and sell for profit but it is not fool proof. I will not explain it here because there is a lot of topics about it. Use the search on the forum or Google.",

I am sure you could find some of them on the forum  Depending on the price you bought it, it's up to you to determine how much you hope to resell your BTC, and especially: how long you are ready to hold them. Everything is a question of patience, as you probably already know  Determining a selling price randomly is clearly not possible, we are not clairvoyant, nor do we have the ability to travel in time... In any case you can always try to determine a resale range that will be to your advantage, but even with that, you will never have the guarantee that BTC will reach it in itselfWhy would you trust the \"expertise\" from randoms on internet ? It is your investment, and you probably have your own goals",

However, it depends on your time budget as well as your financial budget for your life. If you don't have enough money reserve for your life, you will have to sell your coins when you need money even in bear market.QuoteI would like to sell before the next bear market to take profits this time.

Can this be predicted somewhat?Usually, you can consider to take profit about 3 months up to 6 months after Bitcoin breaks out and start to make a new bull run and find its new all time high. Don't want to take profit at all time highs because we can not see future. So if you can take profit at good price, enjoy it and move on.",

So I would answer I don't know, and I don't know where the market is going next, and it could go up and it could go down and anything could happen because of some unknown factor.and my advice is better hold your coin or bitcoin when there is a decline or and take advantage of this decline to accumulate and hold it, because if you believe the market or bitcoin will go back up even though you don't know for sure. There's nothing wrong with you taking advantage of this moment and when the price goes up you can sell it, and be patient so that you sell at the right time and are also very profitable.",

According to Coingecko, the ATH is $69,044.77. Does it mean to say that by the time Bitcoin's price reached $69,050.00, it's already selling time? I don't think so. So when is selling time? $70,000, $80,000, $100,000? We cannot tell. But if you're good enough that you've already made profit, then selling beyond the ATH is good. But don't fret if months after selling, the price continued to rise 20% or more. You have to take note that the halving's full effect on Bitcoin's price happens at least a year from the halving itself. And the growth is considerable you wouldn't want to miss it. The peak of the growth every after halving is significantly higher than its halving price. So a new ATH is probably a low selling point.",

For all you TA guys when would be a good time to sell just to give me an idea? Thanks.You mean you want to sell bitcoin at the highest price? No one will know what the high will be in the next bull season, even if you ask the best expert. You need to have a plan and goal for your investment, not necessarily to sell at the highest price, but to sell when you have enough profit as you want. For example, my goal will sell my bitcoin for 100k, just bitcoin reach 100k, I will sell it even if it has a chance to increase more. Sell when there is enough profit, don't set the target too high, or it will only disappoint you.",

      "body": "When it comes to selling your Bitcoin before the next bear market starts, there are a few key steps you should take. First, determine what your goals are for trading and invest in Bitcoin. Do you want to hold onto short-term gains or use them as a long-term investment? These considerations will all affect when is the best time for you to sell. Second, study trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market carefully, including volume, history of prices dips/peaks, past bear markets and other factors that could influence when you should sell. Keeping an eye on news about developments in the blockchain industry can also help inform your decision about whether now is a good time for selling off your digital assets.Thirdly consider alternative ways of mitigating risk from volatility such as hedging with options contracts or other derivatives products. This can be an effective strategy if used correctly as it allows investors to buy protection against losses at certain points while still keeping their crypto position intact so they can potentially benefit from any rises in coin prices too. Remember too that timing isn’t everything - understanding market dynamics is more important than trying to predict when each individual sale will occur: timing needs to happen right but it won’t guarantee success; careful research into different coins before investing and caution during periods of rising/falling prices will help give you better chances of avoiding serious losses during a bear market period.",
