I have seen ethereum coin go from lows to highs of $4500 and lows were at $120. Now the current is approaching the bull market again so the price of Ethereum coin will rise again.",

Because it got a lot of attention, we ended up seeing the gas fee increase as well, because we saw the gas fee increase, people will start to look for other stuff and because they will leave for other stuff, we are going to end up seeing ETH price not going up that much more.This is a cycle, then the gas fee drops due to people leaving, and the price goes back up again, and this repeats all the time. In the 2021 bull period we didn't had that, we had gas fee being high and people still using it anyway to make even more money than they spend on the gas fee, that is not available today.",

Yeah we saw that somehow it doesn't correlates anymore but right now it takes time for Ethereum to catch up. It doesn't correlates most of the time with Bitcoin so the chance for Ethereum to blast was like to the fact that Bitcoin dominance was likely to go down, so, I'm thinking that Ethereum could shift up and other altcoins, so a mini alt season is my guess to happen. It could not be this month or May but probably June or July.",

We went up from 16k to 30k, if that doesn't still make you think that we are in a bitcoin bull run, then I think only breaking over ATH would help you with that.I personally hope that people would be able to forget that we went down from 68k, but start thinking that we would go up from 16k instead. If you think we are 50%+ down, you would be upset but if you look at 100% up that would be alright. This is why I feel like people need to change their point of view and they would be able to turn that bear thinking into bull thinking for sure.",

ETH down now almost 110k in supply since the merge. Which feels like a lot but is a drop in the bucket. And it's absolutely nothing compared to the old POW issuance that used to be live. Regardless it's a fun trend to watch.The interesting thing to note about ETH is the ETH/BTC ratio to me personally. It really didn't lose much of anything during the bear market trading around roughly 0.07 which is interesting. And during bull markets, various alts seem to crush. So there is a plausible case to be made that on the next bull market ETH rips higher on the ETH/BTC ratio to somewhere in the 0.1-.2 range. Who knows.I can say that there's about 10x developer work done on ETH consistently over time and about 10x TX fees happening vs Bitcoin, so it is a highly sought after blockchain network, especially when compared with anything else, even Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Basically the reason why it went below the $2000 mark is due to all the unstaking that is taking place and causing the selling. Crypto is transparent and its very easy to see how much ETH is unstaked everyday. If you are a holder you can see this and know before hand that most of these unstaked ETH will be sent to an exchange and sold. Hence you are hesitant to buy more and will wait until the unstaking slows down.The amount being deposited doesn't mean anything because those deposited ETH wasn't going to be sold anyways but the unstaked ETH has a higher chance of being sold. This is what might happen if USG sends more BTC to Coinbase to sell or when MtGox releases all those BTC after a decade.",

Which is why I only have always had a few altcoins in my main portfolio. Although not a day trader, I try to always find good opportunities to buy back some Ethereum Just a few days after taking profits. The only times I avoid touching the buy and sell buttons on Ethereum are on times when the whole market gets too volatile or goes sideways for a long time (I usually wait for indicators before jumping back in on seasons like such).",
