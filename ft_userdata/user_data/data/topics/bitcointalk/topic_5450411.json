  "content": "There was an article published on Cointelegraph six hours ago with a very interesting title with definitely looks like a clickbait title: What security? Bitcoin enthusiast cracks known 12-word seed phrase in minutesSo, here is the deal. One person posted all the 12 words of his wallet in no particular order. This wallet was filled with 100,000 satoshis. Long story short, it took 25 minutes to one person with modern GPU to bruteforce the wallet by using the software called BTCrecover.There are people who think that its okay to not completely hide your seeds if you remember the way they are ordered but this small experiment makes it pretty clear that one should be more cautious.Otherwise, your 12-word seed phrase is as safe as 24-word seed phrase if attacker doesn't know your seeds. But if one knows seeds but not their ordering, then 12-word seed wallet will be vulnerable to attacks but 24-word seed phrase still maintains high security.",

If one location does not prove enough then one should consider using more than one location with a multi sig wallet and storing them differently. One getting compromised does not result in loss of funds.An additional seedphrase which you can store separately is also a good alternative to scrambling the seed phrase.",

I'm shocked! 12 word seed phrases, when properly secured, are perfectly safe. If you reveal all the words, then of course it becomes unsafe. A scrambled 12 word seed phrase has only 12! = 479,001,600 possibilities. Add in the fact that on average 93.75% of the possibilities can be discarded for having an incorrect checksum, that only leaves 29,937,600 possibilities which require you to derive an address and check for funds. This is an easy task on even fairly modest home hardware.The moral of the story is don't scramble (or do any other weird \"tricks\") to your seed phrase. The chances are either you will achieve nothing useful, or you will go too far the other way and lock yourself out of your wallets. Just write them down and store them safely.",

QuoteI’ll give you all 12 words but in no particular order.https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-advocate-cracks-known-12-word-seed-phrase-in-minutesNo wonder LOL25 minutes seem to me a long time that took when you have all words in front of you. It needed to check the combination of the words. I studied combination a long time ago from that sense I think finding all the combinations of 12 words/string should not be very hard for a programmer. Your job is then to check the results with each finding which should not be a hard job too.It would be harder if the letters of the words were not in correct orders too.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on April 27, 2023, 08:07:36 PMThe moral of the story is don't scramble (or do any other weird \"tricks\") to your seed phrase.You got it wrong.

It could be much more intuitive if the title was \"Don't scramble your 12-word seed phrase and rely on this as a backup\".Final Thought:It is not feasible (for the time being) for a machine to brute force a 12-word seed phrase. Even if 24-words are generally much safer than 12-words, the math clearly show us, that 12-words cannot be brute-forced.Don't worry about being brute-forced. Worry about backing-up your words properly. Because, as you have seen in the article, knowing the 12 words is much more important than knowing their order. Finally ADD A PASSPHRASE!",

The highest the words the better the security.Well, it's not quite as straightforward as that.A 12 word seed phrase provides 128 bits of entropy. A 24 word seed phrase provides 256 bits of entropy. This much is true. However, all bitcoin private keys provide, at most, 128 bits of security. So the security of the private keys generated by a 24 word seed phrase are identical to the security of the private keys generated by a 12 word seed phrase (provided, of course, that the seed phrases were not generated insecurely).Quote from: Yamane_Keto on April 27, 2023, 11:45:46 PM12!
