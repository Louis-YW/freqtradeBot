Have you try to communicate with their representative first? I think it's only your way in order to solve this problem.Judging from their UI/UX, I don't think their sites are buggy or slow, it must be from your internet or your device. However I never play in this sportsbook, I might be wrong too.",

I think that post from Steve was probably just a typo and it looks as though esportsbet.io has nothing to do with Sportsbet.io.After further investigation, I found that there is actually an e-sportsbet.io domain that Steve also used at the end of his posts that redirects to their main sportsbet.io domain.",
