  "content": "People need a Che Guevara-style protest against the government to increase the minimum wage, as it is the desire of the people not the will of the government to increase the minimum wage In the current situation, a protest is needed to raise wages, not the FED's interest rate hike. FED's interest rate hike will hurt the cryptocurrency market because various institutions, including the FED and the SEC, are anti-cryptocurrency.",
