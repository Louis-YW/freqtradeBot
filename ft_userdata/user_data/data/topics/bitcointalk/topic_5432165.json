So just forget about him. I'd say lets test Putin to make another coin like BTC, Im sure he got no knowledge about the btc code and other tech stuffs, he'll fail.Thirdly, its mentor not menthor.Quote from: Fullbear2222 on December 28, 2022, 03:14:10 PMAS we know Dan penaSorry, but who the F* is this Dan pena now? lol.",

Btc will never go zero no matter the circumstances and even if it is possible for ethereum to overtake btc, I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Dan made these allegations because BTC was not created by American scholars. I was discussing with a friend last week and he told me that BTC was created by Russians and Chinese. So to some extent Dan knows that the creator not BTC is from Russia and not America so to pinpoint his argument, he has to finger point Putin as the creator of the coin, but that is wrong. The creator of BTC is unknown (anonymous). Accusation is heavier than Beating",

He is not even a billionaire, right? There are nearly a thousand people that are billionaires and I believe Dan Peña is not one of them. Actually, I do not even care much about Elon Musk's crypto opinion so I don't see someone that believes Putin is Satoshi Nakamoto worthy of my time. OP I am actually more interested in your trading advice. Hopefully, you will give us a free signal on when to attack big.🚀🚀🚀",

He is no doubt a charismatic man but I wouldn't say he is an economist or a financial analyst. So there's no need to panic or believe that Putin is behind bitcoin. These are all conspiracy theories so read them, enjoy them and forget about them! That's the best course of action you can take!",
