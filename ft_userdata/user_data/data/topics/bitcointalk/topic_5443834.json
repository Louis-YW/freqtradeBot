Not 100% certain what the unzipping process would look like. Or what effect it might have on transaction overhead. Unzip on the fly is a possibility. It would make the download and storage process more feasible for entry level with lower capacity HDD.Blockchain culling.  After a certain period of time, old redundant transactions would be archived and removed from the active blockchain to keep its size relatively manageable. As there are no chargebacks, there is no reason to list every transaction on chain.Uptime statistics for energy demographics.  How many total transactions were powered by renewable energy, with basic breakdowns of who, what, where, when, etc. Total transparency for green power. No studies or research would need to be conducted by the EPA or other organizations. To an extent, energy demographics would be built into the chain and software by default.Different versions to cater to various roles and functions.  One distribution could be dedicated towards remittances. Another could be dedicated HODL. No more big block versus small block debate. Each role would have a dedicated software intended to fulfill the task.Etc.",

But if you have a wallet, you'll lose information about all the transactions you made more than 4 (for example) years ago.Instead of replacing all full nodes with these \"part nodes\", I'd suggest that the majority of nodes become part nodes with the culling feature, but there are still about 1000 or so nodes with full blockchain history connected to the network, so that these transactions can still be fetched, albeit more slowly, as they are only expected to be referenced rarely at most.It is something that can be done now (with another program, without modifying Bitcoin Core) and not an \"if only\" idea.",

How is that even possible, without destroying full blockchain verification?Redundant transactions do not need to be recorded or reverified.There would be a set of conditions for redundant transactions, which would allow the data to be culled after a period of time had elapsed.There are no chargebacks or reversals in the transaction system. Which are some of the main reasons for long and detailed transaction chains being important. Once something has been verified for a period of time. It can be considered etched in stone. Which makes the record of it less important, as it will never be amended or revised. The old data can be archived on a separate chain, which would be considerably larger. While the smaller chain would be the one in active use for a leaner and more streamlined architecture.Crypto miners might also be tasked with the culling process which would function similar to current BTC rewards.Say there are 1,000 transactions in the chain preceding the current transaction. Do we really need 100% of those 1,000 transactions? Why don't we cull 900 out of 1,000 and keep only the last 100. With the raw data being archived in a big file chain. If this is done on every transaction branch, it might shrink the size of the chain by a factor of 90%. If the current bitcoin blockchain is 250 gigabytes, this might shrink it down to a far more manageable 25 gigabytes.",

(separating locations reduces risks of losing all three at same time)and when you lose one its then time to move funds to a fresh 2 of 3 to have 3 keys again to avoid the risk of losing a second key if left to long on an already lost key setchances of losing all three at the exact same time is high if same location stored. so spread them out. give them to friends or relatives knowing they cant do anything with only 1 key they hold. as for any protocol that can move value without key signatures(your permission/consent). a system that allows that is a system i wont want to use. the chances of abuse becomes rife(EG fiat account forfeiture)EG. find an old stash. pretend its yours but you forgot your proof. and boom you win someone elses stash.. um no thanks",
