The digital assets bill was finally introduced in the Legislative Assembly at the end of November 2022, where Bukele's party, Nuevas Ideas, has a large majority. Sixty-two legislators voted for the law today, and 16 voted against.Maybe this is one reason why the price is going up in the last 24 hours? it's now climbing above $18k.So yeah, this could be a welcoming news for everyone. And again, El Salvador never ceases to amaze us with this bitcoin adoption.",

And again, El Salvador never ceases to amaze us with this bitcoin adoption.I don't think bitcoin is bullish on this news, although it is notable news from El Salvador. Today US CPI will be released, and all predictions are optimistic, so it is possible that the market reacted before the official news was released, bitcoin has done this before with CPI news. If CPI is released and stays as low as predicted, we are likely to see an even stronger rise in bitcoin in the short term. Not only cryptocurrencies, but also the stock market had a bit of a recovery at the same time.",

Recent investment decisions seemed to \"play safe\" and therefore, high-risk assets like Bitcoin have been sold. But now, high-risk assets are getting more attractive again. Very likely to see more money being poured again in BTC soon. After making some losses, El Salvador really deserves it to be a bit less unlucky and timing is looking good currently. Well, losses are only losses if you finally sell and if El Salvador will HODL, even their initial Bitcoin investment could see some considerable returns. At least, timing for Bitcoin Bonds seems to be better this time. It's always a bit of luck, too.",

Maybe the world markets have not reached the bottom, but it is obvious that a good part of investors have just started betting on this option, part of the investments are also going towards Bitcoin, which results in an increase in the price.",

However I am little sceptical about the bond. El-Salvador is a very small country without any significant GDP. So whatever bonds they will release, they will have to honour it in future. Unless we see a significant upward movement in bitcoin price, not sure how are they going to honour the bond repayment commitments. Bitcoin is super volatile.
