  "content": "Bitcoin is all about creativity, research and innovation and it all begins right from the start of a positive thinking mind, Satoshi Nakamoto had thought about how to create and bring in something new that could be acceptable to the world which is the bitcoin success today and now in our own capacity we could make lots of creativity out from using bitcoin logo into varieties of display materials for showcase of skills this upcoming annual event of \"Halloween\" this October, this has prompted me to bring this Â awareness to beginners and help section where we could also get alot of interesting participants from junior member rank upwards who can be able to post images and participate in  ðŸŽƒ [ANN] Bitcointalk Bitcoin Pumpkin Carving Contest ðŸŽƒ but note that this is not a persuasion or compulsive effort to engage participants into participating but to identify and appreciate those who will find pleasure with the display of their creative skills in bitcoin art work for this year Halloween event, I actually thought about the other signature campaign contest for Halloween at initial which is totally different from this  ðŸŽƒ [ANN] Bitcointalk Bitcoin Pumpkin Carving Contest ðŸŽƒ which is specially targeted and Â designed for Bitcoin Halloween experience.I chose to post this here after considering the number of newbies and established members that visit the beginners and help section on daily basis that if you're a beginner/established member that has interest to showcase your creative art, graphics or painting skills through this year Halloween day coming up end of this October, then the Â 2022 Bitcointalk Bitcoin Pumpkin Carving Contest is an arena for your bitcoin talent display this Halloween contest season, you can also purchase a \"copper membership\" as a newbie to aid your ability to post an image through  Newbies can now pay a small fee to enable images by paying a little fee for such permission to be granted in other to access the function of posting images while been a newbie, let show some love and make fun in this halloween season with our creativity in display with Bitcoin.",

The pumpkin contest was not restricted to any particular set of people (at least, none that I know of).Like you aptly observed, the Halloween contest is just a mean for more talents to sprout and if you are lacking inspiration on what to create with the Bitcoin logo, that https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416347.0 would have been the best place for you. Unlike peeps like me who doesn't have any creative bone in my body, it helped me appreciate the numerous abilities bitcoiners on here are gifted with.",

There's nothing should be discussed anymore and actually it's just for fun, you don't need to be a good artist or crafter to join the contest.@OP you should lock this thread to prevent other users to spam in this thread, I see you're active login in this forum.Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on November 21, 2022, 09:56:48 AMThe contest is already over now and what is trending now is the bitcointalk community award https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422131.0 you can go there and cast your vote to all your suitable members you feels are deserving for each category award.
