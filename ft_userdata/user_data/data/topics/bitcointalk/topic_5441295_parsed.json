Seed phrases existed for a number of years before BIP39 was published. The aim of BIP39 was to standardize the process of generating the seed phrase and turning the seed phrase in to a wallet. It has largely achieved that given that the majority of wallets now follow BIP39, but there remains one notable exception being Electrum seed phrases (which predate BIP39 seed phrases).",

      "body": "What o_e_l_e_o said about Electrum being an exception shouldn't put you off from using that software if you want to. There is nothing wrong with Electrum or its native seeds. In fact, they have slightly more entropy (call it security) than a BIP39 seed. Either standard is fine. The difference is you have fewer options to recover an Electrum-native seed outside of Electrum, while BIP39 seeds are accepted by most wallets.Electrum seeds have one advantage when you recover a wallet (in Electrum). By entering your seed words, the software automatically knows what type of wallet it needs to recover (legacy, nested, or native segwit). With a BIP39 seed, you need to point the software towards the correct derivation path and provide information about the type of addresses you want to recover. If you do it wrongly, the software can recover what looks like an empty wallet, making you think you don't have any coins or you made a mistake backing up your recover phrase.",

But the password itself is not enough to communicate with the blockchain, you need a piece of software or a wallet to facilitate this task. The magic is that your \"password\" or seed phrase is universally accepted by all these different types of wallets, which means you can use almost whatever wallet you wish to interact with the bitcoin blockchain. At the very least, it is very convenient for the end user since he doesn't need to care for compatibility issues. What makes compatibility possible in the first place? BIP39. It describes an approach to key creation, how and why wallets should interpret the set of words you feed them, and wallets follow it to be compatible with the standard and one another.",

But Bitcoin Core still doesn't use BIP39 seeds for example, only BIP32 ones in WIF format.is BIP39 is a development from BIP32?, if yes, why they don't continue their development about vulnerability or weakness which was shown by electrum?.QuoteA fixed wordlist is still required. Following our recommendation, BIP39 authors decided to derive keys and addresses in a way that does not depend on the wordlist. However, BIP39 still requires the wordlist in order to compute its checksum, which is plainly inconsistent, and defeats the purpose of our recommendation. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that BIP39 proposes to create one wordlist per language. This threatens the portability of BIP39 seed phrases.BIP39 seed phrases do not include a version number. This means that software should always know how to generate keys and addresses. BIP43 suggests that wallet software will try various existing derivation schemes within the BIP32 framework. This is extremely inefficient and rests on the assumption that future wallets will support all previously accepted derivation methods. If, in the future, a wallet developer decides not to implement a particular derivation method because it is deprecated, then the software will not be able to detect that the corresponding seed phrases are not supported, and it will return an empty wallet instead. This threatens users funds.https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/seedphrase.html",

The developers of BIP39 decided they were not severe enough to need addressed, but now we frequently see users unable to track down their wallets due to unknown derivation paths or script types.And now that BIP39 is so ubiquitous, they cannot address them without introducing an entire new seed phrase system which would be incompatible with existing seed phrases.",

Translating the words will result in an entirely different wallet being generated, even if the words represent the same underlying entropy.You can try this yourself in Ian Coleman. Open it up and generate a seed phrase in any language. Then click \"Show entropy details\". Then choose a different language. It will \"translate\" your seed phrase while keeping the same word index numbers, but the resulting keys and addresses will be completely different.",
