And that helicopter crash that killed 3 school kids...Ukraine: Is the Hammer About to Fall?https://www.globalresearch.ca/ukraine-hammer-about-fall/5805101The plan to engage Russia militarily is a tacit admission that the United States can no longer maintain its global dominance through economic or political means alone. After exhaustive analysis and debate, western elites have settled on a course of action aimed at dividing the world into warring blocs in order to prosecute a war on Russia and China. The ultimate strategic objective of the current policy, is to tighten the grip of western elites on the levers of global power and to prevent the dissolution of the \"rules-based international order.\" But after 11 months of nonstop warfare in Ukraine, the US-backed western coalition finds itself in a worse position than when it began. ...One of the biggest surprises of the current war, is simply the lack of preparedness on part of the US. One would assume that if the foreign policy mandarins decided to “lock horns” with the world’s biggest nuclear superpower, they would have done the necessary planning and preparation to ensure success. Clearly, that hasn’t happened. US policymakers seem surprised by the fact that the economic sanctions backfired and actually strengthened Russia’s economic situation. They also failed to anticipate that the vast majority of countries would not only ignore the sanctions but proactively explore options for “ditching the dollar” in their business transactions and in the sale of critical resources....",

      "body": "The question always is, which way is the hammer going to fall? There are several directions it could fall. It depends on the winner, and who the winner really is. Obviously, the hammer has fallen already for a bunch of soldiers in both Russia and Ukraine.Now the hammer appears to be lifted for many peoples of the whole world. Will the hammer fall and squash them? Or will it fall because the hammer holder simply dropped it.In other words, the Ukraine war isn't a war between Ukraine and Russia. Rather, it's a war where certain global elite are trying to take over the world. And it's a war where God is determining if now is the time to release Satan from the abyss for judgment.What the US did in WW2 is to conquer Europe. And they used Russian strength to do much of the conquering for them, especially in Germany. This time it is Russia with it's back to the wall. And its loose-allies are watching to see how she will fare.A Russian Victory in Ukraine Won't End the Warhttps://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/01/no_author/a-russian-victory-in-ukraine-wont-end-the-war/While the information from the front remains sketchy, some analysts think that Russia is planning to send its troops and armored units northward in order to block vital supply-lines and trap Ukrainian forces in the east. A Russian blitz northward would likely be synchronized with the movement of a second large grouping pushing south along the Oskil River. These two dagger-like thrusts would be accompanied by multiple missile strikes aimed at strategic bridges and railway-lines crossing the Dnieper River. If the Russians were able to succeed in such an operation, the bulk of Ukraine's army would be effectively encircled in the east while Moscow would have regained control over most of its traditional territories. The offensive might not end the war, but it would end Ukraine's existence as a viable, contiguous state. This is an excerpt from an article at Aljazeera:Moscow's forces are pushing towards two towns in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhia region, where fighting intensified this week after several months of a stagnant front… Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the region, said offensive actions were concentrated around two towns: Orikhiv, around 50km (30 miles) south of Ukrainian-controlled regional capital Zaporizhzhia, and Hulyaipole, further east….The Russian army later claimed for a second day in a row that it had taken \"more advantageous lines and positions\" after \"offensive operations\" in the Zaporizhia region…. In its daily report on Sunday, the Ukrainian army said \"more than 15 settlements were affected by artillery fire\" in Zaporizhia…. He also said this week that fighting has \"sharply increased\" in the southern region.\" (\"Russia advances towards two towns in Ukraine's Zaporizhia region\", AlJazeera)...HALT THIS CRAZY RUSH TO ALL-OUT WARhttps://ericmargolis.com/2023/01/halt-this-crazy-rush-to-all-out-war/Besotted by tribalism and propaganda, we often forget why we are fighting and what changes the current war will bring. We think killing fellow humans is a noble quest rather than the basest Stone Age behavior.Case in point, the current war in Ukraine. There, ex-Russians now rebranded \"Ukrainians\" are battling Russia's not so competent armies.The United States and its vassals are pouring arms and money galore into the rebellious Ukraine – over $100 billion to date. This is an amazing amount of money considering hardly anyone in the US had ever heard of Ukraine and certainly couldn't find it on a map, and that this flood of money comes from the US which is itself on the financial ropes and operating on borrowed money.Getting America so deeply involved in the obscure Ukraine War was thanks to truly monumental propaganda produced by the six US government-controlled TV channels and court newspapers. Its 24-7 happy news about Ukraine and constant vilification of re-demonized Russia.We are in fact involved in a war that dares not speak its name. Russia denies it's a war at all and claims to be fighting a recrudescence of Euro fascism. The US and its subservient allies also deny a war is going on, while pouring arms and munition on an almost WWII scale into Ukraine – whose government the US spent $5 billion overthrowing....",

The global wealthy elite don't care about the people, except that there enough of them alive to fleece in the future.The little picture of what is happening in Ukraine, itself has little to do with what the elite wealthy globalists are doing. Rather, it's a method that they are using to deceitfully make it look like Russia is the bad guy.",

Ukraine might just be divided into pieces where some parts of it are going to be taken by neighboring countries like Poland and Hungary. But hey Ukraine is winning says the media. It's gonna get worse if the tanks that Germans and all others are trying to contribute reach Ukraine. Of course, Russia will be threatened, and to prevent an attack on thier land they will rather shoot those tanks.",

The commentator and your interpretation is biased to the point of fakeness Germany has accepted to allow other to export certain weapons to Ukraine in an effort to end the war as soon as possible and with an acceptable result for Ukraine. . The export of weapons by non-combatant countries is generally allowed under the rules of law, it is only that Germany has been very reluctant to do so before because they do not want to completely destroy any future relation with the bear.",
