My guess is that we need to wait a little longer for this to happen, and this could coincide with the start of the bull market in 2024, although if Bitcoin continues to rise now, then perhaps the bull market for Bitcoin has already begun.",

As the largest institutional Bitcoin investors are in the US. Furthermore it will promote Bitcoin adoption in a country which has, historically, been pushing against Bitcoin (albeit unsuccessfully ).And yes, the other members in the forum that told you that the approval of an ETF is only a matter of time are completely right. It is now only a matter of time as there are no more hurdles in the path of a Bitcoin ETF. The main speculation is WHEN. Thats what this hype and current pump is all about.",

They'd milk the fuck out of this cow first before they sell it off the market for scrap meat. They've been biding their time all this time and it's particularly suspicious that Gary Gensler couldn't talk about what's going to happen to bitcoin ETFs after the prior ones. I don't know just might be the skeptical in me but I just can't picture in my head a world where he doesn't know what's going to happen to bitcoin ETFs from here on out. In any case, I don't really count on this ETF or whatever for bitcoin's price increase, it's a little fickle for me and we needed something more sustainable if we want to have something like the 2020s where everything outright pumped out of control.",

Of course, spot ETFs will help drive Bitcoinâs value higher and might even create a threshold of resistance, which will be good for all of us, but this isnât the only way Bitcoin will go up.Bitcoin is a sophisticated currency. Itâs the first of its kind in many ways. Its independence and potential for growth are why these institutions want to get a piece of the pie, but that wonât be the start or end of anything.Those who continue to hold their investment in Bitcoin will continue to benefit as it grows in value.

I have always known that the market will not make any major move without those manipulations because that is how the big guys take their position or liquidate their assets. To them, it is all a game. First it was a wrong tweet from Cointelegraph and now Blackrock ETF listing even when approval, by SEC, have not been granted. Anyone who can connect the dots will know what this is all about. It has become very difficult knowing what next for the market as the momentum from these events seems to be fading away. One thing that is certain is that next year will be great for Bitcoin irrespective of what happens now. The present developments in the market might just be the big players taking position and we should follow them in the game so we are not left behind.",

Liquidity crises in banks can also be influenced by other factors, such as the issue of bankruptcy in a country which causes panic among customers to make large withdrawals and other factors. In essence, the SEC and the world's top economic regulators are looking for a loophole, if they get it then ETFs and bitcoin will be legally accepted.Gold has long been a currency as well as an investment, but after the fiat currency system was created, gold was replaced and only became an investment asset, as well as Bitcoin, which has only been a safe haven investment until now. There is still fear from the system controllers that fiat currencies will be disturbed by Bitcoin and gold. Therefore, the SEC as the front guard must be careful in determining anything that has the potential to damage the system.*This is just my personal opinion, and may be wrong and without proper data arguments.",
