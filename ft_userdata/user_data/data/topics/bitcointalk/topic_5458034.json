You will see no enough fund.Another reason is when you import an address on a wallet and you want to send the bitcoin on the address. You will see the error too because it is a watch only wallet.",

There are a lot of scammers out there who will promise you huge profits in order to convince you to send them money that you might never have the chance of getting back. If you are planning on sending the money to a company claiming to be expert's in crypto trading I will advice you proceed with caution because they are likely to be scammers.",

      "body": "Wait a sec! Are you saying you just downloaded the wallet like some random or specific wallet and tried to hit send money option while there is no money. Please do not mind me but this is the most funny thing I have read. No offense I mean no disrespect just saying. I think you are not just new to this forum but also new to crypto sphere too. And do not know how block chain, transactions and wallets works. Well there are so much threads that I could recommend you but I will first make it easy for you by mentioning some basic summary I have in my mind.You have to buy some token using your real money like us dollar or any national currency you are using and that currency in short known as fiat currency.how will you buy that token? Ways are too many but a good one would only be mentioned I would know in which country you live because Bitcoin ATMs are not available everywhere but one thing is p2p (person to person or peer to peer) it depends on you how you take it. In this you handover your money to some middle exchange like maybe Binance and then the other person will handover tokens to you and deal will be done. No doubt as a newbie p2p becomes so hard don't suggest by watching a video from YT will help you a lot. which exchange or middle source to use for p2p is depend on the availability of exchanges in your country.Once you bought your tokens from any exchange then you can send it into your any wallet like wallets are mainly of two types SoftwareHardware wallets and the types and features are many and different respectively.I suggest you to read the following thread provided :[1]. Bitcoin Wallet for Android[2]. [General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?[3]. Wikipedia[4]. id.gadge-info[5]. bitcoin.org[6]. electrum.org[7]. wallet.mycelium.com[8]. Ratimov: WasabiWallet.io | Open-source, non-custodial Bitcoin Wallet for desktop[9]. HUSNA QA: BITCOIN CORENote* I directly copied the source of thread from the post of yudio9",

Quote from: smschier on June 29, 2023, 05:40:26 PMI don't see anywhere that it allows me to add funds.You should tell us what that wallet is because maybe you're using a wallet that's integrated with an exchange and you can do the transaction from there if you wanna load up that wallet. But if not, there's no other way from adding funds to that wallet and all you need to do is to buy it from exchanges, p2p or centralized exchanges as mentioned.

I think newbies should prioritize learning before action it can definitely be very helpful for you guys.Well you can fund you wallet through several ways you can do that through peer to peer and that's giving someone Fiat or any medium of exchange you guys reach and then they send you Bitcoin, make sure you employ an excrow to ensure the safety of the deal. Or you can buy Bitcoin and other crypto-currency from an exchange. There are Decentralized and centralized exchanges you can choose from.",

I prefer using decentralized exchanges for privacy reasons. Once you have successfully bought the bitcoins, you can transfer the bitcoins to your wallet (preferably a non-custodial wallet) and you can make your transactions.",

Aside that, you can simply fund your wallet with your card if you're in a country that accepts bitcoin  in countries where bitcoin  isn't accepted,  I think there are options to find ones wallet with either vouchers or code without having any cryptocurrency related words in your transaction descriptions to avoid trace or tracking the transaction. You can also use exchanges and personally I think exchanges are easy and simpler to use and as a newbie, you should start from there and maybe learn from there.",

If you don't like that option, you can explore non-KYC exchanges listed here: Current list of exchanges without KYC. The original poster (OP) of that thread is Ratimov.You can add funds to your account using credit cards, bank accounts, or other available methods offered by the exchanger you have chosen.Additionally, you can also engage in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, where you ask a \"peer\" to send bitcoin to your address. In exchange, you'll pay them using methods like PayPal, altcoins, or others based on your agreement.Once you have successfully received bitcoin(s) in your wallet, you will need the bitcoin (BTC) address of the person or company to whom you'll be sending your bitcoin(s). Simply click on 'send,' enter their BTC address, and confirm the transaction.Good luck! Don't hesitate to ask any questions if you need further assistance with bitcoin related matters.",
