Why the hell does someone pay 154$ to be a club member when they need to pay their hard-earned money to other members? I can not find it appealing. It's hard to earn money and you want others to join your imaginary club which will not bring any benefits to their members at all. Is that a charity club? If it is then why you introduced an MLM system to your members?",

Because If you invite other people it means you do contribution for the club and you should get some reward for that action.We want to meet in luxury places so anyone whos owner of Luxury resorts like MA-R LAGOS TRump ...lol then you can join for Free.We don't have higher joining prices because many great people want to join but they don't have financial means but we know that person true wealth is not their Job or how much money they have in their pocket but the true wealth is all about their mindset.The world is unfair many great and with loyal mindset people have to work with low paying jobs they have no true friends and they cant realise their true life goals but If they join with us we make them to connect together with others brothers and sisters.And Im sure we will have some very good looking girls as our members and good looking guys so you could even find the husband for life.",

Referral system as it is.You don't have to reqruit other members but you can do so and then you deserve reward for your extra efforts.We follow also to universal laws the law of attraction included.If the Membership is higher there might be problem because many people who are loyal and with great mindset can't join they just don't have financial means but it's all about your genes and DNA you might be with right mindset but you have been born in poor family or wrong envoirement so the Elite Club Will connect you to people and you access to resources.So once they join it's like \"Cheat Code\" or \"short cut\" in their lifes. once you join all you need just little money and right mindset you need to be good person with brotherood or sisterhood mentality.For example: the city Atlanta in USA once use to be poor now its booming because people started working together there is alot good music producer aswell the population there use to be poor and without resources but it's different situation there now the streets are full of nice cars and business is booming ( it's results of great mindset of great people)We the the Elite Club will work together we do business together and each member knows If he or she will be not loyal or true the Membership status will be lost it's like the ADAM and EVE was kicked out from paradise, just follow the rules be honest and loyal and you have good life. Im sure many people by now have suffering enough so they have more respect towards the better life opportunity.Every activity is over looked by Club Admin so Admin will also judge If there is issues between the members the administration of Elite Club are wise and smart they can deal with any issues and make the fair judgemnt.",

Also we Will have confidential secret request department* where you send out your request and once there is match you can connect other who's got the same request as you  It sounds like dream but Im sure many of you want to live life without boundaries the limitless life when every possibility could be realised.The fun Will only start once we got on board more interesting people with different jobs and occupations you could make your wildest dream into real your Brain will start produce the \"happy chemical extraxts\" your life become like birthday everyday.",

But this one could be even better  Speciaially with our secret request message box becouse there is always in the world someone who want same things as you  you just need to find those people.We don't judge anyone we all are unique with our own ways.And this one is not about some weird occult religion it's about to connect people and help each other and make our lifes better and more interesting.  It's a order of higher powers and Im just the tool of higher powers it's not easy work to manage all that but at the end it will give great feeling.We are looking for members now who could become higher ranks aswell so to help to manage and judge over others you need to have good wisdom of life and wise person off course loyal and highly respectful and sure you can earn good income.Anyone who stay loyal and contribute to the club can reach to higher ranks aswell specially those ones who do some good things like helping out other members with something or do some good things on the name of our elite club who will undermine their own selfishness and ego sometimes and do what is good for the club.",

No, you might be trying the law of attraction or another magic trick but you should keep in your mind that members of this forum are smart enough to notice a scam and whatever you're trying to promote is totally a scam and a Ponzi scheme.
