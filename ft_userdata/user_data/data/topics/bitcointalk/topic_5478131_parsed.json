We profit from advertisements and donationsOur site also has special rules and laws, so do not rush to judge us or complain about your good opinion of usCan you prove you are not by showing us exactly what you do and how you do it and how long you have been doing it?Its always easy to claim to be who you are not until its time to walk in the shoes of one who you aren't. I have learnt to believe more in the actions of people than in their words as not everyone is able to deliver on their words said but if you behold an act, you will for a fact know that the person has the competence to carryout that particular activity.So, give us more than just words of identification and let us in on how you have ran the Coin Pot for as long as it existed citing the quoted thread.",

The original website address was COINPOT.CO and you are using the same address but changing .cc instead of .co, what can we call this? Isn't this phishing?You could have chosen any other name or at least told people that you are not the original COINPOT service, but this way you presented it in the topic made all members think that you are a scammer.",

This is my first time seeing a service using a clickbait this way.Just take the suggestions from the members above. Change your name (at least make it distinct) or distance yourself from other services unless you want to get tagged as some impersonator.",
