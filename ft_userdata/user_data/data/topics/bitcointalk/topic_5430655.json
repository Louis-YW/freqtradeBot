The location of the configuration file will depend on your operating system and the way you installed Bitcoin. On Windows, the configuration file is usually located at %APPDATA%\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin.conf. On Linux, it is usually located at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf.Add the following lines to the configuration file, replacing username and password with the RPC username and password you want to use:rpcuser=usernamerpcpassword=passwordSave the configuration file and restart your Bitcoin node. The RPC username and password will now be active and can be used to authenticate RPC requests to your node.It is important to use a strong and unique password for your RPC password to protect your node from unauthorized access. You should also ensure that your configuration file is secure and only accessible by authorized users.",

Not very secure ones, though; I hope these are just placeholders.Quote from: Ahmadn111 on December 28, 2022, 01:24:51 AMThe other thing is do I have to run bitcoind from the command line.  I'm working on version 22 of Bitcoin Core.  ThanksYou could also install Bitcoin-Qt if you prefer a GUI.Link for Linux GUILink for Windows 10Link for macOS",

Then, get this python script from Bitcoin Core repository: rpcauth.py, and run:Code:$  python3 rpcauth.py <username> <password>(replace the arguments accordingly)This will return:Code:String to be appended to bitcoin.conf:rpcauth=<username>:<long_number_in_hex>Then, add the following line to your bitcoin.conf, and restart Core.

Additionally, for getting query from external ip you can use \"0.0.0.0\" in rpcallowip field. Dont use any other ip as everything else maybe insecure.Do not use RPC over the internet. The username and password are sent in cleartext HTTP without any certificate. At the very least, make your own HTTPS endpoint that just forwards the JSONRPC to your own node.Quote from: JamesByrom on December 29, 2022, 09:59:38 AM~It would be nice if you marked this post as AI-generated, thanks (it was made by ChatGPT).",
