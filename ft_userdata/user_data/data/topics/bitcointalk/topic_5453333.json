While only a few countries recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, it becomes challenging to raise awareness in other countries where Bitcoin is not accepted due to various restrictions. Nonetheless, those of us who are familiar with Bitcoin can still promote awareness by sharing information with our family and close friends, even in situations where the government does not accept it.",

Needless to say that if you find someone interested in BTC because it is a censorship resistant and permissionless currency, you should educate them about it, and if they have understood that aspect well, they can then learn how BTC is an asset or investment.",

Bitcoin involves money and it is certainly the hardest thing to try and convince people on. The stereotype about everything investment been done online are likely Ponzi schemes will be hard to eliminate from some people most people in rural areas, couple with the fact that bitcoin is a volatile asset. Quote from: The Cryptovator on May 19, 2023, 05:48:00 PM While only a few countries recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, it becomes challenging to raise awareness in other countries where Bitcoin is not accepted due to various restrictions.This is another big obstacle to bitcoin awareness. There are people that only trust what is under the regulations of the government only, so inviting people to something that government has portrayed bad is definitely going to be hard. Furthermore it is also risky to create public awareness to bitcoin in countries in which it is restricted or banned. I would just say, talk to close relative about it and do not force any one into it and allow things unfold",

Also, in these current days, the rate of Bitcoin investors is increasing every year, which means that the publicity of Bitcoin is even better nowadays compared to five or eight years ago. Again, bitcoin knowledge is not just what people can learn in a hurry; otherwise, there will be some mistakes by people misplacing their seed phrase or even losing their bitcoin to hackers and scammers. Currently, there are a lot more people introducing Bitcoin education to their children, and some Bitcoiners are also going to schools to educate students about Bitcoin. Some universities are also accepting Bitcoin payments, which is helping Bitcoin publication and adoption compare to how slow it was before. Lastly, some business are also adopting Bitcoin payment.",

In reality, not all people in the world have not only access to the Internet, but even permanent electricity. Bitcoin can't be used without both (we will not consider exotic solutions due to the non-mass application). So, even with all the desire, not all people on Earth will be able to learn about the existence of bitcoin, and even more so, use it. Of course, you can talk about bitcoin orally, but what will be the use of this? I guess none. Not everyone will be able to buy bitcoin either, because a lot of people are below the poverty line and purely physically will not be able to do this. Unless, of course, these are 385,000 children a day, not only in rich families, but at least in families with prosperity, above poverty.So it turns out that awareness alone will not be enough.

I can still understand this, because it took a long time for bitcoin to be accepted by everyone and all groups. Currently, there are still many people who are afraid to try bitcoin. Because there seems to be too much fear on their minds. Especially where I live now, people are still unfamiliar with digital investment, especially bitcoin. Even other digital investments, such as digital gold, in my area not many people know about it. If I pay attention, all of that can happen, due to a lack of knowledge about digital-based aspects. Therefore bitcoin still sounds very foreign to many people, and that also includes people in the area where I live.And teaching family or relatives about bitcoin, in my opinion, is also not an easy thing. Because if they don't know about the world of digital business before, they tend to ask long questions, and it takes quite a long time to make them understand. But that doesn't mean everyone acts like that. Surely there are also many people who have immediately opened their minds, when given information about bitcoin. So basically you are right, that awareness plays an important role in progress in the field of bitcoin investment or bitcoin adoption. Even if someone already understands and understands, if there is no sense of awareness about bitcoin, they definitely won't want to invest in bitcoin.",
