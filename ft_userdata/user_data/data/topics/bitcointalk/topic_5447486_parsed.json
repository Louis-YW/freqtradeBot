I will prefer to use open source indicator like Aegis instead which I can even backup without necessarily using QR code which is meant for import.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 04, 2023, 04:35:00 AMGoogle authenticator is necessary anti scam device that helps to lock wallets or transactions process.Authenticators are not anti scam device, they are applications. Also the word anti-hack would be better, not anti-scam app. It does not also lock wallet, it makes your account or wallet you used it for to request for a code to broadcast a transaction. Without the TOTP six digit code, the transaction will not broadcast, but it does not lock the wallet.But if using it for a custodial wallet or an exchange, possibly there may be a warning that you have certain number of times that you can use a wrong code before the wallet is locked for 24 hours, but that is done by the exchange or custodial wallet.

You voluntary handing over your coins to scammers because you believe them, but hackers find a way to hack your wallet. So anyone that fall victim of scam will even send a coin to scammer without the scammer hacking into his wallet. Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 04, 2023, 04:35:00 AMPut a similar name you're using at your trading apps, create password for it, then activate.If you used the QR code generated by the wallet, the name would automatically be generated and will likely be the name of the wallet or exchange. I will prefer the way you explained it and input the name that I like.Note: it is very important that your 2fa app should not be on the device your accounts and wallets you are using it for are, they should be on a separate device.",

Because I am saving Bitcoin using electrum and I don't see anything that it has a google authenticator that needs to be used.Also, as far as I know, it can only be used in centralized exchanges if you have a trading activity, not on electrum, I don't know if trust wallet also has these features, but it doesn't seem to be there either.",

Whenever you want to make a transaction from your electrum 2FA wallet, your transaction has to be signed by a third party called trustedcoin. For asking trustedcoin to sign your transaction, you should enter the 2FA code.

Google Authenticator or any 2-factor authentication application does not provide us anti-scam service. Those applications provide us a protection against digital thieves who can make our devices infected and steal our identity, login information then steal our money. It's thief, not scam!Google is close source and in cryptocurrency, choose open source. With 2FA application, choose Aegis.Aegis Authenticator, a decent alternative to Google Authenticator and AuthyQuoteFirst, go to play store and download it Don't go to app stores and search for applications then download them. Did you know that many fake applications are there in those app stores especially in Google Play Store to make your devices infected?Go to official websites and get links to download applications.Bitcoin wallets mostly don't provide 2FA. Mostly 2FA is available for online accounts that are risky.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsElectrum wallet has 2FA but you have to pay addition fee for each transaction to Trustedcoin, a third party provides 2FA feature for Electrum.With most of Bitcoin wallet softwares, you can set up multi-sign wallets. Rather than a single wallet with single signature, you will have 2nd, 3rd co-signers which are likely 2FA for your wallet.",

Because GA is one of the two factor authentication tools that can be used to increase the security of bitcoin assets. By using this tool, we will be asked to enter a unique code generated by the Google Authenticator application every time we log into the centralized trading application. The unique code changes every few seconds, making it difficult for unauthorized persons to gain access to centralized trading applications.By using Google Authenticator or other two-factor authentication tools, we can ensure that only we can access our centralized trading and protect our assets from possible security threats. But this Google Authenticator only exists in centralized trading wallets, in bitcoin wallets like Electrum and blue wallets which as far as I know there is no Google Authenticator.",

Because they can be integrated with Google Authenticator. Quote from: Amphenomenon on April 05, 2023, 03:42:48 PMCan Google Authentication be hacked? Hackers always found vulnerabilities in your activities and the device you are using. Like if you have clicked on some spammy and phishing links then there is slight chances that you must have given your access to the hackers and once your device is compromised no google authenticator can save your assets as google authenticator's code is placed in your smartphone. So best practices is to use a different device to use your 2FA google Authenticator to increase security so if one device got hacked then yours's one could not and only use that device for this dedicated work of 2FA.",

When you set two factor authentication in a custodial wallet or an exchange, the service doesn't allow you to make a transaction or login to your account if you don't enter the correct 2FA code. We can have this feature only on custodial services, since they have full control over users fund. In a non-custodial wallet where you have access to your private keys, you have full control over your fund and we can't have two-factor authentication in the same way as a custodial wallet or an exchange. You can have a 2FA wallet in electrum as well, but as I said above, it works in a different way. Electrum 2FA wallet is a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet. This means that there are three private keys for each of addresses and 2 of them are required for making a tranaction. In a 2FA electrum wallet, one of master private keys is stored in the wallet file and one of them is owned by a third party called trustedcoin. When you want to make a transaction, you have to ask trustedcoin to sign the transaction for you. In electrum 2FA wallet, you have a seed phrase which can be used for deriving two of master private keys and disabling 2FA. So, you still have full control over your fund.",

Every system can be done with a reverse engineering by these hackers and we can't be sure that you're all protected mostly if you do nasty things through your computer or smart phone devices. Another 2FA is through phone/SMS, there have been simcard/sim swap hijacking that has been done by hackers and that's why if it's possible there to get reversed and hackers get those 2FA codes then even with GA, they'll need to target the actual user and not the app itself. That's why with information that's being monitored in almost every place, please be sensitive on how you share it publicly and avoid unnecessary downloading of apps.
