  "content": "Hello forum I would ask for your opinion in one thing.My friend invited me to use https://minepi.com a couple of days ago.And I checked it out a bit, but really did not understand the thing.He told me he this:\"Pi is now valued at around 24$/Pi, and will be trade able on Binance soon ! So even if you only mine 1 a day on your mobile that's over 700$/month for no work. Get mining, and get your family on it !\"\"A crypto you mine using your phone. I have been doing it for 4 years, and now have quite an amount. It costs nothing. Just use the link to download the app and click once a day to keep mining. It started as an alternative currency for transactions in an alt network, but they are going full crypto now. There are millions of users...\"When I asked how he cashed out the earnings he said \"you can cash out once the main net is up. It was planned for 2024 but the coin is doing well so it will be sooner.\"For me it looks way to good to be true but I don´t know anything about it. What I for sure know is that my friend don´t trying to fool me in anyway, but maybe he have get fooled and doing this?For me it sounds to good to be true when you mining with your phone fore free you just need to open the app and click on something once a day and you will be rewarded around $700 each month?!It really looks legit and everything but it sounds very good to make that amount for such a less effort. Many people in the world does not even make this money for a months work!",

The network has also requested that the listings be removed from these exchanges.After 5 years its community still believes that this is the next big thing in the Cryptocurrency industry but how can it be when its centralized and the developers have dubious characters even though they claimed to be Harvard graduates",

Their \"coins\" can't be exchangedanywhere making them worthless.Most are click bots that \"mine\" by clicking on advertising supported content like Youtube videosto generate revenue for the publishers. Those like Pi are the worst by using KYC to harvest informationfrom users.Real POW miners exist for smarthphones, but they mine some of the same coins as any CPU can,but at a small fraction of a real CPU's performance. They also face all the issues of POW like overheating.Mining on mobile devices should be avoided unless the device is expendable. They aren't designedto handle that much heat.You should not use the minepi.com mining application, it is most likely a scam.",

A POW consensus require a good amount of graphic cards and does consume a lot of electricity. POS is all about staking a fixed amount of native cryptocurrency in their recommended wallets. Some projects suggest POS a way of mining. According to my understanding it is incorrect and a way to scam newbies. Pi network ka already a controversial project. If you are following any projects related to this project then you will get scammed. That is why you should always do your own research. I have zero understanding about Minepi. I do know pi project is full of scam and it is better you stay away from it.",

Here is the official site of MinePihttps://minepi.com/Those early posters have their reason why MinePi is fake and not real and I agree with them, I used to mine this coin on my phone, but I stopped because there are a lot of flags, one of which is their being centralized and their mining algorithm is fake I disable their app because they are monetizing their users by posting ads on their mining page which is for me unethical they are making money out of their users' action.I don't know if they are still showing ads but I'm not looking back to mine because all they have are fake promises for their users.",

The coin doesn't make sense to me because many people have been mining the thing on their smartphones since 2018-19, even on of my cousins who isn't well aware about crypto-currencies is mining the shit-coin since 2019. The trap of the Pi network is so huge that most of the users who have submitted their KYC information aren't yet verified. They are just manipulating people with various IOU listings and that's attracting attention of more users into their network. I remember when the fake IOU was listed on some exchanges the price of that went above $280 a coin. And, everyone who had Pi in their wallet thought that they are going to be rich very soon. But the tug coin just made it fake to keep their customers using their app for mining and no one was able to deposit the coins to the exchanges.",

I noticed that most of the exchanges that listed it are quite known exchange and there is difference in price variation across the exchanges with a wide price margin of $17775 on one of the controversial exchange called atlanticex compared to other exchange which it was Listed. Another thing I noticed was that even with the claims that it is already listed on exchanges, one can not trade it as the deposit and withdrawal function are suspended but trade is going on so I was wondering who are those people trading it and accumulating trading volume on daily basis and why would they suspend deposit and withdrawal from the their members.All these put together made me have some doubt and I am skeptical about the whole stuff about it.",
