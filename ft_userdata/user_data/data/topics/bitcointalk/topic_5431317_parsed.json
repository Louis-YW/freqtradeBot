Quote from: xapirah15112 on December 24, 2022, 11:43:27 PMThe project has already been announced on this forum. That is good 👍So don't you think you need to tell us the name of the project so that we can help you with advise how to make it a successful one rather than depending on your own perspective alone. Apart from promoting your project, anyone can assist you with random ideas on how to push your project with investors that could yield better results than looking for referrals. Tender your ideas so we can give you some hints to facilitate your project growths. QuoteSimply put, we don't want to disclose the name in this post to the general public. Now we need a hustler to bring us actual users for our platform in exchange for $5000. This is why you need to bring it close to the forum for experts to give you some tangible opinion that cam yield better results than what your ideas of marketing could be. If your product is genuine then no one will force you to disclose the name and get going. Have a nice time here and Merry Christmas 🎄",

We will give specifics about our products. You should do your own research about our business after. Although we already had some users, marketing it took a lot of our time. Very time consuming for our team. We are here for the long run. We simply want to spend this money on our first market push with a professional who is skilled in doing it. We just want to be adopted by the market, and we know that there are some really skilled hustlers in this forum who can help us do that. We provided the following assurance to the marketer to make it secure. We will pay $250 if you can get us 25 users. We pay $250 for each batch of 25 users you refer. In addition, we'll give statistics on things like traffic, where it comes from. This is so that we can be transparent with the marketer. Regarding the marketing strategies. Where and how users arrived on our platform are irrelevant to our customers. On this, we are very confident. Simply put, we lack the skills and experience necessary to complete the task on our own. We want to pay someone who is very skilled at it for this reason. Message me on Bitcointalk. I'll give you my telegram number. That's where we can talk.  Then we offer more information.

Even though we could potentially lose money on this campaign, we don't care. Experiencing a previous marketing scam from a small company, our investor is quite frugal with money. Long-term user acquisition is something we're interested in, so we've hired people to do it for us.The current range of sold goods and services is $20 to $200. Since we also want competitive prices, we will probably lose money running this campaign.",
