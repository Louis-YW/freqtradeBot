Buying Bitcoin is not the only thing you can do; you can also earn it, mine it, and so on.Let's use you as an example: you are wearing a signature for which you are being paid in Bitcoin at the end of every week. What does that tell you? Let me put it this way: It's just as if you learned a skill, and right now you are being paid for the good skills that you have learned.So do you own those weekly-pay Bitcoins because you have money to buy them or because you worked for them?",

Without knowledge, money will have no use to a person. It is because he won't know how to spend that money effectively. He will lose that money fast and end up a poor man. The person with knowledge on the other and may be unlucky in life or had some other problems and somehow he just couldn't generate good money. This guy however has a chance to get rich in the future because he is a \"wise\" man. Sooner or later he will figure out the problem and get rid of it Once that happens he will go straight to the top.",

But having the knowledge of BTC and crypto and still have money to invest on them to enjoy the benefits that will make others people to show interest on BTC investment and crypto investment by look for ways to get the money to invest to test if what they learn is favourable or not.",

There will be another chance for you to catch another great spot to buy later once you have money as long as Bitcoin still exists. While you are waiting then depends on what knowledge you have you can just do some freelance to actually gather some money for buying Bitcoin, there are tons of ways to get that and you can definitely do it if you can give little bit effort to it. It's not that you miss once the opportunity, you will miss the entire thing and end of the world. There will be another chance for you, such as in 2017 and 2021 or maybe later?",

The knowledge of Bitcoin and Crypto-currency is very important, it can be your resources even when you do not have enough capital, it's knowledge about Crypto-currency that can actually make you understand other way you can use to build yourself here before you invest, it's knowledge that can help you recognize opportunity and also potentials traps here in the ecosystem, so it can very be undermined .",

Knowledge without application is knowledge wasted, but if all you think about in the application department is \"the profits\" then you've got it all wrong dude. Not every endeavor you take should be about money, there are other much more important things at life, and not everything should revolve around money. Even the very act of presenting and being active in this forum shouldn't always be about money (I know I'm wearing a signature, deal with it), Although I'm open to hear about your reasoning why you think \"not earning anything from what you do is a complete waste of effort.\" Profits are one thing to look for but it shouldn't be the main thing you're looking for especially since bitcoin is a multi-faceted venture with a lot of stuff to offer besides giving you money.",

If we properly apply our money and knowledge in tread i think it is possible to huge profit. Today's advancement of science and technology being possible for knowledge. Amazing Invention Blockchain we get for proper knowledge. So i couldn’t think knowledge is waste without money. Although it is also right money also a important subject.",

      "body": "There is this saying in my country that \"no knowledge is a waste.\" Yeah, it could be that one doesn't yet have the money at that moment, so let him or her get the knowledge first. Based on your topic, do you also suggest that having money without knowledge of Bitcoin is a waste of money? (LoL). Well, for me, I believe that it's better to get the knowledge even if the money is not yet there. So that anytime you have the money, it will be easier to just invest, know how to manage your risk, and secure your asset. Perhaps, if you have such knowledge, you can even educate someone else, and the person can invest with your help, and you get lucky and get a job that could now earn you the money to invest.For instance, let's say I learned how to produce paint with the hope to start my company one day, but there is not enough money to start the company, and luckily they are looking for someone to teach some students how to produce paint, and in that case, someone referred me, and after the training, a rich parents of one of those students decided to sponsor the start of my company under partnership. Things always turn up, learn the basics first. Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

      "body": "OP, I respectfully disagree with your point of view. Knowledge in itself has great value, even if it is not immediately accompanied by a financial benefit. Take classical education, for example. Studying subjects like literature, history, or philosophy may not directly translate into monetary gain, but it enriches our understanding of the world, enhances critical thinking skills, and broadens our perspectives. Similarly, knowledge about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency holds intrinsic value. But the true value lies in using that knowledge to make informed decisions and identify opportunities. It is through practical application that you can potentially benefit financially. Think about it. You can't just sit there twiddling your thumbs, expecting the cash to magically rain down. You gotta get out there and apply that brainpower of yours in the real world. Get those hands dirty, my friend! It's all about taking action and making things happen. You can have the brightest mind in the room, but unless you actually start using it to create something, you're not gonna see those BTC signs.",

You may be right but I don't think it is in all circumstances. money is one of the important tools that we need to survive and make a proper decision as human. If we have know and we don't have the money to bring our dream to reality, we can as well share our dreams with  reasonable people around us to help us and invest in our ideas to bring them to reality. This might be a difficult task to some people that had no one to talk to or share there ideas with. There are so many opportunities in the universe and most time getting to see the opportunity will need the help of people around us. This is one of the reasons why we need to share our ideas and our skills with people so when opportunity comes, it will not pass us bye.",

How? You will waste you money on useless things and will waste them by gaining no profits with them. That's why it will have zero value. And second thing is, even if you haven't money to buy the dip (which you really think is last dip and there will be none other in your thought) but have the knowledge of it, you still can make money by sharing the signals in paid groups, by teaching your strategies for money or you can become a crypto influencer, if you really have that much knowledge and grip.Point is, you should have the sense of taking benefit out of your knowledge not just cursing it or using it as an excuse that you have no money so you can not buy or get benefit from the dip or at any good entry point. Find ways to make money from the knowledge you have then use that money to buy the dip of which you have so much essence. I hope you will got my point",
