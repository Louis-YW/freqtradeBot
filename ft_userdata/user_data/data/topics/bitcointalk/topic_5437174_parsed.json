When you check the Peerwallet's API, you are able to buy directly choosing from multiple suppliers.Learn more at https://peerwallet.com/vcardThis is a very interesting project considering that users will be able to get more the best virtual card support directly from one platform. However, there are a few things that I have questions about:1. Is it regulated? because this relates to customer/investor money, so users need to know about the regulations of this platform.2. Is it really secure? considering that this will be used for many people's transactions, so security is the main thing, especially when you use plugins and APIs in the payment integration process.3. Does it require KYC? and how do you manage documents from users?4. Are there examples of payment platforms that you have worked with? or is this just a platform with a business model that has never worked at all?Quote from: fhr on January 29, 2023, 05:43:46 PMHow does it work? What are the funding options?From what I know from their website, it's very simple, they only provide a payment platform in which you will be able to get access to 300+ Payment Methods very easily from one platform and you can also become a funder and get profit from the rate that you set yourself for your funds.

Is KYC needed?I read their terms, and it's quite clear that users have to be prepared for KYC verification if they are to use the serviceThese are parts where they talk about KYC and AML policy.Quote from: https://peerwallet.com/termsKnow Your Customer (\"KYC\") policies and procedures for individual and institutional customers have been developed as part of Peerwallet's Compliance policies to enable the Company to have a reasonable belief that it is aware of the true identity of those of its customers for whom such review has been carried out. The company's employees, consultants, executives, owners, and directors all abide by the policy, which applies to all users of the platform.The following actions have been performed by Peerwallet as part of KYC & AML Compliance using a risk-based approach:The appointment of a Chief Compliance Officer with adequate knowledge and independence who is in charge of monitoring adherence to pertinent laws, rules, regulations, and industry recommendations;Establishing and upholding risk-based policies for customer due diligence, enhanced due diligence, and know your customer (KYC);Creating risk-based layers for user verificationUtilizing a variety of anti-fraud systems;Rule-based transaction monitoring;Analyses using various analytics including blockchain analytics;Quote from: https://peerwallet.com/policyData Collected in connection with “Know Your Customer” (KYC) Compliance, including:• Government-issued ID• Proof of Address• Photographs, if you elect to provide them to us• Video, if you elect to provide them to us",
