Anyways, hardship oo, bad economy oo, inflation (any one weh you wan call am), waiting for the right economy isn't the solution at all. The thing be say na bad economy even good pass good economy sef. As things are tight in the country, it'll make people wake up to the reality that the government and their minimum-wage jobs cannot secure their future or even pay for day to day bills. Everybody go begin to dey hustle, everyone would start being creative. Some would start learning, and investing in Bitcoin. Literally, I think the thing that brought BTC to our country was actually the hardship and people looking for a way out. So, thank God say this economic situation don teach you something.",

Because we all deserve a better life, our government should give us many things, such as opportunities to work and pay for education and other necessities.People struggle to feed in these countries because they have insufficient funds and excessive expenses. If there is a method, our government should do anything to improve the nation.",

Wetin me I know na hardshipMy brother the situation of the country is becoming terrible everyday. A lot of people are going through a lot, the worst part being that there is no hope in sight. The removal of fuel subsidy was a very wrong move for a government that just resumed power... they would have done extensive studies of the impact and plan on how to caution the effect. Quote from: EluguHcman on July 20, 2023, 09:25:17 PMAbeg make we no call d economy situation on ground inflation. Wetin me I know na hardshipIndeed the situation is hardship.... depression is getting serious o. I just pray this does not get to civil unrest. I know Nigerians are very resilient people but this one seems to be stretching them beyond the endurance limit. Starting this hardship again after surviving 8 years of Buhari torture of a government is not something I find funny.",

Whether na weakly or na peso wey over like money. How peso go call for nationwide strike today, the next day you don see am for Aso-Rock d laugh with the President, telling Nigerians sae the nationwide strike no go work again. The purpose wey you take go see the president sae, make em increase the minimum wage of civil servant to 100k naira due to hardship and the high cost of things, you no actualize am. You lock up for the whole matter till date. The stupid display wey the NLC chairman show to Nigerians makes me to remember Adams Oshimole when em NLC chairman during Obasanjo tenure. If na person like him for seat as NLC chairman, there would have been an immediate nationwide strike d day wey Tinubu announce the removal of fuel subsidy. What do you expect from a corrupt system? nothing. Almost everyone wey d on top of big positions for the country d corrupt. Wetin them sabi na for their pocket. Once wey big money don enter their pockets, anything we d masses like make them pass through for the country is non of their business. It's well sha for us all. We Nigerians are survival of whatever hardship the leaders of our country throw at us",
