Considering that you can only play a free roll once every hour, simple math suggests that it takes more than 416 days on average to get a 10,000 roll (assuming continuous play, 24 hours a day, which is practically impossible). However, this is an average estimation, as the outcome is ultimately dependent on luck due to the random nature of the game. This means that you may go for many years without winning even once, while someone else might be fortunate enough to win multiple times within a year.There is no script to help with this. Also, the use of any script for this purpose is prohibited on the freebitco.in site.",

Apparently it should be 1 in 10,000 but the system is set up so that 00000 and 10000 are half as likely to appear as the rest.I saw this explained quite some time ago in some thread and I am saying this from memory but I am pretty sure this is the case.Apart from this, you have to count the variance. Even if you have a 1 in 20,000 chance of getting the 10000, if you have negative variance, you can play 100,000 rolls or more without getting it.",

      "body": "LOL, you must be kidding. Such script doesn't exists and even if it would exist, do you really think that someone would give it to you? But in reality if such kind of scripts would exist, Freebitco.in simply would bankrupt because they would be losing too much money because of cheaters.Only way to roll 10 000 - don't cheat, roll every hour and maybe one day you will catch luck.Quote from: Agbe on July 14, 2023, 04:34:05 PMI just made research on the topical sentence and I came across this and if this is what you are looking for https://www.febspot.com/348268 I don't think your ambition is good.
