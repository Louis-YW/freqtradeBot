But we had some casinos with instant withdrawal feature which charge more fee and only process our transaction but they are the one sending funds to users so they won't be double spending them unless the site is scam.The process of withdrawal as of now withdrawal -> wait for approval -> onchain transaction (needs enough confirmation) -> balance will credit on the receiving end.",

The website will usually broadcast your transaction and that of others together, if they pay a high tx fee you'll get the BTC quickly into your address like every normal tx, if they use a low tx fee, you will have to wait for confirmation.",

Some take slightly long, while others take 1–3 minutes to broadcast the transaction. For example, when I am sending funds from exchanges like Binance, MEXC, Phemex. The transaction gets approved very fast as soon as i am done with approving the 2FA and email confirmation.I had a very good experience with bustadice too sometime back. There were no delays when you chose the instant withdrawal option.",

I know an online casino that applies Lightning Network to withdrawals and deposits, such as https://betplay.io. Withdrawals and deposits will be made quickly and at a reduced cost.

If using an Exchange the confirmation time is usually 1-3 minutes and it could be longer depending on how the Bitcoin network is doing. If there is a spike in transactions like a few months ago then confirmation will take longer and can even be more than 24 hours. However, instant transactions can be made using the P2P feature between internal exchanges.",

Just a correction. The bitcoin on the gambling site that you withdraw is on the blockchain. While as you send it, it remains on the blockchain. Only what happens is that the UTXO is spent and sent to your bitcoin address. In short, bitcoin is stored on the blockchain.Quote from: cafter on July 07, 2023, 07:11:57 PMmy question is what is the process of withdrawal on most of the sites, which is so fast and without any double spending or issue like that?If you are referring to sites, I do not know what this thread is doing on development and technical discussion. It supposed to be on service discussion. If you are referring to noncustodial wallets, transaction on noncustodial wallets are the fastest because it is your private key, unlike on centralized platforms that it is not your key. Any transaction made on noncustodial wallet is created by you. But any transaction you make on your account on centralized platform, it has to be authorized by the platform. So noncustodial wallet transaction are faster.",

As far as I know, most casinos use some form of payment provider that handles the actual transaction process. Usually it's just a piece of software that can be remote-controlled to create a transaction and send it away, to the user.But everyone knows that's not how fast withdrawals actually work, there's usually some other software running forensics on the account to make sure that it's not cheating, \"mixing coins\", doing arbitrage or any other shady stuff.",
