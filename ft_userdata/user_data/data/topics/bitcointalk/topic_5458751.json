There can't be any justification for that unless the person is waiting for the right price to strike it.Better still, one could DCA it. By doing that, more coins would be bought and I don't think such would ever miss out.",

Now youngsters are getting more involved in the market and crypto community which means the Alpha generation which still doesn't have stable financial status. Students and Youngsters only face this issue most of the time.Also, I think fear of another dump is also a very common reason for those who are recently jumping into the market because they are hoping for a big drop which in my view currently not possible at all. As the buddy above said they should learn about DCA.",

People have their personal reasons why they can't hodl which I know whenever it is the right time they will hodl. But I know The common reason why people don't hodl is because of financial challenge.",

      "body": "Since many people find investing in Bitcoin to be prohibitively expensive, there hasn't been much adoption of the currency. Additionally, the perceived danger brought on by Bitcoin's volatility could turn away potential investors.The financial literacies and cryptocurrency comprehension, however, should also be taken into account. The complexity of blockchain technology and the idea of cryptocurrency is something that a lot of people find difficult to understand, which can be intimidating for individuals without a technical background. The hesitation to invest in Bitcoin may also be influenced by this lack of knowledge.Regarding the financial restriction, it concerns both risk tolerance and the availability of funds to invest. People with unstable finances or limited resources might not feel comfortable putting their precious resources at risk on something as erratic as Bitcoin. This is a prime illustration of the wealth inequality gap: whereas those with discretionary money may afford to invest and take risks, those who are trying to make ends meet cannot.",

Hodling is not even a discussion when you lack the means to buy bitcoin. Signature campaigns is one of the ways one can earn bitcoins and grow their portfolio without investing. However, it is really difficult to hodl when you don’t have other source of income except signature campaigns. Ignorance and fear are mostly what deprives newbies from investing in bitcoin, they do not understand what bitcoin is and are scared of investing in a digital currency that’s not regulated. I think there are more people who in the world who still cling to the old systems and will only put their money in traditional investments like real estate, gold, stocks, bonds e.t.c. For those who are already in bitcoin, it’s a different story because they know the potential of bitcoin and they are engaged in the bitcoin ecosystem. There are different kinds of people in the crypto space, there are traders and there are investors. Traders do not necessarily believe they have to hodl long term to make profits, they usually have a trading plan that’s short term and gives them their target profit. While the other group which I call Investors, they are not interested in the risks associated with trading and only want to hodl for long term. Their plan is simple and safe.  Quote from: Obari on July 05, 2023, 06:22:17 PMAnd if you'll  agree with me that as a bitcoin enthusiast, we at some point believe  that after bitcoin  leaves this mess of instability,  then it should be aiming  for an all time high and no one would possibly  want to miss out of this intentionally if they have the means to buy.Bitcoin is a volatile currency and will never be stable. FOMO should not be the driving force for anyone to make an investment. I believe bitcoin will pump after the halving and historically it has followed that pattern, but there js no guarantee that bitcoin may reach a ATH next year.",

So anyone who wishes to start investing whether it's on crypto or gold or any other asset need to achieve financial stability prior to making an investment which is possible by start saving money and reducing everyday expenses by being disciplined,Once you saved decent money then you have to allocate it for investments which gives you a sense of control over your life and You can make decisions based on what you want to do, rather than what you have to do to make ends meet.",

Right now, Bitcoin is very bullish due to the ETF hype so there’s no logical reason to not hold Bitcoin at this time.I think most sellers is probably looking at 31K as a strong resistance since Bitcoin price failed to break this wall before. Price history can easily deceived weak hands to sell if they have a chance.",

However, waiting for another drop may not be beneficial because the price may not fall below $30k because we have less than six months till 2024 and we expect a halving then; so, the price of Bitcoin is expected to begin moving anytime soon.",

There is a need to change and adjust your budget to be able to cope with how expensive things have become.

We all know that the best way of buying bitcoin is buying low because it minimizes risk and maximizes the profit. But at a time like this where the market isn’t stable and the much awaited halving is approaching then it is better to buy whenever you have the funds, because you wouldn’t know maybe this could be the lowest price it can be for till then. The widely used method at this certain period of time is the DCA method, this can be done weekly till when you feel you have accumulated to your satisfaction. The method will save you from missing out due to waiting for the right price",
