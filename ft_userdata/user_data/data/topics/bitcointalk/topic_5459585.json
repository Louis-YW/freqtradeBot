QuoteCuriously, though, the US government appears to be selling Bitcoin on Coinbase, the very platform that the SEC considers an “unregistered securities exchange.”If you follow the recent news, you will find it more interesting that Coinbase's stock price has also increased sharply since they were sued by the SEC. That's strange, and Coinbase's market share has also increased sharply, in stark contrast to Binance.us, whose market share in the US has shrunk significantly. If the US government doesn't sell bitcoin on centralized exchanges, I don't really know where they can sell it because only centralized exchanges have massive liquidity.Quote from: ZAINmalik75 on July 13, 2023, 07:01:55 AMThe amount is huge and I think it will put some effect on the market too but the market is already opened before $30.6 as we can see, the market was opening around $30.6k in the last two days but today it opened around $30.3k which directly indicates the impact of this transaction and maybe this news didn't get that much hype which could create the fud so that's why the effect is lesser than before.

Recently the US government authorities showed interest in selling some assets which include bitcoins seized from a fraudster from my country. The Silk Road Bitcoin will be sold to pay the $183 million restitution fine placed on Ulbricht by the court in 2015. In auction sales, the highest bidder gets the opportunity to buy the lot. Maybe Coinbase was the highest bidder that was why the coins was sold to the exchange.

This year is an important year for every investor because of next year's halving so any price drop now is an ample opportunity to buy. This news will not cause FUD to well-informed bitcoiners.",

Such a duality of behavior can't go unnoticed and cause bewilderment. Oh, those double standards.Where does this information come from that the confiscated bitcoins was sold at a price below the market price?About the coins confiscated from the chipmixer, I suppose, we will not know soon. Coins from Silk Road are an example of this. How many years have passed since the events of that period, and this story is in no hurry to end.",

So US government has every right to liquidate these bitcoins which I believe they will do now. Nothing surprising in here. This is normal. Just like the other assets are liquidated, these bitcoins are probably going to end up in the same state. But I am more worried about the process of liquidation. If these are sold in the open market, that might bring down the price of bitcoin for some time. I just hope they will not sell it in the open market.",

The market is not only moving according to supply and demand, it is still being manipulated, and it is not too difficult for market makers to hype news to create panic in the market. But according to a news I read today, the US government has no intention of selling all those bitcoins at once, they will sell it between now and the end of the year and the number of bitcoins is up to 41k bitcoins, not just 10k bitcoins.",

There are times when people wonder why the government is not auctioning off those seized coins at a particular time when the price is high. When asked about this, Jarod Koopman, the director of the cybercrime unit of the IRS, says, \"we don't try to play the market.\"[1] However, this doesn't mean they're completely indifferent to the market. It isn't like they don't care about the market at all. While they don't speculate, they're not totally oblivious of the price either. In the words of Koopman, \"we don’t ever want to flood the market with a tremendous amount, which then could have an effect on the pricing component.”[Ibid.] [1] https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/19/what-the-us-government-does-with-its-secret-bitcoin-stockpile.html",
