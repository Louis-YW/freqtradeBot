Besides, I needed another cup of coffee, anyway.Tucker Carlson Launches New Subscription-Based Sitehttps://www.mediaite.com/news/tucker-carlson-launches-new-subscription-based-site/\"Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. We've been out of work for 7 or 8 months now, hard to know. Time flies when you're unemployed, but actually we have been working in secret and producing an awful lot of material for months now, interviews, etc. And all of it has found its way to TuckerCarlson.com,\" Carlson told his followers on Saturday.Carlson added that the subscription service was apart of a larger plan, claiming \"We're launching a brand new thing very soon, and we'd love for you to see it. So go to TuckerCarlson.com to see it first.\"Users have the ability to \"join Team Tucker\" by creating an account and paying to become a \"Founding Member.\"Carlson was fired from the cable news network back in April following the $787 million settlement with Dominion for defamation.Since his removal, the former primetime host has used his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, to release interviews and monologues, including with Former President Donald Trump, Andrew Tate, Alex Jones, and other right-wing firebrands.ADVERTISEMENTBack in October, Axios reported that Carlson had raised $15 million to jumpstart his new media company.

I believe he would do very well there and he is already accustomed to having a format for that kind of organization. He may not be trying to get back in the status quo but rather start something big by his own, who knows... It depends on what is really what he wants to achieve, if he wanted to fully influence on USA politics, he could go back to cable networks, for now he seems rather focused on getting some money.",

Now, if you are instead implying Trump got elected once because he was not part of the DC establishment, then I agree with that formulation.

The members do their job, then they go home, and the next shift takes over, daily, etc.Without profit, every country fails. But if they don't fail, they at least become stagnant.Trump lost to Biden because of fraudulent manipulation of the election system by the super-rich elite, not because the populace was for Biden more than they were for Trump. Check out the videos of Biden's campaign meetings. Biden only had a few hundred attend his campaigns. Trump had thousands and tens of thousands.It's common sense, if we didn't have the info directly.",

Most of people do not pay to listen to a very specific narrative and embed in it. I agree with you those who pay for Tucker subscription will rationalize their expense and avoid reality so they can justify the way they chose to throw money away. Kind of sad. for years now badecker has been a subscriber of freedom-phoenix which most of his brainfarts are direct quotes of.. so now we will see a echo of tucker speeches tooin the past he has made a a few posts from different subscriptions where the articles oppose each other but he was determined to say they were both correct. but when asked how can he rationalise his opposing views he just ends up admitting he is just reiterating the stance of his trusted sources, thus just mindless copying",

It is supposed to only be valid for the study of atomic or sub atomic particles. There is no correlation between whatever tucker Carlson could say and the laws of quantum mechanics. And you would be aware of it if you ever tried to study those laws of physics, though I understand education of that level within the United States is very difficult to afford anyways. So perhaps your ignorance is not completely your fault.",

The quantum Mechanics usage above, was regarding the statement franky1 made that suggested that some of the articles BADecker posted contradicted each other.However, QM affects everything. Isn't light a subatomic particle at the same time that it is a wave?",
