The simple fact that you created an ANN thread to promote your shitcoin shows that you're suggesting (at the very least) that people should invest in/mine/use your coin.  So yes, you did tell me and anyone else reading this thread to invest.Quote from: soosho on October 01, 2022, 10:59:53 PMTheta shita ? can you read a name ? I surely can; can you understand an insult when it is written?  More to the point: could you possibly have come up with a worse name for an altcoin than this?  There's already a Theta, and on miningpoolstats they even link to the wrong coin on coinpaprika.Quote from: soosho on October 01, 2022, 10:59:53 PM41907880 Coin in circulation and only 5% in our hand, dumped ? I never made that claim, so I'm not sure why you wrote that.Quote from: soosho on October 01, 2022, 10:59:53 PMThe innovation : Who said we are focus only on the blockchain ? our innovation at a service for the theta core, where it will support the core wallet. an example, a payment gateway.In other words, your big innovation is the wallet, which allows people to pay for things using cryptocurrency?",
