If what you are doing is legal, keep sending them message. The message you post above that they send you back is just like a bot message which would be the same after someone send the exchange email, then that bot-like message will be sent their customers almost immediately. If they send you second message, that would be the real message about your complaint.",

I believe he’s should be talking about a betting site since he made the post in gambling board although I haven’t heard of it before, and you replied to his post pointing out his complaint in cex while none is present in his post. Probably you mistook his post for some other post… or am I the one not understanding what’s going on here?",

Quote from: tintoritus on September 12, 2024, 06:47:05 PMDragon's Tale is still technically alive, but it's not as active as it used to be. I checked it out recently, and while they have added some features like PVP and skill-based games, the community has thinned out a lot. Some people still play, but it feels outdated compared to newer games. As for legitimacy, they're still functioning, but I'd recommend caution when spending real money. Things can change fast with smaller platforms like that.Is there any chatter as far as people complaining they haven't been paid when trying to cash out? I don't recall seeing any scam accusations threads.teppy better known as Di in the game was last active in April of this year, would be nice if they get a noti from this and answer.",
