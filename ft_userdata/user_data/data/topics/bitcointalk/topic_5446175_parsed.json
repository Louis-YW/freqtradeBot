So, not sure what you expect us to do!Also, it seems bet365 do not have an official telegram channel, so you can suppose any channel on telegram with such name is a scam one.According to your last posts, it looks like you are looking to buy a verified bet365 account. Not going to comment on whether this is legit or not but you should be careful when dealing with any one offering to sell these accounts and always use a reputable escrow (if you can find one who will accept to escrow such deals).",

Them are admin at telegram group bet365 European account.Is everything scammed?Telegram is not a good platform to conduct your transactions through. Scammers often deal with it, so if you want to make any transactions, you can deal through the Escrow Service or other websites that act as a mediator between you and the seller. If the seller requests that you send your money first, you must refuse that because if he does not have a great rank other than a newbie rank and a good reputation in the forum, he will 99% steal your money. He can create a new membership on Bitcointalk and change his username on Telegram as if nothing happened, so you have to be careful; once again, please put chat logs and proof enough to support your topic.",

Them are admin at telegram group bet365 European account.Is everything scammed.Who are even these @Antonnikopol @Rafail_Theodor people. Are they bitcointalk members? As they are some Telegram names and as far as I know in Telegram you can change username. So at the end when they will change the usernames, you don't have any trace unless you get their Telegram ID.Besides, where is your backup evidences. You come here, claim xyz, abc are scammer and then expect everyone to believe you? Can we grow up a little please?",

It is either they mustt have been paid to carry out such act as the case here is an accusation against some people without any form of evidence but however, thanks for your update.",
