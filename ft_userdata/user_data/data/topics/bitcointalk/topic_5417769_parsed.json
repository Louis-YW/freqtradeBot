The rest depends on you  but basic things like wallet/address creation, private key verifications etc - all is easy to do.Code:        <dependency>            <groupId>org.bitcoinj</groupId>            <artifactId>bitcoinj-core</artifactId>            <version>0.16.1</version>        </dependency>        <dependency>            <groupId>org.web3j</groupId>            <artifactId>core</artifactId>            <version>5.0.0</version>        </dependency>",
