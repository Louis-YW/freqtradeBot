This is very important so that we will see how you can recover it.Do you have the recovery phrase or mnemonics? or the master password? If yes then you can recover your wallet by using that Restore->Recovery phrase in MEW.Or maybe if you also have the Keystore file as backup, that's also one way to recover it.",

I don't know what type of WALLET you are using, if Myetherwallet then there are no reason to worry where you donâ€™t need to password to log in into your wallet, seed phrase is main thing in every wallet. But if you have only restore file when you can't access it without password. Just keep safe your seed phrase.",

Follow the steps mentioned by Charles-Tim, I think it's enough to get your wallet back because the password can still be changed there, but it might be a different story if you forget your seed phrase.You just need to change your password again and save it so you don't forget it again.",

I think what you meant about keystore not passphrase. You should check it again. I think that you are misstyping or something else. It's caused by once you are still owning pass phrase and that means if you have access to your wallet.",

You shall rephrase your question again. It seems you didn't even know how to separate between pass phrase and another kind of file like keystore that needs a password to open it. I guess that if you are saying password has become the main concern that prevents you to access your wallet and this must not be your phrase as the main problem. It shall be another file that linked to your wallet caused by it has been protected by password.If you are still having another key like private key or passphrase that contains some words depending on the blockchain and you can access your wallet again without using password.",

The password you see is usually for encrypting your wallet so that once a stranger lands on the wallet file, he can't access your wallet minus entering your password. if you have access to the seed phrase, then all you need is restore the wallet in the wallet software.The password maybe important, but the seed phrase is the most important. Keep it safely. If the hacker lands on it, he won't need the password to access your funds.",

If you have your original phrase (do you mean your seed phrase), you are fine because you can import it and recover your wallet.Search with Google and name of your wallet software (Metamask, SafePal, c98, Myetherwallet ...) and recover from seed. Follow their guides to import and recover.You were panic because you did not understand the role of password that is encrypted your wallet and prevent strangers, hackers to access your wallet. If you have seed phrase, you can recover it and set a new password to encrypt that new wallet file.When you recover your wallet, you must add custom chain if your fund is not in Ethereum chain. By default setting, wallet software, extension will show your wallet balance in ERC20 Ethereum chain. For Binance Smart Chain, Harmony, Avalanche you must add custom chains.",

Whenever you create a wallet you are given very clear instructions about writing down all the information related to it, this includes the seed words, the password and any other information necessary for the recovery of your account.If you have your seed words then there is no problem and you can recover your coins easily, however it is worrying you state you forgot your password, did you refuse to write down all the information necessary to recover your wallet? Because even if you can recover it if you are not careful then next time you could find yourself in a situation where you lose your coins for good, so take the time to write that information and make a copy you keep in a safe place in the case you misplace or forget that information again.",
