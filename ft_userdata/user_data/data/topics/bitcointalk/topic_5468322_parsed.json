Some are inspired by cultures, nature's beauty, situations, individuals, etc.  if the feeling to do something isn't gotten correctly, the expected results may not be gotten, hence leaving such a person in disappointment and frustration. Here are some tips on why I invested in Bitcoin. 1. Bitcoin is an asset: Bitcoin is an asset because it can grow from the point of purchase, especially when taken advantage of markets that are falling in orife or have fallen in price to purchase as well as rise in price to sell. With Bitcoin, you can start small and grow big.2. Investors like bitcoin because it's different from the traditional financial system that's controlled and regulated by the government of such a country. With bitcoin and crypto in general, transactions are outside the control of anyone, entity, organization, or person.3. Transaction is fast; bitcoin gives every user the luxury or pleasure of speed in transactions. Hence, network hiccups are almost eliminated when transacting with bitcoin.4. In the crypto world, bitcoin is the most dominant with a proven track record of growth, stability, and security, and it boasts of high liquidity compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is revolutionizing the financial market, making it the economy of the future you too can take a bold step to invest in Bitcoin if you haven't invested.",

And the fact that you could control your own assets as if it will rely on your hands for your every call in the market. But let's not sugar coat and be biased in Bitcoin, it's actually convenient as you could transfer and do transaction worldwide by just having the internet via Bitcoin. But some transactions can also be slow or having traffic due to many people are having a transaction at the same, which could be bad thing if you're converting funds into fiat in case of emergency. And also don't forget it's volatility that also involve risk if people are not aware from it, which I don't blame Bitcoin but the user already.",

They believe that holding it can lead to increase in value and a corresponding profits. So far, Bitcoin have not failed those who have this belief and confidence. Every other reason for investing will just add to the viability of Bitcoin and constitute speculation. Someone can buy Bitcoin to use for payment due to the accessibility,  speed and comfort that it offers... this does not qualify as investment. What I see as investment is buying with the target of making profits.",

It also depends on how congested the network might appear to be at the very moment that you choose to transact. On the aspect of no limitation, no one might be able to stop you from completing your transaction, but power supply might, and lack of access to the internet can also still go. If you don't have access to the internet, I don't see how possible it will be to broadcast your transaction on the blockchain. Please don't get me wrong. I'm not against the fact that Bitcoin transactions are not fast or not; I'm just trying to point out things that can also affect the speed limit of your transaction. Above all, bitcoin offers us a lot more benefits than any fiat or other currency can, as it has already proven over the past years, which has led to its rising popularity and adoption by many as their choice of investor and reserve option to be considered.",

You can have such ease also by staying in your closet and making use of your bank mobile app. Of course all banks have one form of mobile banking where you use your bank app for your transaction and this doesn't give you any additional stress different from what you have when you want to access your crypto wallet from your noncustodial wallet, exchange wallet or casino wallet. All it entails is login with your username, email address or phone number depending on what was used to register just like your bitcoin wallet and you are good. In fact regards to fees, mobile banking fees are lesser than transacting with bitcoin. Sometimes to use mobile app depending on the size of fiat you want to transact, you may be charged maximum of $0.1 but to have a fast transaction using usdt, you are parting with $1.However, bitcoin eliminates the third party control from the government but that is gradually going off through the exchange regulations.",

Bitcoin is the most reliable cryptocurrency to altcoins but the security of your coins depends more on you. That is why every Bitcoiner has to understand the basics of crypto security.

I'm sure you've tried to send money to someone during a bank holiday, the weekend, or something like that. My bank processes transactions 4 times a day in what's called a session. I think it's something like 9 am, 11 am, 1 pm and 3 pm. If you send money past 3 pm you're not going to have it processed until 9 am the next day. Might look like nothing, but I have a job and one day I wanted to buy a car. The seller lived two hours by car from my house, so on that day I had to call in sick at work just to be able to drive there on a week day and be at his place before 3, to send him the money. Otherwise I'd have to go there twice, one time to see the car, wire money and get there the next day to pick it up, which would mean about 8 hours of driving only because I'm unable to send my money whenever I want. Bitcoin doesn't limit you like that. Quote4. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Tell that to market analysts who draw charts every day by looking at past years. I don't like it too, but the whole stock market is built on these principles.",

But for me, one of the main reasons that inspired me to invest in Bitcoin because of the dramatic increase in Bitcoin's value was its scarcity. because we know there will only be 21 million Bitcoins, and that is a fact and cannot be changed at any time. This is very different from Gold, which is rare but we don't know how much it is because it continues to increase.So, you can imagine if for example the entire supply of Bitcoin were to be given evenly to everyone on earth, then there would only be 0.0026 BTC for each person, this is just my rough calculation. If you have more than 0.0026 BTC, then you will have more than most people can afford and that should be enough to inspire you to buy Bitcoin. So maybe your minimum Bitcoin investment should be at least 0.003, if you can collect more Bitcoins it will make your future better than before.",

They want to diversify it.There are real estate and other forms, but they are not that efficient due to the lack of funds and the high taxation. There, BTC comes in handy. It does not have the issue of lesser funds, we can buy a single satoshi, and there is no huge taxation either.
