  "content": "With the hopes of an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine still not in sight, peace, quiet and stability seems to be a far reaching dream now for not just the Ukrainian citizens but for Russia and the world at large. With the war causing an unbalance to global trade that was sorely affected by the pandemic, a more stronger approach would be welcomed as peace talks seem to be failing.With Putin is still bent on securing Donbas, Xi Jinping has furthered his intimidation of Taiwan as it was gathered by reports where jets were seen flying across the Taiwan Strait. Many believe his attitude of calling for peace in the war between Ukraine and Russia and still going ahead with his plan of claiming Taiwan is a jarring juxtaposition of a dovish international peacemaker and an attacking dog baring teeth. Will he be able to actualise the \"Chinese dream\" or will it be shaky at best since his diplomatic influence is not so strong seeing as his relationship with the West is a bit shaky??https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65247965",

He is definitely a dog waiting for his opportunity to strike.Actually, I would dare to say that he has been trying to stay at the top of the CCP as long as he can, because he was to be written down on history books as the person who managed to reunify China. He has already stayed  in power more than expected.",

It is obvious that he is only cares about himself and don't care about what happens to you in the next minutes. Anyway he is China's hero because he has reformed China to be among one of the top countries in international trade and also in technology. He visited China recently and I thought he went to see Putin on issues related to ending the war but it is like he went to add more fuel to the burning fire.",

I am aware of Putin's special case and I think that Xi's objective is to follow his steps and stay in charge of the CCP during a long long time. Interestingly enough, I recall reading a survey done in Russia (before the invasion of Ukraine) and it seems that a non-neglectable percentage of the Russian population would have no issue with Putin being their president for life.  Which makes me wonder what kind of social measures Putin has taken to guarantee his popularity among a sector of the population there.",

Most nations believed that the consequences of this war will deter Russia from attacking Ukraine. But they were all wrong. Despots like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are unpredictable. America has made it clear that it will join the war if China ever invades Taiwan but this threat might not be able to deter Xi who like his friend Putin believes that America and her allies should restrict their influence and allow them to control nations that are neighboring. I am predicting that the war between Taiwan and China might have more devastating consequences on the global political and economic stage than what we are experiencing because of the Russian invasion and both parties should acknowledge the cost and let peace reign.",

Well, now that war is fully blown, Xi cannot accept a peace in which his ally Putin looks like the looser of the conflict, because this would reinforce the idea of the superiority of NATO and would be a serious warning about his intentions in Taiwan. So, he is both the Dove and the Dog, but his situation is not to be envied, as he will loose a bit in pretty much any circumstance.Quote from: Die_empty on April 18, 2023, 10:59:24 PMQuote from: Majestic-milf on April 14, 2023, 11:21:08 AM Will he be able to actualise the \"Chinese dream\" or will it be shaky at best since his diplomatic influence is not so strong seeing as his relationship with the West is a bit shaky??https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65247965Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, most political analysts never believed that Russia will attack Ukraine even when Russia was pilling up soldiers along their border with Ukraine.

You might be right, because over  here, it shows his involvements in other peace treaties involving Iran and other countries, but then I'm a bit concerned on his plan to take over Taiwan because no matter how one sees it, he's still doing one thing(brokering peace) and going ahead to planning his own attack. Plus, like you duly observed, I doubt he can be able to go ahead with the war. I mentioned it earlier but his military squad would need much training since there hasn't been a fight since 1979 against Vietnam.",

China can move in isolation from alliances, since Taiwan follows China as an independent region, and it is assumed that its return to the Chinese bosom will happen within a few years, which is what Taiwan, which enjoys self-rule, will be forced to abandon.  China guarantees the loyalty of Russia and its allies because they need it to support their colonial or defense projects. Taiwan, on the other hand, has no pressure card except for semiconductor production plants, and its supporters, including the United States, will abandon them if they succeed in finding alternatives.  The world's production of semiconductors is controlled by a few companies, and the big countries are seeking to compensate for this shortfall so that there is no room through which China can exert pressure.",
