      "body": "The world is rapidly transitioning towards digitalization, and Bitcoin's popularity has grown rapidly as it is a digital cryptocurrency. To address current economic and financial issues, there is a need to increase awareness of how Bitcoin can solve these problems. Despite the decentralization aspect of Bitcoin, which many organizations dislike, they cannot overlook the potential of Bitcoin's future. I anticipate that gradually more governments will allow Bitcoin, even if they do not accept it as legal tender, as failing to keep up with technological progress would leave us outdated.",

Do I think there will be total or global adoption of it, I would say No because they are certain things that could limit it. The fact there are people who can’t even use the internet is proof that this faction or group aren’t moving towards it. As the fiat system or government policies continue to dampen people’s hope from saving into bank, more people will seek out the opportunity of having a total financial freedom and that is where bitcoin plays its role. Quote from: Promocodeudo on May 04, 2023, 07:53:40 PMthis informations has change the mind set of many to believe that Bitcoin has come to stay as the currency of the future and have to be accepted despite not being a legal tender.Will bitcoin also become a legal tender? Yes more countries will certainly given to accept it as legal tender, most especially the less developed countries with weak currencies against the top currencies. As this is a way for them to be a pair interms of international transactions and to save them from their devaluing currency. As for the top countries with strong currencies they certainly feel it is a threat to their currency but bitcoin isn’t here to replace any currency but rather to act as an alternative to those fiat currencies.",

But it's true that it will be accepted no matter what and it doesn't have to be a legal tender for it to get accepted.

This is not solely due to luck, but indeed the process that goes through is very heavy. various FUD and bad news are always spread to make Bitcoin's image worse and also a bad specter for some people who may not understand Bitcoin and its uses.",

On this basis, people find in encrypted currencies (Bitcoin in particular) a haven that spares them the troubles and crises of the financial system.For nearly two years, the general demand for cryptocurrencies and trading platforms has increased. And this rise increased even with the crises that the crypto sector went through, such as the collapse of the ftx stock exchange.I expect an increase in bitcoin searches as part of the fast paced digitization culture.",

Bitcoin will be used separately with fiat currencies in the near future, just as new technology emerges and the old fades away. I think change is constant and happens gradually, thus the fact that it is not currently recognized as legal tender cannot prevent it from occurring in the future. Although the process will take some time, I'm confident that bitcoin will eventually be accepted everywhere in the world and recognized as legal tender. Even in remote parts of the world, the availability of internet is steadily increasing, which will assist to maximize its use.",
