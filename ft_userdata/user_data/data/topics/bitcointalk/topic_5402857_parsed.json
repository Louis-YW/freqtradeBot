  "content": "I am using Freebitco.in since the last 6 months (not frequently). I just daily spin, and after months I acquire 533 fun tokens. I always want to have the premium membership, so that I can claim 3/4 daily spin daily. Since the price of the fun tokens is comparatively low now, so I'm planning to buy more than 4500(35$) fun tokens to claim 3 spins daily. Now, Is it profitable in the long term to have a Freebitco.in a premium account?",
