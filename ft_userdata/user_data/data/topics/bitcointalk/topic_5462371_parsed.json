  "content": "Hello everyone. I recently noticed that by using the https://bpip.org/ site, you can check whether that person recently changed his or her password or not. Also, you can check by viewing the profile itself. It will say, 'This user's password was reset recently.' Is resetting passwords that bad, or why was this option even added there? Will the message disappear after 120 days? I know it may be added as a security measure like scam or buy-sell accounts, etc. But when a person sees that message, he or she may get a bad impression of the account. He or she may not trust the person, or the account may not get much interaction. Because I chanced password, now I'm tagged with that message.  Why have I changed my passwords several times? 1. I'm a custom ROM user. So I have to factory reset my phone in order to test the new build. I recently flashed several Roms to test.(Clean flash is mandatory to avoid bugs)2. I don't have any second devices. So I can't just have it logged in on another device.3. I easily forget. One time I even forgot or confused my username because I used 0 (zero) instead of o in my username.4. I always think of BTT as a highly valuable platform. I'm in fear that my BTT account would get compromised someday if I saved my password in an online place. So I never saved my password anywhere. (I know I should have used a diary to note down my password.)p.s: By the time of my writing, I don't remember my password.",

Changing your password is for your own account protection, and I don't see anything bad in that.I believe the viewing option was added there to warn other users of the changes that have happened to the account recently; both email and password changes usually appear on the user's trust page. And yes, the message usually disappears after a short period of time. 30 days, I guess, will be enough to warn users of the change. And the warning message will automatically disappear by itself. A change in the user's password most often draws attention to the account, as there might be a possibility of the account being hacked and ownership changed.",

A notification of password recently change doesn’t give bad impressions. It’s just a security purposes to notify you and other member that you change password recently. Changing password regularly is a safe practice to protect your account given that you will remember all the changes. The only time this action will be a bad impression is when you do a shady activity such as asking for loan or anything that involved money here since this will cause suspicion that your account is compromised.",

It's always better to reset the password only if you are active on forum for sometime because that would make others also believe that you are the real account holder and no one has gotten unwanted access to your account.That was the general answer, and in my opinion one should not change his/her account's password unless it's necessary for the security purpose. I prefer to keep my old password because I think that I have created a strong password which should not be changed at all, but if I find that my password isn't strong enough then I would also consider changing it in future. It's someone's own choice to change the password and I'm quite sure that no one would really care much if they found that someone has changed their password. However, it's necessary to be active on forum because if you change your password after a long time inactivity that could make other suspicious about your account's ownership.",
