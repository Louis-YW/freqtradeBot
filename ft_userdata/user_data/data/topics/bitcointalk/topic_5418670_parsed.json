      "body": "So a pseudonym( fictional character), created by a community of developers… if someone didn’t inspire the creativity of that community… would not they have continued to fail where they had for the previous years?Would not Satoshi then the “fictional character” be the fictional image of the “factual” being whom inspired that “team”? Despite that “teams” struggles, obstacles, stress… being on the beginning of every possible successful “crypto coin” would have some serious financial windfall’s no? I’m merely asking if there was an initial “spark to life” of their eventual “success”. Would they the “team”… be willing to help the provider of said spark,”the fictional satoshi” if in need, or simply because he asked?Or because the solve was so simple “from a conceptual, non programming tunnel vision point of view” would they be egotistical enough to cover it up and pretend that the individual whom was the “solving spark” simply didn’t exist and is “fictional”. Basically saying if he was “real” he deserves nothing. Because “they” though lacking the proper “conceptual solve” had been enlightened to it and had the difficulty of understanding binary code and how to relay it to the multiple different software systems, and hardware systems.Basically a bunch of monkeys attempting to build a fire by stacking a humongous pile of debris that they spent a wasteful amount of time and effort building. Then someone comes along and shoots their pile with a spark, giving it life. Then those monkeys getting what they wanted say “hey what you did was extremely easy and you did very little work compared to us… you can’t eat with us or enjoy the warmth(comforts)….Would you think that is “Justice” or would it seem more proper that those monkeys lose their fire(comfort) and be flooded so as to have their comforts washed away?Purely hypothetical just in an interesting mood… perhaps said “spark bringer” was kidnapped and led astray from the comfort of the fire and has been lost on how to return to said fire? As nice as it is to think monkeys around the fire were not involved… in the m, hacked, drugged, manipulated, kidnapping…. Greed and deception is a treacherous motive.Especially when jealousy inspires some to attempt to corrupt not only the “spark bringer”, but his family, community, etc… all for feeling “insecure” because “they” may have known how to use binary to stack sticks, but as their “programming showed” was only capable of “double stamps” and basically schemes to abuse the internet to “rip people off”…. So to attempt to hide the truth of how their “hard work” previously struggled so hard over was indicative of their “wickedness”… they attack the innocent “spark bringer” to attempt to “steal the glory” and “comforts” it would later provide.Basically everything programmed for  “crypto currency” (Pre “fictional” Naka*moto*) was a failure because it was not honest, and pure hearted….Why the purpose of Satoshi and Greatness was so important,( he was the conceptualist and inspired her) to make something… a crypto currency that was capable of being “Legitimate”, and secure for the world, and the government in which Satoshi was born and was appreciative of, though perhaps less appreciative of now. A currency to be a “future fruit” for the entire earth and beyond.It would be quite tragic if the spark bringer was attacked and contained in an environment that forced him to be unable to effectively communicate “or even exist” with proper authorities or with the original friends that inspired a team of developers to even exist… or specifically an environment that only offered “monitored sources”. Such as neighbors wi-if or, neighborhood local business login portal, or satellite provided by a spy. A method to force him to be like a “Truman show puppet”…. While hoping the “life” being manipulated upon him was enough to not distract him from remembering, but also force an illusion of unworthiness (deceptive lie) as to his true moral “character”. To continue to dissuade him from feeling “confident, or worthy” of a title that became enough to inspire billions. With malicious narrative as an excuse “he just didn’t work hard enough for it”.Just a hypothetical story… curious if those whom know the truth will be kind enough to correct me?",

      "body": "In regards to your second post. Part of issue is with those unwilling to recognize the fact that the light bringer is as important as the monkeys who spend many years or days piling up sticks they probably hoping will somehow light up itself or even have no idea how to cause them to light up. Humans are created with different gifts they may not be able to make sense of or use independently to a create a well developed product unless they combine with those who have parts of the gifts that are required to create a solution. It's like many people trying to solve a puzzle that everyone has a piece of, but they need to put the pieces together and arrange them properly to create a full product/solution... Then once everyone brings his/her own pieces and the puzzle is solved, the one who made sense of the combine pieces of puzzle and tell the rest how to arrange them to form a solution is counted as not nothing, fictional, unworthy, or not deserving of any reward because according to some fools having idea is not enough but having it developed with your own hands.Fools like that currently live in crypto space, proudly claiming on a pinned post that light bringers like Satoshi is unworthy.  This can discourage future Satoshi from contributing to a project thereby preventing a team from success.",

He doesn't seem to be badly treated by those who took over from him in the early days. They accorded him alot of respect to the extent of naming a site after him and adhering to his most important ideals.Not so with certain altcoin founders. It's seems couple of them just want him and people like him gone or forgotten completely.",

Probably from a political aspect his appearance and identification as a single identity, along with his beginnings and lack of political grooming is feared to have too much a political sway over the viral generation. Though him and his original “guild of lucky friends” probably would understand that quite well and be mindful.To me it seems if he did disappear from those people who made effort to include his birthday, as well as another friends in the heavily documented original statements. He would sincerely like to be able to rest accordingly and know that they are well… especially some of the older friends.",

While those who put “criteria like a trust fund” to get either, continually hold him hostage, while abusing and sabotaging his life, and is most definitely not happy.Therefore he cannot sell any of the coins… and those who torture him get to capitalize on his suffering.While he’s sitting here broke, trapped, suicidal and distrusting of the entire world environment talking in this web forum extremely angry. Contemplating anyone in this world that could possibly be trust worthy to have a truthful conversation with. Government included because he’s lived and died before in the future and is now back in the past knowing how those in the future have betrayed him there as well as those in the present who have betrayed him in that past.",
