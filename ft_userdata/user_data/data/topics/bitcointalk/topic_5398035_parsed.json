We have seen this kind of market before in 2018~2020 where many coins disappear forever. This progress, on the other hand, is good for the blockchain since it refines the cryptocurrency market. Those strongest and has many benefits will stay and last.",

Some of the best altcoins in the previous cycle doesn't even have any value at all now or they remain too low from what we have expected so calculate how much they will be after the few cycle. In general people are investing on altcoins for short term so there is no wonder if they die in short span.",

Many altcoins from ICO during 2018 lost their values,some teams and devs use that time to abandoned their projects and run. Those coins who survive from that season have what it takes to recover from that market and many learn from that event to not hold too much altcoins since at time like this, the tendency of coins is some will be left behind and only few coins that are performing well will be able to make it again in the trend.",

Hm, a Hero member who doesn't know that a bear market has different types of levels just like. the bull market, when Bitcoin reached 40,000$ in 2021 we all thought yes this is hit but it goes over 60,000$ isn't it? A bear market will work in the same way, if BTC goes as low as 27,000$ do not think that's it, it might reach 19,000$. .. The higher the uptrend the dipper the downtrend.",

Meme coins are doomed from the start, they are for the hype game to make short term gains and not for the long term game. Those who do not believe this are making a mistake whose lesson they will soon learn. While the bear market has a bad effect on many coins, I dont give importance to altcoins and that keeps me sane. What should be focused on is bitcoin and seeing it crash means you have a chance to buy at a lower than average price. This is what newbies should keep in mind, not doing which they end up in an endless cycle of being unable to trade and losses.It makes sense to say that altcoins get tested during bear markets. Dont jump into them because they are low, some of them may never go back anymore.",
