But developed countries like the UK are more capable of absorbing the effects of inflation. Although record-level inflation must indeed have a considerable impact on their citizens, at the very least they have a much wider leeway to make adjustments. Citizens of strong economies have a higher standard of living. To citizens of developing countries who are already having a hard time even before this global crisis came, things must have already been more or less unbearable today.",

It seems like a tiny amount to be linked to rising interest rates.The UK's economy looks like it grew by about 7-8% last year so it probably was expected to contract after that. It seems like a big place to get overall statistics for as different regions do different things and grow at different rates because of that (for England, North West does a lot of manufacturing, North East and south west does a lot of natural resource extraction or farming and London does a lot with financial firms - these might not be the main industries there but they seem to be the ones that affect gdp growth figures the most - or have done over the last few years).",

They are still advertising for jobs to job seekers in the country. Just like you said, the world is having a slide because of the global activities over the last five years.

The current party in charge took some of the most fiscally irresponsible actions you could possibly imagine, they stripped back lots of laws and ultimately helped the poorest the least while giving massive tax cuts to the richest. It is going to cause even greater problems in balancing the books and the stock market took yet another hammering.

The reason behind it, the governments believe that the billionaires invest in the country, generate revenue and support the people. They'll invest only if they were provided with tax cuts and subsidiaries. The reality differs, another thing collection of tax from the common man is a way to increase the tax revenue.UK is to experience hard days, because for the past 70 years there is no change. Now to change everything to Charles lll itself a big expense for the government.",

With all the stimulative packages given by the government to make things survive and energy rotations happening, Euros and Pounds are affected by this, causing inflation. The trading with energy has produced a lot of problems with the margin calls that are supposed to be with the pandemic easing programs. That's just a hectic thing, to begin with, and out of control.We will see more of this as time goes by, it may not be all at the same time, but I think we are in the recession already. Shortages of USD will also be a problem with what's happening with the trade. Would being with crypto save you from all of these?",
