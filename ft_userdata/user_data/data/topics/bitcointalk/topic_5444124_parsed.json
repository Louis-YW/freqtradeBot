But I just checked not all but some of it only provide BTC ETH and USDT Mostly I mean there is always other coin right. And second yes they only show unaudited or at least they give hotwallet addressAfter I do some digging DefiLama provided a detailed list from the exchange hot wallet but I don't this is a complete list, and only a couple of exchange that provides Proof of Reserve and there is an exchange that does not gives proof of reserve at all. In my opinion PoR is not final and we still proceed with cautionwhen uses an exchange",

It's not an audit, it's not reliable and can be awfully deceiving. But again, we knew this much.. is that important that a certain company came up publicly to state the obvious? What am I missing?",

Fair value represents the price that would be received if the company were to sell the crypto asset in an orderly transaction to a willing and knowledgeable buyer.",

It's an ongoing challenge and will remain as it is for some time, it seems! My opinion is that any report makes sense, because the data is easier to check than to look for it from the very beginning. But there are always questions about the relevance of this data, so you need to double-check all the data for the current date. But we are talking about management accounting, the accounting report always comes out late. That is, the accounting report for 2022 will be published only after 2-4 months. There is a problem with the relevance of the data at the date of publication of the report.",
