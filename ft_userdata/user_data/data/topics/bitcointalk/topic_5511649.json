      "body": "I think you're mixing up terminology.The very first block in the blockchain is called the \"genesis block\". It's block reward cannot be spent. It's the block at height 0.The transaction fee is the fee you pay based on the size (in bytes, or vbytes) of your transaction (so the value transmitted does not matter for the fee). It's an incentive you give to the miners to add your transaction to the block they're working on.Where you go the \"base\" keyword, i have no idea... Maybe from the term coinbase? The coinbase transaction is the first transaction in each block, it's the transaction that pays the miner both the block reward and the sum of all the fees of all the transactions in the block the miner solved... It's a special kind of transaction since it doesn't really have inputs like all the other transactions (since the coinbase transaction actually generates \"new\" funds into circulation, and gets the fees of all the transactions aswell)",

It is not fixed and is variable depending on the current network conditions. The network conditions might include congestion and demand for block space.You need to know that miners prioritize higher network fee and users can specify the amount they are willing to pay measures in Satoshi per byte (sat/byte) from their sending wallets. If network is congested, the fee tends to be higher than when the network activity is low.You can also confirm the current acceptable fees from mempool.space which provides current information about network fees based on network conditions.",

I'm not entirely sure if that’s correct, but it seems to be the case. If I'm misunderstanding your question,please clarify it.BTC Transaction fee of 0.01 for a 0.02 Send?   0.01 BTC fee on 0.01 BTC transaction?Quote from: alxs on June 13, 2011, 04:26:49 PMI'm running latest windows client.  Sent 0.02 BTC to someone and couldn't get it to not charge .01 transaction fee.  Found this really odd...If I send 1.00BTC don't get charged a fee, but get charged if its less than 1.00?  Doesn't seem right...Don't mind the answer above.

      "body": "As a result of transaction validation, miners reward, and network congestion, the bitcoin first layer has no base transaction fee or programmed fee, it all varies due to the few above listed factors. But the layer 2 protocols that's the lightening network was structured to operate above those barriers and you could get lower fees and fast transaction speed when sending bitcoin through LN.

I guess like, what is the algorithm to determine the fee rate? Like if there was no competition for block space, and during a period of no activity, what would the fee be?You answered the question, the algorithm is calculated via sats/vbyte multiplied by the size of your transaction. But, if you're sending through a bitcoin wallet, when the network is less busy, you'd get a lower fee suggestion, which you could adjust to the lowest or higher size depending on how fast you'd want the transaction to be confirmed. However, lower fees are not encouraged even when the network is not congested, it could take hours to send.",

In the early days, blocks even kept a little bit of space free especially for high priority zero fee transactions. Right now, you can still create 0 fee transactions, but most nodes will not accept them into their mempool (nor relay them). This is basically a choice the nodes make (eventough, the dev's did make it easy for them to configure their node in such a way that transactions with a fee that's \"to low\" get bounced) but they make said choice out of their own free will (or because it's the default setting of their node software). If they wanted to, they could accept and relay 0 fee transactions.You could, theoretically, contact a big mining pool and give them your 0 fee transaction and ask if they're willing to include your transaction into their blocks (untill they succeed in solving a block). They probably won't do this tough, since it would make no sense economically...",

      "body": "There is no such a thing as a base fee. This term makes sense only in the Lightning Network.In Bitcoin, a transaction that pays no fee can be valid. However, nodes would, by default, reject adding it to their mempool, and it wouldn't therefore reach the miners. You would have to manually reach the miners with that transaction, and you would likely have to pay them to have it confirmed, which is the same thing as paying the fee. In the early days, when block subsidy was 50 BTC and there were no transaction competition, you could have it confirmed for free.

From there, the fee people pay is a preference and also is affected by how much \"competition\" exists in the network for the limited block space. If there is more demand for it than there is space (meaning if there is 5 mb which is 1 mb bigger than the cap) then the competition becomes fierce and fee goes up. The more people compete, the higher the fee goes.",
