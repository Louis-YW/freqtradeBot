Not as if Pepe is a perfect memecoin that is worth so much competition from competitors such as the above-mentioned.",

And it is possible to hope that there will be success only with general excitement. Unfortunately, this is not observed on the market now, despite the promotion of the pepe topic. Therefore, it should be shown a feature that will be of interest. So far, only dreams are associated with lovesnoopy.",

There's nowhere that these projects will go and that's just gonna be the same fate as the others. Project over project trying to beat each other's asses. No future for memecoins but it's a place where people can truly make money quickly. But also, you know that if there's a winner then there goes the losers.",

Problem is on the actual; there are many projects being released in this industry but only a few had a pump the moment it is released in this market.  $Pepe and Floki indeed showed good price increase but keep in mind that these are meme tokens. There are no other usage or utility of it which makes it risk of an investment. Its price could skyrocket for an hr and fall in a minute. Actually this is the first time hearing about this meme token but one thing I know is that, when you are late already never enter the market on a coin which is too volatile 'coz you'd possible be other investor's liquidation.",
