  "content": "This news is really interesting and should excite the crypto lover a lot. Since we know that the crypto space is all about a decentralized environment and everything is trusted on the public ledger, the same thing was proven by the recent event of US bank collapse that happened recently. SVB lost its major players which were mostly centralized exchangers. This followed the collapse of USDC the second-largest accepted stablecoin in the market. It lost its dollar ratio and had highly unstable circumstances. Soon after the market got aggregated a whopping 25 billion dollars worth of volume is getting traded or exchanged over a decentralized market. This is recorded high all the way after 2021 trading volume. This is a clear indication that whenever a centralized market is baffled people are moving to a decentralized market to secure their funds. It's clear that if the centralized market is relying on the banks then their funds are not secure and it could create a chaotic situations like FTX and thus everybody thinks their funds are not safe at all. QuoteDecentralized crypto exchanges facilitated a record high $25 billion of daily trading volume on Saturday, according to Defi Llama data.The previous high of $24.3 billion was in May 2021, when bitcoin (BTC) was worth roughly $65,000 and ether (ETH) $4,400.Trading activity surged on a wave of panic as USD Coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin, lost its peg to the dollar following a short-lived banking crisis in the U.S.The majority of trades took place on decentralized exchange Uniswap, with weekly volume of $31.7 billion. On the Curve protocol, meanwhile, traders rushed to flee USDC – a move that prompted an unbalancing of the protocol's equally weighted stablecoin liquidity pool.Circle, the company that issues USDC, calmed concerns by reiterating that every USDC token remained backed by one U.S. dollar, despite having $3 billion in exposure to the troubled Silicon Valley Bank.Volume across the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has remained high in the wake of the depegging with a weekly increase of 255%, according to Defi Llama.Traders' confidence in USDC was demonstrated by a surge in on-chain leveraged positions, with $70 million being at risk of liquidation if the stablecoin was to lose its peg again.Decentralized Exchanges Posted Record $25B Daily Volume as USDC Depegged",

No matter how big a centralized exchange is its always not advisable to keep your money there. As much as the SVB drama is an unfortunate event, lets hope it helps people in crypto to understand that they can't completely trust centralized exchanges.",

If the last decade has any lessons to teach. One thing which might be learned is a good percentage of people in the world work hard to live under a rock. Many pride themselves on never following current events on the news and not being able to find australia on a map. The size and distribution of this demographic is a key component to determining what segment of the population is aware events like FTX are occurring. As well as to recognize how far implications of asset contagion and economic instability might penetrate into public consciousness.While these events might seem broad in scope to those of us who have seen it on a daily basis over a period of many years. It helps to remember that not everyone is so lucky as to have the benefits of basic knowledge.",

I don't know, why people are always waiting for the demise of a company or centralized exchange to mock and ridicule. While we also have thousands, millions of banks are still very stable to serve us. I think, whether it's DEX or CEX, it's just to serve us, to make our lives more convenient, so let's just use both for each appropriate case. All DEX or CEX, none of them are entirely reliable, use them for the right purpose and always have a backup plan.",

While that one was obvious for everyone since it's just logical when you spend just a few seconds on it, at the same time DeFi is often misleading, both in terms of decentralization which is not always there and when it comes to security:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/euler-defi-protocol-exploited-for-nearly-185m/QuoteThe losses occurred over four transactions in dai (DAI), wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), staked ether (sETH) and USDC after the attacker conducted a flash loan attack.Not a bank run, not a fractional reserve but a simple exploit, and here you go, $200 million worth of coins evaporating.Best to keep things simple, don't rely on anything that might prove to be something else than what it advertises itself for.",

On the other hand, SVB gave an awesome entry in the market. but as i said ups come with downs, and this is not applicable to everyone like the one who managed to take advantage is now \"UP\" and the one falling prey to market sentiments is facing \"Down\" so overall, the market has something for everyone. Decentralization no doubt needs no popularity people who are involved and tasted the flavor of DEXs are the ones who know how fast, secure, and custodial assets transactions are. But new technologies are still coming with great features which could circumvent the limitations that DEXs comprise. This will also increase the DEX volumes and when the People will fall prey to taking Interest from Banks and When Banks will give them no options other than taking it. Then people will understand the potential DEXs holds, and i hope this could be bearable for them.",

What I mean is really simple if you know how pees keep changing their minds as per the situation. As stated by you in the OP the whole chain reaction started after the collapse of bank and then out of the fear of losing funds in the process everyone is moving or trading more on decentralised exchangers as compared to the before zone in the want of “saving”. Consider the reverse situation here when decentralised exchangers run out enough volume and they do not get much users for long time then ultimately everyone would start trading on centralised exchanges again.
