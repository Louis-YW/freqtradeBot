      "body": "You have explained everything a person interested in joining you will need to accomplish in order to be paid for their job. That is not an issue, and you have made it understandable for anyone who is interested. However, as a newbie to the forum with no previous contributions, it appears that your organisation is not appealing to potential employees. Bumping this post again shows how eager you are to find someone to work with you. Why not look at how others that advertise work like this entice individuals to join them? You did not include a link to your website for potential applicants to peruse before expressing interest; it would be preferable if you did.",

It seems that they do not have a specific project. It is a team that provides customer support to projects and companies. What they do is to recruit according to the criteria listed above and you will now work for any company they broker for.But it is correct to say that forum members are always skeptical when newbies introduces a business, product or services to them.",

      "body": "I wanted to suggest that you should post this in the services section, but I see that you already have an identical, slightly newer thread there as well.I agree with the other users who want to know more about your company and its history. It's unusual that you are searching for professional and talented individuals who must be great at their job without providing more information about what you have done yourself. You should probably tell us the name of your brand, and which projects you have worked with in the past (if any)? What kind of services did you render for them and what were the results?",
