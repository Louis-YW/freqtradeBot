During campaigns and pre Election rallies it is common for politicians to make a whole lot of fancy  promises to the masses which then triggers them to vote them in since the masses would believe that they are on the same page . This sometimes turns out to be the cases rather in some other cases, the masses are simply deceived.For quite a while now Trump like you said has claimed to be a positive supporter of bitcoin however let's all hope it's genuine and not an avenue to win the votes of the American citizens based on the fact that a majority of US citizens are also bitcoin supporters.",

Almost all Americans don't even know what Bitcoin is, let alone support it. Most Americans support financial regulations that keep consumers safe from fraud--that is a documented fact. Most Americans aren't in favor of giving billionaires US taxpayer money (say through massive purchases of their favorite investment instrument). Another documented fact. Trump is saying what he is saying to garner some of the money certain billionaire Bitcoin whales give him. Republicans are wasting their time (and helping Harris to win) by talking about Bitcoin as there are other issues in American life that are a thousand times larger e.g. abortion.",
