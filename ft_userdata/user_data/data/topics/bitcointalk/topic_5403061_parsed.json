The first time in bitcoin's history when the price went below the ATH from the previous cycle.We also are below the 200 week moving average, which happens like... never.We have a fear and greed index of 6, which happened only once in history.It's either a generational buying opportunity with bitcoin being the most oversold it's ever been, or it's the end of bitcoin and it's finally dead LOL",

I know on this forum people believe in Bitcoin almost like they believe in god, but it costs a lot more to go down than it does to go up to begin with. If going down from $10K to $1K is a 90% downside, going up from $1K to $10K is a 1000% upside. While we're at it, we could take the argument further. If $1K would be a dream come true, $100 would be even better, and $10 even better etc. No way. The lower the price, the more disastrous it will be. That said, I highly doubt it will go down to those levels. I think what is going to happen this cycle is that the predictions that were made based on the previous ones are broken and more realistic predictions for the future will have to be considered.",

Never be surprised by that as price decrease is a buying opportunity for many people.The main question here is by who? Those guys claiming that Bitcoin is already dead are those who probably want to purchase Bitcoin at lower price level. There’s a lot of people in the past that say those exact word OP stated but now they are holding Bitcoin and probably sold at the top. This is just a propaganda to make the price worst so I don’t buy anymore if someone whoever he/she is make a bold statement about Bitcoin because Bitcoin will never die.If Bitcoin will have zero supporter in the future, It means that I’m already gone in this world.",

I know on this forum people believe in Bitcoin almost like they believe in god, but it costs a lot more to go down than it does to go up to begin with. If going down from $10K to $1K is a 90% downside, going up from $1K to $10K is a 1000% upside. It's because they only think of themselves and they ignore one thing.For bitcoin to make a comeback after 1k you will need a ton of money, just as how to recover to 68-70k you need a lot of money since the stonk hands-only buy in the dips and will not buy any more once it goes over let's say 30k, who will prop up the price, who put in enough money to cover the ones taking their profits? Not 10$ DCA for sure!1k? It will be a complete disaster, you will end up with hardcore bitcoiners buying all that at 1k, and who will come with the money? The only reasonable source will be pump and dumpers who will buy at 2k and dump for 100% profit back at 2k, taking even more money out of the scheme!And if it goes to 1k, what about the reputation? Hedge against inflation my ass! Security? If it goes to 1k the miners left in the business will not be able to resist a 51% even from one company, for example, Riot will have more hashrate than needed for that, and of course, it will be out of business and available to be bought at 1 dollar plus liabilities.",

      "body": "I agree that 1k would be a disaster. If any of you think 1k would be an opportunity, tell me at which level a stock is considered as dying. At -80%? 90%? 99%? There has to be a point at which people would say no, I'm not buying this shit that's in a constant downtrend. For most people a stock has to deliver to be an opportunity. Something that gains 200% and loses 80% of it in the bear market delivers. A stock that gains 200% and then loses more than it gained in the last 2 years becomes too risky. If bitcoin went to 1k right now I'd start asking myself what's wrong with it that it wiped out the 2017 bull market. What's wrong that it's lower than it was in the covid crash. Forming a lower low than 3k would make people run away from bitcoin because something would have to be fundamentally wrong for it to happen 1.5 halvings later. Also, we are already below mining profitability, which is why went through that 20-17K crash. That was miner capitulation. The same thing happened in 2018 when we fell below 5k.",

It went much lower than it naturally would because MtGox went bankrupt and started all that drama that dragged on for years. I was expecting a bounce when we fell below 35k and then we fell again to 21k with no bounce and then again to 17k that bounced a bit and all of it was on low volume. Really strange if you compare it with 2014 and 2017 where weekly volumes were 600k BTC and now we're breaking the same levels (20k) but with only 100k weekly volume.",
