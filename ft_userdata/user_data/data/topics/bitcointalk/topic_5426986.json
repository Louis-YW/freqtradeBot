  "content": "Hello everyone!Now after we finished testing our escrow tool, we are running a new beta test program for our marketplace and invite you all to participate in it. All eligible testers will be rewarded for their honest feedback. The tests are now run at https://beta.zen.land. The app supports all Metamask-compatible browsers on a desktop. You can read our official announcements thread here. What will you test?Our marketplace contracts (item contracts) allow sellers to add items (products, services, assets) to their profiles, and sell to multiple buyers from one contract. You will test the marketplace functionality by adding an item to your first account and sharing its profile link with your second account to buy it. Test rewardsWe will pay test rewards to Bitcoin/TRC-20 USDT/BSC-20 USDT wallet addresses provided by the testers after posting a report in this thread.- Full & Senior members $20 (5 slots);- Hero and Legendary members $30 (5 slots).Eligibility criteriaEarned 10 merits and more in the last 120 days. Do not have negative trust feedback.Are invited via PM on BitcoinTalk and given the test funds (stablecoins & ETH/BNB)Completes a test contract(s) and submits a report.Basic reports requirementsWe do not have many requirements but we would like it to be:- in-depth, with a good understanding of the process;- constructive (we want you to show us how to make the marketplace better);- have at least 150 words (screenshots are optional);- express an original opinion, not based on other reports.The report must be submitted after a full contract cycle (from creation to execution). How does this testing work?To test, you will need two Metamask accounts (to simulate a seller and a buyer). If you have two different Metamask installed browsers, you can go through the whole process simultaneously; otherwise, you'll need to switch between two Metamask accounts on a single browser.*We will provide trial funds (gETH/USDC or BNB/BUSD) for the test network to the address given in your application.1. Log in using one Metamask account (as a seller). Go to My Items and Add Item.Create any product/service, and choose 1 test network and 1 token you have requested funds for in your application (Goerli/USDC or Binance Test Network/BUSD).Enter the price (5 or less USDC/BUSD) and check the \"Pre-approved item\" box. Click \"Add\" and set to \"Active\".2. Log in from another Metamask address and go to beta.zen.land/profile/seller_metamask_address (e.g. https://beta.zen.land/profile/0x02ce7c23f146db6559a8f5871d5d32aa28c94050/items) and click on the item you (as a seller) created. Click on the test network and token and click \"Buy now\". Approve the contract terms.3. Deploy the contract to the selected network and then, transfer payment (USDC or BUSD) inside.4. Switch to the seller's account and find the contract under \"My Contracts\". Click \"Complete\".5. Switch back to the buyer's account and release the payment from contract.6. Leave the reviews for both accounts (optional).If you are having any difficulties message us on Telegram @zenlandofficialSpecial notice to all testersPlease, make sure you are testing the right contract. Marketplace contracts are called item contracts. Once created, they are seen on sellers' profiles under the items tab. There is no fixed turnaround time for running and submitting your reports, however, we expect it to be done within 5 days after approval. Feel free to point out the flaws and screenshot the bugs. Your report should briefly describe how the test contract went through and whether or not you found it useful and why. Let us know if there are any technical issues or difficulties in understanding the process.How to apply?If interested, reply to this thread with:1. Your Telegram username2. One Metamask address (as a buyer)3. Specify the network for test funds (Goerli or Binance Test Network)We will DM you and provide the necessary trial funding to cover escrow payment and other fees associated with the use of the escrow tool.DisclaimerWe hold the right to approve any application we like and refuse reports that do not comply with the basic requirements (even from accepted participants). All newly registered accounts will receive trial funds to pay the fee we charge for using our escrow tool.",

      "body": "Review Done: this was a great challenge, really enjoyed it -------------------------So I had to populate my sellers profile with some product or service which I did do by adding items relatable to the forum which is, Bitcointalk announcement thread and coin creation which can be seen on this link>>> https://beta.zen.land/profile/0x45a07e2637ead5f5d7cef1e16b84d2b7f2b285c0/items or https://beta.zen.land/profile/MrSatoshTech/items . The Sellers demo marketplace can be seen below Zenlands marketplace contracts (item contracts) are really a game changer, seller can easily add several blockchain payments with ease just not sure if other popular coins such as litecoin,bitcoin etc will be supported...but great innovation all in all.So as a buyer after using seller's contract address, am able to see items on their store and which coin payments are supported on each item...and upon finding what I want I simply clicked on the item which reveals further details about the gig such as delivery time, Buyer protection time and Accepted blockchain networks for your payment.And did I mention that you can have preapproved contracts that don't require back-and-forth processes such as waiting for the approval of the contract which is a time saver if you ask me. So basically with preapproved contracts once that Buy button is hit everything populates without the need to wait for approval from the other party.I like the real time timer that starts the countdown upon the Buyer transferring the coins to the contract(escrow) and the process at this point is smooth ridding for both buyer and seller.. The time given is based on Sellers contract timing terms of which if not fulfilled the buyer can dispute the transaction....very impressive and self explanatory process.and the seller equally gets the timer running before \"Dispute button\" is active on the buyers side should time run out for the seller.----------------- Could I get some clarity, during the fulfillment stage, why is the release button active on the buyer's side when this stage heavily relies on the seller delivering the product or service to the buyer ?? Which is wait for product/service delivery then buyer authorizes release of funds out of escrow  --------------------After a successful transaction, it comes down to a review of the transaction and its a done deal if all goes well, unless there is a dispute  I so feel ready for Zenland   Edit: I got Paid",

      "body": "I'm ready to give my test/opinion/reviewI followed exactly the steps explained in OP's thread, so:1 - I logged in two different browsers in Metamask (Microsoft's Edge and Brave Browser)2 - As a seller it's easy to find the section: My Itens -> Add Item -> Complete the form -> Add3 - After that you go to the page of My Itens and my product is already there, just need to click the Slide Bar to be Active4 - I grabbed the link of the \"store\" and open with my second wallet, the buyer.5 - I saw that everything was there, picture, explanation, informations, accepted coins to pay and after I chose the coin and network the button Buy Now is active, just need to click, next you can check the informations and aprove.6 - It will go to a new screen where is easy to understand what to do next, just click the blue button \"Deploy\" and confirm in Metamask, after that the button Transfer will automatically appear, now you need to interact with Metamask again to confirm transaction.7 - Now the site automatically inform you that your Contract is active, just need to wait the seller to fulfill the conditions.8 - Back to the seller I can see in my contracts that there's one active, very informative and easy to find. I just need to click them and it informs the contract is active, I can proceed with my buyer. I can chat with the person, delivery the product and click in Complete.9 - Now as a buyer I check if the product is right and I can do nothing, just leaving the time to contract ends, I can release imediately or I can open a dispute. (The buyer can chat to seller, and/or can ask help for Zenland to analyze the case). I opted to release in this case.10 - After that, there's the final step to leave a review for the Seller and Buyer, both can give stars and make a comment.Notes:--> I did these transactions a few times, not only once or twice, everytime trying something diffent, opening a dispute, editing the item, activate and deactivating the item, trying the avatar, pictures, descriptions, tried in my desktop and laptop.--> I don't know if this is good or not   but honestly I didn't find any single bug or error during the process, I wish I had something to give to you, but not a single issue.--> I want to emphasize the great UX and design of your service, the colors are working perfectly, it's clean, professional and easy to navigate.--> All the links I tested are working, the documentation is also good and well explained.--> I imagine people will sell digital products, and is there any way to make the process automatic, like a automatic message in product X when someone buys?--> One last thing I want to point out, the little info button on all items are extremely helpful to undertand the whole process.I'll keep looking for bugs ok, and if I found one I'll make a new post or send an MP",

      "body": "Zenland Marketplace Review By MAAManda1. Adding Item (Seller Side)In this phase I didn't have any trouble at all, after I went to \"My Items\" -> \"Add Item\", I found a form that contains several things that I have to fill in, such as item name, add image for the item, description, delivery time, buyer protection time, price, network for payment purpose and 2 additional settings (one off product & pre approved item).But after I managed to add the item that I want to offer, from the buyer's account side, I can't find the item that I made from the seller's side. Turns out I have to change the status of my item to active first.Suggestion: When the item creator succeeds in making their item, the status of the item immediately becomes active by default, this is to avoid confusion from the item maker like me, LOL.2. Item Buying (Buyer Side)After making the item from the seller's side active, I immediately looked for it through the seller's Zenland account link, you can find it here too: https://beta.zen.land/profile/0xca234d6d9474966d6084b6b5462a3d21c36c132b/items.When I chose the item offered by the Seller, I was quite confused about the next process because I couldn't click the \"Buy Now\" button, It turned out that I had to first select the network and token that was supported by the seller before the \"Buy Now\" button could be clicked.Suggestion: IMO, it's better if the selection of the network and token supported by the seller is done at the end of the process, not at the beginning (TBH, this is very confusing).Then, after I click the \"Buy Now\" button, it goes to the page for approval which contains information regarding the items being sold by the seller, then I click \"Approve\". After clicking \"Approve\", then I was also directed to a deployment contract, there were no difficulties at this stage and also the payment transfer stage.3. Completion (Seller Side)4. Payment Release (Buyer Side)5. ConclusionIn general I don't find anything wrong with this platform like bugs and others. But I'm just a little confused about all the processes involved, I think it's a little complicated and might confuse the user. Besides that, I also don't like the home view of this platform, why not immediately display the various items that sellers on this platform offer instead of just the metamask login menu?. Even so, I still like some of the features available on this platform such as the many payment methods from various networks and the chat feature between sellers and buyers after the contract is deployed.Note: I did this review using 2 Metamask accounts from 2 different browsers (Chrome and Firefox)",

      "body": "The Testing was done using two different browsers (Chrome for the seller and Firefox for the buyer)On the seller's sideA. Addition of an item It was fairly good with the help of instructions in the OP, but how about a new user who has not read the instructions in the OP? It would definitely be so hard of a new user.Suggestions --> Adding items needs to be a little more direct rather than checking out under my items. I think \"Add Item\" or \"Post item/advert\" button should in the homepage like \"Create Contract\"--> When filling in the information, the Tx button seemed not to give any effect on the texts. I was wondering what it does or what it's purpose is, Please check it out.--> Delivery time should be a little flexible to at least maybe 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes etc--> Price and Zenland fee per sale should be indicated in the base value of the tokens used, such as gUSDC and ETH rather than using only the fiat value USD to avoid confusion in the slight differences in values.When creating a new item and there is a slight network disruption as noted by this message, \"Contract operations are disabled due to connection loss. Please check your network settings and refresh the page.\" it leads to a couple of problems1. Refreshing, everything is erased, making the user to refill the information afresh. It would be good if the page would auto refresh in the background once the network is restored instead of one having to reconnect the wallet again after refreshing.2. If one just closes the dialogue box and does not refresh, he/she will be able to fill in all the information, but the add button will still remain faded out even when the network has been restored. This can put the user into confusion, thinking what could have gone wrong. I spent over 15 minutes trying to figure out what I had entered wrongly.--> The link of items under my items should be similar to the links of items under profile in case the user wants to share the link of the item he has advertised to someone elseFor exampleLink under items in profile - https://beta.zen.land/profile/0xd531fd889935d4f05c072da96dbab42645f78985/items/hrtgrqegertg-23 (working if accessed by someone else)Link under my items - https://beta.zen.land/items/hrtgrqegertg-23 (not working if accessed by someone else) This should be the same as the above link.--> Item/advert once created can not be deleted (if there is a delete option, then I pretty sure it’s hard to locate)--> The created item also has a buy button on the seller's side. This should be only on the buyer's side.B. TransfersThere were some challenges I faced;After the transfer was successful, confirmed as per the blockchain and the platform from the buyer's side. Nothing happened on the seller's side. Even when I synced with the blockchain, which I thought was the purpose of the button.Instead, I had to physically refresh the page in order for me to see the message that the transfer was successful and that I may proceed with the orderSuggestion--> Make the seller's page to auto-refresh just like the buyer's page does once the transfer is successfulC. FulfillmentThe buyer's release button was active even before the seller had fulfilled the contract conditions. This can open room for scam in case the buyer ignorantly released before the seller has finished fulfilling their partSuggestion--> Make the buyer's release button inactive until the seller fulfill their part of the contract and confirms. No challenge in the remaining part of the contract completion and writing reviewsN.B. Please also add the dark mode for the marketplace. It would be great.",

      "body": "Hello everyone! I'd like to thank everyone for contributing to Zenland by making suggestions and performing the tests. We keep track of all fixes made since our first beta campaign (Aug 19) in the changelog https://docs.zen.land/extra/changelog and you are welcome to look into it 🙂 Of course, there are more really good ideas we received (and hopefully will) but are yet to implement. Those are added to our To Do list and will be implemented as we close priority tasks. Meanwhile, I've noticed a few questions here and would like to answer them.Quote just not sure if other popular coins such as litecoin,bitcoin etc will be supported...but great innovation all in all.Currently, we support only EVM networks that support the smart contract language Solidity. Of course, we can implement wrapped btc and ltc but it is hard to tell in current development stage. It will be implemented in the future if more user requests come in. Quote from: Woodie on December 12, 2022, 08:21:15 PMCould I get some clarity, during the fulfillment stage, why is the release button active on the buyer's side when this stage heavily relies on the seller delivering the product or service to the buyer ??Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PM--> Make the buyer's release button inactive until the seller fulfill their part of the contract and confirms. Initially, the Release button has been left active for a buyer in case the seller fulfills the order but does not want to pay a gas fee for confirming the transaction and convinces the buyer (who already inspected the item) to release funds. In a way that is an option for sellers to save gas and make the service/product cost less for buyers. Taking multiple requests from past and recent reports we have decided to make Release button inactive before the seller completes the order. The required changes are in progress and will be live in the upcoming release.Quote from: rdluffy on December 13, 2022, 01:30:42 AM--> I imagine people will sell digital products, and is there any way to make the process automatic, like a automatic message in product X when someone buys?The seller actually receives a notification when buyer clicks Buy and then, Approve buttons. It reads \"Approved contract #12 (for example) has been created\". I have just re-checked it to make sure it works. As the person who takes that action (Approve), the buyer does not need to see it. Quote from: MAAManda on December 13, 2022, 01:27:49 PMWhen the item creator succeeds in making their item, the status of the item immediately becomes active by default, this is to avoid confusion from the item maker like me, LOL.It really makes little sense to ask sellers to set activation manually. This has been fixed and once the dev server is merged, will be live on beta.Quote from: MAAManda on December 13, 2022, 01:27:49 PMIMO, it's better if the selection of the network and token supported by the seller is done at the end of the process, not at the beginning (TBH, this is very confusing).This has both sides. There are people who prefer to see how to pay before they take any action (click to buy), but I see your point and am taking note of it.Quote from: MAAManda on December 13, 2022, 01:27:49 PMI also don't like the home view of this platform, why not immediately display the various items that sellers on this platform offer instead of just the metamask login menu?The login page will be preceded by the marketplace main page once we complete internal work with item contracts. It is on our roadmap for Q1 2023.Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PMIt was fairly good with the help of instructions in the OP, but how about a new user who has not read the instructions in the OP? It may have a learning curve for new users, but can be resolved with assisting materials like explainer videos, user documentation, etc. We will prepare and add a 2-minute demo before the official release.  Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PM--> Adding items needs to be a little more direct rather than checking out under my items.

Tx button is one of the other formatting options in the item description box. Its role is to clear formatting and will have an effect on text only if it has been formatted (bolded, underlined, etc.).The item price from inside the seller's account only displays a numeric value because of the multiple tokens option. On other pages where the buyer has chosen the network/token, the token and value are displayed side-by-side (for example, 5 gUSDC) On the other hand, a Zenland fee does not have a set currency and displays the dollar equivalent. It is paid separately from the seller's internal wallet which can be topped up with BTC, ETH, DAI, USDT, etc., and displayed on the dashboard in dollar equivalent. Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PMWhen creating a new item and there is a slight network disruption as noted by this message, \"Contract operations are disabled due to connection loss.

It is on our priority list, and soon both links will open the item page.Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PM--> Item/advert once created can not be deleted (if there is a delete option, then I pretty sure it’s hard to locate)The item can be reset to inactive and it will no longer be visible on the profile or accessible for a contract. The delete option has been added to our To Do list.Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PM--> The created item also has a buy button on the seller's side. This should be only on the buyer's side.Yes, the seller can see and interact with the item added but cannot create a contract. The button is there in case the seller wants to check how the contract with the item looks from the buyer's view.Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PMI had to physically refresh the page in order for me to see the message that the transfer was successful and that I may proceed with the orderGood catch, this is a bug that has been reported to dev team. All applicable fixes will be made before the next version release.Quote from: JeromeTash on December 15, 2022, 11:35:10 PMN.B. Please also add the dark mode for the marketplace. It would be great.Dark mode for the marketplace and the entire app is the go-to for many users, and for sure is in plan",

      "body": "Note: Before I start my review, I just want to let you know that I'm using Android phone and tablet when I do the whole test process as buyer and seller. My comment will be based on my experience using this device. I made my review without reading other user review to make sure that I'm using the app from scratch for a more organic feedback.Item Creation and Listing:I have no problem on doing this part due to the info button that contains the details of every items that needs to be fill up on all the required field. I'm just wondering why does the minimum delivery date is 12 hours? Why it can't be set to a lower time frame which makes the buyer easily get the item?On choosing the network,  Is it more easy to make the list in drop down form and state the name of the network instead of just the symbol of the Blockchain network? It will be more safe for a potential mistake on choosing Blockchain network and easy for newbie to identify which Blockchain they are choosing in case you support more network in the future.I like the idea that the item is not yet active right after it was finished creatingg so that I can preview all the details and whether I need to change something on the terms and details before I list it in public.Item buying and selling processThe notification feature of Zenland is really helpful on this part to easily access my open contract and to know if someone purchase. All the step by step process done is also being notified for both seller and buyer to make both party updated Incase they do the transaction in different time. The contract page too is updating real time for both buyer and seller using my device which is very cool since there's no need to refresh just to check for update. I only click the sync button once but it's due to my connection problem.I notice that the item being sold in an existing openncontract can still be edit on the item tab of the seller so I try to test whether I can change some details of the item despite there's already ongoing contract for both buyer and seller. I manage to change the details of the item but it didn't reflect on the ongoing contract transaction but instead it only applies to the new contract after the changes happened which is good for the buyer side since seller can't alter the items he is selling. Next, I made a mistake on using the currency. I use the default BUSD testnet instead the Zenland provided USDT, I just realized that I'm using wrong BUSD because of the contract address of the BUSD token available on the contract information that is helpful for buyer to avoid mistake on choosing the right token contract address.Lastly, Is there a way to null and void the existing contract without finishing the transaction? I made a mistake for not checking the pre approved box and I don't know how to close the existing contract so that I can sell the item in new settings. This null and void button serves as cancella tion of the contract which both party should agree before it will be processed. Conclusion: As a previous tester of Zenland escrow service, I would say that this new feature for buying and selling of NFT item in your platform is very safe for all type of user especially for newbie due to its straight forward feature and info buttons to guide them. The transaction is very seamless all throughout the process because it has live updates on what's happening in the contract.I just want to request for an easy share link for an item which seller will just do one click to copy the share link for the listed item for an easier sharing of item sales.This is the best escrow app and it has a potential to become popular here in the forum especially on the marketplace section. I will definitely use your app once it was live. GL",
