Either he is not thinking long term or that $1,000 is money he may need in the short to medium term. It is better to study bitcoin, its history and price behaviour in cycles to get an idea of what is to come, and be prepared for HODL for a long time to come, if you do things right, a little rise or fall in price should not even faze you. Otherwise, I can already see your friend selling at $1100 because he's short the money when he can easily make x5 in a couple of years.",

Maybe same with ETH. The issue is that the rest might be called a security and no exchange will be able to trade them if they serve us customers.Hence why the sell off started. I also think that Binance US will close up shop in USA. Basically not worth it for them with all this regulation going on. Fiat deposits and withdraws are also closed.

If you are looking to invest in Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, consider it carefully and dig deep into it before deciding to invest. Make sure you have all the knowledge and experience you need to make informed investment decisions.

Only use the funds that you can afford to lose to trade or to buy bitcoin,so that when the prices goes below the amount that you bought,you won't be troubled.

Bitcoin is unpredictable, and no expert can tell you what will happen next with bitcoin. I guess your friend, and you rushed to invest in bitcoin through someone's advice without any prior research. So the panic happened when the market fell. One is that you should cut your investment loss and get out of the market, two: you should start from scratch, learning everything about bitcoin. That way, you will have enough confidence and faith in bitcoin to continue holding. There's no better piece of advice than arming yourself with knowledge.",
