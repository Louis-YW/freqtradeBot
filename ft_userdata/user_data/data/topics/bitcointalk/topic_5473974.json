  "content": "Bitcoin investment dey very important for this our society and  any person wey don get the knowledge of bitcoin and invest go benefit from bitcoin.I dey sabi see this thread for this forum wey people dey compare real estate investment and bitcoin investment, even for social media most people dey compare this two sometimes but I see no need comparing the both because both get their differences. But for me as a Nigerian I think bitcoin investment is very important so I will choose bitcoin investment. Bitcoin investment na 50/50 but I still prefer bitcoin investment and any person wey reason this matter for Nigeria go prefer bitcoin investment. Reasons why bitcoin investment is important in Nigeria:Firstly let me compare the issue about real estate investment and bitcoin investment. before owning an estate, we need to consider the land and most land for Nigeria dey very low due to the nature of the land, so person wey wan buy land for estate investment needs to consider this factors, like for my state the land them low wella so any little rain water dey come underground for some area and people wey find themselves for this kind area and them wan build estate how person wan do?  flooding for Nigeria na the common thing wey dey affect houses but I thank God say this year the flood wahala no come. Everybody know say when this flood don come e dey enter houses and e dey affect estate (building) and e dey affect estate owners too because people go pack out, but in my own view na investors dey face the major challenge.  After this flood the house no go get beauty again and the house no go dey attractive and estate owners get bring back that beauty of the house with huge amount of money like painting the house Secondly most people no go like to live for area wey dey flooded every year because of the stress of packing and other things so why not find another estate wey no dey flooded, me personally if I find estate wey flood dey enter every year me self no go rent that house because I hate stress, how do I mean by the stress, most people no sabi swim for this country and in times like this things dey happen even who sabi swim is not advisable due to the erosion so is better to avoid flooded areas, so if everybody dey run from flooded area/house how the investors wan do and this na the common challenges estate owners dey face for Nigeria that's why I prefer bitcoin investment cause is more secure and safe. No be for only naija other countries wey dey engage for war and fight, bringing down of buildings with bomb etc. Just like the war going on in israel and Palestine, so for that kind country I no advice any person to choose real estate investment in Nigeria, mostly my locality, estate investment is not lucrative and as I said, there are many factors that affect estate investment, hotel owners in my city are also complaining the low patronage by customers, therefore bitcoin investment is preferable in this generation.While bitcoin investment has to do with you and your money no other person to control your money. The only thing person need to know before investing na to get knowledge of bitcoin/ investment, how to secure your seed phrase, keep your bitcoin holding a secret, stop following social media influencers trying to advertise crypto(bitcoin), ignore unknown contacts discussing about bitcoin investment. Bitcoin investment has to do with privacy and smartness.I saw a thread talking about bitcoin investment and Dangote, saying if Dangote had invested on bitcoin earlier he would have been the 6th richest man in the world and that's just the truth, but as I reason this matter no be only Dangote, our politicians too. Naija politicians na people wey sabi hide their wealth normally EFCC no dey allow them rest when it comes to property and wealth, we fit testify say most of our politicians has been arrested just because of their wealth and just if our politicians can invest half or little of their wealth on bitcoin it would have been better rather they keep using dollar, I see bitcoin as a private investment, if you no tell person, person no go know so I don't think EFCC can verify these politicians money on crypto(bitcoin), I don't know if our politicians have the knowledge about bitcoin cause I made my research and I saw a news where ex vice president professor Yemi Osinbajo was addressing Nigeria government not to ban bitcoin but bitcoin should be regulated.Even if CBN government no wan accept crypto(bitcoin), they cannot change the fact that Bitcoin as a decentralize currency is more better than fiat. Nowadays we don't trust bank workers anymore, sometimes  I see stories online how bank workers scam customers",

      "body": "Thanks OP for the enlightenment about the importance of bitcoin investment, instead of real estate investment, inside Nigeria. Because of the halving, ATH and bull run wey we de expect from next year, talk of investment in bitcoin to cash in for di coming bull run, don become hot topic for di forum. So yes, as e be now person fit forgo real estate and oda lucrative investments to focus im funds to de accumulate bitcoin de hold for di coming Joly season.Aldo i understand say you de try give di impression say e de beta to invest in bitcoin pass real estate, but your comparison no de fair. E come be like say you de generalize real estate, based only on your area, wey we get other areas wey flood and oda things wey you mention no fit happen for inside Nigeria. So di comparison no suppose de biased, real estate, just like bitcoin, na very good investments dem be, just dat as e be now, based on say we know wetin de about bitcoin matter, because of di coming bull run, e dey advisable for us to invest in am now.All di same I applaud your faith in bitcoin say na confirmed investment wey person fit rely on to make plenty profit, and na so e be.",

      "body": "Op you really tried for dis one. People just dey compare real estate with bitcoin investment. Though they can do that and can be base on the terrain. In my locality people are building houses for rent and when water comes omo, nobody dey stay there and when water finally dried off people no want to go back again because dem dey fear say water go still come for another year so renting houses in those areas na just waste of money so when you see dis kind thing, you still want to invset in real estate. Real estate business can only be good at the areas that water no dey near sef and such places like islands. And base on what I have said, investing in bitcoin instead of real estate is better. Real estate business is also yearly and within that year if you invest in bitcoin you will double that estate money. And base on the experience in my terrain investing in bitcoin is the best.",

Bitcoin investment na 50/50 but I still prefer bitcoin investment and any person wey reason this matter for Nigeria go prefer bitcoin investment.Bitcoin investment no be 50/50, na before wey we fit talk say the investment na 50/50 as we never know the fate of the currency but things dey obvious na say Bitcoin go succeed so it isn't about the matter of been skeptical anymore. Na altcoins wey you fit say na 50/50 now because you'll make profits when you invest in Bitcoin and hodl. We don't have to choose between the both but invest in the both iif you have the money and when you have lesser amount of capital, start with Bitcoin investment and as you dey make profit you shift attention enter Real estate business. No matter how people think say e dey challenging, it's one of the best investment opportunities out there. Combine both because as a Bitcoin investors, you need to dey diversify and investing in Real estate na better diversification assets be dat as the both market no get relation. When Bitcoin no dey do well, Real estate for fit give you joy and hold you until Bitcoin market dun strong back. QuoteEven if CBN government no wan accept crypto(bitcoin), they cannot change the fact that Bitcoin as a decentralize currency is more better than fiat. Nowadays we don't trust bank workers anymore, sometimes  I see stories online how bank workers scam customersBitcoin dun give you the power back to dey incharge and no be lie say e better pass Real estate investments and that na because Bitcoin dey decentralized, get limited supply and new Bitcoin can't be created but new land can always created and other problems associate MD with physical businesses fit come onboard. Real estate fit no dey go well for your area due to flood or other reasons but e get other areas wey Real estate dey do well and you fit carry your investment dem go that side.",

Abeg, hold your dollar tight pass as well as ina bitcoin, at least until next year. Na my sincere talk for now.",

Normally real estate business no go fit challenge Bitcoin investment minus the demerit them wey you drop about real estate investment if them say make them drop the profits from when them create the estate and the same time wey dem bitcoin, let's say na 2012 dem create the two, you go see say the gap wey bitcoin go give am e no go easy because before you start to calculate profit for real estate you GI first remove money wey you take build am so how them wan use this kind thing compare Bitcoin investment? Just as baba cryptopreneurBrainboss don talk Bitcoin investment no be 50/50 and I go like make you take this correction if na because of the bear movement you say na 50/50 make you no forget say no matter how Bearish the market dey for some time e go still rise or enter bull run and history sef fit back up this fact say na up the market dey go.No mind our politician dem no know say wattin dem dey fight against na also solution to their problem, crypto wey every thing for inside na anonymous something so dem fit get a whole 1k BTC and no body go know and yet ignorance no go let them think reach that side.",

      "body": "OP, real estate investment is not for the poor and anybody wey won invest in real estate as investment go consider the location of the land and the whether the land is in a low land or high land. If it is low land then that person wouldn't buy such land because he knows the consequences that such will cause him. You just condemn real estate like say no be sure investment. If your state na lowland, there are places in Nigeria that are highland, places like Enugu. So if you want to invest in real estate you go to places that are high land and flood free. We still have states in Nigeria that flood don't affect them. Real estate investment benefits is from generation to generation.          Back to bitcoin, for a poor man bitcoin investment is what he should go into because bitcoin provides room for both poor and rich to invest. Also bitcoin can give you a better profit compare to real estate in the same timeline. I will go for bitcoin because I don't have the resources to invest on real estate, and if I have made a good profit from my bitcoin holdings, I will diversify to real estate because both of them are good investment for the future.",

And moreover, every one is open to invest in Bitcoin unlike real estate that's only the rich can invest in due to the huge amount used in running a real estate.",
