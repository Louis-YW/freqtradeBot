      "body": "Good question! If you want us to understand the situation then you need to share some details. Please tell us the name of the online casino. Please go through their FAQ and post it here where they said about withdrawal. We will also need to know the currency you have used for your withdrawal. In the end this topic is not related to Bitcoin. Please post such topics on the Gambling discussion board. The reason is simple as you never wrote Bout Bitcoin and you are asking questions related to gambling.",

      "body": "First, this is not the best fit here under the Bitcoin discussion; your deposit was not done using Bitcoin.Another thing is: did you read the T&C of the platform regarding privacy before you started using the casino and made your deposit?Being safe or not being safe all depends on you. If you think the money you deposited there is not worth your privacy, then you can forget about it and don't send your account statement. But if you really need your money back, you don't have any other option but to give it a try and provide them with the required documents. What you can only do is, before you upload the document, cover up parts that you think will reveal your personal information and compromise your privacy.Edit: I was typing when @elevates comment popped up.Just move your thread to gambling discussion and list the name of the casino; maybe they have a representative here on this forum, and other members with casino platform experience will suggest remedies for your case.",

Or Withdrawal from your casino account directly to your bank account?Quotemy question is, is it safe to share bank account statement for verification purposes?  the site is reputable, but in bank statement all my information are available. is it safe to share?Another question is if you are concerned about your personal details being out, did you do KYC verification where you were required to submit your passport and proof of residence? If yes, I want to believe that your information is already out there. On the other hand, if you are concerned about the security of the site, is the money something you can forgo? If yes, then forgo it. If not, send in the bank statement but blur out personal information you wouldn't want to be revealed.",

I guess this casino is just giving him a hard time and buying time, not sure what a casino needs bank statements for while we use crypto.

      "body": "well, since you are reporting that you have a problem at a casino it is only fair that you say in which casino you are having this problem, this is extremely important information because it can help more other people to use their bank account money to place in the casino, other people will be able to use other deposit options like using cryptocurrencies. this is the first point you should do: say the name of the casino where you are facing this problemnow the second point is about your question, firstly 10 days is a long time, usually the maximum I have seen on other sites since years that I deposit it using the credit or debit card it can take up to 5 to 7 working days (Saturday and Sundays do not count) and the same happens when and even when withdrawing money from abroad (website) to the bank (debit or credit card) it takes 5 - 7 working days, with Saturday and Sunday not counting as working days, so this is the first time i hear about 10 daysthird party on the bank statement there is no information that compromises your bank account, no bank in the world will put your password for your bank account on the bank statement, there is no such thing, the information that will appear on your bank statement for the last 30 days if you ask for 30 days, then only all your transactions that you made in the last 30 days will appear, your full name, your bank account number, your residence address will appear, you cannot hide anything that is on the bank statement when you deliver in the casino, you cannot edit the photo.Before you send the bank statement, check if you have a password on your statement, I'll tell you again that the bank statement doesn't have anything that could make anyone other than you have access to your account, but in any case, check before sending them",

Usually when depositing with crypto it won't be a problem as long as you actually send it to the casino wallet that is provided.But if your deposit doesn't arrive, even waiting 10 days for a return so the casino asks for a bank statement to match the transaction, maybe I just assume it's the fiat you deposited.Quote from: cafter on May 11, 2023, 03:07:55 PMmy question is, is it safe to share bank account statement for verification purposes?  the site is reputable, but in bank statement all my information are available. is it safe to share?Depending on you, some even do KYC more than that by asking for proof of savings more than 6 months in advance, to be honest, I've never experienced this kind of thing.If you think the casino's reputation is good then it's legal for you, if it's a concern then it's better to avoid giving up the lost money.",

After all, the casino will protect its members' data from hacking or other bad things. Or maybe you share other documents besides the bank statements for verification purposes.

Therefore, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and ensure that there haven't been any incidents or issues with the casino in the past that may have affected gamblers, that's really important to look at. I have several questions, but I will wait for you to provide more information about the gambling site. In my experience, if it's a crypto-related gambling casino, withdrawing money shouldn't be an issue. However, if you used your bank account there might be some delay and you may be required to provide some of your personal documents.",
