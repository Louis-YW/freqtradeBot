I recommend you to learn trading yourself rather than relying on those bots. The bots are brainless and the ones who use those bots for trading purpose will definitely face huge losses. It's much better to learn trading and build your own strategy that may make you profits in long run.",

The bot tried  first to buy and sell  with some restrictions on price and percentage. To be honest, the risk is big, but it was worth it (I made $468 from $50 in a month) But writing interactions from scratch and the bot is not smart enough.",

To be honest, the risk is big, but it was worth it (I made $468 from $50 in a month) But writing interactions from scratch and the bot is not smart enough.the risk depends on the strategy followed by the bot. if he is arbitraging on some liquid currency pair, and you understand exactly line by line what the code is doing, and there are appropriate safeguards in the code (like stopbot if loss is greater than X), then the risk is practically zero. It's different than a high leverage trading bot trying to play fortune-telling by predicting subsequent ticks based on technical analysis indicators and you completle dont know whats going on in code.in my opinion, the best solution is to write a bot yourself from scratch, based on strategies that have already been manually tested and worked. The bot only automates what should work manually without it. Nowadays, there is a lot of helpful information on the Internet on how to get a grip on this topic",

The strategy of using third-party bots seems insecure and inefficient.Still, if you want to give a try you should use the test mode, On Github there can be possible more relatable result for you to test your idea.",

What kind of features are you looking for that you are looking for in a script-based trading bot? I suggest making a new thread on services if you want to commission someone to edit or make a bot for you. There is no way you can find a free one that is designed specifically for your purpose. Even if you do, there will always be some restrictions like limited API calls and so on.",

I've used ChatGPT for code generation before, and it usually doesn't do what it's supposed to do, especially for complex problems like yours. At best the code won't compile, at worst the code does something completely different than you expect and you lose your money. The same is true for Github projects that are not widely used. There, the danger is even greater, since they could be written with bad intentions and, for example, drain your coins. I would therefore also suggest that you post a request here in the services section to see if someone can program it for you cheaply. The code could then be checked by other forum members.",

Let alone having an exchange that has a little bit of volume. I haven't heard of the exchange that you posted though.Where did you see it OP?",

It will be more worth it than you looking for bots from other places that may not guarantee to work properly.From your story, you can make your own bot, which works well. With these skills, you should be able to make bots for other markets so that later, these bots can work even better. Creating the bot may take time, but if it's worth it, why not try again?Apart from that, you can be creative with the skills you have so that you can make even better bots. But it will be even better to trade manually and not rely on bots because it can help you improve your analytical skills.",

Some advanced strategies may require paid versions or demand. One of the developers developed it for you, but the essence of the problem is how to use the bot to make profits for you, and not in the bot itself.be aware of any smart trading using chatGPT as it is mostly not true.",
