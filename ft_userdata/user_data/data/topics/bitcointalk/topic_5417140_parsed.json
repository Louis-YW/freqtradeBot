Though smart investors always buy the dip and take part in promising ICO projects which can potentially become new unicorns in the crypto market. We have conducted a survey and prepared a list of TOP 5 and best upcoming ICOs of 2023 to invest in:1.   BlaBlaGame.io – Rock-Paper-Scissors GameFi based on BLA-token;2.   Ethereum – native blockchain with smart-contracts support;3.   Pulse33 – meme project;4.   SafeDancer – autonomous reward generation protocol;5.   Splyt Core – tokenization off-chain products on the blockchain.Below we will consider each Initial Coin Offering (ICO) 2023 to invest in details.1.   BlaBlaGame.io Rock-Paper-Scissors GameFiBlaBlaGame is considered to be the most promising ICO project to invest in 2023 by our experts’ opinion. This is not a financial advice but there are a few reasons for this. First of all, BlaBlaGame.io has its native token called BlaBla token which is the core element of the whole GameFi ecosystem. BlaBlaGame users can invest in BlaBla tokens through most popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, BNB, TRON, etc. It means that BlaBla Team has enough high-skill technical specialists who managed to integrate these trustful networks into one project. Secondly, BlaBlaGame already launched its first product, the game itself. This game is well-known for everyone. It's rock-paper-scissors crypto game in which everyone played in his or her childhood. Thirdly, each project and token has value only when it has well-thought token economics with number of use cases for native token. BlaBla tokens enable their users to play game with discounts, earn higher cashback payments from their own games and from their referrals ones. BlaBla token is considered to be a utility token since it has a few useful features used by its users in the system of BlaBlaGame. Fourthly, BlaBlaGame ICO has solid team members of which are presented on the website. Most of the members are from Ukraine. BlaBlaGame team is trying to deliver great results strictly following their roadmap. Part of raised funds will be allocated to charity for Ukrainian refugees. Fifthly, the team created BlaBla token economics the way so that the number of BlaBla tokens is constantly decreasing. It happens during the playing process. The system charges small fee in BlaBla tokens. It leads to decreasing of number of BlaBla tokens from circulation supply along with further price increase on trades with the time. The number of BlaBla tokens is limited and you may lose your chance since hundreds of investors already made their investment. Thus, rest assured BlaBlaGame is best upcoming ICO 2023.

Though Ethereum project it’s not that new as the previous one, it’s still a good option to invest in. The Ethereum team managed to migrate from the old Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake in Q3 2022. It decreased energy consumption by miners by about 99%. Now Ethereum can be fairly called a ‘green’ project which is ecologically-friendly to the nature. Mining process has also changed from mining on special equipment to mining within the nodes. In order to create a node, the miner has to have 32 ETH which is locked in the node. It brings passive income which doesn’t need to services equipment. Those investors who don’t have 32 ETH can always allocate their part of ETH portfolio to BlaBlaGame project to invest in BlaBla tokens.

The tokens itself is issued on Binance Smart Chain network which makes investment process cheap and fast through PancakeSwap. Anyway investors should always bear in mind that meme tokens are high-risk investments since meme tokens are not backed by real products, and you may lose all your funds. Meme tokens is just a joke and may not be considered as midterm or long-term investment. The trend for meme tokens finished in the end of 2021 after Elon Must tried to pump DOGE token through his twitter.
