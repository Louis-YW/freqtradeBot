  "content": "Guys is there any product out there that acts similar to the MYCELIUM ENTROPY device that can be used to generate bitcoin keys for cold storage wallets? Something that can be used for generating keys over and over again and is atleast semi user friendly? Any pointer in the right direction would be greatly appreciated",

      "body": "another easy way is to download either bitcoin core or electrum or samr7 vanity gen and install them on an airgapped pc and then generate your keys as well. Also, be sure that whatever device you plug into the laptop, use only once and never plug that device back into an online pc after it has been plugged into the airgapped pc. question - how are you generating them now for the coins you have assembled and sold?",

It is possible to update the firmware and write your own if you wish, so it shouldn't be too hard to make it safe again if you know what you're doing.Have a read through the user manual: https://mycelium.com/assets/entropy/me.htmlGood luck finding a 2nd hand one to buy, very rare to find them for sale now.This line from their webpage worries me more than dodgy key pairs:\"This device is not intended for use in safety-critical environments, or where its failure could lead to death, personal injury, or collapse of the Universe",
