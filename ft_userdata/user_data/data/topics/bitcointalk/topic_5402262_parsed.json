  "content": "NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. NFTs can represent real-world items like artwork and real estate. \"Tokenizing\" these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more efficient while reducing the probability of fraud. However, trading of these NFTs are not easy as one may think. In this thread, I will like to hear from the experts in the forum the way forward on how to trade NFTs with ease. Listing NFTs on it trading platforms takes longer time without any offer to buy them until the listing duration elapsed. In such cases, what is your suggestion to get these NFTs sold as fast as possible?",

      "body": "That's a problem most NFT early buyers have today. Looking for a buyer who has the hobby of buying NFTs. It's difficult, no doubt. I don't think this is the right time yet where rich people would be spending millions of dollars to buy crypto art, land, house or whatever they offer now. (mine is in gaming NFTs)You need to look for a target audience/investor, maybe a group or a messaging platform like telegram or discord where they mostly associate. But how? That's the hard part.",

It does not mean that they are the best paintings. The creators just got lucky some rich chap got convinced to splash some money to buy the item.",

Sometimes I feel this will be the next dotcom bubble that is waiting to explode. As per my understanding, if you get a whitelist position on a hyped project then only you can make profit otherwise there is zero benefit in holding NFTs for long term.",

      "body": "I think in general NFT are not traded but possessed by an individual. They are basically transferred from one individual to other in terms it’s ownership. The value is just increasing as result of higher bids during auctions. Definitely they get overvalued with such auctions like the traditional auction houses. But one thing is sure they are really really overrated for their economical point of view. I’m not big fan of NFT or in short I won’t pay huge amount for digital drawing. Rather I can get it from fiverr for few bucks. NFT does not seem to be my forward thing.",

Pretty simple — set the price offer 5-10% below the floor price; or sometimes even lower depending on how much people are trying to get out at the same time. In the first place you should expect these things to sell a bit longer, because they're non-fungible tokens.",
