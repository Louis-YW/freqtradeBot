Do you guys have any thoughts on this... plague? Until now, significant number of casinos that are quickly built so operators can start earning. Most of them are has the intent of scamming their players. It was worse around a year ago because of the number of these \"not serious\" casinos. Now, I don't see lots of them, in fact I see more start up casinos nowadays that seems to be dedicated to compete with popular brands.",

Be careful because casinos that clearly copy another are very often simple scams!!!it is certain that there is a certain similarity between some platforms/games. obviously you always have to be careful about those who copy another site because it is never a good sign of business",

I think it's also the fault of the casino website developers that are looking for an easy money, they could've recommended a complete change in the website's UI/UX to make them different from their competitors but they didn't and they just go for the easy money and just clone it. Maybe if the clients are a bit craftier then maybe we would see unique sites but given how the stuff that most casinos offer are the same, it's not their fault entirely that they're all the same.",

Do you guys have any thoughts on this... plague? In our country, it seems like every new online casino that pops up is just a copy of the ones that came before it. I don't understand why, but they all seem to have the same scheme. They don't pay their players before shutting down. Additionally, their promotions, rewards, and deposit bonuses are all identical. At first, I thought it was because they weren't earning enough to pay out, but it turned out that they were just scams. Unfortunately, even after one of these sites shuts down, another clone will eventually show up and continue the cycle of scams.",

It beckon on the gamblers to scrutinize and do their due diligence on any online casino they pick interest in before making use.  Some of the online casinos flying allover are similar to pump and dump altcoins, they had no intention of staying long in the market their plan is to gather as much as they can and disappear with users money and it's had to actually identify those of them as they do look decent from the start. Best way to stay safe gambling online is making use of old casinos that have stayed years with a good reputation.",

There was a gambling site that copied another gambling site lite version source code but with little differences, it is a local casino. In the neighboring country, I noticed a gambling site also copied the lite version source code and it is also a legit site. I make further research, they are all gambling sites that are registered and regulated and they are fiat casino. I used the one in my country before I joined this forum. Later the casino they copy change the interface of his own gambling site. But a cloned gambling site is likely to be a scam.",

Do you guys have any thoughts on this... plague? It has become easier to create a casino without putting too much effort if you primarily focus on your marketing. Many companies offer ready platforms for website management, slots providers, sportsbook providers, you have all in one to start a casino business, you only need capital to hire their platforms, services and some people for other staff. That's why many of them look like clone websites. Btw marketing looks gimmicky because that's how you promote a casino. Want to promote slots? Hire slot streamers with fake money. Want to promote sportsbet? Get a person like Drake to bet on your website. These are the best ways to promote their business and that's why everyone copies it.",

Do you guys have any thoughts on this... plague? If a casino create almost the same concept with other successful casino then avoid it since usually they are just using the successful casino's fame and provably they provably do a exit scheme in future so always stay on reputable casino which is almost suggested by anyone since this could save us for any financial damages also can make us feel safe then can assure to enjoy each time we play on their platform.If you also mean the online casino almost have similar games then its normal since they are just actually adding a common games in the market which they know can get a huge demand to a lot of people. The only thing matter the most there is how they provide some good services and how they satisfy their gamblers on their support performance in terms of solving some issues also for actively answering this inquiry when they have some question that need to clear out.",

I do not know how that is done and I do not know if a game on legit casino sites can be copied. A casino site that has no enough money or that have just established may depend on third part game providers. Many of the gambling sites that we visit, third parties provide them games. To know that, you can check the URL when you are about to play the game. You will see the URL to be very different from the gambling site. But if it is a sport gambling site, a scammer will prefer to go for such and copy the matches odds from another sport gambling site.",

Do you guys have any thoughts on this... plague? In most cases, these can be scammers. However, in many cases, it can may also be due to the lack of budget, or the casino owner having less knowledge about this related matter. In this case, many times when the casino owner hires a team with less knowledge and less budget to build a gambling website, then maybe those developers just download a template and create the website like cloning.Lately, this kind of gambling website or casino is seen a bit more. I wouldn't call all of them scammers. But if you want to know my personal opinion, then I will say that you can do your gambling wherever you feel secure. No one here will forcefully ask you to play in those new casinos. So avoid those what's looked suspicious to you. Moreover, if you want to take a try on them, take a try with a very small amount of money.",

They do not copy the game in general. They would have the same game that you will find on every casino. Some of them would change the graphics like colour or object others don't even bother to do that. Except a few big name no one has tried developing new games.

Can you tell us what type of marketing/promotion do you consider to be the opposite of \"gimmicky\"? The bonus/referral programs offered by most casinos are pretty much the only way to attract gamblers nowadays.The web design of an online casino cannot be improved any further. The online casino games cannot be \"upgraded\" by adding something new and exciting.I agree with your point, that most crypto casinos looks pretty much the same, but I don't know how any crypto casino could look different than the successful online fiat casinos.",

Some of these people might actually not be there for scamming; most of them might be there for legit business, but they are just too lazy to do their own development, or, shall I say, they don't have enough money to sponsor their own thing from scratch. I have come across a new casino that has almost every similarity to Sherbet Casino, and many other members were also able to see that on their site, which they advised their representative to make some changes to in order for it to reflect the new casino and don't make things look like an already existing casino. Most times, I believe it's from the script they use, which they just bought from some random providers online, and they don't even ask them to make some changes, or they don't even care to check if there have been any casinos making use of such designs already. Such casinos,  to me, create red flags and advise them to be avoided if they can't build their own. How can someone be sure their funds will be safe with them?",
