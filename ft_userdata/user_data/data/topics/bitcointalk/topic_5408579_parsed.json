You can find the SD card firmware from the link you posted above.Or if it doesn't work try the SD card image from awesomeminer here https://www.awesomeminer.com/antminerfirmware and then flash it again to BraiinsOS.",

I guess that you downloaded a web version where you can access BraiinsOS while the JP4 is moved/jumped to another side. You should use the right image if you want to flash it into Nand. Would you mind to try the firmware from this link https://feeds.braiins-os.org/20.09.1/ the one with the name s9 SD?",

Why not stay using it and install it on other miners?The slight increase of hashrate may be due to the ASIC boost enabled so disabling it I'm sure you will notice the difference.Just don't forget to monitor the temp or set up the temp control properly only stay at default/target temp at 89c.",

Feel free to test as much as you want. Remember that some miners were meant to use higher power than others, for example S9 11.85 vs S9j 14.5. Of course low values are safe for all of them.You can do batch installing using bos-toolbox, just make a simple text file with the list of IP addresses, one per line.Don't disable asicboost, all modern miners use it and no pools remain that can't.",
