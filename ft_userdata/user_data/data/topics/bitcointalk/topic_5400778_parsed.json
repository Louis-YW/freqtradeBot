  "content": "Today, life have taken a different phase in a way that humanity didn't imagine. A present day life where every man automatically turned a  security to himself in all spheres.With no loophole for vulnerability, not even to a closest mate or friend even for some seconds.Â In other words, ones vulnerability turns rather to an opportunity for another. No man, hardly any man wants to guide or brace up another that's in some way or the other vulnerable especially for something of high value these days.And this has made many feel betrayed.No wonder a certain man said; \"the saddest thing about betrayal is that, it never, ever, comes from your enemies.",
