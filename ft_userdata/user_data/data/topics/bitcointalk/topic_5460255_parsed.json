But I doubt if the USA women team will be able to defend and retain the title . I look forward to see astonishing results as they unfold in this year 2023 FIFA WWC. My favourite are the Nigerian women's team, even though I don't see them winning the cup am convince they will surpass the roundup sixteen stage. Cheers.",
