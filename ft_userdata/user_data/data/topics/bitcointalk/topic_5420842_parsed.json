But concerning trading, it's always greed, always want it all, there's no amount of maximization that will lead to making profits at first except one have undergone and been highlighten on proper risk management. I have been in that shoe once, and it pains to see your entire profits go down in drain due to greed and carelessness. This year, open a trading position on Bitcoin when it was at $39k, short it with futures and leverage of 30x because my account size was balance. I gain much profits and made triple of my capital, was very happy at the moment but hesitate to close it, hoping that it still surpass my TP, but before my very own eyes, I watch it smash my TP and retrace back to $45k. My account got liquidated and I was shock the whole period. Then I realized I'm in a big mess and sworn never to allow greed take control.",

Yes, one mustn't always be in the market to be profitable. One or two winning trades weekly are more than enough to keep one going as profitable as it can be.

We know that leverage trading isnt really that preferred or way too risky even if we do speak about 30x leveragewhich is something that not all could handle out even myself because it is way too risky on blowing up your entire account balance if the price would really be going into other side.You set SL? which is really that typical.It is really easy to say but doing these things is the most toughest thing for you to consider out.You cant just place up trades and wait upeven if we do speak 2-3x trade per week and also come to mind of that not all does have the big money on starting up that way.You cant just make out that full swing tradewith high leverage.It is really much better on sticking with spot if you arent sure on what you are doing.",

Especially for individual traders like me who are not rich or have a lot of money. People like me can even earn 100$-500$ and up monthly.Then as you said the market is very volatile at the same time we are still in a bear market and are still being followed by scandals like what happened in FTX, and Solana which even if we admit it or not it has affected the crypto market.",

Well that is true --and the title speaks very well.No one will want to have a huge loss but it needs to --because trading is not all about profit but it is also to gain experience which makes you a better trader. There are too many strategies to apply but you need only one of them that you think will work, don't focus on one strategy if you have failure at once or even twice. Repeating your mistakes does not make sense when it comes learning your experience in trading.",

However, positivity will help us create good decisions and will make our trading transactions smooth. We must be grateful no matter how big or small our profit is. Profit is still profit and we shouldn't feel ungrateful in case we'll gain a profit that is lower than our expectations.",

Yours might be short trading with small capital and small profit that when accumulate for a long period gives a decent results, this could be your fate when another traders lose whenever they try short time.That means for them it could be long trade with high capital. As you traded more often, you get to know which one works best for you and stick to it. Do don't follow the crowd as they're usually wrong. In summary, you could say the biggest reason you aren't making profit when you trade is because you're yet to understand what best works for you.
