  "content": "Hi I have my metamask wallet private key which is 64 characters long but not the subwallets which have been lost.I dont have the seed phrase for the main wallet. Just the private key of the parent/main wallet. Will I be able to recover any of the subwallets or generate a seed key from the main private key in order to recover the sub wallets.I do remember that you could add additional wallets assuming you had the main seed key to generate all lost wallets - unfortunately I do not have the seed - just the main private key of the number one wallet.",

If you are only having a privatekey for your wallet and this is only related to the one address but if you have no seed and you will not able to open the rest of address that already contained in your seed. You must know your seed to be able to open your wallet.",

However, I don't know if importing the keystore file will work to restore the entire wallet completely.",

You must know your seed to be able to open your wallet. Based on the OP's statement that it doesn't store other than private keys, so I agree with the above opinion that there is no hope of returning all other wallets apart from the one that can be recovered from the private key that the OP has stored.",

Only one private key/seed phrase/keystore file to access for one wallet, so as i know that there are no way to restore all of the sub wallets by one seed phrase.",
