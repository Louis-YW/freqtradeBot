Agree with post above, buying hardware wallets from unoffcial sellers maybe isn't best idea, but other stuff - why not? Personally for me it's most interesting to find deals for hosting and VPN.Last year I made list of Black Friday deals. If I will find time, I will try to do it again.",

You get like $20-30 cash back in bitcoin for purchasing a hardware wallet. Sounds stupid though — they could've just decreased the price.",
