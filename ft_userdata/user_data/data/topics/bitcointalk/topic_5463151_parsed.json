Topic: bleachedno Is The Scammer on bitify.com and Is morocco.man2. Topic: No use Escrow Service from bitify.com (for Seller).Basically, I've never used bitify.com service, so don't know 100% what happened to bitify.com service as a whole, but the several threads that I have seen, for me are enough for me to draw one conclusion, meaning that it is not feasible to be used as a means of escrow services, that is for me personally.For that, from some of the comments / reviews in your thread, of course you can draw one conclusion, all the good and bad is in your hands, for the next step.",
