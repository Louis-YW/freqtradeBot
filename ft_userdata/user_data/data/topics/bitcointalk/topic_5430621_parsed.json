Used mining equipments don't always get problems, most times it's 2% out of 100%",

If they have access to very cheap electricity, I can see the incentive to buy more affordable RIG, since ROI is just a matter of time. Assuming nothing terrible happened of course.[1] https://cointelegraph.com/news/samson-mow-bitmain-s17-t17-antminer-has-high-failure-rate",

I have seen various mining equipment advertisements on Amazon and eBay, and they also have good reviews but you know, these things can be manipulated especially on such platforms.",

Neither one worked well then I got them and neither really survived that long. But considering they did not know the history when they got them and the price was low enough it did not matter that much,Years ago I bought a bunch of S9 units used, they are still running as space heaters today. Same with the L3 I use.Bought 4 R4 straight from Bitmain. None made it 4 years. The ones I bought used although rebuilt over the years with parts from others as hash-boards / controllers died I still have 1 that was working when I put it in storage.Had a used A8 from somewhere ran it for 3 years after I got it and it was still hashing away fine when I sold it.And the price is a consideration too. If you can get 3 miners for the price of 1, then even if 2 die you are still ahead. If you pay close to full price then it's a bad deal.-Dave",

And this is a point where you should probably share some real-world experiences to make a point.New mining equipment that has just been released can be crap too, Bitmain has made a series of flops where it has released garbage miners that would break far faster than you would have expected even from a used miner, and it has done so even on already proven versions, releasing a new batch that was nothing like the previous. With used miners and trusted sellers you don't just have the price advantage but you know those were proven miners that ran for years and had no issue, so it's more like a lottery but with no real fixed odds.Quote from: joniboini on December 21, 2022, 11:39:24 AMIs there any research or data related to this?

I sometimes check the markets for mining equipment, but I don't often see equipment that are 1 to 2 years old. As a rule, older equipment is tried, this is 3-5 years old, because miners buy more modern equipment. But if you are not an engineer or you don't have partners with good engineering skills to test and maintain the equipment, then you will gain experience, not profit.",

But as you are planning on buying BTC, that's a great choice if you are a long term investor. People are yet to understand the benefit of BTC, and they are waiting for the market to go up and only then they will buy. They want to minimize the risk as low as possible. But they are forgetting that when the market goes up, it also has the chances to go down again. Don't know why they think like the way they do. Bothers me.",

In addition, if you have a bunch of devices, then you have the opportunity to replace certain elements, the same Bitmain sells components.",
