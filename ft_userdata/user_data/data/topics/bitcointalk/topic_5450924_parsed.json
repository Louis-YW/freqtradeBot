Choose any of them except XRP since it's got an active issue against SEC so, I wouldn't get my hands on it. Quote from: Wolyusi on May 02, 2023, 07:21:59 AMhow to distribute the interest on them?If you mean by interest in how you're going to like them. You DYOR and that's how you'll gain interest on them. Because without such and you're just randomly buying them, you'll have no idea of what you're doing. It can also be said by buying these, you don't get an exception just because they're the popular altcoins in the market. And another understanding from this question is how you'll distribute your allocation on them, it's up to you.",

As the poster above me already said though, a lot of people are kinda skeptical about XRP. First of all they are basically fully centralized, which stand against the true purpose of cryptocurrencies and then there also is that SEC issue.I personally think, that you can also look a little further down the coinmarketcap ranking to find good altcoin projects that are already very big and therefore pretty safe to invest but at the same time still have a little more room to grow than the projects that you have listed above. I personally like Cosmos for example, but as always DYOR.",

It moves in $10-15 per week so there's always room for profits if you don't like holding for a long time. Ethereum on the other hand is a good coin to keep. Yeah, it is also moving quite a lot recently but it will be difficult to come back if it continues to go up. Waiting for the dump session could be longer than how it is with BNB. I don't XRP anymore. I stopped using it and buying it for a long time. The SEC issue had a lot to do about that. Trust issues. It's not like it's a bad coin but there's just no assurance anymore. It could become dust if it goes wrong or it could be profitable if they win their case since many investors will probably FOMO. It's always your choice at the end of the day.",

I think XRP definitely shouldn't be considered, it is as terrible as it gets when we are talking about problems they are facing, not technically speaking or anything like that, if they had none of those legal issues then I would say it is not terrible, but I would still not prefer it, but I wouldn't say anyone else to say anything about it.But when we are talking about a situation like this, it means that XRP is facing legal trouble that prevents anyone from buying it, or at least it should. ETH and BNB on the other has nothing like that, well I wouldn't say nothing, BNB could be hurt by SEC attacking binance.us as well, not directly, and won't really change much, but at least there is a tiny small chance, a lot less than XRP though, and ETH has no problems at all.",
