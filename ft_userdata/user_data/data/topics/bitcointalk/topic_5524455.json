  "content": "I believe that Bitcoin and other digital currencies will face a choice: become part of the system that cooperates with law enforcement or lose 95% of it's investors.I realize there are \"Bitcoin OG\" or \"hardcores\" here that feel that a centrally-regulated Bitcoin goes against everything it originally stood for, but if people are given a choice between that or their investment going down by 95%, they are going to... let the government do what it wants .These days there are probably almost nobody is using Bitcoin to avoid their government, which is what it was originally designed to do: most just think of it as an investment that will yield them a profit. And they pay taxes on their gains, and/or report their holdings to their government just like they would if they bought stocks or commodities.It's also worth noting that regulations in democracies mostly stem from some kind of crisis or emergency. When the US financial system had major problems in 2008--and millions of people lost their retirement savings--then Congress responded with lots of new regulations. The FTX scandal prompted a lot of regulations for the digital asset world, and I suspect that work isn't yet done. And now that there are major companies buying US elections like they did in 2024, companies like Ripple, Coinbase, Binance etc. are working every day in Washington to create new regulations that benefit them and disadvantage their competitors. These companies have a financial interest in centralized control as well--even while they go on about the \"anti-government\" Bitcoin religion in their advertisements.For me, this portends more and more regulation around Bitcoin and other digital currencies--and the era where criminals can successfully use these products coming to an end. This will be very good for the price of Bitcoin in the long run--which is another reason why it will happen.",

There's a lot of coins stored in exchange, I think more that there is in self custody, but there's still a good number that have retained their custody.I get that many still do self-custody (although I don't think it's a lot in terms of volume and I think it's rapidly evolving away from that in any case), but to actually obtain the Bitcoin in the first place these days usually requires KYC, and I suspect it will get harder and harder (and more and more illegal) to get Bitcoin any other way, or to spend it.I could imagine, for instance, a similar law that the US currently has around physical cash deposits, wherein if the amount is >$10k the receiver must report the transaction to the government.Imagine that, in reaction to some bad thing that happened using Bitcoin and money laundering, Congress proposed such a law. Who would oppose it? Not the giant crypto companies that just bought the 2024 election, that's for sure. In fact, I suspect it would be those companies that would actually write the law. QuoteAs long as there is still decentralized services, the privacy hardcores will have a way to hold and trade without using centralized exchanges. This could create a distinction in Bitcoin, between those under the radar and those duly accounted for.I get that--although I suspect most criminals* these days use something like Monero and not Bitcoin. But again, I suspect that from a volume perspective, this is a tiny portion of the total Bitcoin investment, and thus a tiny portion of Bitcoin's $2T market cap.(* I'm using the word \"criminals\" here to mean anybody who has a specific need to evade their government--in some countries and situations this is not necessarily a bad thing).Quote from: legiteum on December 27, 2024, 07:01:41 PMRegulations =/= secure or safer. Criminals use a lot of regulated services today still.Sure, but human beings have laws to prevent crime, and it mostly works. There are laws against murder, but there are still murders--but that doesn't mean we should just make murder legal.For average investors, regulations are a good thing because they can just invest without worrying they will get ripped off most of the time.Indeed, regulated markets are bigger markets for that reason.",

There's no need of government approval in order to invest or buy your coins. If you know your way in this market, you can trade anytime that you want. Sure, regulation is coming as this market is going mainstream. Hence, complying to the government is being expected already. People will also have more confidence dealing on this market if their government has specific mandate towards this market. It means, they are already recognizing the existence of this in the financial market.",

But i doubt if an asset like bitcoin can lose 95% of it's investors if there were to be no regulations.

But that doesnt negate Bitcoin's fundamental properties. The fact that people pay taxes on gains does not mean the underlying tech has changed. It simply means they are operating within the existing legal framework.",

Maybe you don't know that some investors even want Bitcoin to be regulated so that the reate of crime using Bitcoin could go minimal. The adoption is already increase and we are going to be seeing some strict regulations soon which does not mean that it will lose the adoption.

They could paraventurely decide to cut off their fiats from every exchange and then it would become frustrating for exchange transactions.But if you ask me. I will tell you that I don't give a damn fuck with the threats that one day the government will impose a regulatory order which may linger to lost of values when investors began flew away. You can always count me in as a strong hold of bitcoin enthusiasts who is alternatively executing my transactions with the non custodial wallets. Thereby I can also run my p2p transactions which I believe would turn out for enthusiasts a great option and fuck off the central exchanges with the governments regulatory policies",

People say bitcoin can be more safe when regulated and I ask how safe is the fiat currency which is already under regulation and been controlled already, is it not same currency which is been looted by politicians or criminals without traces?
