Since this is a thread you specifically opened here in the gambling section of the forum for the sake of advertisement, I believe it would have been appropriate for you to work a bit on a proper ANN and also pay copper membership, so you are able to share images within your posts. Keeping that aside, I would like to ask better your service would me willing to provide to special bonuses for users of this forum or some kind of additional perks for this community. It is a common practice, I think, for new services around here to try to catch our attention by giving some special treat. Anyways, I hope your gambling service goes well. Be aware you also have the option to hire a professional manager here in the forum to help you out with advertisement. Cheers. !",

I hope that you would build a good reputation here in the forum, so that you can gain the trust of forum members. It will be nice to see the games in your casino as I will check it out after this post. You are welcome to the forum.",

So, your site is about gambling sites, and not about gaming sites.I see is just another affiliate farm, and isn't a bad idea at all, that's a way to get affiliates/referrals, and with the right marketing, you can make some nice profit from it, so, good luck with your project.",

I would rather bring people to this forum if they are looking out for a new online casino to start using for bets, if it's not advertised through this platform I won't use it, there are so many fake online casinos out there, and one needs to be very careful.",

That's why I advise you to create your own thread to talk about your casino. You said that your casino operates in Australia, but your casino doesn't have any license issued by the Australian government, the only thing I see is talking about the Curacao license, you can see it in this photo:source:  https://yojucasino.bet/Your casino is operating in Australia but does not have a license issued by the Australian government and your casino does not follow the laws of Australia, it is following the laws of Curacao because it has a license from Curacao. Can you explain this? How is it possible for the Australian government to allow your casino to be operated in Australia without a license?To make it clearer, here is what Australia's laws say about gambling:Quote from: https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/australiaOperator Licence: An operator licence is required to conduct the following gambling activities in Australia:casinos;retail wagering (Retail Wagering), under which licence holders (Retail Wagering Licensees) offer: (i) pari-mutuel (totalisator) betting on racing (thoroughbred, harness and greyhound) and some sports; and (ii) fixed-odds betting on racing, virtual/simulated racing, sports and other approved events.Â  With the exception of virtual/simulated racing (which is generally only offered in retail venues, including hotels and clubs), such betting is generally offered at racecourses, retail venues, online and by telephone.Â  The current Victorian Wagering and Betting Licence includes not only wagering and betting, but also the right to conduct a betting exchange (although the licence holder has not elected to do so);lotteries;keno; andinstant lotteries to persons in Australia: These operator licences are all state or territory-based and are typically monopolistic or very limited in numbers.Â  In addition, these licences also commonly have exclusivity periods attached to them.source: https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/australiaQuote from: https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/australiaBookmaker Licence: Aside from Retail Wagering conducted by Retail Wagering Licensees, bookmaking in Australia is only permitted under a sports bookmaker or similar licence, which are commonly issued in the NT (Corporate Bookmaker Licence), or, alternatively, an on-course bookmaker licence issued in a state or territory (On-course Bookmaker Licence) to an individual (or sometimes incorporated) bookmaker licensed by the relevant racing controlling body (On-course Bookmaker).Â  There is no limit on the number of Corporate Bookmaker Licences that may be issued and Corporate Bookmakers are only permitted to operate online and via telephone.Â  By comparison, in a practical sense, there is a limit on the number of On-course Bookmaker Licences that are capable of being issued (based on available stands).Â  On-course Bookmakers can accept bets on-course, as well as over the telephone and via the internet where appropriately licensed. Fantasy sports betting in Australia is typically permitted under a Corporate Bookmaker Licence issued in the NT. source: https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/australiaQuote from: https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/australiaApplication for a Licence and Licence Restrictions2.1 What regulatory licences, permits, authorisations or other official approvals (collectively, âLicencesâ) are required for the lawful offer of the Relevant Products to persons located in your jurisdiction?Casino table gaming and gaming machines, Retail Wagering, lotteries and keno all require an operator licence, which is typically long-dated and is granted by the relevant Australian state or territory.Bookmaking requires a Corporate Bookmaker Licence or an On-course Bookmaker Licence.source: https://iclg.com/practice-areas/gambling-laws-and-regulations/australiaSo this means you need to have a license issued by the Australian government.
