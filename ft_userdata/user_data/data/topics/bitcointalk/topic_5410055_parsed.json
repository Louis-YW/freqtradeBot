  "content": "The recent report by  Bloomberg  that Nigerians accumulating cryptocurrencies to shield assets against a weakening naira have contributed to a slump in the fiat currency to a record low in the unauthorized market got my attention. The news reminded me of the blame game of the government of my country. My government is always quick to blame cryptocurrencies for the fall of our currency. But they fail to understand that people prefer Bitcoin because they have lost confidence in the stability of our currency. Converting our currency to Bitcoin is the effect of the fall in the value of our currency and not the cause of it. There are many factors that have led to the fall of our currency and cryptocurrency is not at the top of the list.In February 23, 2021, my country’s Central Bank Chief appeared before the parliament to defend the bank’s directive to all commercial banks which forbids them to use, hold, trade or transact in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The apex bank claimed that these currencies are used for many illegal activities including fraud/ money laundering, ransom collection by kidnappers, terrorism financing and purchase of small arms and light weapons, and tax evasion. He also went further to state that dealings using cryptocurrencies threaten the soundness of our countries’ financial institutions which might lead to the depreciation in value of our national currency. From the above, the Central Bank Chief informed the Parliament that banning Bitcoin and other crypto currencies would lead to the decrease of 1.   Fraud and money laundering2.   terrorism financing/ ransom collection by kidnappers3.   tax evasion and4.   depreciation of national currency value.I might not be able to defend or talk much about the third point because he might be correct but the other three challenges he outlined that the restrictions of Bitcoin operations would reduce are far from the truth.Fraud and money laundering: Immediately after the ban, it was reported that four deposit money banks in my country lost a total of N1.77bn to fraudulent activities involving the banks’ employees  and consumers in 2021. The bank incurred due to fraudulent activities rose by N337.5m from N174.40m recorded in 2020. And none of these fraud cases was crypto related; all of them were carried out through physical or online fiat transactions. In fact the main master-minders of fraud and money laundering in my country are government officials. Several cases of fraud or money laundering activities of government officials have been widely reported. But on Monday, May 16, 2022, the country’s anti-corruption agency arrested the serving Accountant General  of the Federation (who was meant to be the main anti-fraud crusader), in connection with diversion of funds and money laundering activities to the tune of $136,752,137. The AGF had raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members and close associates. And the funds were laundered through real estate investments in different parts of the country. Yet the government would want to blame young Bitcoiners for the increase of fraud and money laundering.Terrorism financing and ransom payments: Just recently the government of my country criminalized payment of ransom to kidnappers and bandits. Anyone that is convicted of ransom payment would be sentenced to 15years imprisonment. But the  government  has been accused of hypocrisy; people argue that top government officials secretly paid ransom to secure the release of their loved ones while other victims from poor families were left at the mercy of their abductors. An example is the recent kidnapping of over 61 train passengers and $170,000 was paid secretly for the CEO of the Bank of Agriculture. A report stated that based on what could be verified, between July 2021 (after the ban on Bitcoin transactions) and June 2022, no fewer than 3,420 people were abducted across my country, an increase of more than 100%. In the ensuing period, $9,806,306.31 was demanded in exchange for the release of captives while a fraction of that sum ($1,126,126.13) was paid as ransom. And most of these funds are paid in cash. An example is the testimony of one of the notorious bandits’ leaders who carried out the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls at the Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe town in Zamfara State in February 2021 who revealed that the Nigerian government coughed up approximately $102,561 cash before they (the bandits) freed the girls.The bandits’ leader in an interview with BBC Africa Eye, when asked what they did with the money, simply stated that they used the money to acquire more rifles and other deadly weapons for subsequent operations (Purchase of small arms and light weapons).Depreciation of national currency value: One of the cardinal reasons for the current drastic  depreciation  of our national currency is because of the primaries of the two leading political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Aspirants mopped up dollars across the country that would be used to buy votes from delegates and other critical stakeholders instead of carrying big bags. The  Vanguard gathered that a number of delegates smiled home with amounts ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 each and total of 7,800 delegates will participate in the primary of the APC and 3,700 will determine the flag bearer of the PDP. Even when several professional bodies warned that this dollar mop-up would cripple the value of our currency the country’s apex bank was still making the dollars available to their “political allies. But recently the government blamed Bitcoin for the fall of our currency and never mentioned that our currency has been depreciating since April because of the huge pressure on the naira because politicians share dollars, especially to delegates. According to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on  medical  and $2.9 billion annually on education, a development described by experts as a huge drain on the country’s foreign reserves. A government that cannot fixed the health and educational system so as to limit the pressure on the country's currency is always blaming Bitcoin. It might be true that Bitcoin can be misused or abused by some individuals or organization which might affect the economy, but portraying Bitcoin  as one of the major cause of the country’s economic woes is untrue.  .",

But before Bitcoin exist fraud, money laundering, and terrorism are still there with the use of fiat money. Question: If fiat money can be used to those stuffs, why all people trust and still use fiat until now?Tax evasion is depends on each person, even they're not using Bitcoin, they can evade tax by following the whole procedure in order to not pay income tax. They're using the advantages of country without income tax.Inflation is because of printing money, not Bitcoin. That's a dumb analogy from your government.",

I most dislike what did by my government because they have been blame with banned all global exchange market but keep take tax with cryptocurrency transaction.",

Instead government and her terrible policies did. As as far a the 90's a certain head of state embezzled billions of dollars from Nigeria and stashed in several countries all over the world. Did bitcoin cause this? There's also the news of the of a former accountant general of the federation being arraigned in court for overN109.4 billion fraud. Is bitcoin responsible for this?

Ridiculous.Actually, it's not that ridiculous if Nigerians would be indeed buying cryptocurrencies at a record level, which is not really happening, $2 million in trades a day is peanuts.But now, about depreciation, yes it can happen because Bitcoin is a global commodity, so Nigerians buying bitcoins are offering their Naira for sale, but the rest of the world from which Nigerians are acquiring BTC are obviously not wanting those and so all that gets exchanged into a currency with a demand, that being the USD. So you have a shitload of Naira that nobody wants to get exchanged and so driving the exchange rate down. Nothing really ridiculous or out of this world, this is how economies like Venezuela and Iran are crashing down because nobody wants their currencies but everyone in the country wants $, the same happend with the Weimar Republic in 1923 when they tried to buy foreign currency with printed money but ended up with nobody wanting to exchange that for their useless paper notes.But again, Nigerians are not buying 1 billion worth of crypto from other countries a week to have any kind of effect on the economy.",

The only 'abuse' that is worthy of being highlighted in Nigeria is the government's gross and constant abuse of power and poor policies, that is exactly what is to blame for some of the economic crisis and other whatnots that's affecting the country, her econony and currency. The Nigerian government is famous for following the bandwagon, they know in their case Bitcoin isn't the cause of anything negative in the country, but since there is somewhat of a worldwide effort by governments the world over to taint the image of Bitcoin, thus they want to support that movement.",

The population of Nigeria are looking all over for people to blame for the unrest and poor state of the economy, in reality it might be held back by religion in certain circumstances - like we see the lawless state in the Northern regions. However it's much easier to target an innate object like a currency than actually take action against charismatic opposition figures who might be a challenge. Like drugs in America, if they stopped waging \"war\" and treated it in the proper way it would take much less energy and effort to defeat.",
