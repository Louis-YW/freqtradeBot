  "content": "Well, regarding my title, I don't know what you guys think, but you can drop your opinion (it could be a disagreement or argument). Just drop your opinion.First of all, I acknowledge the fact that there are different calibers of humans all over the world; some people hold great official power in different offices, companies, etc. Some people are also so extremely rich that they don't lack anything that money can buy, while others are so extremely poor that they need God to answer their prayers so that their wishes may come true. Some people are not too rich, but they are living a comfortable lifestyle with their families, and they are content with what they have and what they can afford.Another thing is that some people are having some health challenges that they have been battling with for a long time, while others are living very healthy but have other personal challenges.Most unhealthy people, directly or indirectly, might have been the cause of their health issues. For example, some people take different kinds of hard drugs, abuse their alcoholic intake, smoke cigarettes, abuse their daily diet (food abuse), abuse different things, and yet they are ignorant of going for medical checkups too.Do you agree that there are some people that the doctor will advise to avoid the intake of some things, but they will hide in secret to still take those things they were warned not to?There's a saying that \"money can buy a lot of things for man's use, but at some point, money cannot buy life.\" If money could buy life, so many rich people (or their child) died, and money could not buy them a new, fresh life like they have lived from their childhood to old age.There's also another saying that goes, \"Make hast while it's daytime.\" Another says, \"Whoever makes no plan, plans to fail.\"Some people actually made different good plans when 2023 started, but it did not work out. That doesn't mean they must give up.As our faces are different, that's how we all have different problems, different wishes, different plans, different expectations, different desires, different goals, and differences in majority of things if not everything.There are some plans, goals, and desires that some of us could not archive this year, and the year is coming to an end. We have to try again next year, and as such, it is very important to make new-year resolution plans.Thanks for reading. Drop your opinion.",

What I do is that I just write it all out knowing fully well that I'm not always all that disciplined enough to work them all out to fruition, I still make sure that I write it all out and at the end of the day, I find out I have accomplished a reasonable part of it.The secret behind writing down your plan is that sometimes you might just check it out and see that you are not putting in the needed effort to making your plane come to reality and you pick yourself up at that spot and start doing things right again. As a religious person, I have been administer to write out my vision very clearly and pray over it then work on it and that it will come through and this has been helping me in it own little way",

I had so many plans for this year but most of them don't come to pass not because of my fault but due to unpredictable events. I never knew that my country's currency would lose close to fifty per cent of its value. I also didn't foresee that the government would stop subsidising some important products like petroleum. All these unpleasant economic events affected my plans negatively and it became difficult to meet some of them. However, I am pleased with the little I achieved. I still have my projections for next year and I am very hopeful that my plans will all be executed. Having a New Year resolution is fine but we must focus more on implementing our plans. We have to avoid procrastination to ensure that we follow the plans. Breaking down our yearly plan into daily, weekly and monthly tasks will also be good. We should have a weekly and monthly plan and our daily activities should be focused on achieving them. Next year, I am not going to push myself too hard like this year. I will give more time to my health, family and other relationships. I might even consider going on my first vacation and visiting another country. Life is not all about making money, we need to take good care of ourselves.",

      "body": "Actually making a new year resolution is good but it in the end you have to intentional about it nothing comes without discipline. Most of the new year resolution or life goals fails because such individual was never intentional or diligent about it. The bad habits we mostly have are still with us even after we discovered it as a flaw because we have never been diligent and intentional about it and it will continue to affect knowingly and unknowingly till it may finally destroy us, pray it never get to this though. The truth is I have an habit which has caused me more harm lately and I knew about it but didn't think it will get worse to this point but all I can say is that I pray God gives me the strength to just be victorious over it and I have taken it up to be overcome not as a new year resolution since I don't usually make a yearly resolution. Every bad habits or addiction start as a good and pleasing to us till it starts harming us and the fact is most people fails to overcome this till their death pray God help us all",

Even though there are obstacles, I agree with remaining grateful for the achievements that have been achieved even though they do not meet expectations.Â Hopefully next year will bring a positive impact and greater success for all of us.",

But when that happens, it's crucial not to throw in the towel. We have to learn from our stumbles, adapt our strategies, and keep pushing forward.What makes life so beautiful is the incredible diversity of human experiences. Each of us has our own unique story, challenges, and dreams. This means there's no one-size-fits-all answer to life's questions. What works for one person might not work for another.As the year draws to a close, it's natural to reflect on what we've accomplished and what hasn't panned out the way we hoped. We may have checked some goals off our list, while others might still be waiting in the wings. That's all part of the journey. The key is to learn from both our successes and failures and use those lessons to guide our future plans.",

Ironically sometimes if you don't hold on to the resolutions too tight you get to achieve and I think when we make such resolutions and we achieve 50% of it we should still give ourselves kudos to try doubling effort next year. The next year is fast approaching and if we know the areas we didn't have good performance then we can strengthen ourselves by not doing the same thing we did. If you keep doing same thing same way then we are likely to get same result other than the change we want.A new year resolution is a call for action, it is suppose to quicken our efforts to greater achievement at least 50% above should be better achievement.",

There's no need to achieve those in just the first month of the year, haven't done all your goals doesn't mean you failed, as long as you have progress that's good, also remember that there's a 12 months in a year which you can use to reach that goal. Still, I agree that if don't have any action with your plan, for sure it would be another new years resolution in the end of a year. No need to compare your plan to others just focus in your own improvement.",

Drop your opinion.Everyone has struggles in life and goals they want to achieve. We need to plan to achieve these goals. Acting without a plan can lead us to an outcome we do not want. Sometimes we cannot realize our plans, but we must still try to implement them.It is not possible to progress without a goal, and achieving the goal within plans rather than doing things by chance allows us to achieve a more solid result. There may be some difficulties in all of our lives. We must overcome these difficulties with our efforts, and for this we must make it a habit not to give up.Discipline and patience should always be among the rules we must follow. But even though I say all these things, sometimes life can bring us to a point we don't want. If we have reached a bad point as a result of our mistakes, we must try to correct the situation with our own efforts.",

This is why im not really that a fan when it comes on having those resolution because it do really sucks if you do try to look back on the things which you are really that tending to do but ending up on failing on doing so just because of some circumstances. Trying out to make one is really that some sort of motivation but everything would really be that ending up on how you would be dedicated on making those things real.If you do find yourself on having those resolution could actually be able to solve out some problems that you do have in the past then you would definitely be doing it on next year.Now that the year is nearly ending then it would really be that relevant on what we are trying out to do now.",
