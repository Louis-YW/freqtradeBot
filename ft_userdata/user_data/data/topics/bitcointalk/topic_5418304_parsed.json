This promotion will be valid until 8 November 2022.So, if you are in the EU, the Trezor One will now cost you around €70, while Trezor T is approximately €220.The reason for this is the introduction of Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) in Trezor Suite. Their term for it is Bitcoin savings account. Most already know that using the DCA investment strategy means buying a fixed USD/EUR amount of an asset at a fixed time. That can be once a week/month/year, etc.Source: https://blog.trezor.io/save-bitcoin-with-dca-in-trezor-suite-6ce8f6a2ce75",

I don't see it happening.A 20% discount (for Black Friday) is quite possible and it will be a little more profitable than 15%. In the last 2 years (2020 and 2021), Trezor made a 20% discount for its customers on Black Friday.Here are links to information about it:https://www.cryptocurrencyposters.com/trezor-black-friday-cyber-monday/https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-black-friday-deals-2021-6550e15305acIt is difficult to say whether there will be a similar discount this year, because there was one year (I don’t remember exactly) when Trezor and their competitor represented by Ledger didn't make any Black Friday discounts for their products at all. If I'm not mistaken, this was one of the years of a deep bearish trend. So, either be content with a 15% discount, or wait for a 20% discount in 1 month if it is not canceled.In my opinion, 15% is not bad at all if you are going to spend money on a HW device in the near future.",

This is just speculation, of course.  New Trezor model will probably appear in this time next year, and that is my optimistic prognosis, if world economy don't collapse until them, and full production maybe starts in early 2024.That doesn't mean they should follow steps of bad competition and retire devices all the time like old socks.Maybe upgrading Trezor One with bigger memory (like in model T) would be better option to keep it alive, affordable and functional in future.",

That wouldn't be bad since the old Trezor model doesn't have the hardware strength to cope with certain coins and can't support them. But a hardware upgrade would certainly affect the price, which could then go above €100 maybe.

I remember when Ledger introduced a similar partnership with a crypto company and we compared the rates offered through Ledger Live against what was offered on the official site. The spread was always worse in Ledger Live for the exact same trading pair compared to what you could get on the official exchange. These kind of partnerships are about additional revenue for the manufacturers after all.",

The secure elements we find in today's hardware wallets are closed-source, but Trezor and their partners are trying to change that. I guess they realized early on that 100% open-source isn't going to be possible, so the wording they used in some of their public announcements was \"as open-source as possible\". It's going to be interesting to see how Wallet Scrutiny and other parties classify the new type of wallets once they eventually come out.",

These are some reasons for which I can understand a higher price. Personally, I believe even 200€ or more for a Bitcoin-only device (less maintenance of coins, smaller codebase, less potential for bugs...) can be worth it.Basically, with any such device, you're buying a signer with secure storage of your seed and a pretty good level of security against software and hardware attacks. If you don't need this convenience, you can very securely store your seed on paper in multiple physically secure locations.You don't really pay for the security (as you said, it can be achieved for much less), but for convenient security. Having access to your coins from a mobile device on the go, without exposing the keys to software or prying eyes, for example.Unfortunately, people from financially weaker countries can't afford a lot of things, but by giving up some convenience, they can still use Bitcoin very securely for cheap.",

The Model T was released in February 2018. - An achieve from June 2018 shows a price of €149. - A second achieve from November 2019 shows the same price. - In December 2020, the price was up to €180.- In October 2021, an achieve shows €164. So, the price went down for some reason. - And the last one I checked was April 2022 with a price of €249.",

It's often trivial to read out the flash storage, alter or even reflash the firmware and similar, since that's what they're basically made for. I guess it is still better than a hot wallet and more convenient than a paper seed; just make sure to safeguard those things at all times.But who knows, maybe really secure, cheap to acquire, microcontroller boards will emerge and really give hardware wallets a run for their money.",

It may turn out to be 15% -20% more realistic, that is, exactly the discount that you can usually get during Black Friday or now. Well, maybe a little more. So what am I on about? And to the fact that if there is already a discount, then it is naive to wait for an even greater discount, believing that it will be much more significant than the current one. Moreover, it is not known when and whether there will be this discount. Why is the current discount dissatisfied, if model T is your preference?",

I was just complimenting the device, not expressing a desire to purchase it right now. Because of its design flaws and unfixable vulnerabilities, I don't think it's worth close to $250. It's still an excellent product that deserves its place on the podium among the winners.",

Added to this drop in the price I would also expect other chances to buy a model T with seasonal offer, let us say 10-15%.So in the case it would be a discount of 30% and in the worst case it would be around 15%.
