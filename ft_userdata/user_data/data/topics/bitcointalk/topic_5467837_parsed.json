      "body": "That's a tough one. The FTX crash was a terrible incident that not only made a lot of people lose great amounts of money but also dented trust in cryptocurrencies and centralized exchanges. Fortunately, I believe that the market recovered quite quickly, and the long-term effects have been minimal in terms of trust and the general condition of the market. However, it adds to the list one more exchange that has failed and led to detrimental effects in the cryptocurrency community.Personally, I'd say the Terra crash was one of the worst I've experienced so far. There was a total frenzy on social media with people asking questions, hoping that a solution was to be found, but ultimately, billions of dollars went down the drain within a few hours. Fortunately, I didn't lose much because I managed to get rid of my UST when it recovered for an hour or two before proceeding to crash to its death shortly after. However, waking up and seeing that you have lost over $400 in value wasn't a pleasant feeling.",

Such events are bound to happen again and serve as a marker to avoid centralized exchanges and opt for the alternative.There is also the rise of side projects like ICOs, DeFi etcetera. While they made a few rich, they wrecked a lot more people and served to benefit the founders and developers, but it's a personal decision to put money in such gambles and more of such will always spring up.I will probably undo government involvements in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency of which the users do not have control over.

Example is the FTX that you mentioned, before the hack, people were told not to leave funds on centralized exchanges, but they will not listen. If they will have money on exchanges, it should not be more than the trading fund which they can also afford to lose.Another one that people will not have wanted are the Luna, UST and other depegged stable coins, the Mt. Got and Cryptopia exchanges hacked. There are many other exchanges that were also hacked. Nowadays, there are also many DeFi hack and many like that.
