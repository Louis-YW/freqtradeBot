Quote from: Betcrypto.cr on May 08, 2023, 04:52:11 AMWelcome bonuses , cashback , freespins etc ?or what kind of rewards would you like to see in an online casino ?Thanks All the listed bonuses systems are welcomed development a d their and easily attract new players, especially the no deposits bonuse, and you can have different conditions for different bonuses system, so the player is left with the option to choose from them which he most preferred. e.g the no deposit bonus could come with 5x wagering requirements, but a. Deposit bonus could come with a minimal wager requirement like 1x conditions, another bonus system you failed to mention but is very important also is the rakeback bonuses mechanism, this way the player gets a percentage return on the total wagered amount to continue playing with just implement this and build a good reputation and your casino is good to go. .",

When you get 100 or 200% bonus on your first deposit it's a great way to get to know the casino. Even if you are unfamiliar with a game and lose some money at first you won't feel bad about due to bonus. A high welcome bonus is also a good way for casinos to be competitive with each other. Unfortunately most of us here on the forum are regular gamblers and don't apply anymore for the welcome bonus as we have played on most of the big casinos already. That is why it would be great to get some special bonuses for recurring gamblers that are already customers at your casino. Cashback is one form of it, but that usually depends on how much money you have and how much you gamble with. Instead it would be better to have some bonuses that are independent of our bankroll. Freespins are probably the best way for that as it gives everybody the exact same opportunity.",

Freebitco.in has been giving away 1 free WoF spin to the active players and It is pretty fun. I actually hit some pretty big rewards like golden tickets. Welcome bonuses and cashbacks are cool too but free stuff is always the best. You know what they say \"You gotta spend money to make money.\" and freebitco.in just delivers that. They give away so much free stuff, in the end they make more than what they give. The other casinos should learn from their example.",

A 1$ bonus in any form without any wagering requirements is better than a 100 bucks with high wagering requirements that is very hard to claim. Gamblers usually not interested on the bonus once the saw the requirements while some that got excited usually regret they action after seeing the requirements.Make the requirements friendly even with low amount reward. Iâm sure many will be interested to participate on your promotion.",

Anything lower than x30 would do a thing I guess, and I would definitely give it a try.",

I like this kind of discussion, it can help.To encourage more people into your gambling site, welcome bonus of 100% deposit is good. There are many gambling sites that are offering that. Monthly bonus to gamblers that have lost very much. In a way that you will still make profit and also the rules set should make it difficult to win such matches in a way they will be able to gain and withdraw the money made from the bonus.Rakeback is part of it.
