  "content": "I have always dreamed of accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment since the year 2017 even before I became a master in my money-making haven ( fashion designer ) and now the time has finally come, today I start accepting Bitcoin payments. Yippy 💥💥💥Truthfully only three of my customers are willing to pay me in Bitcoin for now and that's because I was even the one that teach them about Bitcoin since last year 2021 and now they are also investors too. I believe that as time goes on many will develop an interest as well. There are too many people that don't know anything about Bitcoin here, few who knew about it call it a scam, I blame that on lack of knowledge but some are willing to listen and learn, I will keep doing what I do best.Bitcoin adoption all the way, 2023 should be better, hopefully, I want to use this opportunity to say a big Thank You 🙇 to families on here, your share of knowledge reshaped me,  I wish you guys a Merry Xmas 🎄 and a Happy New Year in Advance.",

      "body": "the key to getting locals near you some acceptance of bitcoin is to help bitcoin locally. bitcoin has no brain. its just code after all. it has no arms or legs or body. no one is coming to your location to help, its the people in the area that have to promote it locally to get it accepted locallya few idea's are (such as the pamphlet idea in the other post)find local traders that are selling bitcoin where people can buy bitcoin from them. make it easy for them to buy bitcoin by listing how to get bitcoinlist some local places that accept bitcoinif there is only 1 currently. then ask all those you know what is their regular retailer/service they visit where there is a common theme or desire to want that commonly used business to accept bitcoin(demand) and teach that store about bitcoin, putting the store in touch with an exchange or local service/person willing to swap that stores bitcoin income into fiat to resupply stock.here in the UK we have 'business networking' events where people meet up over coffee to discuss their business and how other businesses can help each others business grow to expand the local eco-systembasically start your own local community and get people networking together for a common goal.\"the world is your oyster\"can you find 2 people one thats a major bitcoin buyer, someone to convert bitcoin to fiat for other businessesone thats a major bitcoin seller, someone to convert fiat to bitcoin for other businessesorcreate a co-operative of multiple people that club together as micro buyers/sellers to work together to do swaps as neededor a CEX(centralised exchange) for bitcoin that handles your countries fiat type that can do the swapsthen when you have the easy access in and out of bitcoin locally and easy to describe how to get it/sell it, then get the local retailers/services to get onboard tooonce you have more locals involved your local customerbase paying you in bitcoin will expand and your employees accepting bitcoin as a wage will be more happy in accepting it as they will have ways to buy something locally or swap locally. thus expanding the bitcoin eco-system in your areasome people start slow. such as pitting a small 5% of employees income into bitcoin as a form of pension savings amount",

I would like to see how this ends though Yeah the first time I noticed the two ladies, I already think that they are workers not customer.  They have the measuring tape, the uniform ( see their outfit).  The two girl are helping @OP in flashing the Bitcoin accepted here board.  Btw, @OP it would be nice if you create a banner or a tarpaulin with Bitcoin accepted here design and much better if you can put on the entrance of your store.  It will surely attract attention and curiosity to those who are new with the Bitcoin payment system.",

I like the initiative, three customers is a good start. I don’t like the positioning of the “bitcoin accepted here” stickers, there are in a dark corner of the room and it isn’t that visible. The stickers are good but it will be better if you make a bigger banner just outside your store that’s say you accept bitcoin or you reposition the stickers you already have and put them on the front door, that would create more visibility and attract more people.",

The fact that a fashion designer developed this concept in her community is not necessarily a bad thing. Don't bruise her ego in her efforts in of sharing this wonderful news with us. You wouldn't expect her to call out her entire region to her bitcoin dealer; this is only for a start (three persons). Gradually it will become known that she accepts bitcoin as means of payment.",

Unlike with other businesses which requires huge amount of raw materials; it is sewing which is somehow being paid in BTC, I think, in this case so it would work more efficiently. Why? In food buisnesses who'd accept cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, perhaps, would somehow struggle because raw materials will be always needed, therefore, btc payments should also circulate on raw stocks to run that business. In fashion designing, (please correct me if I'm wrong), it is the talent of the designer which is more being paid in most instances so I hope accepting btc as a payment would work smoothly for your business.",
