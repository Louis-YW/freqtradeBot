So, with all of these combined circumstances, I guess that's what is clear of what's going on to them. As those things are added to each occurring, it only means that FTX is really nowhere to go and there won't be any single company that would like to help them. Oh well, at least one there's another one that I've seen wanting to help them and that's Justin Sun. I don't know if that's going to make a difference and let's see if his help will be taken or not or if it is, we shall see if it will really help them.",

For controversy they are facing on and how hard the lives of people still have balance on their exchange for sure they will curse them and tell that they will never go back if FTX will get a revive in future. Many people leaving then already because there reputation are so ruined with this incident. Also the fud spread about hacking is really bad since this will add the burden of people and thinking about negative about the whole market which can affect all investor since many think that it will dump more because of this huge issues.",

All this looks pre planned. SBF donate for Bidens election campaign, Alameda CEO's dad works in SEC so she has direct connect with them too. SBF's mother was congress campaign manager.
