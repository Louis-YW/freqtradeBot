  "content": "The crypto community reacted with a mix of disbelief and amusement after reality star Kim Kardashian was fined for promoting the cryptocurrency EthereumMax (EMAX). The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined Kardashian $1.26 million on Oct. 3, for “touting on social media” about the EMAX without disclosing she was paid $250,000 to post about it.Kardashian has neither admitted to nor denied the SEC’s allegations, but settled the charges and agreed to not promote any cryptocurrency assets until 2025.SEC chairman Gary Gensler tweeted the fine was a reminder that celebrity endorsement of investment opportunities doesn't “mean those investment products are right for all investors.”(Source: Cointelegraph)",

No doubt if SEC was charging him back with more than one millions USD as fines for his action to promote the scam crypto. This proves that celebrity cares only money but they didn't even care with what happened with their followers. There are so many dumb celebrities.",

I think Kim was not the only celebrity who shilled Ethereum Max though. Floyd Mayweather was involved too, I am not sure why they haven't charged him yet",

And while it is obvious that for people with a long time of experience in this market such a tactic will not work, it is clear that it works on newbies, otherwise those scammers will not take the time to try to get people like Kim Kardashian to promote their useless coins.",

Well its not that isnt allowed but we are talking about cryptocurrency here. She just promoted it without probably knowing what it is or at least do some background check and review of the project.What if there are some who buys a lot and loss a lot on the process, can Kardashian be liable on that provided she told a lot of good words about the project? The only thing is crypto is decentralized its your choice to invest here. But its not the reality now. If you are in the wrong investment youll get suffer a lot.",

I don't think that this will be the last though, it's easy money for celebrities. But at least they should do their own research before trying to promote any crypto project.

This is actually good news because right now celebrities will have an idea of how dangerous it is to promote random tokens or coins without knowing the reality of it. Most of the time, they will just take the payment and post some promotions about it, making it just an ordinary product but in reality, they could make fatal mistakes where they could ruin an innocent life by letting newbie investors invest in these random cryptocurrencies.",

Do not promote projects for money without disclosing it, and if you disclose it then we know that you got paid for it and not really support it.What we saw was Kim actually promoting and \"liking\" a project, some people may invest to the hype of that, and now that we know it is not real, we can say that she didn't even cared about the project.

If it had not been discovered that she was paid for the promotion, I guess the SEC would not have paid too much attention to it. Tyson seems to personally just have an interest in SOLANA as well as in NFT's, hence he is always vocal about it. If it is discovered that he is paid to do so, The SEC may slam him with fines as well, because it will in that situation be no different from Kim's case. If they don't, that's them being partial.",

Yeah you're right about that but repeating the same mistkae will put here into the big problem. It would better if he will not be promoting the scam token again. ethereum max is a very well known as a scam token and it can be identified easily without even looking on its project. Its name has been representing if it's a scam project. That means kim needs to learn from his mistake.",

Think about previous years, for example Floyd Mayweather ads, when he was advertising different ICO in social networks.

Celebrities should also care about their followers and should not do such endorsements that can suffer losses to anyone. The fine is a clear message to all celebrities and influencers not to promote anything blindly without doing any research.The problem is sometime their managements who handled it was too lazy to dig it even deeper before try to promote it. I meant the celebrity may not know about that as their managements didn't even told about that. I do believe celebrities will not be in contact directly with the scammers who wanna try to use their service to promote the scam token. This time SEC gives celebrity another warn not to promote scam token.",
