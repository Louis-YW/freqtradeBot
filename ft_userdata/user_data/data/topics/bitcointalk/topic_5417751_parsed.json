This is my first time hearing this casino though it's been in the market for a long time now (2015 according to the poster image above).  I've seen that there are some reviews already and I don't think it's a positive plus for the casino.

It actually look like a serious casino learning that they give 100% bonus for first deposit.  They might just do everything to promote this before they will decide whether to continue the business or not by 2024 when the domain expires.Kind of cool. Aren't they the only casino offering NFT loans? They could give you a loan up to $10,000 if you own some of the NFTs.

Moreover, on the Internet, I could not find any mention of this brand before 2022. There is only evidence that they previously operated the Buff.bet site, but this does not give them the right to identify the opening of both brands at the same time. They can write a lot more on their site, but it's far from the fact that this is true.",

If you do really look around basing up with other competitions then you could definitely say that it would really be that hard to compete against with the current popular ones.Its understandable that there are really some restrictions considering that each country does have its own set or regulations or rules in relation to this but looking overallwith simply those withdrawal options are limited then it would really be hard comparing in todays competition.@OP, you should clarify on things above^ guy next to me pertaining about Buff.bet possible been operated.",

I was refused withdrawal of EUR 2650 because I had played amateur basketball 10 (!) years ago. Can you imagine a legit sportsbook refusing to pay under such reasoning?Beware, as they will use every chance they have to apply their \"Terms and Conditions\" as they wish and you will be left with empty pockets. They even have to power to suspend your winning account at the slightest \"suspicion\" without giving any reasons thereof. But, as long as you're losing, they'll accept your deposits, of course.Also, the Curacao Gaming Control Board to which I complained, was no use, as they simply repeated the Galaxy.bet's arguments, without trying to get to the bottom of this issue (I had prepared a 39-pages long complaint with chat transcripts, e-mails etc). That being said, also AVOID any gambling sites registered in Curacao, as the complaint review process is simply a fruitless formality and consumer rights protection is not held in high esteem there. There are tons of much better alternatives to trust your money with!",
