  "content": "I am often considered crazy by friends around me who invest in stocks, bonds and real estate, they always laugh at me when we discuss portfolios and investment opportunities. Maybe some of us (on this forum) also have the same fate as always being ridiculed when talking about investing in bitcoin.Maybe they still lack knowledge about Bitcoin, and don't know how the pattern of cycles is, so they close themselves not to investing in Bitcoin, and on average they say that Bitcoin is an investment based on speculation so that fluctuations occur, but my logic rejects this because stocks and real estate can also be influenced by speculation.I may not be someone who has been investing in bitcoin for a long time but my confidence started to form when I often read Bitcoin cycles and I witnessed the cycle always repeating itself which is the basis for me to dare to invest in Bitcoin, my belief is getting stronger after reading this thread...QuoteYes... 0.1 BTC should be a very reachable goal.. even for a brand new bitcoiner.Surely over the years many of us have proclaimed that it should be a goal to try to attain as many bitcoin as you are able to without overly extending yourself or to put yourself into stress.So I recall that in the 2013 to 2016 time frame, a common goal seemed to be to attempt to try to accumulate something like 100 or more bitcoins.It seems that the 2017 to 2020 time frame, a common goal was to attempt to try to accumulate something like 21 or more bitcoins.Maybe the 2021 to 2024 time frame, a common goal will be to attempt to try to accumulate more than 1 bitcoins... and of course, some people might not be able to reach more than 1 bitcoin in their accumulation, so they accumulate as much as they can, and even the actual accumulation of 0.1 BTC will provide a lot of prosperity in the future, and surely if any of us has amounts of bitcoin that are between 0.1 BTC and 1 BTC, then the amounts above 0.1BTC may well end up being cushion.. or perhaps being a USD millionaire in terms of bitcoin might not be enough in 5-10 years, and therefore it is better to have a cushion and if we are able to accumulate more than 0.5 BTC, then we may well end up having more than 5 million in USD value in terms of our bitcoin holdings, and perhaps that might be sufficiently and adequately enough for a lot of us to live a quite great life down the road.. 5-10 years down the road or maybe our targeted timeline might be further out than 10 years?QuoteThere is always an increase in the price of every Bearis cycle every 4 years which makes it more difficult for people to collect Bitcoin because the prices are increasing as well as the lowest point, even in a Bearish state, as you said the target for collecting Bitcoin is decreasing (100-21-3) This target shows the proof.I think we should not be oriented towards owning hundreds of BTC, owning 0.5 Bitcoins as you said is most likely to become a millionaire in the future.If ATH is formed again in 2024 or 2025 I think there will be 10 times more people adopting bitcoin and learning about it than today (or maybe even more than 10X) and I would really like to laugh at my friend who insulted me.I thought I would like to know how your trust process builds up in investing your money in bitcoins?",

      "body": "Quite a few of my friends and family used to do the same when I started investing in crypto when it was ~$200, the ones that have actually tracked it since then (or have a reddit account) no longer feel the same and normally try to change the subject when it gets  brought up...Whether we'll do 100x or even 10x in the next decade again will be something we'll have to wait on and watch but I don't think those same people calling it a scam, bubble or ponzi will be quite so loud if it does. As always, diversification can't hurt and it might be a good idea to invest in other things (stocks seem a useful way to learn self control because they can also drop when you initially invest in them like bitcoin might).",

      "body": "I started reading in 2013, never really fully involved back until April 2014 when I created this forum account. All I ever thought about bitcoin was this magic internet meme money that no one will really take seriously. The deal was sealed when I experienced my first bull run back in 2016, after buying for 2 years at prices ranging from $180 to $300. That climb to ATH ($1300) before climbing back down to $700 was ecstatic, and since then I started believing that bitcoin could give an insane value to your investments if you timed and bought at the right moment - or even just averaged your buys if the price is too high.Fast forward to 2023, I now have some investments in VUL, some stocks, and some gold, but the bulk of my investments remain to be in bitcoin and crypto. I kinda laid low in buying due to some urgent financial responsibilities, but I remain to be a bitcoin believer to the core. Even some friends are already asking me to teach them how to invest, and I gladly help them and give them the knowledge I have whenever they have questions that they need some answers with.",

But I didn't believed it then, fast forward to 2017 when someone reintroduced it to me, and I remember it too well. And now I also regret my decision not believing on it. But in 2017, it was not too late as I research about it and then later that year experience that huge run, all time high and that's how my belief was form. And after that, the learning curve, another bear/bull cycle experience, another lessons learn. Yeah, I think 0.1 is achievable even by beginners. Again as I have said in other threads, it's the mentality and the patience that will bring you to this goal in bitcoin investment, continue to save and stack sats in whichever way you can.",

There is also the theorical part, but a theory is nothing if it doesn't work for real, and in Bitcoin's case it has really worked on practice, as we can clearly see the digital currency's potential on long term since the beginning. Now my belief is based not only in history, but also on the characteristics which are exclusive of BTC in crypto market: it's the first original crypto among all, truly decentralized, creator didn't want personal status and popularity for himself, remaining anonymous, limited and scarce supply.",

I already invested a bit right before the pandemic hit, luckily before the crash back then I pulled out before it halved my money, and refused to believe that it'd ever go back up again after that.

Don't really recall), so after that, I tried dabbling into trading, didn't do well (badly tbf), so I just waited for timing where Bitcoin was really down the red so that I can enter relatively safer.

The target of how many BTC we want to get will be each target because we definitely have different targets.My trust process continues to increase after learning about bitcoin's journey over time, especially when bitcoin experienced an increase that I could not imagine before, namely when the price could reach $ 20k. That's when I felt bitcoin could go up so high, and I can't imagine it anymore. And it was proven when the price could touch $ 69k, and for the next ATH, I can't imagine the highest price because it could be above $ 100k.",

I was letting them know that you can lose your money in bitcoin if you have your private key with you(I don't think they have it anyway)I think the most reason why people tend not to invest in bitcoin might be due to lack of exposure to how to keep their assets safe, not understanding the volatile nature of the market, and not being patient enough.

Beginners flocked to enter and buy bitcoin at a high enough price to push bitcoin to its highest price. Maybe the dominance of bitcoin will be even greater. People are also starting to learn about bitcoin and people around the world are going to talk about bitcoin. But regarding adoption, it depends on each country because it is constrained by different regulations in each country.People who have never entered and don't want to get to know bitcoin, of course they will lose, because the potential for bitcoin is still very large. If you have 0.1 Bitcoin at the moment, in the future when the new ATH is reached you will get many times the profit.",
