  "content": "I keep reading posts that @laszlo's pizza transaction was a big mistake. Or that you never should spend your Bitcoin but hodl, because you will lose the big opportunity for a phenomenal value increase of your BTC.Pizza Day anniversary 15 is coming, so I expect such posts to increase in the next months.But those people are wrong.First: Bitcoin was envisioned as a P2P cash by Satoshi. Laszlo's transaction was the start for this then (and still now) utopic dream: a hard, global currency which could be spent everywhere in the world for any good or service, and held with only an Internet access and free wallet tools.The \"digital gold\" camp and \"łaszlo was wrong!!\" camp will say now: if you spend the BTC and then do nothing, then maybe you have lost Bitcoins and potential ROI in the future.But there's a completely trivial method to avoid that: simply re-buy the spent Bitcoins!In this way, you don't lose any of your BTC, but you help the Bitcoin merchant network to grow, and bring us close to this utopian dream. And I'm also quite sure that Bitcoin's value would be strengthened. After laszlo bought the pizza, Bitcoin was finally also getting a monetary value, and this value went only up from then on.Corollary: Buy or pay for products and services you really need.Slightly less trivial argument against \"Bitcoin as cash\": Well, but what about the fees? First, sometimes I would have to spend $10 or more on fees to spend my BTC. And second, if everybody was now spending their BTC then fees would skyrocket to $100 or more and make Bitcoin unusable!Answer: This topic is still a challenge, but nothing to not being solved.- First you can use Bitcoin for relatively high value purchases only ($100-500+ depending on fee situation).- You also can create a Lightning channel and refill it periodically.- And there are also other second layers and altcoins you could use as a \"prepaid card\" in a very similar manner. BitVM is a very promising project for sidechains.- You could even spend your wBTC if you have some and are tired of dubious DeFi \"projects\" - and buy \"real\" BTC instead!- And if you don't care about centralization, use Liquid, RSK or a similar centralized sidechain with small to mid sized amounts - it will also help Bitcoin!Money must circulate for Bitcoin's \"Bullish case\" (see also this), otherwise it will be speculative until a likely final crash.(Please don't derail: this is not a thread about LN!)",

Many would rather use fiat than Bitcoin Because it's perceived more valuable (which honestly is true).Is easier to get access to Fiat than Bitcoin. I prefer using Bitcoin while getting things across border (currency barrier) And our local banks tend to block/restrict certain accounts trying to make a relatively bigger transaction So Bitcoin comes in play.",

In fact, this will increase the numbers of your Bitcoin if dome right, all you have to do is learn the best buying and selling time, for example, spend your Bitcoin on your needs now, it is a good time if you Boughy the Bitcoin at 15,000 years ago, and just wait till 2026 bear market and buy back, how hard can this be? Oh yes, emotions, people are slaves to their own mind and feelings, they always end up marrying to their bag, the feeling of I will never let go is actually holding you down, it is good to hold your BTC, but spending and buying back later will either bring you a lot more SATs than you had before or a bit better.

Bitcoin isn't starving from a lack of trading - it trades a lot, what it lacks is real-world usage.I'll tell you this: if I were buying a car, I sure as hell wouldn't pay an extra $100 fee when there are much cheaper options available.Currently, central banks offer cheaper, faster, and more private transactions than Bitcoin, with bank-to-bank fees under $5, depending on the bank, country, etc. but I'm not going to compare all banks here, overall, it's cheaper and faster.People mostly care about speed and fees, privacy comes later, and even later is the freedom to control it (being your own bank).For Bitcoin to be usable, fees must drop drastically, and the only way to achieve that is by increasing block size - ideally with adaptive blocks like Monero. But we know how that would go: another split. And why even update Bitcoin to improve it when there are already other forks with bigger blocks? That's a dead end.At this point, we can only assume that Bitcoin is just another investment stock - a decentralized one - but who cares? It doesn't change our lives the way we wanted.All in all, Bitcoin is just another brick in a wall of other stocks.",
