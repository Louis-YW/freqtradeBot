  "content": "The new year began with another discovery of viruses aimed at stealing cryptocurrencies.Although the Trojan was discovered in 2021, it was not finalized then. At this time, the virus can read SMS in the victim's phones, thereby bypassing two-factor authorization.QuoteThe new malware was designed to collect user data, and it is targeting primarily banking and cryptocurrency applications. Once it infects a device, the malware begins to display fake websites of regular banking and crypto apps in order to steal the login data of users. BaFin revealed that the malware is targeting around 400 banking and crypto apps, including those operating in Germany. We also know that Godfather relies on push notifications to obtain two-factor authentication codes, and that cybercriminals can use this data to gain access to consumers’ accounts and wallets. https://thepaypers.com/cryptocurrencies/bafin-warns-of-new-godfather-banking-and-crypto-malware--1259756",

The thing is to avoid them as much as possible, especially by storing crypto funds offline/HW wallet, these malwares mostly steal funds that are stored in hot wallets on the victims online phone or computer; you should also have more than one email address and have specific ones for untrusted websites so you don't click unsolicited links sent there. It is also safe to bookmark your regular websites so that you aren't redirected to scam/dummy ones that can scam you when you try to type it all the time. TL;DR: focus on how to protect yourself from malwares rather than the malwares per se.",

Although, if we judge that we live on the Internet, the virus can be exchanged in other countries. To calm down that someone lives in another country, I think it's not worth it. It is good that you understand that Internet safety information requires regular awareness. But still, monitoring all the news, and also in the absence of timely news, the device's owner must be careful. Using the phone that was first in your hands, without a previous owner, and limiting the installation of applications, as well as controlling the links you follow, should be familiar. By installing all the decorations and seeming conveniences in your phone, you can expose it to the risk of a virus and control over your device.QuoteAccording to the cybersecurity firm, the United States, Turkey and Spain account for the highest number of trojan or ‘Godfather’ malware activities. Canada, France, Germany and the UK are also hotbeds for the trojan, Group-IB said.Additionally, the cybersecurity firm noted the ‘Godfather’ malware attacked users in 16 countries last year. These attacks affected 215 banking apps, 94 crypto wallets and 110 cryptocurrency exchange platforms.Moreover, Group-IB in its report said the ‘Godfather’ malware code has an interesting functionality that prevents it from attacking users located in Russian-speaking and former Soviet Union countries. This suggests that the creators of the virus are from Russia or one of the former Soviet states, the cybersecurity firm said.“The emergence of Godfather underscores the ability of threat actors to edit and update their tools to maintain their effectiveness in spite of efforts by malware detection and prevention providers to update their products,” Artem Grischenko, a Junior Malware Analyst at Group-IB, noted.https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/regulation/bafin-raises-alarm-on-trojan-godfather-affecting-banking-and-crypto-apps/",

It shouldn't be a surprise why. To have any sort of security, you'd need to verify logins or anything sensitive from an additional device that is physically separate from the account that you're trying to protect. Ideally, not connected to the same network also, to try to alleviate network attacks. Ideally, you'd have a offline way of two factor authentication. A lot of users are now starting to use physical keys which do mitigate some of the attack vectors.",

A lot of users are now starting to use physical keys which do mitigate some of the attack vectors. I myself am currently still using two-factor authentication via SMS, but the device used for the provider is not connected to the internet because I only use a polyphonic mobile device and can only receive text messages without an internet connection.This minimizes the weakness of 2FA SMS so that it is not easily intercepted and tries to mitigate against network attacks like you mean.and on other devices, I also use the Google 2FA App and also without connecting to the internet.",

Here's the lesson: why not keep 2FA authentication on the same device where you're running your crypto or banking apps. BTW, I keep my 2FA SMS sim in another device so that the virus cannot read it. I mostly store my cryptocurrency in hardware wallets, so it's almost safe. Hackers are constantly looking for new ways to steal our money. Just be more cautious.",

But for me i think if you can afford it, getting a new smartphone device for only storage of all your crypto related stuff will be the best option (I.e including both your wallet and crypto exchanges which you used in selling your coins into fiat), so as to avoid any chances of getting your asset infected by any of the new Trojan viruses that might make you lose what would have even been more than the cost of a separate smartphone device.",
