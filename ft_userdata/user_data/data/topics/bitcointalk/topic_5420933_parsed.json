  "content": "EXPERIENCE BASED REVIEW OF EXCHANGES! - This will be so valuable for many of you, and I believe save a lot of money.I am going to give my very experienced feeling of the players in crypto game. I wanted to write this for some time.In no order, I’ll cover some of most liquid exchanges. Feelings I have for some I have for some I don’t have proof so exchanges don’t hold me accountable for saying what I say, it’s just a picture that developed in my mind while trading my money on your exchanges.Important what I’ll share in this post is which exchanges I think participate in fucking their own customers and which don’t.None of the exchanges here will get any affiliate link so you know my bias is netural (and you realize you are to me more important than money!)Bitmex - they have absolutely the smoothest trading interface, which they didn’t develop for years. At times they were pioneer in the field, now with mandatory kyc, playing AGAINST its traders, and many tricks in most important times, it cannot be the first choice exchange.I’d trade it if I’d need to.I’d trust in payouts from them.I trust the support can handle intelligent unique cases.Binance- most liquid- trades AGAINST its traders- I would NOT trust it for big matters due to their retarded support with almost inability to escalate things. Shame for the most liquid, biggest exchange.- I’d trade on it when I have no other choice as for smaller things I know they won’t cause fuss as long as your case doesn’t get in a special-case category, they will hardly go off-the-script for you.Kucoin- decent liquidity- does NOT trade against its traders- slow and glitchy software which makes it harder to execute trades at most violent times (when you need it the most)- I do not have experience with their support, I didn’t need it, but I feel way more confident in ability to escalate with them stuff and explain to human than with Binance for example.ByBit- marketing exchange. Done to build hype, built by aggressive affiliate scheme.- They are good followers, but not leaders in any case. - I am aware of them, their developments, however I have not traded on bybit except when testing it out at the beginnings. However, given how they are working I don’t think they have as a strategy to trade against its people- I think it is ok exchange for smaller stuff, retail friendly, I wouldn’t trust it for bigger stuff simply because of their aggressive changing, I don’t know what would happen with your big win in some specific or questionable case.- I would feel confident you’d get your smaller to medium sized issues resolved in a human way, and that you can escalate upon need. - I need more experience to comment other things on this exchange. I avoided it as it didn’t seem to me as the best in anything, but it’s definitely one of ‘decent’ players on the market.FTX- trades against its people - connected to Alameida and Solana, and I’ve already written about solana heavy manipulation.- has an EXCELLENT software, done by the people who understand how derivatives exchange should look like. - It is successor of BitMEX in terms of technical superiority. Basically, no one understood futures in depth as BitMEX did until FTX came. However, unfortunately, their greed or too much empathy-blocking substances or whatever caused them to be an exchange to AVOID.Here’s why:- besides trading against its people, it has one more trick, which is entering positions on alts is very slippery, meaning big liquidity gap, big slippage, almost as it is INTENTIONAL. I laughed even at entering some alts. I am actually convinced it is intentional because such knowledgable players, to now know/want to provide proper market making for their listed alts, it can only be intentional in my mind.- I am not sorry one bit they got fucked, because they got fucked because of their own trading against people, participating both in markets and providing exchange. Of course, I’m sorry about the people who got fucked in the process. Exchange to definitely avoid: FTXGate.io surprisingly good exchange.Software, interface and support are ‘Asian’ so I don’t think you can really count on getting escalated case easily solved, but from my experience much more intelligent support works there than on Binance, also the pro case is they will treat your small and your big withdrawals the same. I’d trust it with bigger trades. I don’t think they trade against its tradersI found it have some high gain potential alts listed there.Crypto.com-I don’t consider it an exchange for professionals to even consider. It’s retail app, that has big volume, I don’t trust it more than a bank.Bitget- I don’t trust its volume, software, nor for bigger withdrawals. I don’t have a reason for my feeling. When I tried it, it worked properly.OKX-legit exchange- capable of bigger volume- I don’t have much experience with it, my friends use it frequently.Bitforex- slow software- I tested it and everything worked surprisingly well, no issues on any end.- I feel I could get a support from them if needed.- I’d try to go on some other exchange for bigger funds, simply due to the unknown and the fact I don’t trust their volume.Huobi- legit exchange- I trust it with higher volume- Asian and whatever issues that brings with supportBitstamp- legit exchange- friendly for bigger volumes.- I don’t use it, I don’t have experience with it, but my friend does and says great things for it, even did a business relationship with them and OKX I thinkBitfinex- I know the controversy about it, but I had only good experience with it. And I give you here not what you can find on the internet but experience.- I find no issues with this exchange, except a bit retarded attempt to “look pro” in the layout, making it harder to trade, execute trades etc, they need simpler interface.- I do not have any proof they trade against its people, although I forgot them they also know how derivatives exchange should work. Their leadership is knowledgable on the topic, Bitmex and ftx… regardless of the controversies they have the latter two even Bitfinex related to tether.- I would trust it with bigger trades, only because of Tether and company situations I wouldn’t keep the funds when not in use there (as good practice with any exchange). Please note, all the opinions above for other exchanges were also related to whether I’d trust it to make a big trade and get paid, or get paid upon big victory, if you hit the gem alt, or hit a big trade… Bitfinex I’d trust. Binance I wouldn’t although I know that 99%+ of the cases they are paying out, for me that 1% on Binance is simply not good enough, the 1% I’m not certain of.- It is not retail friendly exchange. - Biggest exchange-level con (not company level): they try to look smart and “professional” so they are not advancing with stuff that would help traders, and make things easier. Other than that, I can only say good experience with this exchange.Kraken- legit exchange- I’d trust with bigger volume- I don’t have experience with it, but my whale friend uses it daily and swears by it.Bitget- I tested it. Withdrawals went through fine.- It’s slower and not my preference. Simply it looks to me like “let’s have an exchange” type of thing… needs some unique edge which it lacks.Conclusion for the lazy ones (99%+ small capital, because I know bigger capital will want to read about the exchange they are using)Avoid Binance whenever you can if you are trading big volume or if you plan on making big single wins. Avoid it even if you’re derivatives trading. There are better derivatives exchanges. trade it only if you want that specific pair and you don’t have it anywhere… or it’s good it allows both open and short position at the same time… which I think every exchange should offer.-FAMEEX GLOBAL : above all FAMEEX seems better  with what am seeing i beleive The future of FAMEEX is Great and they will stay but in the meantime please stay strong and Trade safe frens",
