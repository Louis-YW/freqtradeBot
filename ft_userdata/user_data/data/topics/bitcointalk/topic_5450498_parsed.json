Can you tell us a little bit about what PEPA is all about?CEO: Hey, what's up? Yeah, so PEPA is basically a token that's all about having fun and being irreverent. We wanted to create something that would make people laugh and maybe even poke a little fun at the more serious side of the crypto industry.Interviewer: That sounds like a unique approach. Can you tell us a little more about how PEPA works?CEO: Sure thing. So basically, PEPA is a deflationary token, which means that a small percentage of each transaction is burned, reducing the total supply over time. And of course, we've got some pretty fun memes and social media campaigns to go along with it and make it VIRAL!Interviewer: Interesting. What sets PEPA apart from other meme tokens out there?CEO:What sets PEPA apart from other meme tokens is our unique approach to having fun and being irreverent. We're not just about making a quick buck, we're about creating a community of people who enjoy a good laugh and don't take themselves too seriously. Plus, our deflationary tokenomics and social media campaigns are pretty innovative if we do say so ourselves.Interviewer: Sounds like a lot of fun. Any plans for the future of PEPA?CEO: Oh yeah, we've got big plans. We're currently working on some partnerships with some influencers, content creators and other CEX and DEX exchang; and we're hoping to launch some pretty cool NFTs in the future but.. step by step! Stay tuned!Interviewer: Thanks for chatting with us today. Where can our readers go to learn more about PEPA?CEO: Just head on over to our website, pepa.fun, or follow us on Twitter @PEPAToken. And remember, folks, always keep it irreverent!",
