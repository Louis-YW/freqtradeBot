Why Antminer s5 and Dragonmint are listed here?They are no longer profitable and have less support.And another thing is s5 miner is power-hungry compared to the Compact F/USB ASIC-based miner that can pull only 15-30w or Futurebit Apollo which can mine 2.5th/s with 160 watts power consumption.",

What could be good would be a list that tells you how reliable and profitable a miner is and not this random list of random hardware.

By the way I like to make Masternode  Instead of mining. As Masternodes work on a Proof of work system. And what coins do you mine? Masternodes work on the Proof-of-Service protocol and there is nothing similar to mining in the work of masternodes. If you are the owner of a masternode, then you are required to have the required number of coins and provide service to this node.",
