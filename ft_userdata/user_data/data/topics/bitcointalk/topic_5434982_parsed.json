They aren't next anything, they are themselves that others want to be next.I do believed that there will be no ETH killer, we have heard this since 2017 and we haven't seen one even getting closer to ETH as far as the pricing goes. If this is the gauge for being a ETH killer. There are a lot of good alternatives though, but it seems that investors are just on the safe side. Putting their money on the prime movers like ETH and let their money grow.But I wouldn't say that ADA is a bad investment, it could give 10x or higher this next bull run, I speculate.",

I believe that Cardano is already far from Ethereum a long time ago, even Cardano (ADA) was created before.

You are absolutely right that price of Cardano is too far from Ethereum, and its pace of development is also very slow compared to Ethereum. The total supply of Cardano is 45 billion which is huge, and there is no burning mechanism in place to reduce it to boost the price. the team is also planning to launch algorithmic stable coin (DJED) in first quarter of 2023 on Cardano block chain & it will be integrated with partners and decentralized exchanges which will reward users for providing liquidity. However, the failure of UST stable coin has led to negative perception about algorithmic stable coins, and it remains to be seen, how well this stable coin is received in the market. https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-to-launch-new-algorithmic-stablecoin-in-2023",
