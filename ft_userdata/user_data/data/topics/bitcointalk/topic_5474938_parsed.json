I carefully went through all the responses, maintaining keen interest and taking note of each perspective. Another aspect of the inquiry involves whether you would be willing to participate in crowdfunding for a fellow gambler who reaches out to the public through social media seeking financial support after they gambled with the funds meant for an important project like, investment, school fees, rent, marriage or any other thing. And what would you say to those who go ahead to donate to these gamblers out of a sense of empathy?",

Giving money to him is just telling him to continue from where he stopped. So I don't see the need for crowdfunding such fellow and I will never be a part of it.",

And what would you say to those who go ahead to donate to these gamblers out of a sense of empathy?I would say that sponsoring irresponsible behavior does not lead to anything good. There must be unpleasant consequences for wrong actions, it hurts but it works. If a person does not experience anything negative after doing something wrong (because someone makes up for all the losses in his place), then this only leads to the fact that he continues to behave irresponsibly. This is not higher mathematics, but simple life experience that everyone should understand by the age of 7-8 haha.",

This is irresponsible and it deserves a punishment. If these people get any help from the community, who guarantees it that they won't do the same thing again? (spending family funds on gambling) Sometimes people need to learn by the hard way. Sometimes punishment is the best teacher.(for ex:) You spend your kids food money on gambling and now you either feed your kids with the funds which you were going to pay your electricity bills which means no electricity in home or, your kids will starve to death. A punishment like that is hopefully enough to put some sense in these losers.",

It just feeds their gambling addiction because they get money to keep playing and I don't think it will take long until that money is gone to gamble again.Quote from: Odohu on November 21, 2023, 05:08:28 PMIf he gambled irresponsibly, then he does not need crowdfunidng rather he needs to visit a psychologist for help on how to deal with his gambling addiction. Giving money to him is just telling him to continue from where he stopped. Yes I agree with you. They don't need Crowdfunding, what they need is psychologist or professional help to overcome the problems they are experiencing, gambling addiction problems or irresponsible gambling. Giving money to a gambling addict is the same as giving sugar to a diabetic",

Im not really be that being too harsh in this regard since people do really make mistakes on which getting some help once should be enoughbut on the time that they are really that repeating on the same mistake again and again then this is an another story.People should really be realizing and learning up things on the hard way or something a situation that they didnt expect that it would happen into their lives.People do usually be quitting on the time that they had that the lowest condition or worst situation into their lives.",

Any gambler that lost his funds to gamble might still gamble again when funds are been donated to him base on charity because there is still every possibility that he might start chasing his losses again because he is not a discipline gambler.On the other hand, if the gambler has learnt a hard lesson from his gambling life, he might still not gamble and use the donated funds for the right purpose. So I don't know that category that the gamblers falls into as someone that has learnt his lesson or not, this is why I might feel reluctant to donate for that gambler.",

It all matters with someones control and handling towards himself because if you do find out yourself not to be that much effective due to some reasons then its your mistakeon why you do end up miserable or messed up with gambling. Gambling could fucked up our finances and if you arent that careful then it wont be shocking that you would really be ending up on a disastrous condition.There are really just those people who have those kind of unrealistic goals and this is why they do end up on miserably.Giving some support? No i wont do such thing. You would be supporting them financially then it would really be just on the same story on which they would really be spending those funds again and again. They wont learn up a lesson until they would be able to experience those unfortunate events on which i do saythat it is really just that right for them to experience so that they would be able to realize on whats wrong.",

Yes, we're into gambling but we know that being too much on it and with everything doesn't look good. That's the reason why people with gambling issues are not to be trusted with money. Go into the typical angel investing groups and if you tell them that the one pitches the project or the crowdfunding is into gambling, most of them are going to stop their interest to what's being pitched to them. There's a reason why we're all acting like that because we're gamblers and we know someone's approach will change if they're doing something that gambles their own money and what's more if they successfully crowdfunded? The money that someone has is hard earned money and we do understand why it's hard to entrust it to people that can't even manage themselves.",
