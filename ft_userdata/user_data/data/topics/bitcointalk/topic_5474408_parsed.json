We all know that BTC is not regulated by any country, and El Salvador is very bold to adopt it.A small question about Nayib Bukele's purchases so far. Will the purchased BTC be used for the benefit of his country or for personal/supporter interests? It's true that it's in the name of El Salvador, but I'm a bit skeptical about it. If compared to the amount bought by MS, it falls far behind. Country vs Institutional Investor, for now, BTC is still dominated by institutional investors.",

Will the purchased BTC be used for the benefit of his country or for personal/supporter interests? As far as I know, they used national reserves to buy bitcoin, so this money will definitely belong to the country, not just President Nayib Bukele. In addition to accepting legal tender and investing in bitcoin to seek profits, Nayib Bukele's goal is to leverage bitcoin to improve their country's economy. One of the most productive sectors is tourism. From what I know, their tourism industry since accepting bitcoin as legal tender has seen a significant increase in revenue. It can be said that they have not achieved many outstanding achievements, but they are still continuing the journey of applying bitcoin into practice in their country from bringing it into education to becoming the main currency.",

DCA is a great strategy because it does not require a lot of effort and research, but it is not the most profitable for those who want to invest institutionally, and you will be able to employ some economic experts who may give price predictions that have a good amount of credibility, especially since we are talking about long-term trading.The El Salvador experience was not ideal for those who needed a lot to succeed, but they took the first step",

The country bought its first 200BTC at roughly $52k per coin in September 2021. El Salvador will be owning about 2,381 based on the president's statements which will put the average price of each coin at about $44k. So the country has not made any profit from their holding they are even losing close to $60m. Hopefully, the country will be able to make some profit next year and the world will see how nations could benefit from Bitcoin investment.Quote from: DdmrDdmr on November 17, 2023, 05:46:46 PMThe truth is that we don’t really know just how real El Salvador’s bitcoin stash is, and what’s worse, the Salvadorians don’t seem to know either due to the lack of transparency, leading the population to have to take a set of Tweets as a reference.

He has silenced opposition and even arm-twisted the legislature to amend the constitution to enable him to re-contest for presidential elections which was unconstitutional. The purchase of Bitcoin is just announced on Twitter and public statements with there is no further proof of such a transaction or a public government record and nobody will ever dare question the Commander in Chief.",

I wonder what the latest situation is? Do they still continue to buy 1 Bitcoin per day? It would be nice if a new announcement came from Bukele.President of El Salvador, Nayeb Bukele, has depended on the potential of Bitcoin, by which he announced to buy 1 Bitcoin per day through DCA strategy. If the country collected bitcoins daily as per his announcement then their current holdings would be 2748 bitcoins today. But whether they are actually buying bitcoins on a daily basis is yet to be confirmed. They are gradually able to reduce their losses and because of their long-term investment, they will be able to turn their bitcoins into large assets. Provably new announcements will likely come after the election of 2024.He purchased 2381 Bitcoins for the country and at that time each Bitcoin was purchased at $44300 and later when the Bitcoin price dropped to $19000 the country was at a loss of around $60 million. Currently Bitcoin price is slowly increasing and it is believed that the country will turn to profit through Bitcoin even after recovering all the losses. Bukili's visionary plan for Bitcoin was definitely right especially for those who believe in Bitcoin.However, Nayib Bukele's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender was considered risky by the IMF and repeatedly warned. With the passage of time, Bukele's decission will be proved to be correct. Since Bukele has announced his candidacy for the 2024 elections, hopefully he will be able to re-assure the public about the success of Bitcoin investments after he is re-elected.",

It's unfortunate that the total is down by almost 10% (which is more than 12 million dollars), but I'm confident that it will all be up eventually.It's also worth noting that while El Salvador is trying to be Bitcoin-friendly, they're not investing too much in Bitcoin, clearly. They've invested under $130 million, with an annual GDP of $30 billion, so it's less than 0.5% of annual GDP over the course of 2 years. I'd say it means they're playing it super-safe.",

At that time, I did not realize how much profit MS was making, but 1 billion is like a lot. And talking about El Salvador, they adopted the BTC at the wrong time, like when the market was already hyped and the bear market was nearing a start. They should have waited a little longer, but who knows what emergency they were in other than financial problems?",
