You'll have look elsewhere for different coin though. And most importantly, those short incomplete address is deemed invalid.",

And with all the GPU rigs not doing much after ETH went PoS there are a lot of them out there not doing much.Also I have noticed at times when using walletexplorer.com, it will give the 1st address of what it finds not all of them.There are a lot of 1nasty addresses but it does not show all of them.-Dave",

If you have your seed phrase or private key, they can generate your complete address anytime that you want it. I have seen people on this forum looking for some missing characters of a private key, or how to decrypt a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet private key, or looking for some missing words of a seed phrase. Those are normal for obvious reasons, which is to be able to access the private key to spend the coins in connection with them.

Relying of 1stbits and holograms and so on is just no longer viable.That's true/correct.I've read already about manufacturers getting silent and having the coins redeeming logic based on their (now offline) website.I think that I've read about the possibility holograms could be taken down and put back again (in some cases).Clearly, addresses created with the same firstbits in order to mislead users is not a possibility to dismiss.Imho collectibles are very nice even if not funded (I tend to like more the DYI ones). Funded collectibles, especially with higher amounts, tend to pose unnecessary risks.So, again, I agree, you're fully right.However, the topic has started with a question, not a debate on how (un)safe holograms and fistbits are. If one indeed has such a collectible, he will still want a tool to see his funds without taking down the hologram. Yes, it may not be accurate, in some cases the wrong address may be returned/checked, but I don't know of better tools.",

You have to trust whoever is generating the keys that they are not keeping a copy of the private key.If you trust them, then past that then 10+ should be fairly safe from someone duplicating them. Some coin makers give a complete address list, those should be safe (eliminating the hologram peel / replace) others do not.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2022902.0For other things it really becomes a matter of trust vs amount.I am more likely to trust that someone did not bother to scam me for BTC0.01 then a BTC1.0 But for now I really can't think of a reason to use 1stbits anymore.-Dave",
