And, brother, I don't believe that it is wahala you requested a loan and that they have granted it to you. The terms and conditions may be there, but you know how seldom Nigerians read the fine print. Any type of bank loan, whether from a bank or an app, has drawbacks because with bank loans, you must first give security before they would approve your loan, and if you default on the loan, they will seize your property. On top of that, App loans will harass you relentlessly, and as the OP noted, the bulk of loan conditions are rigid in every way.",

If you borrow small amount of money like ₦10000, the amount to pay can increase to ₦13000 in the first month and ₦16000 in the second month. And after that, it is default and it will not longer increase but anyone that wants to borrow should read the terms and conditions. I am talking from experience.

Assume there is an industrials all over the country, I don't think that people will think of getting loan from the bank than to look for what to do that will be bringing them money to save some in the bank and put the remaining money into crypto investment, but you can't advise anybody to use loan to invest in cryptocurrency because it will be difficult for such person to have peace of mind with that loan.",

You see the problem with these people, and na them to dey worry you with the loan offer because them get bad intention for mind.It is better that we avoid these loan apps and take a loan from someone that we know if the situation on ground is critical and there is any other option, to avoid all this mess. If one can stay away from loan, the better for that person, because loan go dey bring you backward and you no go fit plan well with your funds.

I hope say this information they useful for many of us.It doesn't matter where you collect your loans from, be it microfinance banks or loan apps, if you don't have something doing that generates money it's will definitely cause problems.We can all agree that one downside about borrowing is the interest we are paying, not having a business or a source of income can lead to borrowing of multiple loans from different places and at the end of the day it will keep compounding till it gets out of handMany have accumulated loans that they can't meet up with because they don't have a source of incomeHaving a source of income is a good backup and also not borrowing more than what you earn is another thing that must be considered  OP didn't indicate if it's Loan App loan, he just said micro finance banks, if you're going to bank to borrow money they will actually ask for collateral, which the customer must bring before they will grant you the loan, and if you fail to pay they will seal the collateral till you remit the money. All the indications in OP post are Loan apps requirements, which most of then operate illegally, they don't have CNB backing but they still operate and give out loan to jobless Nigerians,at the end they start to disturb your line with unnecessary text and call, some even go as far to print the defaulter burial post or HIV test result,  that's craze,  it's show how careless the finance institution in in Nigeria,  such app can't work in the western world without government approval. Come to think of it, why are you given out loan to youths when  you know there is high rate of unemployment in Nigeria, where would they get money to pay you? Some are owing more than 24 load apps and still counting.  Let me tell you this for free, nothing will happen to your future load requirement if you dint pay.  But take load if you won't pay back.",

Nigeria na country wey so many things they happen and you for also look am from the aspect of the business owners who have suffered in these young people who take loans for fun and not because they need it.I remembered that this harassment thing whatsoever was not there before and was introduced by the loan apps at a time. I remembered periods where people will just take loan without having the plans for repayment and the loan apps end up losing their funds. Then I use to wonder how they make their gains since it was seen as an update in the streets my many youths.Quote from: Forever101 on October 03, 2023, 09:34:33 PMThe funniest part be say some even they collect loan for party wey be one day stuff, some dey collect loan for marriage, burial and other ceremony wey go last one or two days. After that one, Dem go con turn to Jackie for work make Dem fit pay, if Dem no dey meet up, Dem go develop high BP for them self while dis problem don kpai many, some still dey find wey to escape.  That one even our elders they do am. I remember those days when people they collect anchor borrowers agricultural loan when it was newly launched by the federal government and they end up using it to marry. The purpose at which the loan was collected is different from what it was used for. The baffling part of it is that the loan applicants are aware of their deeds and the moment they found out the loans were actually disbursed, they saw that as another update to collect and squander the money. It was launched around 2015 during the Buhari's administration as an initiative of the Federal Government to support local farmers and produce large quantity of food for the nation's consumption. Over 70,000 farmers were said to have benefitted directly from the programme. Later in 2023, CBN in a report said it has only recovered 52% of the money disbursed and the rest have not been paid by the borrowers. The report also gave an account of a beneficiary that was sued to the court for defaulting to repay his loan after six years of taking the loan when the loan guidelines stipulates that upon harvest, the beneficiaries are required to repay their loan with the farm produce which will be bought by the government with profits. While this defaulter complained about flood as his reasons of failing to meet the guidelines, many of these benefiting farmers ended up adding more wives as a result. It's painful sha.Quote from: RockBell on October 04, 2023, 06:05:48 AMAny type of bank loan, whether from a bank or an app, has drawbacks because with bank loans, you must first give security before they would approve your loan, and if you default on the loan, they will seize your property. On top of that, App loans will harass you relentlessly, and as the OP noted, the bulk of loan conditions are rigid in every way.Exactly and that's part of the agreement you must have signed with them during your acceptance of their terms and conditions. But do many of these loan takers really care about the aftereffects? In fact many people are even developing their own strategies on how to default the loans without paying. Some are even going to the extent of generating random BVN's to take these loans while using new emails without their contact lists to take these loans. Their formats long sha. I no really support how these loan apps they take harass people especially to the length of calling their phone contacts to falsely accuse the loan takers of scamming or kidnapping and other crazy things but the loan defaulters must also learn to stop taking loans for fun or with the intention of not paying back the loans.I get two occasions wey them Don ever get issues with my friends. In one occasion, which has been long ago sha, them pick one of my friend's passport photograph come they spread am for Whatsapp through DMs accusing that my friend of fraudulent activities by calling him a scammer and warning people not to have anything to do with him. The second occasion wey funny pass na him be one of my friend wey them crop him head con attach am to one random ritualist body photo online. Them come they share my friend face with different contacts on his phone book accusing him of being involved in rituals and warning everyone from dealing with a ritualist. LOL. As funny as that may sound, it's very awkward of them to do so. And I'm pretty sure that's never part of their agreements or guidelines which means they can be sued to court in a more sane environment. Like, that's going to the extreme of defamation of character. You can level allegations on someone of something this tarnishing because they couldn't repay your loans. That's very bad and such things should be stopped.",
