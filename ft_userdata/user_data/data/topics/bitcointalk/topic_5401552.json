  "content": "I'm trying to sweep some funds from an old wallet.I'm using the latest version of Electrum 4.2.2I have successfully sweeped them from the P2PKH address of the wallet however one of my change addresses (starts with 3) I can't manage to sweep it. If I try to just sweep it then it will give the no inputs error.If I try to put the prefix in front of it (p2wpkh-p2sh:) (or any variations with this) the sweep button stays greyed out. If I remove the prefix it will let me sweep (but gives no inputs), I tried the other prefixes as well but no success.Any idea how I can sweep this change address?",

We already know the WIF is valid since OP can use it to recover an empty legacy address.Thanks for your quick reply.The main problem I have is that my armory refuses to send out any coins. Whenever I try to send any coins I get this error:https://i.imgur.com/I3eUAVg.pngHowever, the transaction fee is most definitely high enough. (I put it at 120 sat/B and then later even at 200 sat/B to make sure that wasn't the problem). (I have completely rebuild and rescanned armory a few times, which in the past would sometimes solve this issue but now it hasn't.)So I am unable to send these coins from my armory, which is what I initially tried to do (I guess I could go to the armory subsection but I thought there was no longer any support for it). Because I'm unable to send any coins from Armory I was trying to just sweep it from those addresses into my electrum wallet, which works fine for some addresses but not for this one. I would also be happy if there is a way to get Armory working again, but for the last few years it's not been easy to work with and keeps giving me errors.",

As I said above, you will not be able to import this address in to Electrum regardless of what you do, so trying to get Armory working is probably the logical next step. If that fails, you could try to build the P2SH-P2PK transaction from scratch, but it is not a very common script type so you might run in to even more problems trying to do this.I would export and share the log file as that pop up box suggests, and we can try going from there.",

From your screenshot, I see the address was funded just over a year ago. I've never used Armory, but I'd guess a year old version shouldn't be the problem.Considering the amount you're dealing with, may I suggest a safer approach than Electrum connected to the internet?

However, I did need to do a few more database rescans before the transactions showed up properly in Armory (which they do now). Have not tried to do another transaction afterwards. I will do that later to see if the error remains.",
