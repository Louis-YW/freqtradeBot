  "content": "I recently swapped my AM Logic board for a Xilinx board (C55) and nothing worked. After some troubleshooting I found out it was running on X17 firmware. So I flashed the correct firmware on it with the sd card and updated it via the stock UI. Now the machine starts hashing again when on stock firmware, but the point of swapping the AM Logic board was to use Braiins or Asic.to to overclock it.None of these work, Asic.to refuses to even boot, the fans ramp up and down in an oscillating way like some sort of alarm. Braiins OS+ works, I can log in and configure a pool and everything but none of the hashing boards are detected. Furthermore it seems that it thinks it's a X17, not a S19J Pro (even though the stock firmware from Bitmain recognises it as a S19J Pro).I presume the autodetection from BraiinsOS detects something different so that it thinks it's an X17 board, even though I updated it and it's working when using stock firmware.I ssh into the miner and edited the /etc/bosminer.toml file to include [model_detection]use_config_fallback = trueand changed the model to Antminer S19J Pro as described here: https://docs.braiins.com/os/plus-en/Configuration/index_configuration.html#model-detectionDoes anyone have any advice?You can find the system log here: https://pastebin.com/DzE4i24rThe reddit post with some images: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/wiidkf/braiins_os_nor_asicto_working_on_s19j_pro/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3",

      "body": "It should detect as x19 since your miner is s19j pro. If it detects different according to BraiinsOS documentation it is due to EEPROM corruption of your 3 hashboard. There is a way to fix this if your EEPROM is corrupted you can flash the hashboard with the correct EEPROM the only problem is that you will need a known working hashboard where you can dump the PIC file and use that file to flash that 3 corrupted hashboards. And also you will need a tool called PICKit3 to flash them. If you want a guide check this link below- https://www.zeusbtc.com/manuals/Antminer-S19-Hash-Board-Repair-Guide.asp",

Just make sure that you have a working s19j pro PIC file if you don't have an extra s19j pro then you maybe need to request with someone here on the forum who have the same unit.",
