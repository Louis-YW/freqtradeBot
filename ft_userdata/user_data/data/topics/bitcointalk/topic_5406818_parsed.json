It is not a shitcoin, it remain to be more decentralized, unlike altcoins.Bitcoin is now proving to be a commodity, unlike altcoins that are securities because they are still centrally controlled somehow. Bitcoin has the strongest blockchain, some people prefer it because of that. Bitcoin has a limited supply. What is scarce is actually money that will increase in value.",

Bitcoin is open-source, other developers collaborated with Satoshi improve the code. Bitcoin has a public blockchain. The vision was to have a digital currency that is decentralized and can be used for P2P transactions without third parties",

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, transparent and trustless system that does not require any third party or middle man. The best example of this is every organization where there is a middleman, whether it is in the form of banks or any other.",

Bitcoin will never stop from dominating the market because there is still a strong demand coming from the crypto community. If that demand decreases, i guess bitcoin will be put in danger and will not lead the market eventually. But for now, it's hard to compete with bitcoin even if we dig through a lot of altcoins. Bitcoin is considered a much safer and secured investment compared to other crypto coins alive. And with the high confidence from the people that show support for bitcoin, then it will always be irreplaceable.",

If people find confidence investing in bitcoin, i guess there is something in bitcoin that most altcoins don't have. Aside from its high storage value, bitcoin too has always its great utility case that other crypto coins lack. That is why bitcoin always leads the cryptocurrency market because its not only for short term investment and profiting, but more on long term profiting and investment.",
