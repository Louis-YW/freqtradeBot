I just saw this on Twitter:I also saw an hour ago the latest news about Paxful exchange, as Youssef said.PEER-TO-PEER BITCOIN EXCHANGE PAXFUL SUSPENDS MARKETPLACEQuoteAccording to Youssef, all customer funds are accounted for, and the Paxful Wallet will be up for customers to retrieve their funds. To facilitate the process, Paxful is recommending options such as Exodus Wallet and Muun Wallet for customers to self-custody their funds. The company is also offering an easy migration to other options for non-U.S. users, including Noones, a new P2P company dedicated to the Global South, and Bitnob, which makes it easy for Africans to connect with Bitcoin.We hope that users who use the Paxful exchange and who don't know this information, with the topic created by @OmegaStarScream, can help to solve their problems, especially regarding funds.",

For example Localcryptos was Australian based, Localcryptos was based in Finland, Paxful is based in Delaware US though some sources claim that they have head quaters in Estonia",

They established a partnership with Celsius to offer their users to earn yield money on their bitcoin. Apparently, when Celsius collapses and so is the bitcoin of their users, and as such the CEO of Paxful, refunded their customers their money from Paxful's own pocket. And it could possible cost them a lot at this point.https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1641105827892264960",

These two p2p platforms provided good rates and good user interface. Well, I see some p2p platforms coming out in the market, yet to confirm their authenticity.

Just like LocalBitcoins. I do not care in the slightest that they are shutting up shop.Noones is absolutely just Paxful under a different name and excluding the US. It also has the same KYC requirements, centralized wallets, and all the other downsides of centralized exchanges.If you want to use an actually decentralized exchange or trade actually peer to peer without these centralized exchanges spying on you and taking control of your coins, then pick an exchange from here, ideally Bisq or RoboSats: https://kycnot.me/",

The regulatory authority on the platforms started since the beginning of the year after the collapse of Ftx, we lost the two largest platforms for peer-to-peer transactions localbitcoins and Paxful. I don't know if there are alternatives that have the same degree of credibility.And as the pressures continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other platforms would respond to similar challenges. What is happening with many platforms recently highlights the need for the industry to work towards more stable and sustainable solutions for the benefit of all parts.",

It seems this isn't even about regulatory policies smothering them. Perhaps it is convenient to drop this regulatory challenges excuse, but this isn't the primary reason. This is also not about centralized platforms offering P2P, competing against them.  This is most probably the result of Youssef's co-founder Artur Schaback's lawsuit against both Paxful and Youssef. Schaback was kicked out by Youssef more than a year ago. Schaback then filed a lawsuit in Delaware 3 months ago. As a direct result of Schaback's legal actions, the \"key staff departures\" that Youssef mentioned happened. To the point that \"there were no engineers, compliance team members, or security personnel left working at the company.\" This actually prompted Youssef to shut down the platform, specifically its security implications.[1] [1] https://decrypt.co/125411/paxful-bitcoin-marketplace-closure-cofounder-lawsuit",
