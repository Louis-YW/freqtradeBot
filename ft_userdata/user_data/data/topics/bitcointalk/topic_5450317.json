  "content": "I need helpI am in need of help accessing (a) old bitcoin wallet(s). My father had said several times he had around 50000 btc when he first heard about it a while ago, and I don't know if they are fake btc or something but I want to access the wallet(s). Around a few months ago, my dad passed away and I ended up finding the old hard drives, I found 3 folders: \"Electrum-btcp\" \"Electrum\" and \"ElectronCash\" and they are all empty, I do not know where anything was stored and I just want to use the btc to get out of my hometown and go somewhere better. Can I use some help?",

If you meant you found an electrum folder that was empty, you could also try searching for a name like \"default_wallet\", \"wallet\" or \"wallet_1\". Have you not also got access to his emails if he did pass away so you can see if his funds are on an online account that was his (ie search for \"deposit\" or popular exchange names where you are). The chances he actually had 50000 btc are extremely slim, it's not impossible but it's more likely to be a lot smaller than that - it might have been a bluff too.",

HardDrive\\ProgramData\\aaQgoNINpzpuIQX\\Files has some stuffThere's a txt file containing alot of passwords for different accounts, even some super old google accounts I can't easily access at the moment. Cookie files as well. There are some other txt files that aren't crypto related like minecraft logs and some other stuff. This was all found from the program data folder",

In this case, you must get your data out of that disk right now, by contacting a recovery specialist (google: \"hard drive click of death recovery\") - do not attempt to run data recovery programs on the drive by yourself as you might risk bricking it.",

      "body": "@OP good luck with your father's wallet recovery. If it indeed contains 50000 BTC, then you could become a millionaire or even a billionaire once you find your father's seed phrase, It's just crazy, but you said something like the last update from the file on the PC was on 2019? was it in the end of that year? because It was a bull run by that time and BTC price reached 19.6k$ which was a tempting price for your father to cashout some of the BTC. Anyway be careful not to damage the failed hard drive you got and consider hiring an expert to recover the data and make sure to choose a trusted source for this service, and I hope you are able to recover the data soon. Best of luck to you!",
