In fact, such high fees for transactions chosen by users may be the reason for their low awareness of the bitcoin (banal low interaction experience), as well as standard settings (or broken settings) in popular hardware wallets, such as a Ledger or Trezor, which is why inflated commissions were spent.If these are not errors, then a conscious choice of these users?

Which means they are just ignorant or they just want to donate bitcoin to miners that mine the next block which will contain their transactions. Less than 500 sat/vbyte is still highly enough to get a transaction into the next mined block. This is just my opinion. It is a waste of money on fee if not donating it to miners.

I believe those warnings are enough for a user to recognize that a fee rate he inputs for broadcasting a transaction is something wrong.I am unsure about other wallet softwares but their developers likely follow developments of Bitcoin Core and Electrum to add something similar into their wallet softwares.I doubt these transactions are like planned one from miners, mining pool owners to self send bitcoins from wallet A to wallet B to fud the market or to spam the mempools and cause a fee race to help miners get more transaction fees.The last time mempools are terrible like this is in 2017.",

So really the bitcoin blockchain is going through a lot of spam from these types of transactions. Recent updates like Taproot and its opcodes, along with segwit discounts, make it comparatively easier for these large transactions to get sat/vByte discounts. So they have an unfair advantage on how they fill up the blockchain, and do it for on-chain tokens like you'd see in Ethereum. So really, this is what's causing all the bloat. There's no way around it and I predict this time it's going to last longer or perhaps not even end. Exchanges like OKcoin have really been promoting these types of tokens, even encouraging their users to transact in this way... So there's a lot of promotion to just add bloat to the bitcoin blockchain.",

After the fee rate has been inputted or customized to individuals choice, the wallet will still estimate the fee to be paid before the wallet user will click on broadcast.

Like I was mad over him, I did a transfer the other day with 60 sat/vbyte and I used an accelerator provided by our brother @Charles-Tim and the tools he provided really help to be frank because my transaction were confirmed it actually took few hours to be confirmed but at least it's better paying such huge amount as gas fee.",

Well, I really feel jealous here, as they are spending my savings of 8 months for just a transaction fee. Haha, now I also want to be that rich. Whenever in the future a person asks who is rich or how much money a poor person should invest in BTC (these topics have already been asked before), I will definitely say that a rich person is one who doesn't care to invest $3540 in a transaction of $15k roundabout.It's damn sure that they don't care about the money, they just want their transaction to be confirmed as soon as possible. And Christmas comes early for the miners of these TXs. It might be a possibility that they wanted other people to increase their transaction fees even more than they already have so the miners could earn more. If that's the case, then it is possible that the person who made these transactions is the one who mined them, which is itself not an easy task, but if you win the previous block, then you can choose which transaction to mine in the next block.I don't know how true I am here because I just learned this information a few days ago when I searched on Google for how to validate or confirm our own transactions.

This is of course, a conspiracy theory to an extent. Someone will need to go on-chain to prove this. However, the theory that the market was manipulated by miners post-halvings to be able to keep mining profitable is also still a theory, we can all see there was truth in this looking back and as we've learnt their influence and power later on.",
