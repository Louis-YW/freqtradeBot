To experience the good side is first to read, understand and then put into practice, if you don't read before jumping to experience, your hands will burn and by hands I mean you will learn the hard ways because you are going to lose everything, that's trading for you.You can't experience good if you don't know the difference between candles, you can't experience if you don't know local support and resistance and global resistance and support. You can't experience good if you don't know how to use stop loss, you can't experience the good side of trading if you don't know risk management, you can't dwell in trading if you don't know basic indicators, trend, market emotions.Above all, you need to remove fear to do well in trading and other aspects of bitcoin, the first time might be scary but people that are experienced trader's today don't have two heads, they removed the fear and it's now a good story (for those that learned).",

Learning by doing in short. No one can maximize learning without practical demonstration so you can apply everything what you have learned and gained. The result will tell you if you have absorb the fundamentals well or you miss some of it that makes you not reliable on your task. This same goes for crypto investing and trading, and probably for crypto gambling as well. Everything that is put into practice more often will definitely create a better version of you, a more reliable and profitable on your crypto endeavors.This is the reason why I don't advise people to trade using bots. The fact that you are not harnessing your skills because you rely on the works of other traders, then you lose the opportunity to excel on your own knowledge and skills because you put other works into priority when you should be the one to promote your own skills so you can be a successful and profitable trader in the process.",

When it comes to trading, there are lots of experience that has been shared on the internet especially in the forum here for beginners and other level to learn and practice so that they wont fall victim of any. So if you go through them try to understand what they have shared if it is what you will adapt and practice. One thing for sure is that the final decision is still yours to make whether to adhere to what they have shared and follow their advise or you can try your pattern to see if it will work best for you not minding the repercussion. This means that you are accepting any consequences and your ready to learn from your mistake. So in conclusion there are two ways to learn. One is from the experience of others and the other the experience you get form your own mistake.",

It's because they are traders who are very disciplined with opening and closing their positions. When they open their positions, they clearly have plans that when they will close their positions for either taking profit or cutting loss or simply closing their positions when time will no longer good to let it opens.Because they are disciplined and professional, they will cut loss without hesitation when they see something is wrong.Trading to hodling is only for amateur traders who don't have any plan for their tradings so when they fail with trading, they switch to hodling.

There are times where we need to face hardships in order for us to be better. Experiencing the hard times makes us better.As for traders out there, experience really makes them better that's why most of the newbie traders tend to lose money in their first try. It's because they don't know what to do, and the only way for them to adjust is to learn from their mistakes. What's important is that, you are learning from the experiences that you are gaining every single day.Words of wisdom for the day. Thanks OP",
