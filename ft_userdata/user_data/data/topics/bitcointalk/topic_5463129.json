Then i don't think the market cap is going to be in the line of quadrillion but i can say it must be in trillions hehe. That's for sure.",

The Bitcoin is going to get its upcoming halving event in 2024 and the next one after that is expected to be anywhere around 2028, and if we look at the history of Bitcoin then after each halving event the price as well as the market cap of Bitcoin has got quite noticeable growth.I don't think that there would be other methods of mining because we already have the advanced methods of mining and maybe during 2030's those chips may get better due to fabrication technology. We already have very powerful ASIC miners which are run by the one who are trying to mine Bitcoin and there won't be much improvement in that technology in 6 years. But, still the current miners will get faster during 2030's without any doubt and they will be more energy efficient by design.",

      "body": "The Bitcoin's market cap is currently 0.57 trillion dollars, which is already pretty significant, and since the supply is growing very slowly, I think it's ultimately the question of the price and going from there to capitalization. I believe that by 2030, Bitcoin can get to 2 trillion dollars in capitalization, perhaps a bit higher than that. But I'd be surprised if it gets above 5 trillion, to be honest, because I just feel like Bitcoin growth has been slowing down for a while (compare the jump from $1k to $19k in 2017 with $30k to $67k in 2021).",

Bitcoin is increasing every year so by that your 2030 bitcoin market capitalization will be very high and it will be  $5 trillion. @ SamReomo your market capitalization is over rated oh, omen, that is high well that is good ambition, but calm down small. Op foreseen the market is good but how main coins will be in your possession is another big question. When the time reach and there is no coin for you to enjoy the market at time will be a painful something so yours is to accumulate now and focus on hodling.",

Whereby the halving and bull run season are the only things on everyone's mind. By the way, before 2030, we would experience two different halving and bull run seasons before we get to 2030. And there's a big possibility that the market capitalization will be hitting $3 trillion. All the same, it would have been wiser for us to make predictions about bitcoin's market capitalization for 2030, if we are in the year 2026. By that time, we would have a clear view of the target market capitalization for Bitcoin in 2030.",

On the other hand I feel that Government regulations in different countries can affect the adoption and value of Bitcoin, these could boost growth.Another factor that could have a considerable impact on bitcoin's market capitalization would be the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million coins, it would manage to influence its value as fewer coins are mined over time. Besides halving events, which halve miner rewards, could also have an impact on supply and demand. Whatever it is, many of us hope that it will reach a high enough capitalization to satisfy our expectations.",

Now, to reach 15 trillion in 2030 it would need to grow 30 times more in half that interval, so it would need on average 60 times more investment than previously!

Bitcoin is not deflationary right now and won't be till 2030 either, the fact that you still have more Bitcoins getting mined every day is clearly a sign of this, you have an increased supply of coins!",

Bitcoin has a limited supply and lots of demand from people. The prices can only go one way and it is not down.

In that year, Bitcoin will have to go through 2024, 2028 halvings, two more halvings. If $69k is top of 2020 - 2021 bull run, I expect Bitcoin will make two new all time highs after 2024 and 2028 halvings. I think it is realistic for Bitcoin to make its price to $150,000 or $200,000 in 2030.But remember 2030 will be a bear market, not bull market so price from $150,000 or $200,000 is my expectation for Bitcoin price as its highest price in 2028 - 2029 bull market, not in 2030.",

Although bitcoin has had impressive growth in the past, its growth rate is gradually slowing down because the bigger it gets, the slower it will grow. Currently bitcoin's market cap is just over $500 billion and to reach $10 trillion that means bitcoin needs to grow 20x from now, I don't believe bitcoin will.",
