But no one can tell you which one is the safest.  It if you run out of luck, all wallets can be hacked by the hideous scammers. Blackboss has shared some nice resources which are useful. Also ensure to download Electrum from the official website only. You also will need to keep it up to date as and when a new version releases.",

Avoid importing private key from one wallet brand to another because if the wallet brand used to create that wallet is bad, has backdoors, compromised, the second wallet brand can not save your fund.I agree with your advice to abandon the initial wallet (paper wallet in this example), and move it to a new wallet (in this example, Electrum wallet).QuoteI strongly advice that you buy a paper wallet.It is hardware wallet, not paper wallet?For the Last Time, Stop Using Paper Wallets!",

      "body": "Quote from: PomskyFluff on September 29, 2024, 09:59:54 PM~~~Why posted in Bitcoin Discussion, I feel it fits much better in Bitcoin Technical Support?Electrum is a well suited light wallet that has a good reputation. It can also be used in safer operating modes, like with a hot (online) watch-only wallet part and a secure offline cold wallet part, where the cold part is only used for signing.You should understand what it means and how to operate those two hot and cold wallet parts. If you don't I highly recommend to brush up your knowledge!When you ask for a safe withdrawal of a paperwallet, I would avoid to touch the private key of the paperwallet with an online device. Sure, I would make a distinction if the paperwallet only holds a rather low amount of coins/value.To play it safe: install Electrum only from https://electrum.org; verify your download, never omit this step create a new watch-only wallet with the public address of the paperwallet on an online device; I recommend not to use your daily computer, better a second (used) one with Linux as OS, you can also simply boot a live Linux, but data persistence is a bit more tricky with those create a spending transaction withdrawing all UTXOs from the paperwallet (if there are more than one UTXO) to a public address that you control (carefully verify the correctness of the copy/pasted destination address); pay attention to a reasonable amount for the transaction fee (have a look at mempool.space for currently needed transaction fees; with Electrum your transaction have RBF enabled anyway) --- remember to understand how Bitcoin transactions work, a transaction input is spent as a whole; if you want to spend only part of it, the excess has to go to another output (can be the same as the input address) or it will become transaction fee! as you can't sign the transaction in a watch-only wallet, export it as PSBT file to a thumbdrive for the cold wallet you need an offline device that can't ever connect to the internet, best not even accidently; best is a dedicated offline device for this, but it can be accomplished e.g. with booting TAILS without a network connection; I don't go into details here further, there are topics with all the details for this create a new cold wallet by importing the private key of the paperwallet on your \"cold\" offline device import the PSBT for the spending transaction, verify it carefully and if all is good, sign it and export the signed transaction I would recommend not to destroy the private key of the paperwallet even when you have withdrawn it fully; you never know... now back on the hot online wallet import the signed transaction, check it a last time and broadcast itIf you're not familiar with certain steps, you can ask or do your own research. I'm not going to spoon-feed you.",

I don't think this paper wallet is ideal for frequent transactions. Really safe creation of paperwallets isn't that easy, now that almost all modern printers like to call home and are network connected. Most paperwallet generators are Javascript based and the security of Javascript-based secure entropy is somewhat disputed. Not to mention actively scamming websites that offer rigged paperwallet generators that will make you loose your funds even when you use the generator offline!Paperwallets also have limitations and usually reveal the private key easily to an intruder if found by those who shouldn't have gotten access to them.Just get a decent good hardware wallet and be good with it.
