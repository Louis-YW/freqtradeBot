If it is then I'll prefer to learn risk reward management before investing so that you will not worried if you invested dropped. If you choose small money to invest but you have lack of knowledge then you cannot get profit because you don't know what you investing. So before entering in trading, crypto make sure that you research before betting your money that can easily lose at any time.",

In my investing experience, I see that when I study and keep updating the latest news it can avoid losing my investment, my return on investment becomes bigger and more stable and I stop losing my investment capital. That's what good management can do.And it's true that it's better to use small money than to use money that isn't free, especially by going into debt for this investment, a fatal mistake. Although later investments can increase wealth, there are still risks and can not always generate profits.",

Newbies have to understand that some investment will never give you profit no matter how long they stay especially if you investment is on shit coin. Don't rely on what you are told before investing but to make adequate research, asking questions here because some members are well knowledgeable in crypto investment.",

What if it happens that the period they need the funds falls between the bullish market?? ¬†And they aren't left with any options than to sell? Won't that be mean - losing everything??

But you should also note that in most cases the higher the risk the greater the profit margin. So if you are willing to take more risks, you might end up making more money. Almost all the billionaires in the world are dangerous risk-takers. Some of them go bankrupt if an investment fails but more money if it succeeds. But like OP started we should take risks based on our level and don't be greedy to invest more than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is a unique investment that gives almost everybody the privilege of buying because it could be bought in bits and can be sold easily. It might not be easy to sell a landed property but bitcoin buyers are always available.",

And this logic has been inscribed into the minds of young ones and most of them just waste their time for getting investment money from someone (maybe a relative, parents or any person) and once they got it they seek ways to invest it, in ways that they don't even have to work for it just put their investments and wait for profits. This is just chaos, i have seen so many practical life examples and tried my best to teach them the basic rule you have started, but still, any fail to acquire it too. i know this rule seems so simple and many intend to ignore it but simply becomes hard when time passes and you have got no more of it.",

So why we should keep thinking it was okay to lose this money when we have ways to avoid it and work harder? It is all about the mindset that we have. We must know how to value every penny that we have that is why we don't think about it was just spare money but I rather be thinking it was our hard-earned money.",

Investing on an amount you can afford to lose is one way on managing the risk when taking investments. Because the fact that there is no assurance if you will make profits out from your investment, then it‚Äôs a wise move to just invest using your spare money, so that if your investment fails and lose your capital, you will not struggle with how you‚Äôll manage your remaining finances and you will easily recover the funds that you have lost. That way, you will be motivated to be more knowledgeable and gain experience first before you start putting good amount to invest.",
