Thank you!According to a new law from 2018/19 it's normally illegal to operate btc ATMs in Japan  .I know there are 2 listed but only checked the one in Akihabara some months ago. Unfortunately it was turned off so I cannot give any info about the fees. Before the law there were plenty of ATMs or people to meet via localbitcoins but now everything goes via exchanges here.",

Thank you.There's an article in Cointelegraph from August 2022 saying that the machines were turned back on: https://cointelegraph.com/news/after-four-years-japan-brings-back-its-first-crypto-atm. However, the situation may have already changed -- who knows.The article also states that the machines require registering with the company. I suppose that entails showing an identification card but I do not know.",

No mention of buying can be found, only selling.QuoteBTM is an automatic cryptocurrency exchange machine that allows you to exchange cryptocurrencies into Japanese yen and withdraw them on the spot. Currently, it supports four types of crypto assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. You can withdraw up to 100,000 yen at a time.*The limit (number of times) is up to 100,000 yen per time, 3 times a day, 5 times a week, 20 times a month, and 5 million yen a year. (However, depending on the user's occupation, financial assets, income, etc., there may be a limit (number of times) of up to 2 million yen per year.)2. KYC/identity verification is required. QuoteWe are working to prevent financial crimes by preventing fraudulent use through impersonation through identity verification when registering users, two-step authentication when using BTM, and monitoring camera images.3. I should also mention that you have to register online and wait for your designated card to arrive before you can use the machine.QuoteStep 01: Register for use from your smartphone or computer. After completing the registration, we will mail the user card to the registrant's home.4. It appears they charge 20%???.... that's pretty high.QuoteThe fee rates stated in are set as follows.  〇Crypto asset exchange fee  Currency Exchange Fee Equivalent to 20% of the Yen amount you wish to withdraw  *The exchange fee is the amount of Japanese yen that the customer wishes to withdraw, and the fee rate set by the Company (consumption tax  This exchange fee is added to the desired yen amount to be disbursed.  The amount of crypto assets obtained by dividing this value by the transaction rate will be the amount of crypto assets to be sent to the customer.",
