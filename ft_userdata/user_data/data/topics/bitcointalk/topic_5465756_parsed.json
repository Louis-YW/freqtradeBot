To use this money to pay for your education, so you can conclude a superior course and achieve a higher degree, having access to a wide jobs' market, or to use that money to acquire an apartment, house or piece of land, so you can make a passive income from this.People will have different opinions about this. If I am making money, I mean enough money and if I am rich already, I can never go for education because it is the education that I have that makes me rich. It is not about going to school before someone can be educated.But for my children, they are young and I will not want them to be inferior to their other colleagues, I will send them to school.Quote from: uneng on September 05, 2023, 02:42:52 PMIt brings the following question up: what is more valued in life: to be or to have? Does it make someone fulfilled to have while not being or being without having anything?I may not be able to answer all your questions, but the most important thing someone should have is money, after good health.",

Does it make someone fulfilled to have while not being or being without having anything?The answer to this question will depend on the individual's goals and circumstances. Studying might be the best option if someone wants to gain skills and qualifications to help their career. However, acquiring assets as a source of passive income and working might be more practical if you need to earn a living and support yourself financially. It definitely depends on the person's forte and the industry they think they are good. As for me, I know in myself that I have more chance of reaching financial stability through continuous studying, and so I did. Now, I am working, together with the passive income I accumulate through earning from the application of my skills and knowledge. What matters most is considering your current financial situation, future career aspirations, and personal goals before deciding.",

There are some people who may have free accomodation from their parents until they are 30, allowing them to fund both. There are others that may be kicked out at 18 and fending for themselves who will find it extremely tough to fund higher education. Both things can also come at different times in life, student loans may happen before you're 25 and housing mortgage costs may happen after 25. You have to be careful with higher education though and be sure there are plenty of higher paying jobs in the field you are studying if money is your aim.",

Don't forget that if you choose higher education, you'll still need to cover your daily expenses, books, clothes, etc. so it's worse than owning a house considering the costs along the way. You might be able to afford your daily expenses if you rent your extra house while learning by yourself and working to get some experience, but that option will vanish if you choose the formal education option. And the output? It's not guaranteed that you'll get a good job with the certificate. It's not worth it.",

I can't make choices for you and since both have their importance, some will go for education first; probably because you need it to be literate. But if I'm to choose? I'd go for property allocation.

To use this money to pay for your education, so you can conclude a superior course and achieve a higher degree, having access to a wide jobs' market, You made the question easier by adding concluding a superior course and wide job opportunities. Of that is what superior education attracts ideally on a normal circumstances because times are now different from what it was when you can be educated and acquire good job. So it is better to pay for school fees to finish up a higher course that will help you get better job because you can buy bigger properties in the future.Quote from: uneng on September 05, 2023, 02:42:52 PMor to use that money to acquire an apartment, house or piece of land, so you can make a passive income from this?There is no time limit to buy property but education though does not also have limit but the interest might not be there again and your level of knowledge might diminish as you get older. So education should be priority.Quote from: uneng on September 05, 2023, 02:42:52 PMIt brings the following question up: what is more valued in life: to be or to have?

But if you choose to sacrifice your education to buy the land, you can lose that land or possibly something else happens and it will be too late for you to get the education that you should have gotten some years ago. You cannot do somethings when you pass a certain age, so do things when the time is right for them. Education may not be able to wait, but buying a land can wait.",

Cause even if I say that I'd rather have to own a land or apartment to gain passive income in which I could use for my education. Since here in my country (PH) even if you graduated with a degree there's still a lot of people are having a hard time to find a stable job. Some haven't even used their degree like going to the other path like you're aiming to be an engineer once graduated but you've ended up being a call center agent which is nothing wrong, my point is that it really depends on the environment and the people. Cause here if you have a land, you'll have a huge opportunity to have passive income where you can widen your options once you have the money since houses here are pricey as hell.",
