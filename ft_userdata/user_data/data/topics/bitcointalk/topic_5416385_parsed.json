Remember:\"Everybody is a genius during a bull market.\"And now we see that they weren't geniuses at all.We are in a bear market in stocks and crypto, bonds too. You need to find what is doing well during these times and invest in it. Majority of the crypto currencies are scam so it is wise to stay away from them till the FED again start to lower the interest rates. When that time comes back, everything will be going up again.",

When noone is interested everything is cheap so things you buy will become very valuable in future when everyone will join to make money. That will be where you leave out. Actually bull market peak is where you sell. Its main point with crypto. But I think its better to wait some more before buying alternative coins.",

Not all bear market is the right time to buy because there is a chance that it might worsen and price can go lower than we expected. Learn how to read the global economy it will always be connected in crypto since peope will have money to invest in crypto if they are receiving good pay rate and paying less tax or interest for there daily expenses. I always preferred buying when there is a confirmation for a trend reversal. I don't care if I missed to purchase on the lowest price because I preferred to buy on price that I’m comfortable that it will go up rather than bear market and still feel anxious that price might go much lower than my buy price.",

When you are in a bear market, you think the price will keep dropping so you don't want to buy lol. If you believe in a project, than a bear market is a good idea to buy but don't go all-in and spread your money over multiple coins.",

And i suggest much better to spectate some coins so that you can get some information which is still very promising despite of bearish situation so that when market shows a good sign of bull run you can easily pick where to invest.",

If we are talking about good coins here, then buying at a cheaper price are always the smart move. Remember, there’s a lot of weak people that don’t want to take the risk on buying during bear market and that’s why they missed a lot of opportunities. You have two options though, you can wait for the price to down a little before you buy or you can start buying some now and when the price goes dipper, you can buy more. Take the risk and with good coins, it’s more worth it.",

Dont expect something like pumps or increases on a bear market.There might be greens but only on small percentage pumps.What can you expect on a bear market?Speaking about right time to buy coins then it would really be just common sense that you would really be pertaining or looking on bear times where price is almost on the bottom.You cant just consider on buying out when its already on FOMO times or hype.You would really be just basically messing up your investment.Its true that buying on bear times arent simple yet hesitance and fear or simply your emotion would be your main enemy on these kind of moments.",

There is no need to be afraid of bears because the bear market is the best time to buy many coins that can increase. But unfortunately, in this bear market, many people are afraid to buy because they think the price will drop further and eventually disappear from the market. And if they think like that, they will miss the best moment to collect the best coins and lose the opportunity to make a profit. This time, we still have more time to buy many coins, so use that opportunity before it is too late.",

But the fact is that they prefer to buy when the market is bullish, their fear is the cause. How many today talk about the bear market as if they are pessimistic that the market will not stabilize again? They are afraid that their money will not be stable and decrease every day, even though investment brings not only profits but also losses.",

People are taking shit token as a gamble for their money. The dead token can also be pumped but it's very risky to take the meme token as investment these days",
