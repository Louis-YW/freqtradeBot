  "content": "Considering that the number of banned accounts is increasing daily and over time, I want to take this opportunity to offer advice to new users of bitcointalk.org. I'm not sure why this is the case, but I believe it is because of a few factors that I want to discuss right now.1. Lack of proper forum knowledge: At this point, I'm sure the majority of people join these forums without having a thorough understanding of how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work. Instead of asking questions when they don't understand something, they instead copy someone else's ideas and claim them as their own, which is bad and against the forum rules. 2: Technical board: Most of the banned accounts I've seen in the forum were barred from replying to a topic in the technical board, and I suspect that these accounts had plagiarized by copying content from the internet and pasting it there. The technical board is not appropriate for new users who have just joined the forum to learn about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The only thing a novice who is unfamiliar with bitcoin should do there is to just ask technical questions, not to respond because you don't understand what is being said.3. Greed: As a newcomer, you don't have to be greedy about anything; simply ask questions if you don't understand something. This is one of the most significant roles these forum play when it comes to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.All of what I've said here is merely what I've noticed from the banned accounts I've seen in the past; if you're a newcomer and want to post something here, you need to conduct your own research (DYOR) and comprehend the subject matter. There is a link you must use to ensure that your post is original; perhaps new users are unsure of how to use it or are unwilling to boarder.

I'm open to any more comments that might prevent too many accounts from being banned from the forum. You don't need to visit any site to confirm if your article is free from plagiarism or not. It's only when you copy text from different sources and try to make it look as if all the entire content belongs to you that you need tools like those you mentioned to check if your contents are convincing enough not to be detected as plagiarized content. If one writes something from his brain, even if the person might have read it from the internet weeks, months, or years ago, there is very little possibility of the writer's content looking exactly like that of the learning source, unless the person crams the entire word. If not, whatever you are writing from your head will definitely be different from others, even if there are about three of you who read the same book. Your point of view and understanding will be different from others'. Among all your aforementioned reasons why people get banned, plagiarism is one of the things I noticed moderators don't take seriously; they either give a temporary ban or a permanent ban; it all depends on the level of your offense.Another one you fail to add is having different alt accounts participate in the same campaign with the purpose of rug pulling, bounty cheating, ban evasion, etc. all of this are things which add to banning of accounts.",

Cheating with multiple alts do not get banned in the forum because it is not against the forums. It is most likely tag negative by DT or campaign just to send out warning that such member can’t be trusted. The most common reason for permanent banning is the plagiarism and the malicious links sent on the group. The likes of spamming and sending unsolicited PMs are mostly temporary banned and if the users doesn’t change their ways they could get the permanent ban. Another thing is having your posts deleted way too much that the deleted posts are more than the actual posts left, which could also lead to a permanent ban.",

      "body": "The technical board is for those who are really knowledgeable about Bitcoin tech and development, as well as for those users who have any questions about Bitcoin tech that they need answers to. So if a newbie is not knowledgeable about tech and is not even asking any relevant question on the tech board, their post can be deleted multiple times by the moderator with a warning, but if they persist in shitposting and spamming the board, they will definitely get banned. Also, some of them who post a malware link, end up being banned.There is always room to learn in this forum and make corrections where possible, but some of the newbies are not even concerned about the rules, and the best thing they can get is a ban. A newbie is a newbie, but as long as one can read and write, the first thing to do when they go into any platform is to read the rules and make inquiries about it if they don't know any, but most of them are being very ignorant or even what they read.Well, I hope most of them read or are even too lazy to read. I was a once a newbie here too, I can say I made some mistakes but at least I asked questions and I got some helpful links which I still make use of some of those link I got in that my first thread, I read and learn some forum guid and rules and that's why I am still here.",

Instead of asking questions when they don't understand something, they instead copy someone else's ideas and claim them as their own, which is bad and against the forum rules. It's ironic that beginners who are here to learn about bitcoin without following basic forum norms still claim control over posts that don't belong to them. I simply regard this as a very grave act perpetrated by a novice. I would have argued they don't know the punishment for duplicating someone else's work online because they haven't gone through the rules or are unfamiliar with the regulations here, but having to claim someone else's work and make the statement appear like theirs shouldn’t be tolerable in this scenario. When you join a new place or forum, the first thing you should ask or read about is the regulations that govern it in order to avoid being a victim.",

Maybe in projects and users getting scammed of there funds. Perhaps that could happen and has been happening but that leading to bans, its definitely not in the context you've put it.Although, there are accounts that have been temporarily banned in the past for reasons that are bounty related. Such as, having to spam post or earn without doing any real task but merely making directive comments based on a manager's directive on a project.One way one can lose an account is by clicking just any link you see on the forum, even as a pm. You just might be clicking some phishing adhoc link that could create a backdoor to some hacker. It's best you try to quote and report should you notice anything strange on the links.We can't be too used to the forum or be the best persons but we would always try.",

Tags can be negative or neutral depends on the member who tags you.Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMWhile we will not be directly moderating this, I encourage people to give merit to posts that are objectively high-quality, not just posts that you agree with.Do not beg for merit excessively.Quote from: theymos on February 05, 2019, 06:57:48 PM - Giving negative trust for merit trading and deceptive alt-account use may be appropriate, but you should use a light touch so that people don't feel paranoid.Quote from: theymos April 24, 2018The current status quo seems OK. If you have to pay $20 per merit plus a risk of getting red trust, then that's a situation that doesn't concern me at all. I'm not going to lose sleep over people going to ridiculous lengths to buy merit, since only a small number of people will be willing and able to do that.As long as merit sales are a black market, I'm happy, since that makes it far more difficult and expensive to buy merit. If that's the case, then the small volume of black-market merit trades don't themselves bother me much, and I think that it does more harm than good to get too witch-hunty about it.Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIf a DT member tags you for something stupid involving merit (ie. probably anything less than selling merit), then they're not going to be a DT member for much longer.QuoteAnd also, coming to this forum to share referral links is not allowed as this is not Facebook or other social media where you share links to get referral rewards.
