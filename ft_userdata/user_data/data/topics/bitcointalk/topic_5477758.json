Please always use the search bar and google search to confirm the topics before starting a new topic and for for me oh this topic is not needed. We all know from the beginning that scammers are moving around whom to be victimized. This topic is a music we are singing in the forum so if any still fall victim then na the person problem. At first base on the topic I think say you don go see new project at somewhere wey you carry come yan us. And when I read the first paragraph, I think say you go provide some of the scam matter but nothing come out. No be every time we go make thread, sometimes make we use as comment, merit go still come if it solve, answer and contribute to questions.",
