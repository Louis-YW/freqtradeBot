It's completely up to you. You should understand the price is very volatile, and any news (for example ETFs being rejected/approved) could trigger a big move in price.",

The best strategy will be to do DCA with the way the price is going up and down. Waiting for the right time to buy is something I wouldnâ€™t advice because we never might know maybe this is the lowest we will see bitcoin or it will go down again. But to cast doubts out it is better to invest when you have the money",

Electrum is a hot wallet, so if you are using electrum default hot wallet, then it isn't safe for long term holding. The safest wallet for hodling Bitcoin for the long term is wallets that are offline, wallets like hardware wallets or air-gapped wallets (of which you can create with electrum).Quote from: Makus on September 06, 2023, 08:00:50 AMWith the current reduction of price in Bitcoin, is it the best time to buy bitcoin or should I still wait for the dip?.DYOR.

But the reason to buy now is because any further downtrend would only be an unrealized loss if the buyer do not sell, and the price will later increase and reach all-time-high. That is the reason it is wise to buy bitcoin now. Some people can even go for the DCA option. So if anyone buys bitcoin now and the price started to fall, the person should not panic but wait and the price will increase back and later all-time-high will become a reality again.",

There is no bottom so no matter how dip the price of bitcoin goes some people will never be satisfied and will tell you the price will drop more. If you think the price will go down then buy in parts. If the price further crashes you will DCA to lower your average. This is the safest and most proven method I know of investing in Bitcoin.",

But you must understand that the longer you wait for a profitable offer, the more time you lose if you prefer to invest using the DCA method. Check the history to make sure that even if you make a mistake with the price now, bitcoin will still grow over time. Therefore, if you have an amount that you do not need for some period of time, feel free to buy, but do not give up on any price fluctuation.

Well, it's challenging to predict price movements accurately.For a long-term investment, I would prefer dollar-cost averaging (DCA).

When you express yourself in this way, then I can say that it is definitely not good advice, because it turns out that every hardware wallet is equally secure, which is simply not true. We are witnessing that what we considered safe yesterday becomes unsafe overnight, so we need to choose carefully which HW we will choose.I, for one, cannot say that a good HW is one that has the possibility to share the user's seed with third parties, but I cannot say that a good HW is one that has an irreparable vulnerability that, if not properly patched by the user, allows possible attackers to extract the seed for less than 5 minutes in case he gets physical access to the device.",
