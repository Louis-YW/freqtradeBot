Isn't it the same thing in this case, but it's just fiat in digital form, or I am missing some detail?Those who are smart will still choose Bitcoin over CBDCs if they want to make certain transactions like it is the case right now.",

Bitcoin removed this kind of thing and if only people knows exactly how important bitcoins in today's era, Banks will no longer needed.",

When you are holding/moving funds through the banking systems, then there is ZERO difference.",

Let this thing get implemented so we can see the outcomes. Remember, there cannot be any final verdict for something incorrectly included.",
