The recovery we already had is nothing compared to amount of pain we have had before. We did not even hit a 0.236 fib lvl yet (long term from top to the bottom). There is a lot to space to go up even if its not the beginning of new bull run and we are about to see a new lower low few months after.",

Last time there was a doji similar to this was January 2017 or otherwise March 2012, prior to further upside.To me the candle resembles more 2012 than 2017, as price was still down -85% from ATH after bouncing from the lows (-93%), as opposed to 2017 just below ATH. What followed was a +1% monthly candle lol. Quote from: tokeweed on March 01, 2023, 12:54:34 PMSo what do you guys think?  Up above 25k USD by end of March or still below it?Based on February close, I'm relatively neutral again now with bears & bulls failing to move prices higher or lower by the end of the month, until there is further confirmation with a price move in either direction. There is strong bearish divergence on Daily chart that's difficult to ignore, as well as continued rejection from bearish trending 50 Week MA currently at $24K (third consecutive week now), so I do think if $23K support will break then the next level of support is around the 200 Day MA at $19.8K. But otherwise if bulls can reclaim $24K in the coming days/weeks, then breaking $25K towards $30K seems much more likely.So while that is pretty vague, I do however think that if price can break $25K then we could easily have another +40% move to $32K, as it would confirm February candle as a consolidation/continuation doji, as opposed to a trend reversal / bullish exhaustion candle. The irony being it's too early to tell until there is confirmation in either direction imo, even if bears might have the upper hand in the short-term.",

I don't have the best idea other than hold and hold and ignore the negative sentiment, however it is good to stay optimistic about the future. Although we can't say for sure how much it will cost in the next 1 to 2 years, but we are already prepared for the possibility.",

I'd still not thinking this March will give us a surprising trend but probably be the same as February - it grow slowly. Well, I hope we can reach $30k before the end of 1st quarter this year and I consider it a great development of the market. Because we don't need to have a fast recovery but what we need is consistency as we still reach the $50k, $60, and more in the coming days...",

By comparison, there appears to be a lot more volume between around $16.5K and $24 than than $30K to $40K for example, so for me the idea that $28K will act as any meaningful resistance (if price is to reach there soon) seems quite unlikely imo.The bullish outlook would be that there are clear skies above $25K based on volume profile, because most of the volume is just below as opposed to above. As a reminder as well, back in 2019 with price at $5K there was a lot more volume above around $6K and $8K than below around $3K to $4K, but none the less price was able to move above this resistance all the way to $14K as if the resistance was insignificant.So overall, I take any resistance between $30K and $40K with a pinch of salt, because compared to 2019 $6K to $8K resistance level, it looks barely significant (volume wise at least).",

I guess for me 2019 took me by surprise, I wasn't expecting Bitcoin to get back to $6K levels let alone reach $14K, so trying to mentally prepare for that possibility this time around. First a foremost price needs to get above $25K, without that, I don't see any breaking of $30K to $40K towards $50K. As maybe price instead just stays between $15K and $25K for rest of the year due to MtGox coins getting released.",

The only reason why the price of Bitcoin fell today, Friday, March 3rd, according to the latest data, is Silvergate Capital Cryptocurrency, a bank. This Silvergate bank shocked the entire cryptocurrency industry. The crisis of confidence has led to a suspension of filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Because of this, I think today's Bitcoin market is suddenly a step down.Every time the price of Bitcoin starts to rise, there is a bad news.  However, the possibility of Bitcoin price crossing 30k in March is very unlikely.
