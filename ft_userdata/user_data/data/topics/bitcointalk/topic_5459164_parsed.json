      "body": "It's because of the difference between the format used for each drive (your system's storage and the USB disk). Your HDD/SSD which is the source is usually using the newer and more reliable NTFS format while your USB disk which is the destination is using the older and less reliable FAT/FAT32 format hence the warning.To solve it you should format your USB disk (create a backup of any files you have on there) using the newer and more reliable NTFS format if you can.",
