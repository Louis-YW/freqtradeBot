  "content": "I think this is something more people should be aware of. To begin with, it might seem like common sense to people in this board since most here are experienced with games and gambling platforms. But to any new comer into the gambling scene it probably isn't as obvious. What am I talking about? Well, at least once you must have stumbled upon a stream where someone plays slots. These streams are normally sponsored by the casino that hosts the games. They pay the streamer a salary and even fund his account. So the casino knows who the streamer is, what his account is and when he'll be playing. The thing is, that these streamers get big wins so often that it seems very unlikely for their streaks to be happening at random. We would know this as casinos say in their terms that playing with fun money does not incur the same level of randomness when playing with real money, which is really code for saying that fun money results to more flashy wins when you really can't win anything. So it's not unlikely that streamers are also getting some similar treatment as they don't play with their own money. This can attract their viewers to deposit and gamble with real money of course, but they'll very rarely get the same results. This is something I've tried to highlight to my friends that want to get  into gambling, but overall not many people seem to be aware. What has your experience been? Has this affected you or your friends?",

They will surely win big too often because they are betting big and also betting frequently. We don’t know exactly if they are using different set of games since they are just using their normal casino account on stream. I watch a lot of streamers and they are losing too like everybody else. They just have shit tons of bankroll that’s why they can always hit a couple of huge win due to their high bet.As normal gambler, This is really unrealistic but you will understand their level once you consider their bankroll and the frequency of their bet since they have nothing to lose here because the money is just sponsored while they are still earning from viewership and commission.Let’s always remember that streamers main purpose is to entertain viewers. No one will enjoy watch them if they are always losing big time. Don’t take their job seriously because they are not a regular gambler like us.",

First off FIAT-only casinos almost never work with provably fair games. So that's red flag number one. Red flag number two is how FIAT casinos don't disclose their ads on streaming sites, especially when they hunted casinos other big casinos off streaming sites for good. My country is a good example of this for instance. The local \"licensed\" casinos in Greece pushed the local regulator to block crypto casinos, and in the meantime the local ones are allowed to advertise with big streamers as they like. But in reality they're even more shady, because they don't explain anything about volatility and RTP to their players.",

But I still ended up losing all those multipliers.Trust me, it looks like streamers often win multipliers, but the truth is they most often lose. We as viewers, only focus on winnings  not on how much the streamer lost. It could be that the accounts used by streamers are known by the casino operations since they sponsor those accounts, but I doubt the casino would do that to make the streamer hit max win or any high multiplier.",

Many aged players and young people fall for these streamers and click through their affiliates links showing huge discounts to con them into signing into the casino they promote. A lot of the said casinos they promote ain't promising to beginners and most times are illicit. I mean don't meet the supposed requirements for a responsive online casino. However, the streamers make lots of profits from the casino they promote. Pays ranging from tens to hundreds thousands of dollars. Due to the enormous traffic they generate for the casino. The wins is what causes the deceit. The fastest way to con people is by giving them a too good to be true offer. They'll be controlled by their emotions to be rich and fall for such casinos. Though, the results are manipulated, but everyone knows it. Even the streamers in different interviews with news channels like WIRED mention that the casino fund them to stream games. The problem with their viewers is that they expect to see similar results, which tend to be impossible. Because what they see is a contract deal and the casino, like you said know their workers and would make their results far too good for everyone that watches to feel intrigued to join gambling. And, naive people would at least want to make lots of money.",

It’s the typical behavior human to follow the heard especially if there’s already proof of potential good outcome.Online casino is doing the same trick that’s why they always post huge win on their social media status and partnerships with streamers to have a good publicity on winning big on their casino. Their target is new customers and not professional with their ads because they already know that it’s not effective to gambler with experience just like what you said.",

For stupid people maybe they will believe in what the stremers are doing, I'm sure they will follow the advice given by the stremers just to get the number of wins like them. Haha lol that's very silly, maybe their understanding is still too early in terms of gambling or maybe their brains and minds are already covered so it is very difficult to be able to think logically.I believe and believe that the stremers use fake money or promo accounts provided by the casino in every video they show, before the casino has set up the account so that the victory dominates, and obviously nothing but the goal is to lure gamblers or even beginners to enter their casino. And that's where beginners will say \"the way the stremer suggested didn't work for me\" haha that's a real trick that casinos often end up doing by paying stremers for promoting their casinos. It's not necessary, and I think it's better to gamble on your own.",

So the casino knows who the streamer is, what his account is and when he'll be playing. I have seen something similar like this in some casinos some few months ago, it was early this year to be precisely. What this guys were doing is that, they were paying influencers to promote their betting platform and in return pay back huge money for endorsements. What the platform does was that, they created two sections, one for real players and the for influencers to use for advertisement. The influencers segment was fake and they never had any loss when they demonstrate the platform to players but when you use the main segment, you lose times without number. This is to tell you that not all endorsed platforms are to be trusted.QuoteThe thing is, that these streamers get big wins so often that it seems very unlikely for their streaks to be happening at random.

You can't convince everyone and don't expect others to yield to your opinion, if you tell them and they refuse to listen, then you let them be for that particular time, when it is time for them to learn, they will learn and when they do, hope it doesn't affect them badly but you must let them decide something because they say that experience is the best teacher.Majorly, only newbies fall into this streamers because I can't say and I have not seen any person comes out bodly to say that he has won something beautiful from this guys. If you check the streamers, they have something in common and it's that they don't condemn platforms they advertised. Even real platforms that are well reputed get casted for their mistakes but streamers are always perfect.",

I don't follow any streamers, but from time to time I see some Twitter shares, and when I see how many \"max wins\" on Hacksaw I get a big wish for crying... that is one of the worst providers for me, I had x0 so many times, and I never won over x1k on Hacksaw, and I tried so many times... so many bonus rounds won from normal spins, even more bought bonus rounds, and nothing. I know I simply didn't have luck with this provider, that's why I am not playing it anymore.
