Ryder One will be using Shamir Secret Sharing, and we talked many times before that this is inferior compared to Multisig setup and has single point of failure. https://www.ryder.id/What is the price going to be for this device we don't know yet, but let me give my prediction for something between $300 and $500.",

That is not even possible. But definitely what you are discussing is clear to understand.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 23, 2023, 09:54:21 PMRyder one has No seed phrases, No physical buttons, No ports, No Bluetooth, No Wi-Fi, and they claim this device is 100% tamper-proof.Communication is done using NFC connection with Ryder Mobile App installed on smartphone.When I was reading this, I thought I could point out wallet like Muun which is a software wallet that does not make use of seed phrase backup, but after I later read about wallet recovery through friends and trusted people, this is another stupid wallet.The wallet will not also make use of QR code and also can not be connected to other wallet like Electrum.What we are seeing about hardware wallets is not good at all, see the reputed Trezor that have gone worse by adding coinjoin and later decided to make a hardware wallet with close source secure element, now is this another one that does not want to make use of seed phrase. About this wallet, I am expecting a backdoor, or something similar in the future. Maybe there would be a time hardware wallets will go so bad that people will have to rely on airgapped devices. Airgapped devices and multisig wallet will always exist.$300 to $500 will also be too expensive when there are better hardware wallets with the features and specifications that I like at $200.",

On the video, it is said that backup can be done with the Ryder mobile application and the Ryder mobile tag. And the backup can be done by touching the two devices together which will take 60 seconds (but maybe less than 60 seconds, I do not know, but 60 second is what on the video). But also social circle can be used which requires your phone or recovery tag and two family members or friends.Quote from: BitMaxz on October 23, 2023, 11:55:42 PMI don't think this would be the worst hardware wallet based on its appearance it looks the same as a smartwatch I checked their website and they mention IP68 which is the model name of a smartwatch.I think we should not to determine if a hardware wallet is the worst or not using its physical appearance.

Seed phrases and private keys are scary and confusing to the general public.All you need to backup is the seed phrase. Is that scary and confusing to you? I do not think it scary and confusing. If you are thinking of not being secure offline, you can use a passphrase. Having both backups differently and differently stored in different locations. All that is needed is to know what seed phrase and passphrase are which will not take you more than 5 minutes to read and understand.

Tapsafe recovery method by Ryder one is surely not a better solution and i don't even know how you can recover your wallet in another software or hardware wallet since you need to use their mobile application and tap Ryder one on your phone to recover your wallet.Ryder one also requires the Ryder recovery tag to recover your wallet, and on their site they advise customers to have at least more than one recovery tag, it is much better to use a recommended HD wallet and back up your seed phrase in more than one secure location and recover it in compatible software and hardware wallets whenever you need to. Ryder are also including recovery by family or friends, which reminds me of Mixin safe.",

The very principle of hardware wallets was that private keys and seed phrases are secured by the hardware it's held on. In fact any wallet would have a private key, just maybe use it differently. So if their goal is to not be able to export your private key, it might even be an anti-feature actually making things harder instead of bringing more innovation.",

But at the same time they will keep silent that they themselves will have access to these crypto assets and in the event of, for example, your death, your friends and relatives will not be able to return your crypto assets and it will all remain on the company’s balance (which they can appropriate for themselves).Quote from: dkbit98 on October 23, 2023, 09:54:21 PMThey are using Recovery Tags with their mobile app for creating backup, but that means you can't use this for any other hardware wallets.It doesn't take a genius to understand that one fine day this company will cease to exist and you will be left with nothing.
