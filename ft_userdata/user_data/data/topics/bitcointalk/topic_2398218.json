Everyone would expect the bitcoin to reach the more value but bitcoin value correction will be increased and miner will again turns to bitcoin.I am really happy that bitcoin price started increasing again and it seems again grown to 6.6k USD in the chart. I have heard that some big mining group gone to mine BCH.",

They're testing the limits for sure. but it seems like someone will profit greatly out of this coordinated attack.Yeah, I also have a feeling that this is not the last we've heard from BCH. I wouldn't go as far as calling it an attack though. It's simply what happens when multiple coins share the same PoW hash and one gets pumped. Arguably it shows a merit of BTC relying on ASICs instead of GPUs, because otherwise BTC would be forced to battle with other alts for computing resources as well.",

They're testing the limits for sure. but it seems like someone will profit greatly out of this coordinated attack.I don't think it's over, either. This is all unfolding piece by piece, and I'm beginning to agree with Sergio Lerner that Bcash was a damn masterpiece in game theory. At this point, what I can say is this: do not underestimate Jihan Wu and friends. They have very deep pockets (USD, BTC, BCH), and they are very skilled with propaganda and are leveraging anyone they can (Kim Dotcom, Calvin Ayre, Vitalik Buterin, etc). And Bitmain has a stranglehold over the ASIC manufacturing market. And they're only accepting BCH for new mining hardware. The spam attacks on the network are truly impressive. I've never seen anything like this..... a coordinated attack from all directions. These people are dedicated. I truly hope the market buys up all their dumped BTC and shows them the exit.",

They want miners to switch permanently, not flit around, which means pumping the price and keeping it there while keeping the spamming up. As they're collecting the fees they're spamming with then it can continue as long as they like pretty much. Traders are such mindless sluts that they'll pile in if a pump is initiated with enough power and enough BTC is dumped.",
