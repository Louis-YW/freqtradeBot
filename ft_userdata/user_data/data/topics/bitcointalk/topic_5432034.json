Since the majority of countries do not consider the use of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money or a commodity varies, with different regulatory implications. While some other countries explicitly allowed its use and circulation, others have banned it. Following the same analytical approach, various government agencies, departments, courts, and even academic and financial institutions have rated Bitcoin differently.Although your post explains the legal status of bitcoin in comparison between America and other countries, the rationing and bans that apply to cryptocurrencies often also apply to other similar systems.",

      "body": "USA doesn't control bitcoin. If you acquire more bitcoins you won't be in the hands of the US, rather you will be independent and autonomous from any governments and authorities, because bitcoin is decentralized. Actually, by holding and using bitcoin you are protecting yourself from the big nations which try to rule the world, as your money will be immune to their financial policies which depreciate the value and purchasing power of fiat currencies, while inflation grows without limits. Bitcoin is above the power exercised by governments, doesn't matter their political spectrums.",

Who told you adoption is high especially in Africa? There is a difference between Africans trading crypto to enhance their financial status than claiming they have adopted crypto. People still largely accept old Fiat currency from my own location, despite the high number of youth mostly involved in crypto. Fiat still serves them well despite it's numerous issues.",
