UBETis a decentralized web3 sports betting platform that enables sports trading using USDC. UBET is distinct from traditional sports bettings sites in a way that we approach sports betting as peer-to-peer trading instead of gambling.  UBET is Peer2Pool model where each bet is between a bettor and a group of liquidity providers. Anyone can become a bettor and a liquidity provider on UBET! The betting odds are determined by our own automated market maker. By having automated market makers, we eliminate centralized market makers and you do not have to worry about liquidity.   UBET'S MISSION!! Our objectiveis to enhance the existing classic sports betting business into a modern, cutting-edge,  and worldwide scalable model from both business and technology innovation perspectives. We view sports betting as another type of financial instrument that can be traded just like other derivatives.  We envision sports betting to be fairly traded over the marketplace, digitized using smart contracts, and stored in a public ledger.  GOALS!!  At UBet, we envision a future where sports fans have better access to betting services. An open sports betting system that is secure and transparent to users. Bettors can wager on their favorite sports with peace of mind without the need to worry about issues peculiar to traditional sportsbooks such as,>Banning>Bet limits>Poor Odds / Prices>Poor Product Experience, especially when live betting>Slow payout process>Bad customer service WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS!! 1. Gambling operators are the boss. which often attach manipulations. 2. Gambling operators are often time-consuming.  3. Bettors need to open accounts giving away their personal details, like banking information, social insurance, etc. 4. The absence of any tangible way to audit the historical gaming data questions the legitimacy and fairness of centralized casinos. 5. Withdraws entail waiting for a series of formalities. Bettors may be asked for additional documents.6. Frequently, bettors cannot get their money out when they win big.  THE SOLUTIONS!!  1. With UBET, there are no central authorities or third-party intermediaries. 2.
