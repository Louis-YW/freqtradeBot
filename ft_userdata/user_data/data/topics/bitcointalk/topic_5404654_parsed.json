So I temporarily stop this 2 days because my record is not that good, (maybe 3 out 10)So I have stir up, but the game is there, excitement, thrash talking. But the again, NBA is really very different.Dream vs Lynx - won't even predict, as this is going to be very tough game.",

People want to see greatness. On some level, it makes them feel great. Watching WNBA is more like watching unmotivated employees show up to a 9 to 5 job than it is something likely to garner mainstream attention. There isn't much excitement or urgency people can relate to. Which could be the norm as far as woman's sports go.Even female boxing lacked good paydays until the Paul brothers began promoting Amanda Serrano. Before that happened, female boxers like Claressa Shields were transitioning to MMA due to the pay being better.",

Her agent might be good to keep track on what they will do next to up her market. I watch WNBA just to be updated with stars but not with the whole roster unlike the NBA. They badly need something that will pump their market up. It's been too long already and I still don't see any change. The worst thing is girls today which should've been supportive to them might be doing something else due to the pandemic (i.e. phones and computers) instead of liking the sport.",

Yes that's one of the most common reason why the league is still struggling two decades after it was created. Talent or skills may be there as btc_angela said but I share other people's observation that it seems women are more interested in men's sports. Maybe the \"Karen\" supporters of WNBA demanding support from men in social media doesn't help either hehehe.Quote from: YuginKadoya on July 28, 2022, 03:28:45 PM.....That is very sad, I really think they need to consider when I watched the WNBA, it is likely not like the regular NBA but there are certain talents that you can not miss by watching themUnfortunate as it may seem but that's the reality.

Sports athletes' event is a good place to look for your preference. Maybe WNBA will mandatorily require athletes to be sexy and beautiful to have  more support for both men and women.In my opinion, there are different types of women with different likes and I think the adoration of a woman and another woman is not just intimacy, you can also say that some adoration because she likes how she plays and wants to play just like her, just like Jayson Tatum to Kobe Bryant, Tatum wants the mindset of Kobe and adoring him and one be like him when he plays ball, I really think WNBA doesn't need sexy and beautiful players but if there will be beautiful players that are a bonus, but just like in the NBA talent and greatness in playing basketball is what they are needing, Here are my picks for the WNBA 2022 tomorrow games Indiana Fever VS Las Vegas Aces Stake odds for this game are 7.20 for the Fever while 1.06 for the Aces, for now, there are no injuries for any teams, and Las Vegas Aces have the upper hand with the odds if they are the favorite to win, and the last game for this team it was Las Vegas Aces wins with the score of 90 - 77 a pretty much high Advantage for the Aces, and I think A'ja Wilson from the Aces will score more than 20 plus points again, While Jackie Young is on support, so my pick will be Las Vegas Aces but due to the number of odds for the Aces, Chicago Sky VS New York Liberty Stake odds for this game are 1.16 for Sky while 4.50 for Liberty, Right now for New York Liberty Betnijah Laney is said to be the only injured player, and she underwent arthroscopic surgery, On July 24, Liberty won a game against Chicago Sky with 83 - 80 Score, but for now, I think Chicago Sky will take their revenge in this game for me Chicago Sky could win this game, so Chicago Sky is my pick,",
