      "body": "I do not think this is that simple. It is true that you can ban mining in a state due to environmental legislation, but these farms pay taxes, take loans, and consume paid energy. All of these are advantages that you may find in another state. Even environmental legislation is not universal, and if Bitcoin mining were banned in the United States, the miners would move elsewhere. That state will lose part of the taxes.What motivates people to do this is profit, and as long as Bitcoin mining is profitable, it will continue despite legislation, and we have oil companies. They harm the environment and are pursued by the media, yet they continue because they are making profits.Speculators focus on the harms of Bitcoin mining because it contributes to influencing the price.",

Energy consumption may be large but it is also part of the state's energy income that is charged to mining.if they want to change the energy they use, then what does this have to do with Bitcoin mining? if they talk about the pollution that is occurring, then more large industries will develop there.I don't think this is a problem of pollution or excessive energy use. This is related to the face of politics and also the imposition of taxes where there may be some parties who are dissatisfied. Maybe their direction will lead to regulation.",

Easy math I guess!I don't think \"unsecured\" is the right word — just the fact that Bitcoin can be more susceptible to centralization-related attacks; but not necessarily unsecure. Like, even if Bitcoin mining hashrate cuts down to 1/4th of the current hashrate, Bitcoin would still be hella secure(though significantly less).",

Bitcoin is built on trust, so it automatically comes out on top. Even if they promote their own centralized currencies like RealUSD or PCCYuan, neither country can trust the other's currency more than they trust Bitcoin. Plus, the world is moving towards super-sized corporations with as much power as governments, all competing with each other. Despite some short-term deals and partnerships, they're all ultimately trying to outdo each other for profit. While Facebook might want everyone to use FacebookCoin, rival companies won't trust something that can be easily controlled by a competitor. Bitcoin gains trust from people naturally.",

But because of the disdain the government has for bitcoin, its contribution to pollution is exaggerated. This negative campaign against bitcoin mining is to paint it as the villain thereby discouraging people from investing in the sector. Most of the research funded by the government to investigate the extent bitcoin mining contributes to the environment is predesigned to indict Bitcoin. However, there has been increase in bias-free researches that has proved that bitcoin doesn't consume as much electricity nor affect the environment as it is was generally believed. Some of them include Research: Bitcoin Consumes Less Than Half The Energy Of The Banking Or Gold IndustriesBitcoin mining isn’t nearly as bad for the environment as it used to be, new data showsBitcoin Good for the Environment As Sustainable Energy Count Rises to 52.6%",
