I believe the power to choose which project to invest in will be given to the people. The warning from the government will be ' do not invest in unregulated projects '. I really don't understand your question, bitcoin has been in the space for many years and authorities have been trying to regulate it. Haven't you heard of exchanges requiring their customers to follow mandated KYC for AML purposes? That alone came from the directive of world governing bodies. And it has been discussed every year in G summit. So Satoshi Nakamato being anonymous doesn't affect bitcoin per se if this is what you are trying to come up.",

If thats the case then stay with bitcoin. Cause no matter what government do they cant interrupt bitcoin since its decentralized and no one can intervene. Of course thats Satoshi's goal from the start. So no matter what they do and say they cant stop bitcoin since its a system made for everybody. They can apprehend other project since they are known but not btc.",

You have exchange site that has become gateway for money to go in or out from the crypto market. The regulators are having better consideration rather than you. They are eyeing the gateway of money to enter into the crypto. Quote from: CryptoATM on June 10, 2022, 06:31:34 AMhe (Nakamoto) saw this coming all along so what's going to happen?

The launch of new tokens can be fully regulated. All of centralized and decentralized platforms can comply with the regulation if it will be forced by the regulators. DEX and CEX are still being created by human. The regulators just need to forced human behind these platforms to make it happen.",

I believe the power to choose which project to invest in will be given to the people. The warning from the government will be ' do not invest in unregulated projects '.  That power is already on the people, nothing more to do here.The government's words are not the basis here. Once there starts a regulation-unregulation division, the unregulated projects will go underground and still run rampantly taking money from people just like they used to pre-regulation in far future. At such times, the effect of scams will therefore be much more and also those giving huge profits.So even if the projects get regulated the \"Wild West\" sort of projects will still remains - because humans love to take risks and this is a prime example.If one wants to make money, they should just be in bitcoin, why even go into the realms of scams and shitcoins?",

Bitcoin is an entity which is separate from Satoshi in a similar way how if a person creates a company the company is an entity which is separate from the owner, and even if you were to sue the company you cannot touch the assets of the owner due to their independence from each other, now while the extent of the regulations that can be applied to bitcoin is limited due to its decentralized nature, regulating bitcoin is difficult but not outright impossible as we have seen many governments establishing regulations against bitcoin for years.",

They can't regulate the bitcoin blockchain network indeed but they can regulate the FIAT gates (exchanges) and that would effectively regulate bitcoin because almost everybody trade bitcoins against the dollar or dollar based stable coins. Since those coins are centralized, once they regulate the other side of the trades, bitcoin gets regulated automatically.If you think you can purchase stuff without the services provided by the exchanges, then the government will regulate the merchants.

I believe the power to choose which project to invest in will be given to the people. The warning from the government will be ' do not invest in unregulated projects '. Well as far as i know the main reason why Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin was to create a way of payment that is not controlled by countries or by federal banks. The promise and the goal of bitcoin was that everyone should be able to send payments anywhere or to receive payments from anywhere and that this can not be blocked or controlled by the authorities first before the payment goes through.There are always rumors coming up about impending regulations for crypto currencies and what this might mean for the crypto market as a whole. Most of the time the news of such regulations have caused a drop in the prices of crypto currencies because people are stillt htinking that regulations would be a bad thing. I think we will see some form of regulation sooner or later.",

Bitcoin has been regulated for a long time by most countries, legislation and tax regulations are in place, licenses for exchanges are being introduced, exchanges are introducing KYC, and the SEC is keeping a close eye on big companies that invest in bitcoin. So I wouldn't say bitcoin is unregulated, it is one of the regulated projects in the crypto industry.",

The government can't modify the blockchain transaction or stop the Bitcoin network.  Even with Satoshi missing,  the Bitcoin economy continues to bloom.  The only action the government can take is to implement KYC in the centralized institution that deals with cryptocurrency.  Quote from: CryptoATM on June 10, 2022, 06:31:34 AMI believe the power to choose which project to invest in will be given to the people. It is actually the current status in terms of investment.  We are the ones who chose where to invest, how much we are going to invest, and when we are going to invest.  It does not need to be given because we already have it.Quote from: CryptoATM on June 10, 2022, 06:31:34 AMThe warning from the government will be ' do not invest in unregulated projects '. It is normal for the government to issue a warning against unregulated projects because many scams are done by this kind of project.  Aside from that, unregulated projects are kinda careless with their decisions that cause millions to billions of dollars lost to their investors.  You can see the recent event in LUNA as an example.",

It's totally different for bitcoin. It was all about the decentralization that it has given to everyone but these days, it's important to know the people behind new projects because they are possible to run away. BTC has proven its worth and it has started all of this decentralization and anonymity. Whilst the new projects, even it is portraying anonymity, it's hard to put trust in it especially when most of the projects today are prone to rug pulling. Unless, these projects even with anonymous team are proving themselves but it's hard to see such projects these days.",

I disagree with you, when theres outside regulation to the crypto currency world; then there is nothing like 'power to the people' instead, you hand over power back to the government to determine and decide for you what and when you can use your own crypto assets. The blockchain should remained decentralized with DAO embraced to give power back to the people",
