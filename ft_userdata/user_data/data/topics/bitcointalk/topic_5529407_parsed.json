      "body": "firstly the normal blockreward is sufficient to cover miners for a few cycles(halving periods) before fee's become meaningful(say 2040+)so no real need of a fee war to force people to pay more right now to feed the minershowever by the time we hit year 2100 the normal blockreward would be so small, no one would care because fee's will be the significant portion by then anywaysno one will even think or discuss the blockreward in 2140 as all discussion way before then would be about feesalso by then (reminder we are talking about 75 years from now) the bitcoin blockchain and basically all electronic tech would have evolved to allow more data per 10min to not be limited to just a few mb per 10min(we already can surpass 4mb safely right now if dev-politics was not in the way(hint: not a technical barrier, just a dev-political barrier))so its not going to be a situation in 75 year of only ~3000tx per block having to pay $1000 worth of sats per tx to cover a $3m block cost, but instead we would and should have scaled the space for many many many more transactions per block by then, so each transaction pays very little per transaction to still be a popular value transfer networkremember just 25 years ago kodak was arguing 1megabyte flashmemory was going to be too expensive to be consumer practical.. now we have terrabyte+ flash memory",

What if everone just mining and nobody make transactions?If no one spent money there would be no purpose for money!Quote from: Naruto111 on February 07, 2025, 05:15:29 PMThe whole point of bitcoin is that it has no fees if you use professional mode wont that defeat the purpose of not having a central computer? It's still decentralized, as anyone can become one of these nodes, just not every single user. The developers actually stripped out the ability to easily turn on mining from the base wallet software back in 2011: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5353.0And with the dominance of asics (special type of chip that mines faster than cpu's or gpu's found in typical computer's) there is no point in attempting to mine unless you buy specialized hardware.There's some intresting stuffs about fees eventually getting too small to incentivise miners: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_CommonsIt seems there is a link between fees and security of the system, which may be impact the fees level.Quote from: Naruto111 on February 07, 2025, 05:15:29 PMAnd after 2140 there will be no reward to maintain the network then why would anyone bother doing it? Would the people investing money into these servers not just quit right away causing the whole system to collapse and the value of money be completely lost?Senders already must include fees to get a transaction added to the ledger quickly. These fees go to the miners/maintainers. The amount of those fees is function of supply and demand between people creating transaction and miners/maintainers. Those fees will be the sole incentive after new money stops being created, which will be reduced gradually over time not suddenly.",

With transactions, transaction fees and Bitcoin block subsidy, Bitcoin miners that have weak fund for their mining business have to shut down their ASICs and capitulate from Bitcoin network when mining is not profitable.When Bitcoin network has no transactions, that means there will be no new block found in my opinion, because return to time when there were only Bitcoin block subsidy and no other transactions like years ago, is very impossible IMO.Bitcoin hash ribbon indicator and capitulation.https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/hash-ribbons/",

Would the people investing money into these servers not just quit right away causing the whole system to collapse and the value of money be completely lost?Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency and its market cap is similar to market cap of top companies. There is no way for such a popular thing to not experience transactions on chain but even if we imagine the scenario when nobody makes a transaction, then I can confidently tell you that there will be nobody to mine. It's impossible for everybody to mine and nobody to make transactions because both of these scenarios are the opposite of each events. If nobody makes transaction, then why will somebody mine something that's dead? And if everybody mines, then it automatically means that many people make transactions.The whole point of Bitcoin is not 0 fee, if it was, then there wouldn't be a fee system. After 2140 there will be no reward but Bitcoin will be so popular at that time that there will be millions of transactions every day and that will be enough to motivate miners to keep their mining rigs turned on.",

Bitcoin decentralization is simultaneously decentralization of coin mining, decentralization of development and decentralization of coin ownership. It follows that globally, all three of these groups of people have common interests. If we assume that the further development of the first cryptocurrency will lead to the fact that it will be unprofitable for miners to maintain the security of the network, then I have no doubt that developers will come to the rescue. A hardfork will be made that will change the economy of the cryptocurrency so that all three management groups have the motivation to continue using the Bitcoin network. We cannot look into the future a hundred years. Therefore, we cannot say exactly what changes will be made to the Bitcoin code. However, I have no doubt that everything will be fine with Bitcoin.",
