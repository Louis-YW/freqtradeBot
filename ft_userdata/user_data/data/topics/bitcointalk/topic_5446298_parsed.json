Because each project has its own tokenomics. It's also all about the use-cases they offer and the enthusiasm from the crypto public. Even though the percentage in circulation is only 1%, but the token use-case doesn't exist or there's no enthusiasm from the crypto public. Everything will be bullshit.Quote from: StormHawk on March 25, 2023, 05:34:57 PMIt is fine to avoid a project that has low circulating supply? The less supply that's in circulation when investing, the more promising the investment will be. So, the answer is \"FINE\".",

I don't have any problem with max supply as long the team doesn't temper with it and the contract, if it remain fix, the token will perform well regardless of what tokens are in circulation, the only place I think circulation supply usually have problem is when there is concentration of tokens to a group of whales who can damage the price and control the price, when this happen, they can go far by manipulating the Dao and everything will always be in their favour. Do you know that a coin can be healthy when the total supply is unlock and even distributedm by that I mean distributed in decentralized way in the sense that coins are not congested in a particular wallet.",

Might see new projects get pumped and move fast due to its hype but after that, the drastic drop is also about to witness. Those projects that have no use case will never go far in the long run instead, they will just die. When looking for a project to invest in, we'd rather choose those projects that have a low cap as they have a huge chance to grow in the future compared to those projects that have a huge circulating supply. But of course, it also matters on the project developers and their role in the market because as admitted that not all are worth to invest either. Research is a vital thing to do, otherwise.",

Not certainly familiar thoroughly on tokenomics but if circulating supply is low and the market cap is already high I think that's not the way to pick it. I bookmark a thread on Twitter that goes through about the knowledge on tokenomics and I'm still learning about it. If it has potential to be used by the masses I think that's fine.",

Obviously is one of the basic tenant of economics, law of supply and demand.So yeah, if there is like billions of supply of some certain coin, then it's hard for the price to go up because there are a lot of them in the market. So vice-versa, low cap projects could potentially flew in price if there investors who are going to flock on it because of the low making the price shoot up.In any case it's one of the factor, but obviously there are other reasons for the project to be successful.",

Some good projects have a low supply and yet they are doing great in terms of their value, so this will depend on the project itself and don’t just based your investment decision by just looking at their total supply, try to consider other indicator as well before you invest. Personally, I prefer those good projects will a low supply volume because they are more expensive especially if there’s a lot of supporter and investor for that project.",

Low supply, and a good project most likely will appreciate in value while having a huge supply yet the project is not that good can be a big issue. Investors are looking for the fundamentals of the project as well, if they saw good usage then they will surely buy. For me, I prefer those who have a small supply but offers a great service and technology, they usually enter the top spot.",

Circulating supply matters because it affects the price of the token or coins.  We all know that price is dependent on supply and demand so whenever one of these factors changes the price of token will move accordingly.  More supply means the market is saturated and the price will be reduced, while more demand means the price will increase because people are buying.  So the circulating supply does matters because it is the indicator whether the price of the token will have the possibility of surging or not.",

But price compared to it matters a lot as that defines the marketcap. Number itself (of circulating supply) can be anything, big of small, that doesn't matter. There can be even ton of digits after it, it doesn't matter either.But calculating marketcap via circulating supply can be misleading if you don't know the token issuance rate and max supply. Because issuance rate could flood the market with too much tokens for market makers to handle. That would mean inflation and total crash.Fundamentals (as token use cases) is whole another subject.",

A supply that actually makes sense with the use case that the project wants to present. I certainly don't see any advantage to investing in a project that has a seemingly infinite number of coins at its release with no plans to balance it out according to their project plans. A big token supply can actually be understandable if the mechanics for it being burned (or something similar) is rather big as well, it's just like any regular good project, just scaled up in terms of token numbers.",
