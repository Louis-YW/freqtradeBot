  "content": "Hello everyone.User \"Kostelooscoin\" made a post claiming he was the owner of demoscript.online website.Im writing this post to say that's untrue (he will scam you if you send him your money) and also to explain why I am (the real owner of that website) working on it.Firstly. The casino you can see on the demo website was made using a free version (some call it leaked but it's actually a free version published by Isaac Kohen) of Win5x casino.I've been fixing and upgrading the free version since August 2022 and at one point I even started selling it for dirt cheap to motivate myself to keep going and to be able to pay others to help me a bit.I've fixed over 70 bugs and added over 10 new features  so far.I have also designed a new frontend for the script (https://i.imgur.com/O6eEolf.jpg) that should be ready in a month or so.My plan is to fix all the bugs the free version has and for that to happen I need your help.Please check the demo website and reply with all the bugs you find. Also add any features you'd like to see on a crypto casino.  Why I'm doing all this: I dislike phoenix gambling, simple as that. They sell bugged garbage for $2000 and I think people deserve something better even if it means underselling my own work.BTW If you think my work is worth more you're always free to tip me  Why I'm selling something that has bugs in it:I give all updates for free so everyone who bought anything from me will have the finished product sooner or later",

Alternatively, you can upload a custom text file to your hosting server and share the link with others.By the way, I couldn't find the discussion you mentioned where he claims to own the website.",
