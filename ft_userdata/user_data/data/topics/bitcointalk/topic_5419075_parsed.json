  "content": "This is an emotional touching story of a friend who is having some hard and difficult situation feeding for himself. After longtime of searching for paid job with no success he saw a job that will pay him in commission. This means you will have to depend for money with your success in the work daily, weekly or month depend on the agreement. This friend that got a job is now having more hard times to go out looking for customers to buy the product of the company that he is working for because it is a marketing company. He is depending on me for some support like to go to work, sorting him for transporting himself and sometimes feeding and I help to do this for him (a friend that is down today can be up tomorrow and may help you also in future, they say future is pregnant. Help a friend in need). I do this with him sometimes with happiness and good face. I encourage him that soon he is going to make big sales with big profit to cover all the time he is not having profit.This taking me to the benefit of both kind of jobs and the negative side. Just few that I will cover                  Benefit of commission job1. Possiblity of high profit: This is very possible like I encourage to my friend. You can be lucky to have a customer making good demand of the product in high quantity plus good profit margin per unit of your product and you be surprised to cover more profit for that month against colleagues who chose to base on salary.2. You have time for yourself: Commission job give you free time to go out, visit friends, go party and not to live a life to get monitoring by neighbours. It is not a 8am-5pm job. You decide the weekend time to yourself and how to do about the Saturday or Sunday.3. No harsh talk or shout from boss: There you have your Independence and to report to company , no daily problem of not performing to company.4. You can do more jobs: Yes the time you have, a wise employee can do more jobs or another business.5. Good for high rank staff: If you are lucky to get to high rant in the organization, you have lesser challenges to meet up with sales. You have more network of customers to help meet your target.                   Negative of commission job1. Low sales or no sales at all: Like my friend as example. Sometimes this is challenging for that kind of job. If you are selling or dealing in season products or service, just know you will face this from season to season.2. No productive time: If you are not wise, creative and with good energy you won't make use of the free time advantage. You will lazy around, weak and only focus on one job. If you are not smart this type of job is not for you.3. You assume a self made boss: This is because you are having to control yourself, you can lose control and have ego that it will pull you down when not control.4. A new member: If you are a new staff you can face financial challenges like example to my friend is.              Benefit of salary based job1. Salary expectation at the end of month: This is the reason and advantage why workers like this type of job. They know the ending of the month will put cash to the pocket.2. Relax mind and no target attached: This type is not always target oriented. Some may attach target but normal office job is to do your part and expecting to be paid at the end of the month.             Negative of salary based job1. Laziness: This kind of job make for lazy workers and they play tricks and do little or no job and expect payment during the month end. This is why organisations put cameras now, at least apart from security to also know how employees perform.2. No creativity: Such workers are not bother of innovation, diversify or do better or have their own business.3. No personal time: You are limited, your time is occupied with work most times.The salary base job having more negative effect than benefit. Benefit is more of salary expectation during the month end.What do you think of it ?",

But just like what the OP said, you can't control your time which is you have to work 8 hours a week depending if you have rest day.But just like what the above said, it all depends to each individual but the more you have master a skills the more you will earn a profit from your commission based income. Plus you have a full control of your time and no bosses who calls you more often to be there in the office even if you are off to work.For me, I'll choose commission based but I have to master a certain skills first or a career for commission based salary.",

      "body": "Having a fixed salary job can be of the biggest disadvantage to someone considering that with inflation, your salary can become less than sufficient for your basic needs in a short time, and since a salary job also means that the salary you are paid at the end of the month is also considered a consolation for the time spent in working for their benefits, you time is consumed. A commission-based job puts value more on your job and pays you better for the time spent, and also give you time to find other interest and engage in self-development/growth. In a couple of years if you do a commission-based job you can on your own observe the level of growth and how developed you have become in that particular field but a salary job can keep you stale.I would personally choose a commission-based job but also will not criticize those that choose the fixed salary jobs because truthfully the rigours associated with commission-based jobs cannot be handled by everyone.",

But commission job has opportunity of being able to earn more if you put additional effort unlike salary payment that will be eaten up by inflation.",

If you mismanage your funds during the time that you are making good cash on a commissioned job,you will end up regretting. A salary based job will benefit his reward after retirement.He is a tailor sometimes he comes home three hours from the time he went to work, when I ask him what happened you came home early,he will say just made one shirt only,because he doesn't feel like working anymore that is why he came home. I will ask him what about your boss,he told me that she will pay him based on how many shirts he makes.",

Although it can vary massively between different professions and some people can have a natural talent for commission based work as you describe, often however companies will take advantage of people by underpaying with the promise of earning commission but with very difficult sales targets. Commission based work in some sectors can often lead to sellers exaggerating benefits, manipulation or twisting the truth in order to sell products and services - thereby deceiving the customer but benefiting the worker. Those who are unwilling to bend the truth will often find the base salary in this commission based job too hard to live on.",

It is like, you are being paid as long as you can outperform and be at the top of the food chain. The only problem is, you have to be consistency at your work. While the pay may be higher compared to salary-based jobs, the latter is still more stable and secured in terms of receiving monthly wages.At the end of the day, it all boils down to preference and opportunity. If you think that you are someone who prefers to control your own destiny, then a commission-based job may be better suit for you. But if you are someone who prefers to be secured, then a salary-based job may be the right choice.",

The job is too important for him to be paid nothing on a slow day. I know a case where firefighters were paid per hour of putting out a fire, so they were setting the nearby woods and abandoned buildings on fire.
