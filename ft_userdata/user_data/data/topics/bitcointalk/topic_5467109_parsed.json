If Anyone of you know about this please do lemme know Many Thanks Kind RegardsSnowpega  If you delete the post, then your merits will not reduce, but I prefer you not to delete any posts, as I can see you have made not that many posts and the ones on which you got merits are also very low, so it's better not to delete posts. Deleting the post can cause trouble in finding the real source when someone tries to find that on which post you received the merits. Other than that, I don't think there will be any problem for you, but it's totally up to you to either delete it or not. The merits that you have received will remain forever in your account, which means they will show the same forever, but of course the number of merits will be gone once you send them to anyone.",

If Anyone of you know about this please do lemme know Many Thanks Just like most of the above said, Your merit count won’t be affected but take note that the description on your merit history will be (Deleted Post/Topic) which is not good to see in history since you usually get merit due to good post while deleting it will make the essence of merit waste.Activity count is the one that can be affected once you delete a post that attached to your activity post. So be cautious on deleting post if you don’t want to rank down/decrease activity count.",

So be cautious on deleting post if you don’t want to rank down/decrease activity count.Yes but if the user has got enough posts that can help him increase in activities after two weeks then it will not matter, so it depends on how many posts are deleted and the posts number of the user. However, op has asked a good question that will help other newbies who probably are thinking about that and have not made attempt to ask. So to Op, I don't think anything reduces the amount of merit you already have, even if the particular posts bearing that merit was deleted .",

Good that the merits will not be lost with the deleted post. But another question is why you will want to delete a post that has earned merit? because a post that has earned merit must have made sense to be merited especially when it was merited more than once, and also a moderator will not delete such a post?",

A Merit is an irreversible action so I think even if your post is deleted of which you were merited no really happens to the merit.",
