As I mentioned above: By using water cooling, the temperature will drop significantly which also has a positive influence on the power consumption of the hashboard.Make sure that you choose the right kit if you are going to buy a kit. There are a few differences between the S19 models.",

I guess they might be loud too?There will be some noise ofc. But its nothing compared to air-cooled systems. Some kits are designed to operate as silent as possible. They also come with a fan speed controller which can be used to control the speed and so on. However, you should be careful if you don't know what you are doing - dont lose sight of the temperatures of the hasboards.",
