  "content": "Digital Currency and Cryptocurrency It may seem that digital currency means cryptocurrency. Recently I saw in the news that my country is going to bring digital currency which can be used everywhere in our country. Seeing this, at first, I thought maybe cryptocurrency will be legalized. But later I saw that there are some differences. The following is a brief description of this-Digital currencyDigital currency refers to a currency that is connected to the Internet, meaning, more simply, any currency that can be transferred to a computer or mobile via the Internet. For example- we use debit card / credit card, ATM booths.That is, the digital currency has both physical and digital aspects.CryptocurrencyCrypto money is invisible, and adding currency to it is cryptocurrency. In other words, invisible economic management is called cryptocurrency. Simply put, it is a currency that has no physical condition. It resides in a blockchain database system. Such as Bitcoin, BNB, Etherium, etc. I don't think there is much to be said about cryptocurrency here because everyone who is there knows about cryptocurrency.From here, I have made this post as clear as I canHopefully, the issue is getting clearer for many.||*Please excuse my mistakes and feedback, advice, and suggestions are always welcome to me.*||",

This is just a payment method. You can use many different currencies using a debit/credit card, you can even buy things with one currency and pay with another one using a debit/credit card.Second, there are cryptocurrencies that do no use blockchain technology. For example, XRP and IOTA.",

Fiat that is controlled totally by the government can be a digital currency, like the fiat transferred electronically while using credit cards or from bank to bank through e-transact while using bank app. Also CBDCs are new fiat that are also digital currencies. Not all digital currencies are cryptocurrencies.",

      "body": "Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. The thing is that there are different kinds of digital currencies, the one your country is planning on launching is a centralized digital currency (or CBDC), meaning it is controlled by your government and issued by them, they are somewhat similar to centralized digital crypto like XRP, the only difference is that CBDC's are issued by central banks. Bitcoin is also a digital currency, but a decentralized one, thus they more or less mean the same thing as they are both digital currencies, but of different kinds. Digital currency is just like the general name for both of them (crypto and CBDC's), see the excerpt below:QuoteDigital currency (digital money, electronic money or electronic currency) is any currency, money, or money-like asset that is primarily managed, stored or exchanged on digital computer systems, especially over the internet. Types of digital currencies include cryptocurrency, virtual currency and central bank digital currency.",

      "body": "I'm quoting something from wikipedia to get a lot of comparisons about what digital currency is. Here's the quote: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currencyQuoteDigital currency (digital money, electronic money or electronic currency) is any currency, money, or money-like asset that is primarily managed, stored or exchanged on digital computer systems, especially over the internet. Types of digital currencies include cryptocurrency, virtual currency and central bank digital currency. Digital currency may be recorded on a distributed database on the internet, a centralized electronic computer database owned by a company or bank, within digital files or even on a stored-value card.Digital currencies exhibit properties similar to traditional currencies, but generally do not have a physical form, unlike currencies with printed banknotes or minted coins. This lack of physical form allows nearly instantaneous transactions over the internet and removes the cost associated with distributing notes and coins. Usually not issued by a governmental body, virtual currencies are not considered a legal tender and they enable ownership transfer across governmental borders.This type of currency may be used to buy physical goods and services, but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game.Digital money can either be centralized, where there is a central point of control over the money supply (for instance, a bank), or decentralized, where the control over the money supply is predetermined or agreed upon democratically.There is an important point from the explanation of the quote above where digital currencies also include cryptocurrencies. This means that any currency that is connected to the internet and is transacted electronically is called a digital currency. Cryptocurrencies are different digital currencies in that they are built on a blockchain [though not all]. Some of them have developed decentralized nature like bitcoin, but most of them are centralized. Correct me if wrong.",

Cryptocurrency is backed by blockchain technology whilst digital currency is not.People use another term, virtual currency too. It is commonly used by governments when they want to compromise the misleading term in order to prevent as many citizens in their nations to learn about and get access to cryptocurrency.Because people naturally want to have something real, not virtual. They feel safer with real things, not virtual ones.Sum up: Cryptocurrency is bigger than digital currency.",

      "body": "The infographic below briefly describes the main differences between digital currency and cryptocurrency, comparing them with each other against certain criteria. I would also add that digital currency is always a form of fiat money that is controlled by governments. It requires a centralized clearing house to function because it is not possible to prevent double-spend in digital currency without authorities who see and control all transactions. Cryptocurrency is not necessarily a store of value because, for that, it should have a robust monetary policy and decentralization, which most cryptocurrencies don't have. It is also worth pointing out that bitcoin doesn't use encryption.The value of digital currencies is very far from being considered stable because an uncontrolled printing and questionable regulation on the part of central banks makes these currencies subject to gradual debasement. The value of cryptocurrencies is dictated mostly by a free market, namely the laws of supply and demand, which naturally results in unexpected price fluctuations.",

So currency that enables you make payments or purchase something without presenting a physical cash is a digital currency.
