I think what you have presented is what OP is really looking for here because I already see the headings to be blue as described by OP and the content very reach in knowledge on Bitcoin. OP can also look into this thread by Ratimov as well.  it is very rich in all information about Bitcoin and other related services as well when it comes to Bitcoin too.

I believe the page itself had a blue background and did a great job explaining the blockchain/bitcoin, and I would love help finding it. I've already used the search function, but it came up empty.Sometimes it is hard to find topics when you need them in the future, I also have to mention many topics in my post that I am currently writing on, and what I do, might come in handy for you too. I simply try to remember the keyword I might have used in that post or try to remember the topic name. And in your case buddy, you are aware of the topic name. So, all you have to do is, simply go to Ninjastic.spaceInput your username and in the post content section insert the keywords and then you will find the topic regarding that specific keywords but if you have entered your username then only those topics or replies will pop up on which you have commented and if you will ignore the username section then you will see all the post in which that keyword has been used. you should check that website out and insert your keyword as dummies or bitcoin dummies etc. Whatever you remember out of that post.",

But if still he finds some errors than, then he should go for Ninjastic because, with the help of it, Op can easily find the topic or reply he is looking for. I was going to share the procedure but I realized that the last member already shared the procedure. All it lack was some photos so I am going to include them. You can see, that the research shows 0 topics but you should check individually like first with BTC for dummies then Blockchain for Dummies and by writing Blockchain for Dummies I found the exact topic but there is no comment on that and that topic is already been shared by the decodx You should use ninjastic tools because it will make you more used to it and then you can easily find any topic you are seeking.",
