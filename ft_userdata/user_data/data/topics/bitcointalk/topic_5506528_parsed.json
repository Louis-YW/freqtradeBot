      "body": "I'm not sure \"largest crypto market\" can be quantified in just one way..though I guess if you're just wanting to look at it from a trading volume,..but that perhaps is short sided ?   I dunno tho..asking while thinking out loud.Who would be the other 3?  The US of course.  I feel like Amsterdam/Netherlands has to be up there just in terms of % of citizens who own bitcoin..Australia, Canada, ummm??Turkey is shocking to me, as number 4 trading wise.  Never woulda guessed.",
