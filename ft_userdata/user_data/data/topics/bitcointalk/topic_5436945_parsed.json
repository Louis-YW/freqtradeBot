It should be the IP: port of her node after typing it close it then check the circle on the bottom right corner if it's green or red. If it's red it means it's not connected or there might be a connection problem but if it's green it means it's connected.",

All you need is to ask he for the IP address and port, and after you click on a green icon, use that IP address and port number.Sometimes, after you choose her server, the wallet may choose another server, so after completing the previous step, restart Electrum, Right click on green Icon and select \"Use as Server\"Note that by connecting to its server, she can:Knowing all your addresses, even the new ones you will generate.Show wrong balance or modify your balance.Prevent you from sending, or to a specific address.Things she can't do:Find out your private key or send money instead of you.",

You can obtain your IP address by either going to a website: https://whatismyipaddress.com/ or use Code:curl -s http://wtfismyip.com/textin commandline using curl.If your friend is running Electrs on the server, then the IP address is the same as the server. Electrs's default port is 50001 and you can try connecting it through that.",

Managing full node requires advanced skills because it is mainly intended to enhance privacy/verify every things with your self.If she does not understand what she are doing, any wrong step will lead you to create holes in your privacy.",

How can she optain the server IP?The IP address of her local machine will only allow you to connect to her server if you are on the same local network, in other words plugged into her router or using her wifi.  If you want to connect from outside her local network she'll need the internet IP address from her router, and she needs to enable port forwarding to tell her router where to send queries to the Electrs port (usually 50001.)  Take note, if her internet service provider uses CGNAT, you won't be able to connect to her server from outside her local network unless she has a virtual private network set up, or uses TOR.  TOR is by far the easiest way to get around CGNAT for personal use.To find the server's local network IP address use the following commands:Linux:Code:ip addWindows:Code:ip configTo find the internet IP address the easiest way is to log into the router's configuration page, you'll find it listed there.  Once in the router's configuration page you should be able to set up port forwarding there.Quote from: Husires on January 31, 2023, 07:14:28 PMShe needs to setup a reverse proxyNo, she doesn't.  Not unless she has a VPN running on a cloud server or some complex set up of that sort, but given the questions being asked here I gather that's not the case.  The only reason she would even need such a set up is if she didn't want to use TOR and has a service provider that issues IPs through Carrier Grade Network Access Translation (CGNAT,) such as satellite internet, cable internet, or 5G internet services.If her ISP uses telephone-based land-line connections like ADSL or Fiber, her router will be issued an IP address that's reachable from outside the local network.",
