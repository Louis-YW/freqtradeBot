  "content": "Hey everyone!Hey CS collectors!In the Bitcointalk forum, the Crypto Stamp has a longer tradition by now and we were among the very first collectors quite quickly. We were particularly taken with the first Crypto Stamp, as it was a world first and the Austrian Post was the first major company to combine blockchain technology and NFTs with a physical product.Sure, subsequent Stamps didn't really compare to the first Stamp. We missed the plastic card, the general design and the beautiful holographics. This seems to be changing again now.... with the very first stamp in the CRYPTO STAMP ART range. This series picks up on the success of #cryptoart, which started to boom especially in 2020. In doing so, the very first ART STAMP is based on a historically significant and very valuable stamp... the Vermilion Mercury; a stamp that fetches five to six figure prices and was launched in 1851. Here, ENCODE GRAPHICS had the privilege to take the lead and present a new and contemporary design almost 170 years later. This is just the beginning though, as it is rumored that we will see some well-known Cryptoart artists on future stamps too.The stamp was first launched as a special issue stamp without an NFT twin and looks like this:The NFT edition will come in MYSTERY BOXES and there only will be 2,500 boxes. The price should be around 500 USD per box and contains 4 NFTs.Of course this boxes will let the owner claim physical stamps and it seems there will be the rarest Crypto Stamps in these boxes that have been ever made.This sale takes place on JULY 22 2022 on the platform https://tokapi.com/More info from TOKAPI in this tweet:https://twitter.com/tokapi_official/status/1546527279051849731There will be aTWITTER AMATODAY under the linkyou find below.
