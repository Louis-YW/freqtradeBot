Let's build it together!BTCÂ  Great plan but do we really need another platform intended for this? we already have bitcointalk where anyone can share their own sentiments. discuss anything related to bitcoin and as well anyone can hire here any skilled person what you have mentioned. But eventhough we already have strong community here still proceed on your plan since if many can see that your platform created is good place to stay then maybe many will use it and do their activities just like what they did here in bitcointalk.",
