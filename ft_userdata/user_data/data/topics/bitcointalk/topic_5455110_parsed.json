Would love to be a local reseller.sidehack sure made an awesome little miner and it is amazing that his has persisted all these years.Hoping you all might help me understand the state of things without having to bother him too much as I assume he is very busy.Thanks in advance!",

You're not the only inquiry I've turned away lately, but we do appreciate the interest.Thanks for the kind reply. Our goal wasn't to become a reseller per se, we are building a community of Bitcoiners and wanted everyone that joined to participate in mining to some degree. We are striving to create sufficient demand for these little miners that anything less than wholesale is worthy of consideration for other options. Hope you'll reconsider. We'd just like to buy in bulk on a monthly basis at a fair price with the assurance that you will be able to have a continuous supply available. Thanks for the consideration. Have a nice day!",
