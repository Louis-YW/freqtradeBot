And when your profile is enough to post an image then you can post the image as per below directionStep 1 - visit https://www.talkimg.com Step 2 - click  and  then copy Full BBcode and add your image link on your post where you want to post Image.-If you want to resize your image then use the following code bellow Code:[img width=200]image link[/img]Code:[img width=200 heigth=100]image link[/img]",

Right now if OP (who is a newbie) upload his imagine link to the forum it will still remain as a link except a rank higher than his quote the link to make the image visible. But when you pay which is refer to as purchasing the copper membership, you will be able to upload a visible image and also  have the benefits that a member rank enjoys. Many service providers usually pay for it just to have more freedom to market their services. Here is a link on how pay for Copper membership",

I really have no idea of paying before you could upload pictures/images. It's possible, he can buy a copper membership and able to attach an image even though they don't have any activity. But since @OP already have 4 merits and 9 activity, he can create another 21 posts and will become Jr. Member rank that make him allowed to attach an image, of course not spamming.Quote from: Zaguru12 on July 12, 2023, 05:24:27 AMBut when you pay which is refer to as purchasing the copper membership, you will be able to upload a visible image and also  have the benefits that a member rank enjoys.Copper membership has a similar benefit like member rank, but not same since the BBCode is more limited in copper membership.

Second, you can also remove the restriction by buying a copper membership and you will have a custom title called Copper Member. You can buy copper membership in this link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote.

If you register an account on Imgur, you have access to all your updated images in one folder. You click on any of them, and the site allows you to change the size with one click. There are options such as small/big square and thumbnails of different sizes. After selecting a size, you just need to copy/paste the changed BBcode for it.
