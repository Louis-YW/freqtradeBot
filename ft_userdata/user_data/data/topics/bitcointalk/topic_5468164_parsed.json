After all your time spent in the fight against abuses on the Internet, exposing fake profiles, you without much explanation are looking for some kind of access to someone's personal LinkedIn profile (there are mostly real accounts, very rarely fake ones).Connecting someone from the forum to his LinkedIn will significantly affect his anonymity here.However, I may be wrong, so I leave the possibility of a different scenario.You can send me a PM with approximate details of what it is about. I have an active LN profile on which I am not active every day, but it has been registered for years.Maybe you should have moved this to the Service section",

(moderators can move this thread elsewhere if they feel it is more appropriate)----Thank you to those that had a look at this thread and the request. I have now found an alternative solution therefore this thread is no longer needed. For those that may have a curious disposition, I will add a detailed explanation to this thread within a few days.",
