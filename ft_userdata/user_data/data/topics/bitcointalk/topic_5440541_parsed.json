      "body": "There is no answer to this type of question, we are not Elon, so it is impossible to know what he is thinking and what he will do with the doge. Investing in doge is very risky, if you are looking to invest in it you can, but always be ready to face unexpected risks. For me, doge will not die or disappear even if Elon is no longer supporting it because it already has a community that uses it before Elon talks about it. But its hype will definitely depend on Elon, if he declares to stop supporting it will return to the real value.",

It's only hyped by him and if he's really into this coin, he should have accepted it with various companies that he owns.But did he ever accepted it as per his companies? I don't think so but just like Tesla, he's invested on it and that's why he's making such statements that's making the online community hyped with it.Let's be real, Dogecoin is nowhere to be found near $1. And let's just grow about making such moon statements.",

Well, I hope you are aware of the situation of Dogecoin and Tesla company. Dogecoin is so hot in the past few days and it gains more interest and support especially when Tesla company announced its acceptance but too unfortunate that it never happens. The hyped of Doge is done already, never I see it rallies again just like before and I wasn't sure if Elon Musk could still get support in this.",

Elon is merely a fan of the coin, maybe use it as a currency itself and as you've said, maybe accept it as a form of payment (which I highly doubt, but whatever goes), but by no means is he backing the coin itself. Also, I swear, you gotta expand your circle a bit if \"the majority\" of people you belong to believe Doge would go to $1. You'd probably have better chances gambling or in the lottery or something similar.",

Today another celeb can come in and say that their product is going to involve DOGE and pump its price and then leave the stage while the moonbois are having an orgasm but they find out the market crashed while they were drooling. The truth is that no coin is ever going to be big as bitcoin has been, so if you have not sold when celebs were promoting it you have missed the last chance, now you can just hold and wait for some miracle to happen and bring it back up again.Whether some product of that celeb is going to use DOGE, depends on their choice, but dont bank on that.",

Doge , as far as I know, has no utility which means that its market value will only depend on hype and demand which makes its market price unstable and unpredictable.The market price will only go up if there will be a push into its name just like with influencial personalities such as elon. But other than that, its market price won't be pushed upward. Meme tokens has a high rate of increase especially during bullish trends but problem is tendency to collapse everytime there will be a pump. Unlike with tokens having utility wherein the market price would be sustainable no matter how the market behaves.",

Elon isn't buying dogecoin nor is he backing it. He is mainly trolling the whole crypto community by creating more hype as he wants to be seen a cool and eccentric billionaire.I don't have anything against with doge, and for a long time i had sympathy for it. But if i had to choose between shiba and doge i would go for shiba in a heartbeat.",
