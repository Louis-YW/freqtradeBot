It is important to note that meme coins like Samoyedcoin can be highly speculative and volatile. I have no idea about such coins, especially in terms of trading. But I think Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, Floki, BoneShiba Swap meme coins are potentially reaching high. If you think, you can choose from such coins and proceed.",

By the way this is not a new thing in the Crypto world we can see many things which be happened any time any unknown coin can perform really well. But you should be careful if you are thinking about trading or investing in these kind of coins.Even the recent increases may make you to trade it quickly but it is really important to do a research on the coin and understand why its value go up. Or there can be a trap that they were showing that the value is up now and can go more up. And they tempting the people to invest in it.If you are thinking about trading in this coin so you should make a plan that where you should exit if you invest. Or make a better stop loss which automatically triggered and it will safe you from big loss. It can be a risky trade but if you want to invest so invest that money which can afford if you lost it.",

From its initial launch until now, $SAMO has become the largest meme token for the Solana network. Then, why this token experienced a high increase, IDK the exact reason, but because $SAMO is a meme token, it's very likely that this high increase occurred because of their hype or trend that has returned.Quote from: jerry0 on December 09, 2023, 01:07:04 AMIs this coin worth trading short term?Of course, by taking advantage of the current wave, but never make long-term plans, never!Quote from: jerry0 on December 09, 2023, 01:07:04 AMBut not for holding long term as it probably go to zero pretty much later on?100% Correct .",

If you buy layer one coin(solana) it might be able to add to your portfolio, even though the price is higher but you can buy other coins with the layer one coin. even with the difference in the increase in the other layer coin.",

Nice to know that Samoyedcoin has a vision and that is also towards pets but is there any proof to support their cause? Meme coins are made only to benefit the owner and early investors. I do not think the have a purpose for the real-world scenario otherwise this coin won't be trading so low.

So much so that I always wanted to help dog shelters out there.If you want to help those organizations that are focusing on animals, you don't need to create a new project just to have funds. I have a huge empathy when it comes to animals, but they are just using animals to scam people. It's indirect, but you got the point. If you want to help animal organizations, you don't need to create a new project because you can help them in many ways. I love the vision of the project, but since it's a meme coin, I don't want to touch it.Quote from: jerry0 on December 09, 2023, 01:07:04 AM~I then took a look and this coin has been out for many years already.  The high was about $0.24 and the lowest was $0.001.  Now what exactly made this coin suddenly go up like this recently after being out for few years already?  Is this coin worth trading short term?  But not for holding long term as it probably go to zero pretty much later on?It's a pump-and-dump coin.

People misunderstanding to that 10 wallet are holding more than 50% token who can anytime dump the token price. 3 days ago team officially tweeted that 4 wallet belong to OKX and only 20% tokens are holding by big Whales or team members.QuoteThere is a misunderstanding as it relates to 51% of SAMO sitting in the top 10 wallets.- 4 of those 10 wallets belong to OKX, Kraken, Gate.io and Tulip Protocol.- 2 of those wallets (1B SAMO total) aren't real - check out the address. They were part of a \"burn\" where funds were sent to a non-existent addresses. They can never be accessed.- FTX holdings = Alameda. Like a majority of SPLs who launched in 2021 and 2022, we used Alameda for MM. We too are waiting for claims to be processed and funds returned (which is part of the legal contract we signed).If you account for the above and recalculate the top 10 holders, this 51% number plunges to 20%.If you strip out the SAMO marketing fund, the figure then drops to 12%.Tweet Another reason maybe Solona token performance in the last few days. Whenever any best network perform well then whales look for memecoin of this network which could be possible reason of pump",

And people are the ones who will FOMO on it. It was BTC is the one that creates a bull run, (not Solana) but I know that Solana is being hyped right now. It still has nothing to do with the increase in the market because they are already rising even before.Meme coins are always meme coins, and it doesn't matter if where they come from. So, we shouldn't dare touching them. Don't say that you will only trade it for the short-term because people behind it are wise enough, where you can't even eject at the right time. It will be better if people will just invest on Solana, even if it also had some anomalies because it's too strong to withstand it.",

Perhaps the bigger reason is that many people pay attention to Sol, and it seems that the period still does not have many truly outstanding areas for investors to look for quality things. Many people like the hype and short term search associated with things like this.During the 2021 bull cycle, I also managed to make a big profit with this cryptocurrency, but since then I have never intended to return to holding it to look for some profit goals with it. Anyway, each of us has our own research, and I still just want to express that even if everyone likes risk, balancing risk/return as well as responsibility is important before every decision.",

This coin is a very high risk to trade for short term or long term but if you were agree to losing money in a short time and it's up to you.I would rather than avoid to touch the meme token as this moment caused by the volatility is very hard to control it.

It has a good and loyal community, a creative and diverse NFT collection, and a strong and supportive network of partners and influencers. However, it is also very volatile and risky, as it depends on the trends and sentiments of the crypto market. I would not invest in it for the long term, but I might trade it for the short term if I see a good opportunity. This is just my opinion and not financial advice.
