Many of these inhabitants of the island do not know anything, but some definitely keep these diary sheets, and others have information about the order in which these sheets were placed and can give a tip which of the islanders has a piece of the diary.And so you, an adventurer and treasure hunter, having heard the legend of Captain Gover and learned about his lost treasure, arrive on the island, hoping to try your luck and become a rich man.The goal of each participant is to collect all the information from Captain Gover's diary, decipher it, put it in the right order and finally get the location of the Scratched's treasure. The received place must be sent to sekeersfortreasure@gmail.com. The very first player to do so will receive the final treasure key (assuming the specified location is correct, of course).https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FuaaoOnXgAA-KRD?format=jpg&name=largehttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/FuQhN3aWIAk1jLJ?format=png&name=900x900https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F0lFQPHXgAEzaur?format=png&name=900x900More info:http://treasuregame.quest/https://twitter.com/ExMister_Axehttps://opensea.io/collection/legendary-pirate-treasure",
