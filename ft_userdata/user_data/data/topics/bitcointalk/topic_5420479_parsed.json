  "content": "Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and fighting game in which players own and work as part of the game.The Axie Infinity (AXS) token is an ERC-20 symbol that was sent off on the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, Ethereum's proof-of-work (POW) agreement instrument gets it. Axie Endlessness needs to progress its non-fungible tokens, including Axies, Land, and other in-game thing tokens, from the Loom Organization to Ronin, a particular Ethereum sidechain.In the meantime, AXS price prediction for 2022 is bullish since it can't break the help level. We can anticipate that AXS should reach $25 this year.",

Try to look at the current condition of the project in order for you to see what really happen in this project, not this speculation. Sorry but seeing AXIE making it alive again seems impossible as once the P2E games has been hyped last year, they grow fast but unfortunately, they dump too fast as well. Stop hoping for this project mate. If you are still holding this, better accept the reality that hyped projects won't go far like Bitcoin and ETH, they will turn down once the demand is over.",

Too much decreased its users and the same goes by for its investors. I don't think that we'll see $25 by eoy too easily because it's not enough for it to be looked at at that price. Well, we may see that price but not for this year and it will have hard time to get back on the top.",

It's an extremely amazing endeavour, but if SkyMavis took action the first time, AXS, SLP, and everything Axie-related might still make it to the top and prove that P2E is possible. But nah, they just chose to give out grand promises and that's it.",

The main reason is that we are talking about a game and that means we are talking about something that would be valid as much as the game is valid, and if the game is not played then the token will go down.As we have seen from the moments it started to fall even before any of this crash, it wasn't really loved by all that many people, because the more SLP people earned, the less it was valued and eventually people crashed the price because there wasn't any reason to buy it and breed it. So both SLP and AXS will be gone, breeding is not profitable anymore and it will probably stay that way.",

SLP dumped so hard and this will never recover. People who have been grinding SLP keeps to dumping it even deeper than before. The crash happened with crypto market has been creating very bad impact to the SLP. The revenue received by the company was also decreasing so hard while it's still in debt to reimburse the funds that got hacked by hackers. There are lots of things to do by this company to recover its token from the unhealthy situation. Axie now is not like last year. The hype has gone and this time only small amounts of players remaining compared with last year when this got so much hype",

The most the market would've been involved with was when changes happened to the in-game mechanics such as skills, lands, etc. It was healthy at its initial release imo, but with the sudden influx of a lot of players, everything just went to ruin after that initial hype. It is rather hard imo to manage the economy of the game so that it can last to a stable run though. It's understandable in a sense as to why Axie failed in doing so.",

This company axie doesn't have any future. I have seen the release of new game for land owner. it seems like that was just another BS from axie infinity. The economic condition of company was so bad and the ROI was very long to get. SLP minted got decreased caused by the demand has been dropping so hard from its peak at the middle of 2021. Giving revamp to the game will not help it a lot as the mistake already made since the creation of unlimited token like SLP.

All we have from developers are promises of a future which hasn't come to Axie Infinity. I don't know if it's their own fault by not improving the environment for players in an efficient way or if it's a general crypto market issue, due to the bearish season. The truth is that I'm not optimistic anymore regards this game and it's not solely because the crashed market I'm thinking like this...In my opinion it was a terrible idea to focus only in PVP mode, because most players prefer solo or adventure mode, especially in pay to win games where you can't compete against wealthy players. What Sky Mavis did (removing SLP from adventure mode) discouraged lots of people from playing.",
