This could be the best time to invest in Bitcoin in terms of future profitability, but people simply don't have the money, and the risk of it is magnified because of the recession that we're currently sliding into. This will probably be the biggest recession that a lot of people have seen in their lifetime, and that's going to play a major role in the price of Bitcoin, simply because buying power is down, and generally people's faith is lowered since they have less money. Of course, Bitcoin has a proven track record of recovering from dips, but you can't compare the previous dips to this one, because all the dips before it never had a compounding effect or long term issues like a massive recession. It probably will recover, and a lot of us are probably confident in that, but when is the question. This recession could last years, and while Bitcoin was created on the back of a recession, during a recession it'll probably perform like any other investment, poorly due to the buying power being reduced. So, if the war continues for a couple of years in Ukraine, and the recession from that, and the pandemic lasts a couple of years, we could be seeing low numbers for a while. Obviously, looking at it over a five year period, and Bitcoin's still in the green. However, Bitcoin definitely has a trying period ahead, that will test a lot of investors patience. Plus, due to the recession investors that were previously thinking about holding for a number of years, might be forced to sell since they need the money, due to the recession.",

No Alternative to Bitcoin, Your Alternative is Bitcoin. 2. Why Bitcoin is the most Preferred ChoiceEveryone in this forum already know Bitcoin is really the best crypto to invest especially this forum is full of Bitcoin enthusiast, but it's really important to repeat over and over? You can't force anyone decision to invest what coin or asset they want to invest.",

Great points that bear acknowledgment of real-life considerations the majority of people have to do: food on the table, roof over heads, heater to keep warm. No matter how tempting Bitcoin price is now, it's likely a priority pushed far behind immediate, life-sustaining needs.Only need to look at myself to see how holding plans are held hostage by unforeseen circumstances. I last had a major forced liquidation in 2020 (just as 20k was being breached). Would have loved to hold then but circumstances required selling. That was then, before all this war and inflation and job layoffs. Back home, pawnshops have been seeing upticks in business since Covid. It's getting worse. People pawning gold, they're not buying Bitcoin.",
