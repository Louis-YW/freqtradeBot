I think you understand that to make such decisions, bitcoin must be legalized as a subject of education and recognized by countries. Do you see something similar? We can only hope for the future, but I'm not sure that this can happen shortly. But no one forbids you from teaching and disseminating information about bitcoin among your friends.",

Entrepreneurship and perhaps some sort of skill acquisition and or training programs would be nice. I do not think any government would ever include cryptocurrencies into its school curriculum. That’s something you would have to learn away from the classroom.",

This has been on my mindLet's take it a step at a time. Mass adoption and acceptability should be much more of a major concern now than asking for cryptocurrency to be made a subject in the school curriculum. It will be a tall order anyway, considering what challenges cryptocurrencies are facing at this time. We're faced with rejection here and there, coupled with bans from various governments of the world ATM. It will make more sense if we're looking at cryptocurrency being included as a topic in Economics or Finance rather than as a subject on its own. To kick start this, I think countries with well structured educational system should lead the way on this.",

When it has been well adopted by over 50% of the world's population and government, this kind of view could be raised more often with more appreciation following it.For now, we should be trying our parts by introducing it to our family members, friends, business associates, the companies we work, the school we teach and all that. These are the ways that we could set the fire burning, and with time, who knows? Crypto might surpass your dreams/wishes.",

Much better if they teach this lesson on seniors or maybe in collage since people at this age are maybe focus to learn something new. This should be added since technology and finance is evolving so that new generations will not be illiterate on new evolving industry.",

Bitcoin and blockchain on the other hand is something that could be taught at University level, for example.  But we are far from having any of that on a global scale. Not when we have presidential decrees aiming to change a decentralized and censorship-resistant blockchain into something controlled by selected government agencies. Since that won't work, the next best thing from their perspective is a CBDC and hopefully no attempts to ban that what they cannot control.",

It seems like my country has had some that provide defense at the college level.

The government will add a curriculum to schools if the crypto adoption factor is legal based on regulations, but for countries that prohibit crypto activities it will be difficult to add crypto education to the school curriculum, but every country certainly has a crypto community so crypto education will still be spread even though it has limitations due to conflict with government regulations",
