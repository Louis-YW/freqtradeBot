How can the crypto industry overcome these challenges?Well, it depends on what you're planning to do. Bitcoin isn't the best when it comes to privacy; there are other options for this job, such as Decred, Dash, and Monero. Regarding security now, I'm not too certified to voice an opinion, but quite a few incidents have occurred with wallets being compromised, some of which were supposed to be non-custodial but turned out not to be; see the latest incidents with Atomic or Trust wallets. There are certainly ways to preserve your security, by using non-custodial, air-gapped or hardware wallets. While there's never a guarantee, taking the necessary precautions to prevent a possible compromise",

How can the crypto industry overcome these challenges?There are so many solutions to security and privacy problems. Centralized exchange has made it impossible to stay anonymous while using their exchange because you're obligated to complete their KYC verification or you won't be granted your withdrawal.We have mixers that can be used to increase privacy, if you withdrew from a KYC exchange, you can send the coins directly to mixers then mixed the coins before sending it your wallets. Make sure you make use of wallets that you have your private keys as that increase privacy. KYC is the main challenge when protecting the security and privacy of a user therefore making use of exchanges that don't mandate kyc or completely ignoring centralized exchange and only make use to decentralized exchanges will solve this privacy problem.",

Setup a cold wallet and \"be your own bank\".This is the only way the crypto world could overcome privacy and security problems. Not the so called \"crypto industry\".I assume that by the term \"crypto industry\" you mean all the centralized crypto companies, which are offering crypto fintech services.I couldn't care less about some centralized crypto companies having issues with the authorities, getting sued or being forced to shut down.Their problems are not my problems, because I don't have any crypto funds stored in their hot wallets.",

The kind of attention you will pay for any of your things is certainly not measured same to how a person or an entity will have over yours. And if you are kind of too scared then there are options like trusting your kin or families to keep some for you rather than storing these keys on platforms that either the developer would one day compromise or some of its work will. But with multiple back or using kin and family then you know where or who must have been involved in compromising your funds. I still think the best of bitcoin and crypto currency at large is the been our own bank. Quote from: Epaper on June 10, 2023, 07:46:54 AMI think, to address this challenge, the crypto industry needs to adopt a comprehensive approach towards security and privacy. One of the steps that can be taken is that the crypto industry must continue to develop and implement new security technologies to protect users' crypto assets. This includes the use of strong encryption, innovative identity authentication technologies, and sophisticated threat monitoring and detection.The problem is all these authentication are actually available but the major problem is as technology advances with developers trying to create extra layers of security so will scammers, there is no way beating this. The thing should be people should seek out adequate knowledge in everything they want to get into and shouldnât be in a rush to do things like installing or updating apps, verify them diligently. Even if people use encryption they would still get compromised if they arenât careful. Take off your keys off online services no matter how hard it is for you to be your own bank. People should also be less greedy because most of the major scams are through phishing which are followed through by people that want to earn through faucets or airdrops",

Physical concern of privacy like avoiding wrench attacks which has been on the news and even took lives of those holders/investors. The lesson of starting to your own by protecting your privacy and not being too vocal about it is what should everyone does. The next one is about the wallets that we use, if it's an unknown wallet and you're still optimistic about it you have to make sure that you've done enough research before using it as your personal wallet or cold storage. Too many stories have been said that they've used an unknown wallet and then eventually someone has hacked them or their funds were no longer there and that's because there are other people that has access to that wallet that they've downloaded randomly.

Crypto industry definitely CAN tackle these issues, just not yet as there are no tools ready for that. But there's going to be. Privacy trough ZK smart contracts alone and ZK based ID will guarantee that information will be private, and can in fact be a holy grail for GDPR / privacy laws. These are currently being made, they are just not ready for big adoption yet.I am thinking that by security, OP means investor's security as user is always responsible for themselves. And it's really hard to do anything for the user safety on this. Users will be always the weakest link and vulnerable for social engineering, thefts or hacks. Some coins could technically deal this in token issuancer level and make transactions reversable. But i am not sure what that would look like or what would it do to the ideology of decentralization and permissionless transactions.These immutable transactions most likely won't fly with regulators when we are talking about altcoins that had an ico, ido or any kind of sale. It's likely that demanding that user is responsible of his tokens (self custodity) will be against consumer protection laws but it isn't yet being dealt with.Regulators can't really do anything about fairly distributed POW coins, or coins that have achived a certain level of decentralization, except maybe they can ban them from CEXes, but teams of funded coins could technically be sued later on about this. I am actually baffled why they haven't yet used this type of attack yet. Maybe it's coming later.",
