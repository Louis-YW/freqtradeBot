This is a great innovation that will receive universal acceptance and restore hope to many. I have interacted with those who are virtually impaired and I can confirm that they are very smart people, able to navigate through their soundings and having very sharp memory. So teaching them about Bitcoin will not be a stressful task because their brain is well developed. I can only imagine how excited many if them will be with this latest development especially when they see what opportunities abound for them in this digital space.",

I read about this news on 'Twitter' or 'X' as it is now called and I think it is  hope for all who have wished for sight one more time inorder to make things right. It is a brilliant innovation and I think besides the fact that Elon is on top of the game when it comes to space exploration and alternative sources of energy as well as technology innovation, he is a genius with a working system, with a means to an end and a the capacity to back it all up. Besides also the fact that such new blind sight technology will help those who are visually impaired and have hoped to invest in cryptocurrency, it would help those who have investments alike but were affected along the line by their sight. Although I still think this initiative is as expensive as it would be and may still not be the best option for those who can't afford it, simply because they don't have enough funds or have lived so long, so that they have become used to their eye sight conditions.",

It's most important, more important than how they can use Bitcoin and invest in Bitcoin.Meanwhile blind people can use physical wallet back up methods like titanium plates that are similar to how they read with Morse code.

People with visual impairments have been using existing tools, such as screen readers and voice commands, to safely manage Bitcoin without relying on others. Rather than waiting for this tech to evolve, focusing on improving current accessibility solutions might be a more practical approach for now.Since the company has gotten permission from the FDA to advance animal and human testing, this new invention might soon be accessed by the public. The medical effects of this complicated surgery will be enormous. The common use of eyeglasses causes a lot of side effects, which means this one might have bigger effects. I have a visually impaired friend who can do anything to see the faces of his wife and children. Many of them will be willing to take the risk, daminng the consequences. Another problem will be the cost of this technology. It might end up being reserved for the rich. While the poor might have to sell personal belongings or go for crowdfunding to pay for this surgery. QuoteAll that being said, I really hope that they will speed up the development and make this tech available widely as soon as possible, Blindsight is a very good thing. Blindsight is indeed an uncommon invention that will bring smiles to the lives and families of those with visual impairment. And it will also open the door of opportunity for them to invest in Bitcoin. The company should take their time to make the process perfect because mistakes can lead to more complicated health problems like stroke or even death.",

We are now on 2024; I mean it is not also easy to get here, so we should not be shocked a lot to how our technology has evolved. Not all technology and its advancement has a positive effect to the human being but sometimes it can also depend on how they use it. They might say negative things about it but it is also their fault on why it is happening.Before this Blindsight technology, I think there are already some who can aid a blind but some are not only free or cheap. I won't call them a miracle because they don't just come in a instant but it is a product of hard work and knowledge of the people.
