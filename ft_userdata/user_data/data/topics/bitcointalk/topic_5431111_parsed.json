  "content": "Hey everyone,I am the founder of Livetree.com - starting a thread here to provide updates and bring the community up to speed.HistoryQuick history of how we got here for those that missed the releases along the journey. We started off in 2017 and launched Seed Token (SED) through an ICO 2018. 2018 - 2019 Royalty Payments Multiple FIAT and crypto-currencies, coloured coin licensing smart contract and fractionalization support. Exporting to media accounting systems. Launched a product called Blossom TV. This was the first FIAT and blockchain tracked royalties (FIAT/Crypto) system for film, and TV.2019 - 2021 Artificial intelligence / Video infrastructure Live & multi-bitrate streaming, transcoding from image and video formats. Hollywood standard encryption. Massively scalable storage with smart CDN and optimised cold storage costs. Machine learning capabilities for image/video: Speech-to-text, object recognition (e.g. bicycles, tables), facial recognition (e.g. gender, age, race), geo-location, landmark recognition (e.g. Eiffel Tower), OCR (e.g. written text in videos) and sentiment (e.g. happy). Launch a streaming website similar to Netflix, targeted to socially conscious documentary film makers. Utilised the Royalty system build initially.2021 - 2022 Human interface device Desktop, iOS and Android mobile app game engine game support. AR, VR support on mobile and desktop. Advanced video player for bandwidth optimisation. Launched latest iOS/Android app focused on user-generated and creator content. Built on the royalty system, A.I., Video Infrastructure and introduces the concept of royalties for NFTs, social posts within a collective (DAO) structure.About LivetreeThe latest version of Livetree combines all the technology developed over the thousands of hours and years of development. The Livetree app is available for download and is in the top 1% in terms of user-design and real-world functionality in the entire crypto space. Livetree appTL;DR: The Livetree app combines the functionality of TikTok, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat into an all-in-one app. Under the hood, your new social profile on Livetree is your very own decentralised #Collective (think DAO) registered on the blockchain of your choice, with a unique hashtag #name, the ability to convert any of your posts to NFTs (including videos) and 1 million membership (governance) crypto-currency coins of your very own. There are totally new ways to earn income from your social posts, including livestreaming ticketed events. plus, the best bit — the entire non-profit Livetree’s social network is decentralised meaning, it’s not controlled by billionaires, ad-revenue, shareholder profit, or dictatorship self-interests. You control the income it makes and eventually everything, including censorship policies and content algorithms.No blockchain experience or knowledge is needed to use the app, just swipe up like on TikTok.The app is completely free, and gas fees are covered for frictionless adoption for the creation of your #Collective, converting your posts to NFTs, and creating your very own crypto-currency.SED Upgrade to SEDCSEDC is sold for equivalent of $1 in-app and is staked against 50% of the income generated by all creators via the app. That means the value is directly tied to the app based on a real-world business model. It is staked against the treasury and provides governance over the entire network. You can also trade it via the portal.SED hodlers will be able to upgrade their tokens to SEDC. The mechanism will be discussed in this thread in more detail but from discussion with some of the community members the feedback has been to keep it as simple as possible. So, that's what Ive done by creating a simple \"airdrop\" mechanism based on MetaMask connecting to a web page. You will send your SED on Ethereum then we will airdrop the SEDC on the Moonbeam chain back to your wallet. I will publish more details after the festive break when we can complete testing and will be open for any feedback. Reasons for upgradeWe could not use the SED token because it didn't support any #Collective (DAO) functionality, namely, governance, treasury and numerous technical reasons.  You check out the tokenomics  and contribute to the SEDC token code on Github here Launch of new EIP-6145 standardI have made a proposal so that hashtags used on other social networks, websites like Reddit can also earn for your #Collective. Please contribute on Github hereThe value of SEDC/SED is based on people using the app. Learn more and try it yourselfFor some context in order for Livetree and the token to have value and compete against TikTok ($75bn valuation), OpenSea ($13bn), Patreon ($4bn) and others we will need your feedback, support and growth.  Read more here: on mediumDownload the app, it is tied to the value of SED/SEDC learn more here",

I have already given up on social media tokens but I'm still interested on how you're going to market this to the general public. Do you have any data on who your top users are? Great question thank you. A lot of this is down to my personal persistence and dedication. In short, Livetree provides new revenue streams for Creators and Creative Impact Ventures and we are undercutting competitors fees.Livetree provides the synthesis of a set of Web2 and Web3 unique creator revenue streams: Creators generate income from a range of Web2 revenue streams (such as those uniquely available to Livetree such as ticketed live events, pay-to-view posts, spotlight chat). In addition, to Web3 revenue streams (e.g. trading of membership coins converting posts to NFTs, fractionalisation and more). We are seizing upon the opportunity to undercut competitors, grab market share and capture massively invaluable AI datasets. We can undercut Bigo Live, and Patreon ($4bn valuation) fees for example by 100%. In terms of top users we launched the app in Dec 22 and have 4.5k creators who have a combined follower reach of over 165m. As always we are bootstrapping user adoption through partnerships with leading partner including  blockchains (which have taken years to forge). The build process took a long time for a few reasons but namely underfunding meant I’ve had to bootstrap and program a lot of the near 250k lines of code myself which has obviously taken time (been frustrating to the community and users who don’t care how many programmers it takes to build for example Tiktok. Creators and us all are just used to it being to an expected standard for example live-streaming for millions of people within a completely slick user friendly app isn’t technically easy and is expensive to build and operate) however, that said there were some mistakes for example the first product blossom tv was way too far ahead of the market (2018 NFT royalties . I think now is the perfect timing for the app and we are starting to see some real traction.",

It hasn’t been tested thoroughly yet. I’ll keep this updated and send the screenshots etc so you can provide more feedback on the process.Ps We have 2 major announcements coming this week. Please support them, I’ll post them here for your convenience.",
