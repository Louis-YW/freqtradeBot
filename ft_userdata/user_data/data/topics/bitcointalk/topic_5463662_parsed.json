  "content": "Hi.See this thread:   Crypto/NFT open source rouletteYou can see my comment on it about too many alts praising the system which has made me leave a neutral tag on the OP for the time being. But I see that all the alts who have commented follow the same pattern, which is to have been created between 2017 and 2018, not having written a single fucking post until today, and appearing in that thread within minutes of each other to write posts promoting the service that the OP advertises, a roulette. I would like to read opinions from the community before, if appropriate, proceeding to leave more tags.",

(use of old newbie accounts) my guess is that this is the work of infamous Vitor Services that is usually responsible for this type of \"marketing\".",

Old accounts with a zero level are sold on the Internet very cheaply, and it does not cost a lot of money and labor for scammers to buy several batches of such accounts. I looked at the history of some accounts; some accounts belong to the Russian locale, and there are also old accounts of miners as well as accounts participating in bumping services.It would be right for moderators to destroy such accounts after the first post after hibernation. Although, as one old, respected user says, this is a fight with windmills.",

Those accounts are very old and shouldn't be abused if it is bought. That is why moderators need to see what to do on this issue. Anyway it is a cheap scam and anyone that falls for it must be a greedy person who wants to reap from where he didn't sow from. It might also be that the accounts are controlled by one person who knows such a funny trick.",

I think I have read about a similar case where an user got so many replies on his thread from accounts that were created the day they made all their comments and after that they all left the forum without logging into their account again and when the user was called out he claimed that they (the accounts) were owned by some of those that patronized him and after their deal he made them create an account here in Bitcointalk to give him a review.But I’m this case I don’t think that’s what is happening here, it is obvious that those accounts are being controlled by the same user and since the main aim of this act of socket-puppet is to deceive people into believing that he has actually done anything with those accounts and therefore going into trade with him I think that calls for a neutral tag warning others against the risk of dealing with him.",
