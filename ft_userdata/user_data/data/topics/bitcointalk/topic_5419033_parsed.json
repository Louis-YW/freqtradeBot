  "content": "Hey folks, I noticed during the quarantine that I pursue far too few hobbies that I enjoyed in earlier years. To add more adventure to my free time, I made a list of things I'd like to try - a (partly-checked) bucket list so to speak. Of course, the various things on this list could not be practiced during quarantine, but I'd like to include them for inspiration nonetheless. I implemented the following categories: Sport, Outdoor, Creative/DIY, Nerdy/Science (no claim to completeness - let me know if there is anything I missed)I kindly ask you to help me with the list so we never get bored again! Use CTRL+F to search for your idea. If it's not included yet, let us know Sport: - archery- Rockclimbing- Basketball- Basejumping- Billiards- Bouldering- Bowling- Boxing- Darts- fencing- (Ultimate-) frisbee- Golf- inline skating- kajaking- Longboarding- knife- and axe throw- paragliding- parkour- cycling- rowing- sport shooting- swimming- tap dance- sailing- Standup Paddling (SUP)- Slacklining- dancing- diving- table tennis- trampoline- wakeboarding-motocross/quad- hackysackOutdoor- (deep sea) fishing- Boomerang- beekeeping- (cliff) camping- falconry- pigeon breeding- gardening- hike- sailing- horse riding- mountain biking- forestingCreative/DIY - 3D printing- baking- beat boxing- caligraphy- playing an instrument- art forging- glasblowing- spraying/tagging- sand castles- knitting- welding- wood carving- creating your own rubber stamp- creating your own family crest- leathercraft- linocuts- papermaking- brass ball track- aquaponic- beer brewery- kite building- building a portable sound system- bookbinding- restoring a car/motorcycle- towel folds- building a potato gun- inventing card games- lockpicking- model ships- model airplanes (RC)- origami- papercraft- mushroom growing- soap making- upcycling- building instrumentsNerdy/Science- finding alternative investments- comics- antique trade- astronomy (with own telescope)- board games- crypto farming- dice stacking- kite fights- go-kart- juggling- card tricks- laser tag- paintball- magic tricks- meditation- robotic- language learning- chess- shogi- video games/gaming- rubics cube- board game Go",

There looks like a lifetime of activities to try there I may be being really dumb but I can’t see running/jogging in the list. I think lots of people do it to try & keep a decent level of fitness. Maybe you should include it but you have included pretty much everything else. I can’t think of anything else.",

If you really have tried all those activities since quarantine hit with COVID then I have full respect for you. I used to hate walking/hiking but when COVID happened all the shops were closed, all we were allowed to do was exercise, walk outside etc so I took up walking. I still do it now, so lockdown was good for something",

This helps me with my mood, reducing stress or any anger that I have. It’s hard to believe that not only are my pastimes something I enjoy but I can make sure that my physical health is in check. I plan out my destination and gather my gear. Most of the time it is to the beach taking in nature, the sounds, the scent, and the scenery. Mediating on the sounds of nature, birds calling, listening to the waves crashing into the sand. I also do a little reading, not on an electronic device, an actual book to read.",
