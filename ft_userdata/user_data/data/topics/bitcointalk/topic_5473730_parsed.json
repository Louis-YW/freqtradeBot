  "content": "Well it holiday season in USA. I have some digital apple codes they are 100% good. Not stolen. I can cash in points from a Credit Card reward.If I offer $100 dollar card code what would you pay me?I would take Doge LTC or BTC. At the moment LTC and Doge are cheaper and faster to send then btc.I can do 11 card codes for 100 each value at Apple Store.what would you want to pay for a card?95 for 100 dollar code?94 for 100 dollar code?93 for 100 dollar code?92 for 100 dollar code?These are not ripoffs these are actual codes to be generated by me when you place an order and pay me the coin.I go to my cc and generate the code. It comes to my email I then send you the code to an email of your choice. It should take under 36 hours for the CC to give me the Apple code.",
