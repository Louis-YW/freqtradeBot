What we can call \"coins\" is the outputs in each transaction and they consist of an amount (like 1BTC, 0.0002BTC, etc.) and a locking script which is like a smart contract that defines the conditions that this output can be spent. It usually requires a digital signature from a key that the locking script has the hash of.",

      "body": "If you have studied how bitcoin transactions work, you must have also heard what these transactions do. Transactions in the bitcoin network represent the transfers of ownership over specific chunks of bitcoin called \"unspent transaction outputs\" or, for short, UTXOs. To transfer the right of ownership, a transaction uses particular UTXOs (created by previous transactions) as inputs and creates new ones as outputs (new UTXOs), which also will be destroyed and recreated in future transactions. A UTXO is a piece of data (plain text) that contains a locking script that put constraints on how and when it can be transferred (spent.) Also, a UTXO, along with a locking script, contains a field with an amount of bitcoin represented in the smallest units - satoshis. It also follows that there are no \"bitcoins\" in the bitcoin network because everything essentially is measured in satoshi terms.",

(you probably know this already)Every node has/had it's own self-verified copy of the blockchain, which consists of blocks, where transactions are recorded. (you probably know this already)Stored bitcoins are every transaction's outputs, so coins are just stored as transactions.Clients/wallet are just making it simple by always checking which ones are still unspent and saving them in easy to access forms.For the \"mined\" coins, those are technically called \"coinbase transaction\" (not Coinbase, the company).Those are pretty similar to a normal transactions but not pointing to an existing unspent transaction output, also it's the first transaction that's stored in every block.",

I think Op is not asking how bitcoin works, he already studied how bitcoin works and the cryptographic arithmetics therein. But I doubt he did, because if he is aware of that, he shouldn't have raised the question in Op.Op is practically asking the form of bitcoin, though he had said that he knows it's not physical, he wants to be able to draw bitcoin when he is asked to. He doesn't want bitcoin logo to represent bitcoin, he wants if it's a code, script, amoeba, maybe a rectangular virus or a blue SVG. I am not Op, but I think I understood the nature of his question.",

I find that video does a great job in detailling the technology behind Bitcoin and how it works so that anyone can understand it, even if they have absolutely no scientific or coding background.The youtube user in question makes a lot of mathematics/science videos and explains difficult concepts in a very easy to understand kind of way.I think anyone regardless of their Bitcoin knowledge or seniority, even as an veteran on Bitcointalk, should watch this video at least once in their lives. Even if just to freshen up their own knowledge without having to sit through all the minute details of how blockchain actually works on a mathematical/coders level.",
