If op creates a blog and start posting some real reviews for the casinos that would be more attractive for the users.",

Where are the detailed reviews with all the pros and cons? Where are the comparisons between the individual casinos? You just copied partial reviews from random sites and put them on your website. If all you can offer are copy-pasted reviews from other people's sites, then I will be better off reading them on the original sites, not on yours.By the way, those fake testimonials at the bottom of the site are just a joke, right? What do you even hope to achieve with that?",

Therefore, those names should suppose to be legit right?My advice is, to try to include the ANN threads of those sites.

However, if you are going to use them, it's important that they don't do more damage than good. There is nothing that will absolutely turn a potential customer away faster than a website full of fake reviews.So @topcryptocasinos, don't use bogus testimonials. Instead, focus on building a reputation for quality performances and for treating your customers well. That goes a heck of a lot further than falsified feedback from overly enthusiastic (and fictional) customers.",

Agree about the design. It needs some improvement. I don't know if the web page looks so big or it's only the images? They may need to resize it as well. The site is not in under construction because there are no missing features there. They really intend to come up with 5 casinos because that is what their thread title says. There is no next button but if you click on the review link, you will be redirected on another page.The reason why they copy reviews from other sources is because this was their concept, to collect the best reviews for users to understand more about the casino before they visit them. This could be useful for some but not for others as they think this site have no originality.",

This could be useful for some but not for others as they think this site have no originality.Indeed, copying reviews from other sources is not ideal, most especially trust pilot, I just learned that trust pilot reviews actually can not be trusted, as I learnt that if the company pays them to remove bad reviews, they take the money and do as instructed, so reviews on that site are heavily manipulated.If this site is going to be coping reviews from other sites, then they should look for some trusted review site, not trust pilot and the like...But best of all is, allow user to write their own on your site, don't depend on other review sites since it's hard to trust others except yourself.",

      "body": "OP, after reviewing your website, I am sorry to say that I'm not impressed by what I saw. The content is weak and poorly organized; it doesn't engage the reader or convey what you're trying to sell. You simply listed a few online casinos and copied partial reviews from other websites. I don't see anything about your website that sets it apart or makes it worth reading, and I'm concerned that you havenâ€™t done enough research on the online casino industry to create a successful review site. If I may suggest, you need to do more research and find out what makes an online casino review site successful. Make sure that you fluctuate between adding objective facts and subjective opinions. It's also important to note which online casinos you think are the best and why, rather than simply listing your top picks without explaining why.Â The design of your website is also very basic and doesn't give off an impression of professionalism or credibility, and the overall user experience is not pleasant. This is just my honest opinion, but I would recommend starting fresh and rewriting practically all the content on your website. Start interacting with the online casino industry on other platforms so that you can have a better understanding of it and what your audience looks like. You are also going to need to create an engaging design by hiring a professional designer. On top of this, you should also use SEO to improve your ranking on search engines, as this will attract more readers to your site. This may be a lot of work, but if you want your website to succeed, I think these are the things you should start doing from now on.",
