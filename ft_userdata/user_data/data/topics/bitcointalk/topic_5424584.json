See if it's cheap.",

You shouldn't have opened that pdf in the first place. May we know the source of pdf ? Was that given to you by any known member here ? A website ? This would help others to stay safu! Btw, if the amount is quite large, try contacting all the top  exchanges like binance (unless the hacker hasnt converted your btc into fiat already) they may blacklist the hacker's address and any try to deposit btc in the exchanges would lead to freezing of the funds!! Once again, sorry for the loss but you should be more aware next time.",

I doubt most would be able to do anything in terms of recovery once it's moved, maybe if a report is done but I'd say it's rather minimal for exchanges to move to help recover it. I'd honestly try to clean everything from said pc/laptop first and change your security for your emails, accounts, or anything important since as I've said, your funds are most likely lost already. Invest in a hardware wallet to avoid the same thing happening again and try not to well, open stuff you don't know where it came from.",

It just doesn't happen like that and a malware won't give you a warning when stealing your coins. Why do you even think the pdf file was the problem?Besides, are you sure your coins are stolen? Maybe the wallet is having problem syncing. Is it 5 year old wallet opened today or are you regularly using it? Was your wallet password protected?",

You should never open an attached file from an e-mail if the sender is unknown to you (these e-mails are usually gibberish and should be easy to spot unless you set your e-mail app to automatically download them). Some news reported that these PDF contains a keylogger and other stuff, so Electrum is likely not at fault.My condolences, try to reinstall your OS and probably wipe your device just in case the malware is still there.",

I don't think that's as simple as it sounds. Binance and other exchanges aren't just going to listen to a random person asking to have certain addresses blacklisted. They are going to require proof (proof you don' have) and the involvement of law enforcement. But until that happens, the coins will be long gone.If the goal of the hacker is to convert the BTC into fiat, he doesn't need to touch centralized exchanges at all. He can mix the coins or take advantage of coinjoin services and exchange them via a decentralized exchange like Bisq. P2P trades are another option.Unfortunately, it seems like the OP's money is gone.  Quote from: hugeblack on December 01, 2022, 12:22:27 PMbecause I careless and download a lot of PDF files.

Quote from: pooya87 on November 30, 2022, 01:36:28 PMYou need to provide more information than that if you want \"advice\".Pretty much that. Isn't it a little weird that newbies show up out of nowhere and ask for help to recover their 5 year lost bitcoin with literally zero effort from their side?Quote from: hugeblack on December 01, 2022, 12:22:27 PMbecause I careless and download a lot of PDF files.It depends rather on the PDF reader. Use reputable, open-source software. I use the pre-installed Evince (AKA \"Document Viewer\") from Ubuntu 22.04, which AFAIK doesn't allow executing external applications and is only used for reading.",
