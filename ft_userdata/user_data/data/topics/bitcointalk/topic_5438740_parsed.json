Everybody has what they are good at and what works for them because they have devoted time and years to making themselves better and acquiring the best knowledge, skill, and profession that have made them excel at what they do.It is good to be self-reliant, study yourself, know what you are good at, and improve yourself in that area. Everyone who is successful in business has sacrificed time and spent years building themselves and their businesses. Anyone who is successful in Bitcoin (crypto) has spent time learning, studying, and acquiring more knowledge about it. keeping themselves updated with revolutions and frequent adjustment to improve themselves and achieve success in Bitcoin investment.I know of a successful pharmacist in my area who owns a big pharmacy. All of a sudden, he decided to go into politics and contest for a political position because of his friend, who was an ex-president that he could attain a lot of wealth when it was still his tenure. So unfortunate for the pharmacist; he used all his savings, mortgaged his shop, and used all the funds to run his campaign, but luck ran against him as he lost the election. After which, he started from scratch again.The guy imitated his friend, thinking he could win and acquire more wealth than he had, but he was wrong. He was really doing well in his field; some of his other friends convinced him not to contest because he had no concrete knowledge about politics, but he refused to listen.I think it's good to do what works best for you and not to imitate others. just my opinion, though.",

But one thing should be noted; never let your imitations become your limitations. Most persons just want to be like those that they're imitating, and that's the point where they get it wrong. If you're trying to imitate someone you should aim at surpassing the person and not to remain at the same level as the person. As for the guy I will say he didn't take his time to set out a plan. He probably thought he could just jump into a new trade just because he has the resources and forgot that it's difficult for one to survive without them having a good plan. He might have learnt a lesson but the price he paid was just too much.",

Everyone is unique. And one that works for others might not work for someone else. That is why before jumping into any decision, one should make prior research first, and know it’s pros and cons so we can derive into a sensible decision. Otherwise, if we keep on imitating on how others have succeeded, we might only fail in the end and realize that what we did are totally out of our context. It’s still best to follow our own path through developing our own skills and capabilities, that way there are high chances we will succeed because we know we are doing our best.",

Regarding the man, I'll only remark that he didn't take the time to make a plan. He presumably assumed that because he has the resources, he could quickly leap into a new trade and overlooked the fact that it's challenging for many others.Some people have followed in the footsteps of others and succeeded in life. it should be mentioned that you should never let your imitations be your end point. The point where most people are is in their desire to merely resemble those they are copying. If you're trying to emulate someone, you should strive to be better than them rather than to be on par with them.",

Well, I like your take on this, but these days, some imitation is only based on greed, not even envy, although not all, some will real intentions to learn and be better.We may have families of lawyers, doctors, and the rest, but most are not just inspired by success stories. Let's assume my dad is a lawyer, and right from my tender age, I have shown an interest in becoming a lawyer too. I can start some self-education at that early age and grow up with it until I go through a high institution, but most people are just bound to try what they see others doing without having to fully learn much about it. Like I said in the first paragraph, it is good to feel inspired or motivated by others' success stories, but trying to imitate them without getting to understand what has put them where they are can be detrimental.Quote from: BADecker on February 08, 2023, 08:38:40 PMDon't imitate others; do what works for you.Imitate others, because that is what will work best for you... except if you are an artist. imitate others while you don't have enough ideas and are also never ready, then get recked and throw regrets😆😅 ,because that's what they end up doing.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 08, 2023, 03:03:04 PMsnipBut there is something wrong with following them fawningly like some will do; you can't say you are following someone when you don't even intend to go that extra mile they took.",

You should learn from their experiences and their mistakes then apply those things that you've learned to what you're trying to achieve. Starting from scratch trying to learn on your own is time-consuming, while you can just learn and develop from the experiences of the others",
