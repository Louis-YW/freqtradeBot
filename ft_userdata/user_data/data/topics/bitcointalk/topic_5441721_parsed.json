  "content": "Are you sure you have everything updated? A lot has been done since the previous announcement and the ‚ÄúHard‚Äù Talk held in January, and this post is an invitation for you to update your nodes.February was a productive month with the release of the Full Node v1.7.0. After intensive testing, it is considered to be the last stable version before the Leman Network Upgrade.The full node v1.7.0 possesses all the Leman Upgrade features but they are not activated on the mainnet. The full node v2.0 or the Leman Upgrade version, will essentially be the same as v1.7.0 with an activation timestamp for the Leman Upgrade features on the mainnet.Deploying v1.7.0 across the network will allow assessing whether any patches are necessary before the release of v2.0. It will also indicate the propagation time of the update across the network which will help us to set a realistic activation timestamp for the Leman Network Upgrade.Here is what you need to do!DownloadsWho & What:Regular user: Don‚Äôt need to do anything, but it is recommended to have the latest Desktop Wallet (or reach out to your wallet provider to verify if it is up to date)Miners: latest Full NodeUsers running Full Node locally: latest Full NodeUsers running Full Node and Explorer Backend locally: latest Full Node and Explorer BackendUsers running Full Node externally:Dappnode: There is nothing to do if you‚Äôre running the node with the auto-update option checked! If not, you must go to the alephium package and click the upgrade/update button.Flux: There is nothing to do.Services providers (exchanges, wallet providers, etc): latest Full Node and Explorer Backend (if necessary)Full Node: v1.7.1Download it here: üîó https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases/tag/v1.7.1This release is backward compatible with the current Mainnet, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about compatibility issues. Download the .jar file from the GitHub page.Explorer-backend v1.13.0Download it here: üîó https://github.com/alephium/explorer-backend/releases/tag/v1.13.0This additional download is only needed for those running the explorer backend locally. However, it is mandatory for compatibility with full node v1.7.0. If that is the case, download it from the GitHub page.Next StepsThe Leman Network Upgrade is closer than ever! Here is what you can expect next:Patches release, if necessary.Setup the activation timestamp and release full node v2.0Propagation v2.0 of the full node across the majority of the network before the activation timestamp.Completion of the Leman Upgrade!If you need assistance, you are welcome to reach out in the community channels on Discord, Telegram.
