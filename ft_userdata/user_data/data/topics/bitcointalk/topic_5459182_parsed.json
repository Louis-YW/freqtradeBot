  "content": "This is not about investment advice, as such. But I have been itching to start investing in crypto-related projects and have come across a few interesting ones. The problem is, in today's world, handing over money to someone seems about as safe as throwing it from a moving car and hoping the right people catch it. I am totally okay with investments having some risk, I even like to put a bit into unlikely projects in case they take off. But I do not want to just hand some money over to a project and then realize they just ran away with it.So my question is, how do _you_ invest in projects, regardless of the size, in ways where you feel you are not going to get outright robbed? If I want to put a few grand into Billy Bob's Crypto Cousins Emporium (not a real project...) but do not want to just hand over cash to someone in another country who then shuts down the operation and runs cackling to the bank with what was my but is now their money, what are my best options?",

      "body": "In Crypto space, the solution lies with Decentralized Model, a bit more like ICO (Initial Coin Offering) but more secure.The model gives the funders or contributors the opportunity to fully control the keys to their assets or investment funds, which could be escrowed or locked in a Smart Contract under an agreement between the funders and developers on different promises on Project Roadmap that must be fulfilled before certain percentage of the funders locked funds can be unlocked and released to the project developers. Funders can always withdraw their funds if rules are broken otherwise they can't be withdrawn yet. It's safer to unlock contributors locked funds and release them gradually to developers as they continue to fulfill parts of the promises in their roadmap. The contract can say: \"unlock and release 5% of all contributors locked funds when number 1 promise on the roadmap is fulfilled\".Before fund is released, there should verifiers (with reputable verifiers having more powers) that check to see whether part of the agreement for fund release has actually been fulfilled or whether Work has actually been done, if yes, they tick \"Yes\" or \"Work Done\"... verifiers who disagree are free to point out issues for further verification before majority of the verifiers can finally tick \"Work Done\" after the issues are resolved/solved. This is a simple Smart Contract approach that can be automated or manual or both, and can functions in decentralized manner..",

But many projects need to operate in dollars or euro, since their budgets demand payment in such. But hell, even in pure crypto space, scammers seem to be undermining the system! Hell, I almost invested a few grand into Log*n Pa*l's Cryptoz*o stunt! I'm looking for some clever way to have both freedom and control, if that is even possible at this point!",

Doing the same with a bunch of talented geeks across the globe is a very different challenge, it eels like.",

I just feel like having some hold over my investment so I know people do not simply run off with it and disappear. IRL I can sue or just track them down and take my investment back if they try to scam me, but if I am on a completely different continent, that does not work. I am hoping to find some kind of escrow or other method for securing that my investment is at least used as described. Whether or not a project fails beyond that, that is life.",
