  "content": "So I just read Theymos' post in the Auction board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407725.msg60976136#msg60976136 but it's locked so nobody can comment there, and it wouldn't bode well to start a discussion there anyway since you can't delete or edit posts there.So, ads are not going to be auctioned away anymore. He did mention that you can privately contact him to buy some ad slots from him in the usual manner.Seeing as this frees up a bunch of ad slots, what does Theymos think of advertising non-profit bitcoin sites?I was thinking in particular about websites like bitcoin.org and perhaps my own website bitcoincleanup.com. Of course, as a prerequisite you must already have an HTML banner designed.",

I don't see a problem with that, considering we have a big \"Lastest Bitcoin Core version\" banner at the top of the page pointing to bitcoincore.org.Like, let's go back to my own site for example (sorry about that).Greenpeace has one million dollars to play with for smashing Bitcoin mining, while resisters have to pay for advertising from their own pockets. It's very expensive, considering that there is basically no website income to offset the costs. The result is that the facts don't get the reach they deserve (whereas the misinformation does because it is bankrolled).",

To ban ads will not affect this forum traffic, but if signature is banned, there would be less traffic. Many people that supposed to be exposed to what bitcoin is properly will be unable to. I don't think Theymos would actually ban signatures based on what they've said in the past. They've mentioned scrapping the ad space below threads and I think there was hope demand would drop before then or it'd be less effort to implement that system. The first topics where he mentioned stopping with the ad slots were years ago and perhaps this is a time where users enrolled in signature campaigns can determine what's promotable and what's scam/worthless.Signatures remain a quite good way to distribute crypto to newbies and enthusiasts and to keep traffic here. There's also the argument that people might ignore the slots after a while so inserting new ones after a break might make them more noticeable to users. I can't find statistics on ad clicks either. I wonder if we'll get some new factoids coming out though soon? I'd support a community based project on that too if we have things/need tor ank things worth advertising generated by forum members here.",

Most of bounties right now are social medias campaign, so banning signature doesn't really make huge difference on bounties section.I'd say Bitcoin discussion and Beginner & Help are become the new spam sections since there's many pointless thread created everyday.Quote from: jackg on September 26, 2022, 01:19:32 PMI wonder if we'll get some new factoids coming out though soon?

In my office, direct opposite a clothes and a provision seller ask me what is bitcoin because she saw it on the banner I sample on the street of my office. It was not only she that has asked me but many and I have explained to many as well. And also for the forum. Let there be no restriction on signature and campaign posts. The restriction is making some boards redundant. Although I really do not know why the restriction was implemented. Well paying for ads slot is not too bad but not everyone who want to make advertisement have the amount, that is an another restriction on interested persons to add ads.",

I am sure that more than 50% (maybe the percentage is even more dramatic) of the activity on the forum is due to paid signatures. even in spite of that, some DT members or those who had almost secured a place in a better-paid campaign have left the forum. just to imagine how different it would be without stimulation through signature campaigns.why not an advertisement? many services gained significant momentum by advertising here. on the other hand, if the ads here are a burden, I believe that there are many Telegram and Discord groups, where it is possible to discuss freely without advertisements.",

In theory sig campaigns should just be a bonus to people who were already posting anyway, and I think for some posters this still holds true. However, its pretty clear the vast majority are here just for the payday. This has led to an ingrained culture of shitposting-for-cash where genuine contribution is quickly buried beneath a flurry of dull, meaningless drivel.
