  "content": "Hey guys, I have some questions/ideas I want to discuss here, because with those electricity prices nowadays things begin to be a bit hard. Going off grid is almost impossible if you don't scale enough to afford it, and not always a easy solution. But here is alternative. Since the price of the electricity fluctuates a lot during the day/night (at least here in Norway), I was thinking about a small household/mining rig solution, a power storage which can be charged during the \"cheap\" hours and when the electricity price is hits the top then used the stored power to mine/powering the house. In addition you can add additional charging from solar/wind sources. I think that will be the future. Anyone knows about/have experience with such solutions like Tesla Powerwall?Nowadays there are many smart house solutions which charge your electrical car based on the electricity prices, same with the dishwasher, the washing machine etc so I'm sure there is something like this out there.",

      "body": "QuoteCompressed air storage is MASSIVELY inefficient, it's a joke.No, it is NOT a 'joke'.Just a different version of the more common pumped-storage solutions that use water which is pumped into reservoirs and released through generators when peak loads need it. Yes it takes a fair bit of energy input to do the pumping but typical power-in to power out is still a bit over 50%. The point of it is to suck up excess power when available by using massive electrically driven pumps or compressors to fill the potential-energy 'bank' (the compressed air or elevated water reservoirs) and then on very short notice release that stored energy to be able to put back into the grid a large % of the power put into the system to handle short-term peak loads.A perfect example of a massive one built in the 1960's is here It um also had massive failure in 2005 when one of the side walls gave away due to water level sensor failures and design faults. 1 billion US gallons (3,800,000 m3) of water was released in 12 minutes....Ja it makes zero sense to use either method for small-scale operations but on the Utility scale both are very practical.",

My friend, Norway has build the communism at it's greatest. It's one of the most social countries, no poor people (very low percentage), everyone are equal, basically no lower class and of course taxes are sky-high. We do not suffer of the gas/oil shortage at all, thinking that we have enough oil for generations to come, but the prices are quite speculative. The government takes quite a big cut off the fuel market prices and they are the one to speculate with them. With the electricity the situation is different. Norway is divided in different areas and electricity prices are different in each one. Most of the electricity is produced by the hydroelectric plants and the prices depend a lot of the weather. Most of the time, when the summer is shitty and rainy, the electricity bills are low. I've experienced a 0 bill for July this year so I cannot complain. But things are to change soon and the prices will rise no matter the weather. I wish the salaries could also follow but that will take a while for sure. When I started this thread I was wondering if there's an efficient way to store energy something like this solution here. In the video the big water tank stores the power of a one 1.5v AA battery, so there's a very low efficiency, but it shows the possibility to store power in alternative ways than the use of lithium (or other type of)  batteries. Back in the day I had a lot more free time to experiment and play with hydrogen cells, solar panels, wind turbines and off-grid projects, but after the kids came,I left this field (and many others as well) to focus on the family so I'm quite off the rail tracks of the latest inventions/approaches.",

You can store energy in just a few ways:- electrical, for home users there is only one, batteries, you won't be able to build a SMES in your home- mechanical with either the mentioned air system or pump storage (barrel on top of the house or concrete block on a crane)- thermal, again for a house use maybe only a miniature steam accumulator that will only charge your phone with a full load, but its better to just use a boiler and heat your water for the next day with cheaper power, and of course liquid nitrogen tanks, a thing that actually is in use and works but that's one risky toy for a hobbyist.- chemical, don't know a single one that could be used for a home, in theory you could try electrolysis and then store hydrogen, then use it to generate energy, and so on, but again, not something we see on small scale.So, batteries!",

But that is for full discharges. Partial discharges are proportionally less of a burden on the pack, and no one does full discharges ever if they avoid it. So If you over design what you need, you will obviously pay more. But this is where you need a lot of math. Paying 2x up front to get 3x the lifespan may be a good deal for you. Paying 4x up front for 10x the lifespan for someone else might be better for them.The recycling depends on composition of the battery. Figure anywhere from $0.12 to $0.40 per kilowatt hour for large recycling (read tons and tons) for smaller amounts it's by the pound.-Dave",

Figure anywhere from $0.12 to $0.40 per kilowatt hour for large recycling (read tons and tons) for smaller amounts it's by the pound.-Dave ...Keep in mind almost ALL of these companies hide crucial info when they sell you a battery, i had an offer for german paid battries that were sold as 100ah, when diving deep into the specs it turns out that it can only give you that much if you discharge it for 100 hours, so if you plan on using it at full load for 2 hours, it is no more a 100ah, more like 70ah....Battries are rather complicated and very expensive, i ended up buying a diesel generator, assumed it would die on me in 5 years, accounted for service and repairs and despite all that it was a lot cheaper. Ja. one MUST always refer to the battery manufacturer website and factory data sheets for the full picture. Actually that applies to buying any power electronic device. Even reputable manufacturer authorized distributors rarely give all the details (but will provide the links you want). Random resellers of things, well.....There is a 3rd/4th solution as well: Storing the power in large banks of supercapacitors which have a massively long lifetime but do self-discharge or the latest variant of them, hybrid supercapacitors that combine supercaps & Li-ion batteries into 1 device. In essence the caps handle whatever amount of load be it short high-current or long term output with no change in apparent capacity. btw: That article delves quite nicely into what a capacitor is and how they work Of course both are very expensive but to a point it is balanced by them essentially being zero maint for 10-20+ years.One available provider of them is https://powerquality.eaton.com/emea/supercapacitor/default.asp Per that page, QuoteThe Supercapacitor back-up power solution is available for all of the latest 3-phase Eaton UPS products starting from 8kW single units up to 7700 kW parallel UPS systems providing back-up time from seconds to minutes. No doubt using a lower% of full power rating gives more time. In other words long enough for the overall much cheaper (for hours/days/more of running) diesel genset(s) to kick in.
