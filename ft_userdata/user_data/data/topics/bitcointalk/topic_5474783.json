I have used that site in past and back then it was a good site to exchange your local currency into Bitcoin but now the site is a home to scammers. I think it's better to avoid such sites because they aren't reputed enough to be used and if someone uses those sites then they may get scammed by those scammers. I'm not big fan of using such sites but surely in my earlier days with Bitcoin I used that site and back then I would say again that my experience was good with them.I think the admins and moderators at Paxful doesn't care a lot about the users anymore and that's why they are allowing things like that to happen. I appreciate you for creating this thread because I believe that it will be helpful for the ones who still want to trade on that site. Since you can't embed the images on the forum due to your rank and the Imgur.con doesn't work anymore that's why I have uploaded your image on Talkimage.com.",

But still though, scammers have a lot of tricks in their bag. There was one case wherein I wanted to exchange my bitcoin to my local fiat. And so I pick someone, who turns out to be a scammer and says that he has send it already. And then he keeps on like forcing me to released my crypto. However, I didn't because I haven't received any. And then he has the audacity to say that he will file a dispute. And so he did and I gave everything to that exchange and later the verdict is that he is really a scammer so they lock his or her account.",

Do not ever trust screeshots or QR codes, Email and SMS messages stating that you have received funds, and you will never be scammed.Only release after confirming the balance and I think to avoid this kind of headache, only trade with old, reputable or merchant accounts. Brand-new small volume accounts are likely to try and pull off scams at any point.",

Brand-new small volume accounts are likely to try and pull off scams at any point.You're correct in what you mentioned.Even the most famous and reliable exchange platforms provided with the P2P feature warn against this. Scammers have ways of forging screenshots, sending fake messages as if they were real, or engaging in dishonest behavior, as happened to the OP through a QR code or a malicious link. Looking at the attached screenshot of the scammer, it appears that he has 267 positive ratings. However, even positive ratings alone cannot be relied upon. Every user using P2P on any platform, whether Paxful or another, should check and review their bank account or payment method to see the funds they have received. Honestly, I haven't used Paxful before, but if the platform's team doesn't take strict action against the advertisements and accounts of these scammer traders, it will undoubtedly affect its reputation. Moreover, advertisements that display significantly higher prices than the market, such as 20% or 50% by buying Bitcoin, are red flags, as they aim to lure and attract sellers with these unreasonable offers.",

I have known her for a long time and I know many users who have been victims of scams via Paxful. I don't understand why someone still insists on trading it.Despite the repeated attempts that prove the platform's weakness in ensuring the security of its customers' deposits and financial transactions, it still has great popularity. It gained its popularity many years ago when there were no peer-to-peer platforms available as today. I remember that the only two platforms available at that time were Paxful and localbitcoins, which are still working today according to my latest information.",

And going on with this platform, they have already made a closure announcement and then came back. With that behavior of a service and company, for just a short period of time there is already a change to that decision is something to be curious with. And the better option is not to go with them anymore and avoid any further transactions. You were able to skip on that attempt but how about those that are new to them and to this market?",

The weakness is in their chat system which I think isn't moderated at all, it's allow for scammers to ask you to do other things outside the paxfull trading procedures.",

I've learned a new thing today, thanks to you for that and I must confirm that the QR code part caught my attention the most. So scammers have started using it to bypass and gain entrance into people's accounts? That's advance! Scamming is getting uglier, we all need awareness and get to be smarter than the scammers in their game.About Paxful, as a business, it's not that they are not concerned about it, but I believe it's beyond them. If you noticed, every exchange always has its disclaimers, it's about parties' transaction involvements, and it's actually out of their sole control unless you later report such. Some of these might be so new to them, which is why they always update their disclaimers and warnings to fit the current vices of the perpetrator and to caution the intending victims.",
