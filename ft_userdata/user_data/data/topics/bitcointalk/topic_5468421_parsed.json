Because back when I was there, I knew all the players that were there except for the visiting ones. Most are friendly and they sometimes share some tips to be a better player and their funny experiences. I think that is what I mostly missed. Damn pandemic.Now, I only play online and it's not as fun as playing with buddies near you. Anyway, a good help to learn more about this game is by following some pages, like me I follow one page on Facebook and sometimes it's also fun to watch popular artists who join the table.Like that one where they cage the loser, I forgot the name of that tournament.",

I don't think so, even though he has 22 years of experience, it doesn't mean he can be one of the best. Maybe what differentiates us is our experience. It's not about the best or not. What is clear is that playing Poker might be better than playing slots, because in the game we can decide for ourselves whether to continue or to fold based on the potential cards that we hold and those that will be issued by the dealer and that may be held by other players.",

If you want to gain more skills and improve your game, then communicate with other players, share experiences and strategies with them.There are several types of poker games that can be played but the easiest one in my opinion is Omaha even though this is almost similar to Texas Hold'em but there I can more freely predict what cards my opponent has and what might come out first.But everyone definitely has their own choice of which one they feel is the most popular or easy to play.If you are learning or gaining experience it is better to play in free mode for some time so that you can have skills in each game.Quote from: Gozie51 on September 28, 2023, 01:35:47 PMWhen I watch poker game during sections of some mafia action films, it trills me alot.

The way hands are ranked will determine if you have a strong or a weak play to show, and better understand what your odds of winning are in any given situation. The current hands ranking is as follows:Royal FlushStraight FlushFour of a KindFull HouseFlushStraightThree of a KindTwo PairOne PairHigh CardI include pictures from other articles because to make it clearer if one day a beginner gambler enters this thread to learn more details here sourceI dont remember how long I have been playing poker but for now I like the type of gambling that trains skill like poker and sometimes I also bet on sports betting but to fill my free time I prefer to play more relaxed poker games and I recommend it for beginner gamblers it is always better to use smaller amounts to try betting in poker games and I am sure many beginner gamblers will love the game.",

You said it yourself \"it requires knowledge and skill\" and frankly enough not a lot of people will be willing to put in the required work and hours to learn a game only to fail horribly to opponents with years of experience under their belt. Make the game a little more beginner-friendly by setting up tournaments or special events catering to the noobies, and you'll see changes. They made the same approach with chess and it paid them in dividends, maybe it's high time we do the same thing for poker too?We have governing poker organizations anyway, urge them to look towards adding more enthusiasts and people into the scene, make it a bona-fide game instead of a \"gambler's game\" so more people can get into it without the fear of gambling addiction. There's much we can do to change the image of poker into a much desirable one.",

I played poker a lot years ago but there was a time when I felt that I'm bored with the game because it is a game that consume too much time especially when it comes to tournament. I do not play poker anymore for several years already but I may play it again if I find something interesting or something new with poker in the future.

Once you have a general knowledge of what hand is what and what beats what, then you can take a shot at some micro buyin tourneys($1) or sit at a micro cash game.

Don't start playing thinking you're the best ever as there are a ton of players out there ready to prove you wrong.Agreed, there are 50cent or lower tourneys too. However, low stakes and high stakes tournaments dynamics and playing style will differ but it's still good to get experience from low stakes tournaments before moving into higher ones. There's a reason why some people(pros) manage to get into the money more often than avid poker fans that aren't pro. Things you learn from experience, rather than just studying books. Poker isn't just playing the cards. You need to learn about your opponents (especially cash games) tells and positions they like to play, to have an additional advantage.",

And with good hands play aggressively enough to see how your opponents react. And sometimes the reason would be just to see what others are holding and taking notes on how do they bet on those cards.As my stack size grows, i am playing more aggressively and try to control the table. Not arrogantly enough for others to play me out, but way more higher bets. I often try to get a read from other players when playing live, but that takes more intuition. It doesn't involve much tricks. Except keeping a poker face, which can be a lot of different things in different situations. Basically making your opponents think that you either don't know what you are doing. But yeah. That can't really be taught i think.",
