I cannot believe that the main characters, John Wick, Keanu Reeves, are still the same since 2014. The man looks the same from John Wick 1 and just does not look like he ages much.Will this killer assassin finally close out the series as we all have waited years for the release. It is a movie for me its worth to pay the admission to the cinemas. I can watch it for free online but want to see it on the big screen with loud stereo audio.",
