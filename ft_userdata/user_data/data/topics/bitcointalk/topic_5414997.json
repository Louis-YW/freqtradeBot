Did you actually mean Bitcoin network or Bitcoin cash indeed?Quote from: https://unbankworld.com/Since 2014 we have placed hundreds of ATMs throughout the United States. We prioritized the importance of creating a network of user-friendly kiosks, backed by our partners and in house customer support team. We have over 40,000 locations that support buying and selling cryptocurrency with cash.This is surprising considering that I thought this service is still new. In fact, I just got to know about it today",

We only allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin, not Bitcoin cash.We've been operating Bitcoin ATMs (cash-in to Buy) since 2014 but our cashout product (Sell) with AllPoint ATMs at their 23,000+ locations is a new service that we offer. We don't charge any fees to sell your Bitcoin and withdraw cash from an ATM.",

We've also purchased unbank.com from a defunct bank and won't have access to that until the new year. I've changed our profile here to support@unbank.world so anyone that views our profile can contact us directly. Try us out, no fees when cashing out your Bitcoin and withdrawing cash from 23,000+ locations!",
