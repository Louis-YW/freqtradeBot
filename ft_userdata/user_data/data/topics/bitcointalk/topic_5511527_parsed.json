But what I noticed about the time like this is that the market will later become good not long after the bad event.Not only Bitcoin, the entire stock market was also in red after the news of war spread. This is understandable because bitcoin and stocks are both highly speculative assets, so people often decide to sell when there is negative news. This will always happen and is nothing new as they are ready to cut their losses and find safe havens to protect their assets in the long term. That is also the reason why gold always increases when war breaks out. The market usually recovers afterwards because it adapts gradually, similar to what happened in the war between Russia and Ukraine which no longer has much impact on the market these days.Source: CNBC",

October is normally a bad month for markets, even if it has not historically been as bad as September for Bitcoin.

On the other hand, it is really annoying when they enter the market and use their power and money to manipulate the market in their favor.

This institutions are like hypes and Fud to me if they buy and sell, it only drives out those who follow it but once you can are in to hold with a diamond hand then you need not to worry. This particular dip though is associated to the war and that’s why we see a lot of outflows from this institutions. The banging of the Iran and Israel war is what’s causing this FUd but it won’t last as long as this doesn’t escalate more than we have seen. So to overcome institutional fuds like this it is simple don’t get carried away with them and hodl your bitcoin till your target is reached",

But I am done with this as the main decider of what I would do in my trading and investment because I see the true guide in the technical chart. As it is now, I predicted earlier that there would be a selloff of Bitcoin in October, it's already happening, the market pattern is getting stronger, so expect more liquidity outflows one way or the other in October.",

I didn't think I expected that Israel would assassinate Hassan Nasrallah and Ismail Haniyeh which necessitated Iran's attack on Tel Aviv. Many people also thought that the retaliation would come later. Maybe your prediction is just a coincidence with the conflict in the Middle East.",

It also goes to showthat these investors apply a traditional investment mindset to their Bitcoin ETF investments, atthe sign of anything which will spook the markets they apply a \"weak hands\" attitude.There goes the \"uptober\" outlook for this month so far but no doubt there will be a more positivesentiment shortly - hopefully!Hopefully for both the prevention of more senseless loss of life in Gaza and Lebanon and for ourBitcoin market the situation playing out now wont escalate.",

People will come up with a narrative that whenever there is a crisis the market is supposed to go red. And then you see investors with massive BTC start selling them off while some people start buying them back because their narrative is that they have to buy when there is a crisis. It just depends on what will have heard about events and how they affect Bitcoin. So whatever action we take is based on the information we have. But I think its better if we stop focusing on narratives and information like this and go about our investment with the knowledge we have. Because no mater what happens the price will go back up.",

Also, the attack did not do any real damage, so they overreacted and probably lost money.
