  "content": "I keep hearing the argument that POS chains are securities because you appear to be profiting from the work of others. Gensler has made this claim and so has Michael Saylor.Ethereum solo stakers are actually doing the work of securing the network in the same way a POS miner is. They are providing hardware, electrical infrastructure, internet connection, and an Ethereum wallet with 32 ETH. It would seem the Howey test does not apply to solo stakers.Bitcoin developers updated the blockchain to enable smart contracts via the Taproot upgrade in November, 2021.If Michael Saylor did not physically work on that upgrade can't the same argument be used that he is expecting to profit on the work of others? He also did not mine the Bitcoin but instead purchased it. If he is not securing the Bitcoin network via mining then he is not doing any work on the Bitcoin blockchain. Therefore he is expecting to profit from the work of others, correct?",

When a validator completes this task by proposing a valid block that is subsequently attested by all other validators, they receive a block reward.Feb 8, 2023https://www.blocknative.com/blog/ethereum-block-rewards-maximize-validator-yield#:~:text=Ethereum%20block%20rewards%20(or%20%E2%80%9Cproposer,they%20receive%20a%20block%20reward.",

Whether you mined or staked or bought or earned or were given or stole your Ethereum has nothing to do with whether or not it is a security. All Ether is either a security or not a security, not individual tokens, so it isn't irrelevant to your situation. But how you got your Ether on the other hand is irrelevant to whether ETH is a security or not.And no, Satoshi running the first miner is not as though he did a pre-mine. A pre-mine is a specific thing and has nothing to do with being the first miner on a network. A pre-mine means minting coins at the start of the network (basically the opposite of mining them) and selling them off to raise funds for the project. This, obviously, is not the case with Bitcoin. Nobody argues that Satoshi pre-mined, unless they simply don't know what pre-mining means.So it seems you have some false ideas on what a pre-mine is as well as what it means for something to be a security. Bitcoin obviously had no pre-mine as is well known by everyone, and it doesn't meet any definition of a security. Ethereum could definitely be considered a security, though that's up for debate, and honestly I think the main reason to not call it a security is simply to allow it an exemption just because it is such an important part of the crypto industry and is already established (unlike every other altcoin). And regardless of how you got your ETH, your ETH is either a security or not depending on what the regulators decide.Personally I don't think the idea of securities should even be applied to cryptocurrencies, because they are a totally new kind of asset that obviously was not taken into account when securities rules were made a long time before cryptocurrencies existed. If we do apply securities rules to cryptocurrencies though, just about every crypto besides Bitcoin is a security (maybe a handful of other old non-pre-mined altcoins might not be securities but its a small number). Everything else including ETH is likely a security if we're gonna apply security rules. Ethereum isn't really different from any of the countless altcoins controlled by a centralized company or organization that issued coins in a pre-mine to fundraise. Though if in the case securities laws are decided to apply to cryptocurrency I'd be for exempting Ether simply because it is already established and important to the industry. Of course if you do that and not to the many other similar altcoins then you're basically just playing favorites. So either Bitcoin and a few other old cryptos are not securities while Ethereum and most altcoins are securities, or we just don't apply securities rules at all to crypto and none of them are and we give them their own regulation rules that have nothing to do with securities.",

It made Bitcoin faster, and much more efficient.Verification of transactions on Bitcoin's network used to be a slow process prior to the implementation of Taproot. This was due to the fact that each digital signature needed to be validated against a public key, which significantly increased the time required for complex transactions involving multiple inputs and signatures, such as multi-sig transactions.We can finally have DeFi on Bitcoin as well.Also another benefit of Taproot (Source: https://cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-the-bitcoin-taproot-upgrade) QuoteMerklized Alternative Script Trees (MAST), which condense complex Bitcoin transactions into a single hash, reducing transaction fees, minimizing memory usage, and improving Bitcoin’s scalability.That is a literal game changer for Bitcoinverse.Now coming back to the topic, Did Michael Saylor work on the Taproot Upgrade? No. Is he mining BTC? Yes, on his personal desktop with a 3060 /s",
