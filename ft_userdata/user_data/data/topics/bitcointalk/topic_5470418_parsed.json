      "body": "MetaMask has always been in the center of all this drama every time, there is hardly no months left hat pass without them having to Clear all this kind of mess. Yesterday I read about them removing their wallet from IOS after many members complained that couldn’t download it from the Apple Store, and after acclaiming to it, and blaming the increasing number of their fake wallets spreading round, they came back few hours later that it has been rectified. All this back and forth saga is a reason to not only use a wallet that is open source but a wallet that you can simply verify its signature to been able to identify its authenticity. It’s time from its users to move to other wallet which open source before things get outta hand",

      "body": "Is there an email associated with our wallets. As far as Im waware its none so definitely that is a scam. With the recent removal on appstore make some people panic and obviously they did return it but these scammers are quite fast to make it sure that they can hijack anyone to click any links from that email. Someone must have think of this or else another wallet will be drained by them and metamask be masked by scammers once again. Be careful everyone.",

So be careful.Here is the Email which I received.So be careful about these kind of scam. Thanks.You should be careful from such mails as they as sent by scammers in order to steal our coins. Most of us fall into such traps because we don't really look at the URL of the site and download software from those unknown websites basically they are phishing sites. Another user has reported such type of scam a few months ago where he also shared the scam information with the community.Here's the link of the thread where Nwada001 shared information about a similar MetaMask scam: Scam targeting Metamask wallet user'sThese scammers often use fake URL's in order to steal coins of the user's. The official URL of MetaMask is https://metamask.io/ and if the site which you visited has a different URL than that's 100% a phishing site set by scammers. It's always needed to check the URL of the page before entering any sensitive information and unfortunately most of us don't really give much importance to URL and just see in inner contents of a site and that's why those malicious people get success with their negative activites.",

So be careful.If they sent you that to your personal email, that means you musr have exposed your email the public. It's obvious that this is a scam and scammers cannot auto generate email and send email to people they have no idea liveness of their email, they copied it somewhere or you made it available for others to see.I hope this is not the reason why Metamask was delisted from Apple store, maybe they are trying to minimize the risk for people that use IOS operating system.",

When you trust to enter the mail and share some important information of your account in that link, they will get access to your wallet or account, so always beware of this kind of fraud. This is a very common problem for those of us who use cryptowallets. Those who know beforehand and are on the alert are not deceived by this deceitful means of the deceiver. Especially those who are new to Crypto easily believe these scams and give their wallet access to fraudsters.",

Thanks.I have not received any such e-mail but I am thinking that if hackers can easily send e-mails to people through e-mails from any wallet, then people can definitely get trapped in it, and of course this is a very disturbing situation. Often we think that our assets are not safe in exchanges where only our authority is limited to passwords and our assets can be lost if any exchange crashes, but when it comes to keeping your assets in a personal wallet, which generally people think is more secure than our assets and under our own control.When such problems arise in the personal wallet, we do not understand where to keep our assets safe. Hackers can do everything so easily but no strong wall can be built against these hackers till now. Those who found out at the time that it was a scheme were protected from the attack of hackers, but those who found out later had their assets easily stolen by hackers. I think the only solution is to not participate in any of the activities of these wallets after holding your assets.",
