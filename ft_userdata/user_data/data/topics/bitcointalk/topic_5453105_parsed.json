  "content": "The project name is: qrpaperThe github link is: https://qrpaper.github.ioThe twitter link is: https://twitter.com/qrpaper_satsThe discord link is: https://discord.gg/3MjNRBhuRvbitcoin whitepaper will start inscribe from 2024/1/3 18:15:05 UTC (#BitcoinFirstBlock 15th 15th 15th years)## SloganSalute to Satoshi, every blockchain project should mint their white paper on Bitcoin.## ForewordThere is only 600 segment NFT, I want it can be hold by the most core Bitcoin users to enhance the consensus of Bitcoin, it's all free for mint. Follow the twitter and join our discord to get White List. Bitcointalk users is priority to get.## SignificanceAs the earliest blockchain, Bitcoin's value mainly comes from consensus, but it is also constantly facing challenges from other public chains. In order to consolidate the value of Bitcoin, we put forward the slogan \"Salute to Satoshi, every blockchain project should mint their white paper on Bitcoin\", which is not only conducive to continuously strengthening the consensus of Bitcoin, but also It is beneficial for new projects to be understood and accepted by Bitcoin users.## Introductionqrpaper converts the white paper into a plain text markdown format, and after splitting it into sentences, encodes each sentence into a QR code, signs it and mints it on Bitcoin with Ordinals Protocol for permanent storage.the theory image is here:https://github.com/qrpaper/qrpaper/raw/master/docs/img/qrpaper_theory.jpgthe example image is here:https://github.com/qrpaper/qrpaper/raw/master/docs/img/first_441.png## Why bitcoin1. Bitcoin is the first blockchain, it is the chain with the highest degree of consensus and the highest security2. Bitcoin ordinals protocol, storing all of the NFT data on the blockchain, it would not be lost forever3. Bitcoin has the largest TVL, minting your project white paper on Bitcoin is very memorable and advantageous ## Why qrpaper1. qrpaper is the first project who helps users mint their white paper on Bitcoin use ordinals protocol2. qrpaper optimized the NFT image generation technology, compressed the data size to the limit, it greatly reduced the mint gas3. qrpaper use qrpaper.sats domain to sign every NFT to ensure no one can fake it4. qrpaper split and visualized the white paper to qrcode, which has a beautiful style, it is easy to spread5. qrpaper is governed by community through qp-dao, it's a decentralized project## qp-daonext, we will start the qp-dao, everyone who holds the NFT of the three core qrpaper(bitcoin, ethereum and qrpaper) will have the right to join. And you will have the benifits like airdrop, whitelist, vote and so on.",

Loot project has fixed fieled and the format is uniform, so it looks not confusion.I have desiged a QR code, which embeded the big bitcoin logo into it, it looks harmonious, and every QR code has an serial number in the foot of it.The example and project details can be found here https://qrpaper.github.io/",

Yes, it's a good ideal, but there is mainly three reason, which cause me to split it into sentence:1. mint the whole whitepaper by one person is too expensive2. hold by many person may more easy to build Consensus3. every one hold the only one unique sentence may interesting, make people have chance to communicate, which is good for build Consensus community.",
