I heard you can dual mine this coin and the source said it makes more sense than other dual mining coins we know before can anyone confirm this.Worth depends on you electric bill. RTX 3070 do 61mh on ETH and use 120w - dualmining adds 40 - 50w and 305mh on kaspa = 300mh give you at the moment 150 kaspa - difficulty is exploding so it will be less in the next time - calculator say i must get around 300kaspa, but the reality say 150.You also need bigger PSU´sKaspa can give some extra cash, or you hold it - it rised much in the last days - but this is a gamble.You can also dual mining eth/etc/ubiq with heavyhash or now with Radiant (sha512-256D)",

In closed cases, there will be fewer problems, but you will have to increase the speed of the case fans. In open cases in the summer, I do not use the dual mode, because the video cards overheat. Try this mode on one mining farm to see your temperatures.",

I will like to give this a shot right now.",

If you use lower core frequency settings, then the mining hashrate will be small, but there will be no overheating of the video card.But if you increase the core frequency, then the consumption increases and the video card overheats more.RX6900XT consumes about 150 watts in ethereum mining, and already 230 watts in dual mining",

      "body": "Kaspa on Rust - First Stable ReleaseWe are excited to announce the first stable Rusty Kaspa (RK) node Release (version 0.14.1).This is a significant milestone for the Kaspa network, as it marks the point where we shift to a new improved and optimized engine, which can now be built upon and accelerated to its limits.Approx. 2 years ago, when I first proposed the Rust Rewrite, I dreamed of unleashed performance and superb code quality. Today I can say that the new codebase is of highest quality possible, and that the set of individuals contributing to it is now an elite group of people, forming a decentralized and world-spread core development force.https://medium.com/@michaelsuttonil/kaspa-on-rust-first-stable-release-636938596441",
