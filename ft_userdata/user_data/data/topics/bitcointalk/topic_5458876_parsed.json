  "content": "Robert Helenius is officially now the new opponent of Anthony Joshua this weekend. The 39-year-old Helenius just won a fight a few days ago in his native Finland. That was his return bout after losing a first-round knockout against Deontay Wilder. A rematch is coming between former unified champion Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte this coming August 12 at the O2 Arena in the UK. Both fighters are rebuilding but the winner might get an eliminator or even a title shot. Whyte was KO'd by Tyson Fury last year for the WBC belt while AJ has a back-to-back defeat at the hands of unified champion Oleksandr Usyk.    AJ will remain a favorite in this fight but we better not count out Whyte. AJ is a completely changed fighter which is something Whyte can capitalize on. If AJ continues to try to box, not letting his hands go and Whyte is well-conditioned conditioned for a full fight then it will be a very exciting one. AJ might also get his confidence back knowing he already TKO'd Whyte when both of them are still unbeaten.",

They are worth watching but people are probably right as well about not worth PPV. Fans are cruel. After a few losses, fans will just look at them as just big blokes. Looks like an exhibition fight but they are reviving the old quarrel between the two, while there are no other boxers stepping up after all they did not retire yet. AJmight still win for the second time. It's just nothing else after that unless Usyk will still give him another fight.  It will not be surprising if both announce their retirement after the fight.",

After that, he get's tired easy and that's where Joshua can get him and maybe score a knockout. Very wise move by Eddie Hearn here. So let's see if Whyte will be a willing participant here or he will just spoil Joshua and his future fight with Wilder.",

But AJ should be careful as well not to overlook Whyte here, I think he still possesses that one punch knockout and AJ should try to avoid that right hand of Whyte otherwise he might see flashes of Ruiz fight again and then he will just be knockout or knockdown in the canvass.But I still see AJ winning here, either by decision if the fight goes on the full 12 rounds and AJ having a hard time to knock Whyte out. Or AJ finding his rhythm and power once again and scoring a big KO.",

Yup, Anthony Joshua would still be the favorite here, the only thing that we have to discuss here is whether Whyte would survive the full twelve rounds as he was KOed by Joshua on their first meeting.The thing here is that Joshua beat Whyte when the former was not beaten yet, I mean his confidence was still very high at that time but for me, at the present moment, it seems that Joshua's confidence is fading after that loss to Ruiz, that makes this fight interesting. Hearn wants to test Joshua before giving him a fight with Wilder.",

He needs to make a statement to prove he can still compete with the best heavyweights.Yes, they are looking for a good dance partner for Anthony Joshua, and just like you said, instead of directly going to Wilder in December, he might as well go for a tune up first. Just like what Ryan has supposed to do before the Tank fight, but he opted out of a tune up and then badly beaten. I think Wilder though will go to Andy Ruiz if I'm not mistaken.Anyhow, I think it might end the same way as the first fight. And then Joshua very happy as he might think that he is back on track. But I think the Bronze Bomber will knockout Anthony Joshua if they face each other in the Middle East before the end of the year.",

Anthony Joshua is the character, he's a competitive fighter who is constantly concerned about winning, but with his recent performance, he's recorded defeats over his opponents, so I'm guessing he still needs more time to get back on track. Dilian Whyte, on the other hand, is always ready to meet the Nigerian in the ring, and this time I believe he can match up draw points with him.",
