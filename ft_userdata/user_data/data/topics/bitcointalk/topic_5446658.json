This went smoothly. but to my shock there was one more transaction created along with this transaction with BTC 1.06 going to another address.Do you mean there's another address in the same transaction or a completely new transaction with another ID?If the former, then it's probably a change address that also belongs to your wallet. It's nothing to be worried about.",

However, given the discrepancy between the amount shown on the blockchain and the amount shown in your Trezor wallet. Have you contacted Trezor support and reported the problem. I think They may be able to help you recover your funds or provide guidance on how to proceed.",

      "body": "Thanks mate.Actually first i transferred 0.03 to my exchange address which was successful. but it also created one more transfer within same transaction of BTC 1.06 to another address.now my address in trezor, when checked in blockchain explorer showed 1.06 btc less so i got worried. but when i checked my trezor balance then i had full amount there.now to check again i tried to exchange 0.01 btc to eth within trezor itself. now again two transfers were created one with 0.01 and another with 1.06 btc.i have got eth in my trezor and the btc balance is also showing correct in trezor but that first address where i had all btcs now showing 2 btc less in blockchain explorer.but in trezor everything is showing as correct.i am sure this is something about changing address as my friend omega mentioned above.",

      "body": "Yes this is called the change adress and is how Bitcoin works. With your Trezor you are also in control of all the change addresses so there is no issue. If you want to send bitcoins again you will see the same happening again. If you look at mempool you will see that this is the same for all transactions",
