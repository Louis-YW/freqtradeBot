  "content": "It's really very necessary to know by our relatives about Bitcoin because I believe that we all know about Bitcoin and it's usecases. So it's our duty to teach about Cryptocurrencies specially Bitcoin so that they can also use it and be a part of this Digital Currency. In this purpose Today I have shared with some of my close departmental Friend's about Bitcoin and the benefits of it. I have tried as much as I can because I think they should be familiar with this gem and the future of currency system. I have shared some points about Bitcoin. They are :1. Bitcoin Is Decentralized: I have shared with them that is is a decentralized cryptocurrency which is transferred from Peer to Peer. There is no middle man in Bitcoin transection and it's fully Safe. If you use non custodial wallet then your funds have no access without you.2. Anonymous Transection:  Every Bitcoin transection are normally fast and anonymous. It's very secured also. No need to submit personal or sensitive details at all. It has a limited supply which is 21 Million only. So day by day it's price and demand will increase because no new Bitcoin can be created.3. Can Gain Huge Returs : I have also shared that you can make huge profits by buying and holding it. But you have to buy when it's price is cheap and it's very easy to use. You just need to have an internet connection only which may be a limitations too. I also told about it's volatility but assured them if you buy at cheap at the end of the day you will win surely.I tried to teach them the trust about Bitcoin and they are really excited to learn more and some of them promised me that soon they will be a part of this Digital Currency though the amount is low. I just welcomed them and I am also trying to teach about Bitcoin with my family soon.I think we should teach our friends families and neighbors about the Cryptocurrencies specially Bitcoin. So that they can use it and be an early adopter.Edit: I told them that the total Bitcoin is only 21 Million and no Bitcoin can be created so the total Bitcoin is limited. So day by day people are involving and filling their bags and also because of its usecases day by day the demand of Btc will increase. And also told that will be more beneficial financially if they can inter in the market at right time. They also agreed with me.",

Beside them I also told them that day by day there is a huge chance that the price will pump more as Bitcoin is limited and users are adopting massively so if they buy now they may have an additional profits also.

      "body": "Brief them about how it is advantageous against the fiat we use around, because people find it easy to understand when explained with the real time usability. Because very few are good with technical understanding, also it is good to show them the chart and brief them about the way price have grown over time. When we assure of high returns, at times it'll disappoint.We should not try to educate people about bitcoin in little conversation. Give some basics and let them explore. It'll give better understanding than we ourselves briefing. Anyhow it is really nice initiative to educate people about bitcoin.",

      "body": "It's great that you have an interest in educating others about Bitcoin. However, it's crucial to approach it in a responsible manner. Instead of trying to persuade them to invest, focus on providing a comprehensive understanding of various aspects related to Bitcoin. Cover topics such as wallets, price fluctuations, volatility, risks, and potential profits. By doing so, you empower them to make informed decisions about what they should do.In your explanations, draw from your own experiences to provide valuable lessons. Share your past encounters with Bitcoin, highlighting both successes and challenges. This will enable them to learn from your experiences and gain a broader perspective on how Bitcoin operates.It's essential to emphasize that investing in Bitcoin carries risks, including potential downtrends in the market. By educating them about the intricacies of Bitcoin, you equip them with the knowledge necessary to navigate the market themselves. This proactive approach ensures that they won't solely rely on you and avoids potential blame if they encounter losses later on.Remember, the goal is to provide them with a balanced understanding of Bitcoin, enabling them to make well-informed decisions based on their own assessments.",

Please don't do this.This is where people are getting rekt because of the thinking that they'll be making a lot of money in Bitcoin without experiencing something isn't nice.

Yes good a thing you shared it with your friend so what you want an award from us for actually introducing your friends to Bitcoin, all the gains is their the fulfilment that you have gotten by actually doing the right thing for your friend should be a big reward for you.I believe we would be seeing more post like this because it's becoming the trend. It's not becoming genuine.I think post like this should be about I introduced my friends to crypto-currency and #they are experiencing this difficulty ........# I was asked a technical question by them and I could not answer it.And many other feed backs you get from them that you can personally tackle then it would be more presentable and organic.",

You need to tell them that even with self custodian one’s keys the coin can be lost. This is could be when you do not store your keys properly. Scammers could get through your keys if you store them on your device and it becomes comprised either through phishing or other malware attacks. As for those offline devices it could be lost if not safe in a place where people cannot access it and you also could remember. It could also be lost if the keys are written on materials that are easily prone to damages. You should advise them on having a proper backup for it in case of emergency. Quote3.

I also told about it's volatility but assured them if you buy at cheap at the end of the day you will win surely.The right word to use is buying low because bitcoin isn’t that cheap again and it’s almost near impossible now tht it could fall down cheap. Although it’s also advice to buy low it is very important not to wait till for that perfect time. You should just buy anytime there’s fund to invest by using the DCA method as this will reduce the risk of losing",

Always state the pros and cons not only the positive side, it should be balanced and understand the possible risk.It's not advisable to only tell the positive side of Bitcoin without addressing the associated risks, there should be transparency and providing a balanced view which is considered critical when introducing someone to Bitcoin.  By discussing both the benefits and risks, you give knowledge to the individual to make a good decision based on a comprehensive understanding of how Bitcoin will work. Because IMO, failing to mention the risks can create unrealistic expectations and may have a failure in investment decisions.  It's always important to ensure that they understand the potential downsides and challenges involved in adopting and investing in Bitcoin.",

We are easily driven by the concept of money and making profit. But there's a downsdie with this keypoint; high hopes. You may be able to encourage someone to invest in this technology but since they are more likely to have high expectations of returns, they'd be easily discouraged once a crash happen as part of its market price volatility. It is indeed true that this industry has huge profit potential but problem is risk management. Again, you would be able to encourage someone because of possible profit but how would you make him/her stay? Not to mention the possibility of you being blamed for his/her possible losses.",

Not everyone likes crypto or Bitcoin, and it has not been fully accepted everywhere.

Their interest in things like cryptoIf Bitcoin or crypto is illegal in your country, it is better to keep any information about Bitcoin. Never think to share it with anyone in this situation. You will endanger yourself and others if you share it carelessly. But if Bitcoin is legal in your country, you are free to share it with anyone as long as they are interested in it.
