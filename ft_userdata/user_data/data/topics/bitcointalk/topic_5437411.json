  "content": "One of the biggest difficults in life is to manage growing your patrimony and income, when earning minimum wage and living in poor areas where opportunities are scarce, as is the money circulating in the local economy. Some hints that could be useful:Get rid of addictions/habits: addictions or habits (in mild cases) are harmful not only for your health, but also for your finances. Cigarettes and alcohol are responsible for consuming a large portion of the income from individuals living on minimum wage. It's not that unsual to find people spending at least 1$ on cigarettes daily, what after 1 month will result in 30$ expenses, which could be going into bitcoin investment, for an example.Choose carefully where you go shopping: some supermarkets are more expensive than others. Shopping on physical stores is more expensive than shopping online. Don't go for the first price you see on the labels. Search for promotions, try to adequate your demand for products to your currently financial budget in a way you don't spend all your money in the end of the month.The impression which matters is the one you have about yourself: forget about boasting yourself to friends and suitors around. Live a realistic life and don't pretend to have a superior lifestyle in order to make people's eyes shine in front of you. There is nothing wrong in displaying some style, it's actually pretty good and satisfactory, but only when we can really afford it.Doesn't matter how depressing is your day, never give up: everyone has their depressing days, but these days can't become a rule in someone's life. Don't feel pitty of yourself, don't blame your life and your currently conditions. Think it's just temporary and that an exit from this situation is reachable with good will, effort, hard work and a positive attitude with people around you.

They do not even bother to count how much money they spend on beer or cigarettes, by the way.I recall certain case of this man who used to smoke so much that if he stopped smoking for a day he started to feel sick, flu-like symptoms.",

I'm not sure if this is wrong, but I find it costing you big by the end of the week since you'll be spending 1 dollar per day until you win, but what if you don't win? You lose money, right?

Cigarette, alcohol, and even little gambling habit. Don't be a picky eater, if it's healthy take it, even though they are cheap. The other problem with low income employees is how they spend their money with food. They are getting pulled by co-workers to dine at a prestigious restaurant even though it's out of their budget. There are small food places that can offer the same service and taste and yet they are cheap, it's just the ambience which is different. Well, the ambience doesn't make your tummy full.",

And generally the crime rate is higher in that area, so don't think anyone to look rich than others.",

They started a seed company, did communal gardening, sold their produce at local markets. Tried other approaches. Apparently none of that worked and it took two decades to generate profits, which proves how difficult it can be to generate income as a producer without the benefits of a strong consumer market.That said, I think there are often angles or opportunities, even in poor neighborhoods where people lack access to raw materials, equipment and resources. It is difficult to identify and recognize them when we see them. But they are definitely present. Everyone wants to get ahead and do better. Most of us simply do not know where to start, or how to get there. In that sense I think identifying opportunities is important. Having good information and guidance is also important. Most of the information offered as advice trends towards being generic and diluted. Even in poor neighborhoods with weak consumer markets there are always opportunities. They simply happen to be things that no one wants to do. Or they break with routine in a way which people find uncomfortable.Developing a new skill set can also be a big part of it. Making the most of opportunities often requires learning new skills which one currently lacks.",
