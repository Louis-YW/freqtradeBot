On the second note,  the ability to right predict the possible outcome of a market is uncertain sometimes,  but still we have a few of those projects that say what they mean and mean what they say,  but projects at that level are rare and can not easily be discovered with just our ordinary inquiry but you must have to hard long time of follow up on them to be able to choose rightly.",

      "body": "At first glance these seem like some generic advices for a company as most of them have nothing to do with crypto space. Lets unpack some of these:Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM1] Your skills are precious enough to be a monthly charge I mean what does this even mean? In what scenario this applies to DeFi? Sounds like you want to work in the company that respects you for your skills and pays you monthly salary?But if you made that company, aren't you responsible to cover that?Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM2] You don't need the clients, They need you moreThis is just not true. Uniswap needs customers as much customers needs uniswap. Users fuel it, while uniswap provides the infrastructure for the actions users want to do.Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM3] charge highly, Deliver betterI have no idea what you would be delivering that would mean. If the tech is more expensive to use, then i get charging more, but if you want to charge more just by your profit, i think you are in the wrong business.Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM4] Any skill can be monetized - so far it has generated profit for you.I don't have a clue what this means in this context. If i am reading it correctly it's more like a statement of getting profit from a skill?Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM5) if you are looking for your first client, you already found one, me and youWhat does this even mean?Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM6) Testimonials help you sell better and faster - get yourself result firstEvery time i see testemonials in the web page from random people, i am thinking it's 100% scamQuote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM7) Don't ever sell your services -anybody can sell services, but not everybody can sell profits vSell profits? Are we lost in translation here? People sell their startups all the time. I mean would you fight against big players like google or get aquired by them and invest that to your next project?Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM Always share your TestimonialsYou already mentioned testimonials,Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM9) Brag humbly - it brings more client and increases your authority in that niche Doesn't really work on this space. Bold marketing, and down to earth meme-like marketing that doesn't take itself seriously works better then toning the attitude down imho.Quote from: baby2020 on October 26, 2023, 07:37:09 PM10) Partner with other agencies to increase leverage Why not partner only that serves an actual purpose? Not sure what you mean by leverage here.",

Back in those days when most projects are trusted and stands on their words even there are most of them that comes to launch without running an ICO, IDO and IEO yet they are successfully launched in exchange with good prices then but what they mostly do is that they just involved themselves with an airdrops after which they share to applicants and they sells out with a good prices. Then we can say of believing in their words but not now whereby people has turned the cryptocurrency space to a scamming industry were anyone would just come to scam people with fake promises and after their target are being met the close and fold down, same thing are applicable with some cryptocurrency exchange. The most important thing is that when a new project is launching we should be very mindful in times of putting our resources as an earlier investor because most at times those who often comes as an earlier investors are the people who always falls victims of being scammed.",

I think a defi developer or manager is what he meant for this. I thought how defi business works or the platform that offer defi products are what Im gonna read. Isnt this an advice for anyone who wanted to do a defi related remote job or finding a business partner in the crypto industry?",

Be that as it may,  we can't deny the recent flooding of the market by fake projects that have drained out investors and most of the projects in that category are where you see a project just popping up and making several promises without any workable user case for the investors to rely on as a liquidity for the project,  this is why we have seen a lot of the pumped and dumped coins that we have around in the market today.",

Anyway, some of the advice can be good, if applied though one can be confused on the things OP is referring to. Surely, this does not concern DeFi at all and I am speculating this is more of freelancing and self-development.",

This makes them speculative. We only need to make our research properly before doing an action so that we can minimize the errors as much as possible and be more successful on this venture.
