Doing the right thing at the wrong time. I was thinking they would swing into action as earlier when the heat was on by starting with the banks selling the naira note to the POS vendors. Week's ago Nigerians were under pressure and sufferings just to get naira notes which were removed in circulation. Banks and pos took advantage of the whole process as a good lucrative business by trading with the naira for naira at exhorbitant rate extorting and exploiting innocent citizens of the country. The efcc should have swinged into action then not now. They are just attention seekers who does not know or have clues on what to do at the right time.",

Shall how una see the development, e good as EFCC dey go after this POS businesses or you dey feel say na another misplaced priority? For me, I see this as another misplaced priority, because the people who were supposed to be arrested are those bank managers who sold the money to P.O.S agents rather than loading it on ATM, making it accessible to customers. Because in as much as these P.O.S agents did charge exorbitant price due to cash scarcity, they did actually play a bigger role helping the poor masses access cash when our banks failed us all with no cash and even poor networks for internet transfer.So in conclusion, I will love to say that this whole issue of money palava can be resolve by only two people in this country, namely \"the president & CBN governor, of which that has had no business to do with stopping other banks from operating p.o.s agent",

I support EFCC, this will make the news spread much faster because if they go about arresting or closing banks first, The bank will try not to let the public known about it (No organisation will want to damage their image) but  in the case of the pos vendors, Citizens are seeing them and will continue to report them till they change from their high rate.There will also be fear in any bank Managers and pos vendors heart, both parties will not think of buying money. Aside from buying from the bank, Pos vendors do buy money from traders and so this is the best way to stop their over high rate",

If dem finish from that state make them enter another state because this people just dey rip us out of our hard earned money. The problem come be say their mouth dey together always and you can’t get it at a cheaper rate in another place. Na we naija citizens still dey do ourselves even when government wan help us. . But wait oh, the POS people no force you to withdraw with them na, you for baff early morning leave everything we you supposed do for your house, carry yourself go bank go stand for queue to withdraw only 5k abi dem dun increase the limit self. This POS people dem they provide a service and to get that service you need pay na, I fit believe say some of them they buy the money from this bankers self or give bribe to get slots to get the money so no blame them, blame the banks for being too greedy. Also this POS people understand say there is more demand than supply as such they can take advantage of the situation to make some profits for themselves, I no blame them for taking the advantages as majority of us for do the same if in the same situation, most not be pos business but if we get the opportunity wey them get, now our own go worst. My only anger na say majority of them over do the thing which wasn't nice. If them been dey charge #1 per #1k e for dey alright and we go understand say money dun scars. But this #300-500 hundred per #1k  na where dem no try but sha thank God funds dun dey come out small small. Soon I believe everywhere go dey alright.",

Na good development say EFCC arrest these POS vendors because those people no get conscience. We no say them been dey buy the money from banks but the rate wey dem been the charge just dey too much, na over profit dey worry dem. Now wey e don be like say the money don dey circulate small small, some of them still dey charge 100-200 per 5k transaction for my area, while others dey 300-500 per 5k transaction. So the question be say the operators wey dey charge lesser, how dem dey take get their own cash? I really dey in support of the arrest, make EFCC arrest the all the greedy POS vendors.",
