  "content": "Hi guys and ladies...Like we all know. or maybe some of us already know, Stake.com has this feature that allows a bettor to copy other user's bet, It doesn't matter and you don't actually have to know who owns the bet you are copying, what important is that if you copy another bettor's bet, and that bettor's bet wins, you win as well, amount you win you already know depends on the amount you stake, so also, if that bet losses, you loss as well.PROCEDURES Its easy,--Just tap the \"All Bets\" or \"High Rollers\" tab .Click any of the \"Events\" as they are being updated in real time, the bet slip will pop up for you to review..After reviewing and you like the game and would like to copy, just scroll down and click the \"Add _ Bets to my Bet Slip\", set the amount of money you wish to stake and place your bet.Now, the above tutorial is not my reason for making this post as i believe a greater number of us know this already, i just decided to to post the tutorial for users who might not know how to and wish to try the feature..My reason for this thread is actually me wanting to ask if copying bets from unknown bettors is a good practice ? I tried this one time and won actually, though the odd was pretty low and i staked a very small amount as well, but then, i tried it again the next day and lost, though not anything significant...So for you, is copying bets online a good practices? have you tried it and won before? would you try it when you really want to bet and have no idea where or what sports to bet on?LEts discuss.",

I don’t see it a good practice either. Copying does not guarantee profits, so for what reason you have to do that? Good thing if you know that bettor well and you know he has been winning in most of his bets, so might as well try your luck too. However, if you ask me that copying guarantee consistent profits, of course no. That is why you have to trust your own self if you bet, especially if you have a good knowledge on that certain game.",

The risk is the same whether you are making the bets yourself or copying from others, so in my humble opinion it is better to create your own bet with the odds you think are more favorable and then see what happens, because copying another persons bet does not mean you will win, you can also lose, so why not do it yourself.\"If you want something done well, do it yourself\", but if you have studied  a bettor and noticed their bets and pattern results in far more wins than losses, you can copy their bets on days you do not have time to study the odds, but doing it yourself is better than allowing another persons pick decide what happens to your money.",

Copying bet is good if you keep on winning, but if you’re like betting blindly and make you lose everytime, then you have to decide for your own bet and trust your self. While most bettors always think and analyze first, some just simply copying bet and lose eventually. The reason why I always think copying bet is never  a good practice, aside from you lose your self-confidence, you become dependent on others to chase your luck.",

      "body": "This seems to reinforce the lazy attitude of many gamblers who dont wish to do research and place bets on their gut feeling or emotions. Sports betting is an EV+ game and can be used to make good money unlike dice, but if done in the wrong manner, it can end up being a EV- game at any time, like this.Just because the site is offering an option does not mean it might be good for you, like the \"Max Bet\" option previously seen on Primedice (hidden by default now) - it was like YOLO option for frustrated gamblers.Reminds me of copy-trading to some extent. Some players may have found this option profitable but the basic remains same, this is betting down without doing research from our end, hence a risky step.",

Do not just copy blindly. At least you have the basic knowledge and can tell if the bet is good or not. Then you are can make a good decision if you copy or not. It is a good way to find some good bets you might miss if you are just betting on your own. You can just scroll through the bets and you might find events that you have missed that you can bet on. I hope you can know whose bet you are copying so the person can develop a reputation. Like if you know this person is good in NBA, then you can copy his NBA bets because you know he has a high chance of getting the bet right.",

I remember doing it once because I saw a user that shared his winning parlays and decided to follow him with a small bet after he posted his new parlay which ended up winning but that doesn't mean it's good. There's a lot of information available out there for us to use so it's better to take your time and decide than to just copy someone's bet.",

It is not a good practice to be honest! It's very similar to copy trade functionality that some forex and crypto brokers offer. But people hardly make money there. Gambling should never become a source of money because that's when it ruins your finances. As long as someone gambles for relaxing, that's fine because that's when your finances stay under control. Personally I would never recommend to try out your lick based on some third party. Gamble as per your knowledge rather than depending on someone else.",

I know and have  heard of cases where people copy bet slips from people that they know but hearing about people copying from unknown people sounds too desperate for me. I'll habe doubts and will not be comfortable staking my money on a bet slip that I got from someone who I have no personal relationship with and cannot attest to his ability to stake games correctly.",

In this case, copying a bet from an unknown bettor is wrong for me because in taking my selections I always cross-check each selection before adding each team to my list the bettor which I copied from may not have the time to make a certain analysis of the teams before adding to his list and this may affect the outcome of his winning but on the other hand, I have come across some people who has won big in gambling by copying the bets of unknown bettors so it all depends on the choice of the individual but I will always prefer to place my bets.",

Yeah mate, its a very nice option to have indeed, most especially for the purpose you mentioned about, its very good for people like me that don't know much about football and some other sports games but would like to bet and don't mind loosing the bet amount, like two times i tried it, i knew absolutely nothing about the game, I just copied the bet and staked 0.5 usdt, it went through and i won 3 usdt( if I still remember correctly), the second day, i did the same thing but this time choose a multi bet slip( about 10 games in one), i staked 0.5 usdt again to win over $10,000 usdt ( odd was pretty high), eight games went through but two didn't, that was how i lost it    , pretty close I must say, for a game I have absolutely no knowledge in.",
