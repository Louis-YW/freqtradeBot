Basically, the only other alternative would've been cash, but then you're dealing with physical security, which a lot of people can't afford. Bitcoin, you can secure you a reasonable degree, and it's fairly easy to do so, especially with the innovations with software as of recent. Still, we've probably got a long way to go before this important point/usage becomes more mainstream knowledge. As an alternative to fiat, sure. However, it probably isn't going to be as widespread as a lot of us first thought. There's likely to be too many stumbling blocks in the way, and I think the governments of the world will probably make it very difficult to achieve. Not impossible, but incredibly difficult I'd say. However, I don't think that was the intention of Bitcoin in the first place, and instead is achieving exactly what it set out to do, today.",

He did not also create it to compete with fiat money. But he created it to be an alternative to fiat. This Bitcoin has been serving the purpose. For store of value, a time will come when Bitcoin will be more stable in price. That is when there is massive adoption of bitcoin. Before that time we should always be careful on how much we invest. It is important to invest what you can forfiet .",

For Bitcoin to have a shot at becoming \"the future of money\", it must demonstrate resilience, it should be withstanding the FUD and not crashing by 20% over something that has no influence on the network and the protocol. People say that Bitcoin will become less volatile when it will be more adopted, but how can it get adopted when its so volatile?",

If you view Bitcoin from the price stability, I agree that Bitcoin seems hard to be the future money. But if you view Bitcoin from the simplicity or the effectiveness in transactions, Bitcoin has an advantage as the future money. It is also better in transparency, it is easy to track every time. So, how the potential of Bitcoin to be the future money, depends on how you view it. However, we cannot deny the fact that there are already many people using Bitcoin as a currency. Agree or not, Bitcoin is already a global currency.",

FIATS existance of value is locked to things like the laws of minimum wage and tax which keep fiat in power and circulation, yet the min wage price is not meeting the standard expectation of cost of living..where as bitcoins value is not its market price.. bitcoins value is a number set at the periodic LOW.value is at the low(a number underneath todays market rate) not the high(EG a ath number).the speculative market rate where it goes ATH every 2-4 years is not where value is. the ATH is the PREMIUM not the valuewhen the bitcoin price is near to the LOW its GREAT VALUE, when the market rate is high is far from value and a premiumemphasis:bitcoins store of value is not the market price. its a number that sits below market price. but its a non-zero numberbitcoins VALUE for 2020 was ~$4k for 2022 is about $15kthe market PRICE is not the value. but speculative amount above valuebitcoins store of value over time goes up because over the years the non-zero-bottom raisesbuying bitcoin at market rate is a premium above valueright now bitcoin is at great value to buy compared to buying at 2021 peakbut even so buying at 2021 peak would be in say 2-4 years time great value compared to the future value when the deflation raise of the non-zero-bottom moves up over years..emphasis. store of value is not about \"locking in price\"its not about buying bitcoin at $70k in 2021 and able to retrieve out $70k in 2022its about the VALUE of 2020 being $4k . the value of 2021 being $10k and the value of bitcoin 2022 being $15kand you able to sell coin and get your value out.buying bitcoin on markets does not lock in the market rate as value. the price is not valueyou pay premiums ontop of valuethis is why its always best to buy low. buy the dip., because then you are securing more of your wealth into store of valueEGimagine you hav $20k wealthbuying bitcoin in 2021 at $70k market price is ~1/7(15%) wealth lock because although the market ATH to $70k the value was $10kbuying bitcoin in 2022 at $20k market price is 3/4(75%) wealth lock, because although the market was at $20k the value was $15know imagine its 2017value was ~$900. but you bought in at the market year end of $20k. . at that precise moment your wealth lock store of value would have been under 5%.. yet due to deflation, waiting 5 years turned that 5% into 75%where as if you bought earlier in the year of 2017 at say $1k a coin. you would have had 20 coins and a 90% wealth lock store of value. which today in 2022 would be where your $20k buy is now worth $360k which is a 1800% store of value..bitcoins VALUE is never found at the ATH. the ATH is bad time to buy. back time to put your wealth into bitcoin. buying the dip is the great time to put your wealth in. its the best time to lock more of your wealth into bitcoin store of valueyet even when you do accidentality or stupidly buy bitcoin at a ATH. your not at complete loss. you just have to wait it out and have patience for bitcoins store of value non zero bottom to raise up because of deflation to reach your break even or profit point...summarybuying the high is (short term) where you should have doubt. you should not be excited or wanting to buy when the price is at a high. you should have doubts about locking in your wealth at a high if you are only wanting t be a short term holderbuying at the ow, the dip is when you should get excited and lock in more of your wealth. buy low, sell high.. not the oppositebuy the dip not the hypelong term however eventually even buying on a previous high will eventually lead with patience to you breaking even or profiting . IF YOU HAVE PATIENCEbut just remember to buy low to secure more of your wealth into store of value. and never consider the market price or its occasional highs as a 'vale' point.. the highs are not a point of value.. the lows are..buy into prices closer to the value not the premium",

Stability of market value is a must when it comes to a mode of payment to be used on a daily basis. If the value of the currency moves from time to time, what would happen to local markets then? They can indeed announce a fixed price but during highs, investors won't surely use their holdings to purchase a cabbage (just an example).",
