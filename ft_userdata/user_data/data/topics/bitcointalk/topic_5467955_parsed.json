Abeg make we suggest wetin this country or ihn government suppose do to  take control or stop the pending disaster. This disaster still dey pending and I believe this disaster is also part of poor economy/poverty in Nigeria Omo the matter be say, the only way we fit fight this flood matter, no to dredge our rivers, especially the ones way dey the River Niger and river Benue axis so that them fit accommodate more water if there is an overflow like flood for example.Another thing na to build dam's too, wey go fit absorb a large volume of water, so that if the flood come, them go channel the water to those dam's.Na the thing way me I see way government fit do to reduce the effect of the these reoccurring flood oh. But to talk say make we stop am, Omo we no go fit stop flooding outrightly, because na natural disaster e be, but we fit prepare against it, make the damage no plenty.Make we also tell our people them, to commot for low land areas way flood dey affect well well to a higher ground, so that them no go dey stranded after water don cover the area.",

Did pipo no build their dam or dey release the water wit the intent to punish Naija; rather them do wetin any country wey wan remove plenty water wey rain don heap for dem do. The Lagbo dam--as I believe nah wetin you dey refer to--- was built in 1982 and wetin we Naija govt for do nah to build we own wey go dey times two to take combat any incasity.  Federal govt sopoz build a dam for Adamawa State to take act as buffer but all of a sudden, Dem dump be the project for reasons best known to themand now, anytime wey Cameroon wan offload water, nah the masses dey suffer am becos even relief items no go still reach victims of the flood all say our leaders too greedy.QuoteMy country people, abeg make we chuck mouth for this matter, as a country and giant of Africa, wetin we suppose do to stop all this things cause as e be now, if the thing wan affect the neighborimg country I no go fit say the mata dey the hands of our leaders alone because we sef we get our role to play. Flooding fit occur on a smaller scale too. Some areas wey drainages holes dey, you go see say during raining period, pipo go dey throway dia refuse, which fit go block passage and before you no drainage don full dey cause problem. Then in the aspect of our government? Bros, for us to see change nah wen corruption and greed go leave them nai beta tin go happen because if you wan suggest ways way beta go happen, nah who wan implement am wey no go check if e go gain for inside.",
