Anyway, the project's name is Solv protocol and has up more than 25k Bitcoins staked on it since it's inception in 2021 and basically what it does is \"provide a flexible and yield-generating solution for Bitcoin holders.\" Still that's not the most amusing fact I found while reading about the project. It's that even with the 25k BTC the project has presently, it's no where close to Blackrock and some other ETFs, it's just mind-blowing. Anyway, the project is a pretty good read and has quite a bit interesting features and advantages, if anyone knows about the project tell me what you think about it. Tq https://x.com/SolvProtocol",

Tq https://x.com/SolvProtocolIf you're up to date with web3 community, you'll know Solv is on Binance megadrop thereby it could be a big shot. I'm also following up on this due to its utilities, some of which you've mentioned . It'llnalso be available on Bitget PoolX from 17th.  Poolx. If you didn't get into mega drop, this could be a good offer...",
