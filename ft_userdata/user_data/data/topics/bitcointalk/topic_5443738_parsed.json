  "content": "This one na our presidential election topic where we go dey torchlight different mata for we country. Everything we need to yarn about the just concluded presidential election na the right topic be this. No need to create another topic because if you create another topic, it would be considered as a spam. Having said that, I go like make we put mouth for this particular mata. The presidential election has come and gone with Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC emerging as the president elect. Before the election INEC assured Nigerians that BVAS was going to be used for the election but clearly did not use it in the collation of electoral results. The presidential results have been announced but at the time of writing this INEC is still uploading results on the portal.Here's a tweet posted by Dino Melaye.QuoteGovernor Wike's Obio Akpor LGA results in Rivers State on INEC Portal.LP: 70,186APC: 12,547INEC announced:APC: 80239LP: 3829Imagine this INEC magic.https://twitter.com/_dinomelaye/status/1632449899101921283?t=luLis6sV3sHh6IzIbC2MIwObio Akpor result on INEC's Irev portalThis is just one of many doctored results. During PO's campaign, he said something that caught my attention. He said he's the first person to unsit a sitting governor in Nigeria. We know that LP has hired 20 SANs to take up their matter in court concerning the presidential election. Do you guys really think PO can win this case? Please share your thoughts.",

Do you even know the criteria needed before new board can be created?",

I guess I had so much on my mind ðŸ˜ƒ I've effected the correction and has also taken your advice to center it on presidential election alone. Thanks",
