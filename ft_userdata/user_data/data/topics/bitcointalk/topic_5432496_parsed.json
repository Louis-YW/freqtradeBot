Biometric unlocking systems such as fingerprint scanners on your phone are based on comparing your scanned fingerprint to a registered fingerprint and making sure they are close enough to unlock your device. Close enough is not suitable for generating private keys. Even a single data point being off by the smallest measurable margin will produce a completely different private key.And even if you did manage to develop a system which can 100% reliably turn your fingerprint in to the same private key every time, then someone else can also do that and therefore utilize the inherent insecurity of biometrics to steal your coins. And of course a very minor injury or even just natural change over time would be enough to break the whole process.",

Btw, I added an edit to the post.Here is my input to your four points:A person's biometrics may change over time, resulting in a different key.Yes, unless the \"reduction process\" that you use to obtain that simple string from a huge amount of data, allows to actually obtain a constant string.In oher words, despite that the huge amount of data (human body or whatever) evolves, it is still immensly similar to what it was during the last measurement, and thanks to that, I think it could be possible to use a reduction (hasing is a reduction for instance) that spits out the same string. But that's what I wanted to learn about with this post. The measurements themselves are not precise enough to generate the same key each time.Same argument as previous point. The measurement is not perfect, but the amount of data gathered during the measurement is so immense that, with the right \"reduction process\", it would counter, from far, inaccuracies.Anything that takes the measurements gains access to the private key.That seems to be a common fear today, however, I did not mention fingerprints. And, even if we speak about this very narrow thing that fingerprints are, how often do people actually get robed their fingerprints to access their phones, bank accounts, etc...and steal everything with that fingerprint. I am not aware of such a global issue.. Anyway, it is an interesting topic too, but it is not the point of this post.The association of a person with their private key cannot be broken.You mean that this link is for life, and that's a problem, right? I think you have a point there and this is critical. But I also have a gut feeling that there is a solution to that. I would have to dig deeper though. But for now, you're right that's an obstable.

A hash function can reduce the size of the input to a much smaller output, sure, but even enormous inputs which differ by only a single data point will produce vastly different outputs.The only way I could imagine even approaching this would be via DNA sequencing, but even your DNA does not remain constant throughout your life. And of course you leave your DNA on everything that you touch, wear, drink from, breathe on, etc., making it very easy for an attacker to obtain a sample and reproduce your key.Quote from: Black_Sun on January 01, 2023, 04:13:33 PMAnd, even if we speak about this very narrow thing that fingerprints are, how often do people actually get robed their fingerprints to access their phones, bank accounts, etc...and steal everything with that fingerprint.It's not a case of how often does it happen, but rather, why would you use a private key which could be stolen by someone doing something as simple as lifting your fingerprint from something you touched.

I think you have a point there and this is critical. But I also have a gut feeling that there is a solution to that.The solution to that is you use the biometrics as the input to some function which you salt with a password or some other data, and so if the resulting key is compromised you can generate a new one with the same biometics by choosing a new salt. The obvious downside to that is that you have now reduced the security of your system to that of a brain wallet, which are the most insecure wallets in existence.",

Biometric identification is not new, it's used since many years in many serious areas and no big issues had been reported concerning that matter afaik. Moreover I don't think it would be very inconvenient to change your key/seed and your wallet every 10 or 15 years(biometric passports are usually valid for 10 years), it would even be a good thing for your crypto safety actually.But what is to care about here is the entropy(randomness) of the private keys generated this way IMO. Because if the entropy is too weak, hackers will be able to identify ranges of keys likely to be generated and used, and will be able to concentrate their computing power on them. The strength of BTC private keys is too be highly unpredictable and independent from each other.

Combinations do a better job as the chnacs of brute forcing it is slim but, when it comes to Face ID and Biometrics, they've got loopholes to which, someone could get your print as you go through your day to day life. Also, Face ID unlocks sometimes malfunction and someone with access to your device while sleeping could as well get access to your stuff.The private key is as safe as it is or could get.

All points of biometric collection you can think of.Let's say your base figures had a heavy degree of altercation 20 years later.The same individual now has permanent illness, missing a limb/thumb, no hair and altered DNA from time, lets toss in a radioactive event.How far has 20 years deviated your base samples? Could that percentage reproduce the same exact hash/key?In the end, is it possible to make a reproducible private key from biometric data?No. If you have one altercation weather its 1% or 1 × 10-99999999%, it will deviate the base biometric data resulting in a different hash/key.you could map data to key factors and do a conversion and probably get accurate enough to tell someone is the same person as 20 years ago with no issue.however, a consistent KEY approach wouldn't be valid I don't think a consistent hash function could be achieved at this point in time.",

Although this process is very accurate, it is not 100% accurate, and random mutations, swaps, insertions, deletions, etc., are happening constantly. These mutations often occur in genes which that cell doesn't use, or in non-coding parts of our DNA, or even in a gene it does use but it doesn't affect it significantly, and so on, meaning that the cell isn't faulty and so isn't removed by your body and the mutation lives on. If you took two different samples from the same person at the exact same time and sequenced their DNA, then they will not match 100%.Now, this doesn't matter for most of the things we use DNA sequencing for. Crime scene investigating, for example. If the DNA matches 99.99999%, then you can be certain it is the same person. The same for screening for genetic diseases, or tracking ancestry, or so on. But for generating private keys it's a far different story. If you don't match exactly (which you never will), then you will not generate the same private key.It is not a trivial problem to ensure that you can extract the exact same private key from different DNA samples from the same person. And if you figure out a way to do it, then an attacker can do the exact same thing with a few of your dead skin cells which you leave on everything you touch.",

When you register your fingerprint with a device, the device is pinpointing various minutiae on your fingerprint, such as where a ridge ends, or where a ridge splits in to two, or joins another ridge, or a small ridge island, and so on. It creates a map of those minutiae points, and stores that in memory. When you scan a fingerprint in the future, it compares the minutiae points to the ones on file and decides whether they are similar enough. Their orientation and the distance between them won't be exactly the same, due to the rotation of your finger, or the angle of your finger, or how hard you press, or how cold/warm your skin is, etc., but if they are close enough then you will get a match.Now consider trying to restore a private key from a fingerprint. The scan isn't exactly the same, because it never is, and so you generate a completely different private key. Perhaps it measured the distance between two minutiae points to be 49 microns, instead of 50. Or perhaps the angle between two points to be 24.4 degrees instead of 24.5. But with nothing to compare to, where do you go next? You have no way of knowing what part of the process is giving you a different reading, and even if you did, nothing you can realistically do to fix it. Do you just endlessly scan your finger over and over and over and hope that eventually you get an identical picture to the first time?",

When you register your fingerprint with a device, the device is pinpointing various minutiae on your fingerprint, such as where a ridge ends, or where a ridge splits in to two, or joins another ridge, or a small ridge island, and so on. It creates a map of those minutiae points, and stores that in memory. When you scan a fingerprint in the future, it compares the minutiae points to the ones on file and decides whether they are similar enough. Their orientation and the distance between them won't be exactly the same, due to the rotation of your finger, or the angle of your finger, or how hard you press, or how cold/warm your skin is, etc., but if they are close enough then you will get a match.Now consider trying to restore a private key from a fingerprint. The scan isn't exactly the same, because it never is, and so you generate a completely different private key. Perhaps it measured the distance between two minutiae points to be 49 microns, instead of 50. Or perhaps the angle between two points to be 24.4 degrees instead of 24.5. But with nothing to compare to, where do you go next? You have no way of knowing what part of the process is giving you a different reading, and even if you did, nothing you can realistically do to fix it. Do you just endlessly scan your finger over and over and over and hope that eventually you get an identical picture to the first time?May I ask you if it's just your own opinion based on your knowledge or something you have read in reliable sources because I guess you are not a specialist of the matter and your knowledge on the topic is limited as mine. So I think it would be better to provide some sources supporting those conclusions.

My statements regarding turning fingerprints in to private keys are hypothetical since (to my knowledge) this has never actually been done.Quote from: Saint-loup on January 08, 2023, 08:54:02 PMFrom what I see in those articles some methods seem to already exist to encode fingerprints actually.A Method to Encode the Fingerprint Minutiae Using QR Code https://www.iasj.net/iasj/download/6a869cbba3b0f35dA Bar Code Design and Encoding for Fingerprints https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017313005719How to Encode a Secret Message in a Fingerprint https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-to-encode-a-secret-message-into-a-fingerprintAs I explained in my post which you quoted, it is not an issue with encoding the fingerprint, but rather an issue with reliably reproducing the same result every time.The first link you gave is simply a method for turning a fingerprint in to a QR code. Irrelevant to this issue of reliability.The last link you gave is simply a method of generating artificial fingerprints with a hidden message. Irrelevant to the issue of turning real fingerprints in to private keys.The middle link includes the following statement:QuoteTherefore, a very important phase is noise removal for this proposed barcoding system, as even a small amount of noise can make the ridge structure different, affecting the whole barcoding systemWhich confirms what I have said above. If the image of your scanned fingerprint is slightly different, because of noise, angle, pressure, warmth, moisture, ambient lighting, dust, skin aging, damage, scars, whatever, then the whole system falls apart and you will generate a different private key (or in this case, barcode) to the one you generated before.You can easily set up a system to turn a fingerprint in to a private key. The problem comes when you want to restore that private and cannot reproduce it from your fingerprint because of the above issues.",
