I didn't expect they will not sell without a pk/stickeI responded to Steeley they initially wouldn't be included before he even bid so *shrugs*. So even after including them for everyone to make it *fair*. ..Quote from: QuakerBull on November 05, 2022, 11:32:42 AMThanks for the update, but unfortunately I won't be able to participate in your auction since progressing on another big deal that is going on right now. I've received the buyer's response only today. So I will take off my participation. I usually don't do that like never but this time it's different. So I'm asking you to remove me from your list. Im sorry for the bother & apologize if causing any delay to your auction. Good luck!QB.Moral of the story: please don't bid on this if you don't got the scratch, especially on a one day auction.",

With the posted pictures I assumed the stickers and PK were included. In fact, they were why I was excited to buy multiple of these. I see Cas 5s for sale a lot but not the whole package. Anyway, I would like to retract my bid for four coins and decrease it to 2. I trust the forum to let me know if this is out of line, but I feel this is ok on my part due to the confusion of what was actually being sold. Steeley",
