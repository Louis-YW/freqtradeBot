However, this is not about BTC itself, but about the fact that salaries can be paid in all cryptocurrencies, and if someone chooses the stablecoins option, then he does not have to worry about volatility.",

Since Ecowatt which is a well-pronounced company in Dubai has adopted this method of payment. It will be accepted by others gradually since some people are ready to accept it as a means of payment.However, the information I got from x was that the Dubai court validated the use of cryptocurrency for payment. Based on the fact that a worker sued his company for refusing to pay the promised cryptocurrency based on the fact that it was not a legal payment method. The court decided that the money should be paid in cryptocurrency and not fiat and at the same time it was made legal to accept cryptocurrency as payment in case there are other cases similar to this.",

The truth is that the fact that a global economic city like Dubai recognizes cryptocurrency as a viable method of salary payment means that yet another phase in the evolution of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies may be looming large. It will be quite insightful to observe and note just how this new development and decision is going to shape the rest of the countries and industries to mimic. The potential for more widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency by average users is quite enormous, and this decision made by the Dubai Court can actually be considered as great progress towards achieving that.",

Because a country like Dubai that is still quite happy to make changes and create new things that have not been made by other countries, of course it will not be so surprising when Dubai wants to make such a step now even though previously there was a rejection that perhaps the authorities there had not researched it further at that time.But for now, it has come true again because maybe the State Court has seen Bitcoin as something logical to be accepted and legalized to pay the salaries of its own country's employees even though their own country's currency still has a pretty good value at the moment. But what we need to see is Dubai is willing to accept Bitcoin and make such a move so that it could be that the move can influence other countries that are also close to Dubai to make almost the same move.",

This is especially true for those who are new to cryptocurrency. If receiving salaries in Bitcoin is optional, not mandatory, it will be a step in the right direction.Just like many companies or stores already accept bitcoin payments, but what we need to care more about is how many people are willing to use bitcoin as a payment method. Because most people are interested in bitcoin for its profits, there are very few people who are interested in its actual use cases and even they think that using bitcoin for payment is a waste. Or even we are strong proponents of bitcoin, but how many of us are willing to use bitcoin as a means of payment on a daily basis? I guess receiving a bitcoin salary would be an option, if that were the only method there would be strong opposition. Bitcoin's volatility is great for our investments, but it's not so good if we use it as a currency or a store of value.",

It was only made clear that the said EcoWatt is now recognised and could be used as salary payment in the company as agreed, as long as it's acceptable by both the employer and the employee.This news is born out of the court judgment that ruled that an employer should pay its ex-employee the EcoWatt tokens that were included in the contract as part of his salary. The employer didn't want to pay the employee because they claimed that payment in crypto is not legally enforceable in the country. This landmark ruling has paved the way for the paying and acceptance of cryptocurrencies' wages or salaries. OP might be assuming that this judgment might lead to public acceptance of cryptos.

Even the case that led to this law was about paying salaries both fiat and a token called EcoWatt. Based on the contract, the worker was meant to receive a salary in fiat alongside 5,250 EcoWatt tokens. So, I think accepting crypto as salaries will be optional.",

I think this basic knowledge will go a long way. While payment are done just as signature campaigns on this forum are done (i.e to have a specified amount like $100 or $150) which will be paid monthly in Bitcoin according to the current rate of executing transaction.",
