  "content": "Hey All,New here.  So I have a wallet with Zengo. I chose them due to the fact that they are mainly anonymous and don't require you to link your bank account. I have some money in the wallet which I would now like to get out.  An options they have for me is to exchange the BTC to a Stablecoin. I guess I would then send the Stablecoin to my coinbase wallet and from there, deposit it into my bank. but does that defeat the purpose of remaining anonymous? Once the stablecoin is acquired an sent to my coinbase account, does that create a trail back to me?  so i guess my question is any options to cash out from Zengo while remaining anonymous. Does anyone have any suggestions?  and also, does anyone have any other methods of receiving BTC anonymously with the ability to cash it out?  Please let me know. Thanks guys! Excited to be new to the community.",

      "body": "It depends on how \"anonymous\" you want, what I can say is you're not anonymous if you use Zengo since it's closed source and you didn't run full node. You're using someone else node that connected to your wallet.Choose better non custodial wallet and open source e.g. electrum, bluewallet etc, but the best is Bitcoin Core for anonymity. Don't forget to use open source OS too i.e. Linux, since Mac and Windows aren't good for privacy. Use Tor, avoid VPN.If you want to cash out without KYC, the best is using Bisq, or other exchanges like Robosats, PeachBitcoin etc, for other alternative you can check kycnot.meQuote from: https://cryptowallets.gg/review/zengoPros & ConsBefore we dive into the full review, lets get into the pros and cons of ZenGo.ProsSupports Bitcoin, Ethereum and EVM chains.Web3 enabled, so you can use DeFi applications, staking tools, NFT marketplaces and more.Mobile applications for iOS, Android.Completely free to use/download.ConsDoes not support the Cosmos ecosystem, the Polkadot ecosystem, Tron, Algorand.Does not have a standalone desktop application.Cannot be used as a browser extension.

It could be a blockchain.info web wallet and the procedure would remain largely the same.",

What are your feelings on it?   So according to what you say, Zengo is not the best for anonymity?  What would be my best bet?   So bisq is not a wallet itself? Just a platform to do peer2peer transaction?    if thats the case, what would be the best wallet to use to maintain anonymity? Should i get Tor browser & open a bitcoin core wallet?  Thanks,Dogtown",

As you said they serve as an intermediary for both parties involved in the exchange.Quote from: dogtowndistro on June 04, 2024, 08:24:28 AMif thats the case, what would be the best wallet to use to maintain anonymity? Should i get Tor browser & open a bitcoin core wallet?  Electrum is a great SPV wallet to use. You don't have to download the entire blockchain but you have full self custody. Bitcoin core is good to use if you have the requirements to download approximately 600gb of blockchain data and a decent RAM.Note that wallets give you pseudo-anonymity not actual anonymity. These wallets require no personal information so there's no link between your identity and your wallets. If you use Bitcoin core and run a node that will give you more privacy.",

Again, for someone who is aiming for complete anonymity this might be far from that person would want. They wouldn’t want to give out their address and any personnel to have access to it.QuoteObviously there are few risks from this method, either being a target of $5 wrench attack, you received fake cash, the mail disappeared etc.There’s also some risk of physical harm in an attempt to rob or just steal from you. Maybe that is why op is looking for ways to be completely anonymous but op let me say to you that in cryptocurrency you are never totally anonymous as there can be traces. The best you can do is to conceal your identity and try to lead the traces in different directions.",

I never heard about Zengo, but it looks like some closed source wallet and I would never use to to store any of my coins.Quote from: dogtowndistro on June 04, 2024, 06:34:33 AMI have some money in the wallet which I would now like to get out.  An options they have for me is to exchange the BTC to a Stablecoin. I would not do that because you will be stuck with stablecoin that you can't send anymore, until you have base currency like etherum, tron, or bsc coin. Quote from: dogtowndistro on June 04, 2024, 06:34:33 AMI guess I would then send the Stablecoin to my coinbase wallet and from there, deposit it into my bank. No need to send anything to Coinbase.Depending on your location you can find plenty of cash p2p deals using PeachBitcoin app or Biqs exchange.PeachBitcoin app is easy way if you prefer to use mobile devices, and Bisq is more complicated and suited for desktop users.Quote from: dogtowndistro on June 04, 2024, 06:34:33 AMdoes anyone have any other methods of receiving BTC anonymously with the ability to cash it out?It depends if you are using Bitcoin mainchain or Lightning network.Robosats and lnp2pbot are good options if you are using Lightning wallets to trade with cash.",

What are your feelings on it?   I have only used it sparingly, and not since several upgrades ago.I want to say I like it. I think it's really the way P2P should be, but it's not easy for the first-timer to even open and get connected to the software, let alone find someone available to trade. I've never been able to convince anyone to use it more than once! And myself, I've moved on to my own direct p2p with the same circle of people for years.So like Potato Chips says, learning curve...Quote from: dogtowndistro on June 04, 2024, 08:24:28 AMSo bisq is not a wallet itself? Just a platform to do peer2peer transaction?  Bisq is a standalone software, you'll need to install and run it. It will create a wallet for you to deposit your coins into (including fees and your security deposit). You will be able to retrieve all your keys to sweep out to your own wallet.P.S. Another option, depending on what currency you want, is to trade with someone on this forum (currency exchange subforum). Probably easier for the first time, but you'll bear all the risk (no escrow). If you go this route, choose an offer from a user with a high trust rating and long reputation of good feedback.",

Your government will surely know because they understand crypto transactions.But if BTC is legalized in your country, you can make use of binance app which is among the safe p2p exchanges platform, that will make your transaction successful with the coins you wanted to convert to BTC.If you are tired of hodling the zengo in your wallet and you want to convert it to BTC, i guess that is a good decision OP, but you don't need to be afraid of KYC which is for your own favor and it will make the transaction very clear for your satisfaction.",
