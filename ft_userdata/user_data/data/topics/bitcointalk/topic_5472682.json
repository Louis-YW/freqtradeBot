On the one hand because of the ETF hype, but on the other hand also because more and more people are becoming aware of Bitcoin and are realising that our economy is at the end and our monetary system is not working. We can see a giant rise of the price. Maybe this year or beginning next year",

I am sure that ETF news has played a big role in BTC price movements in recent weeks. If the Bitcoin ETF is still rejected or experiences a decision delay, I think BTC will experience a decline and go sideways.",

      "body": "A little over 2 weeks ago, Cointelegraph made a fake ETF announcement that moved the price of $25k to $30k briefly before a pullback that led to another high on the top side of $35K. Imo, the recent move can be attributed to that Cointelegraph tweet — at least now, everyone knew what would happen in the event of such development and starting buying in anticipation. Also, the halving is coming soon in T-minus 6 months and anything else right is nothing compared to what's coming.",

Guys share your thought which can be expected?Well, the analysis is different, and even before that, when Bitcoin was at $25000, everyone thought it would soon decrease, and now that it has increased to about $34000, people are expecting a different price. Although I also like the price increase, I am not here to observe the constant fluctuations of bitcoin. There are a number of reasons why I am more cautious at the current stage, when news easily creates large fluctuations. I remember in the previous cycle when bitcoin increased to $ 13000 after a long time in the bear market, everyone thought that it changed to bullrun status and then the price fell to about $ 4000. Maybe the current context is very different from the past. There are many, but I still have some personal opinions that there will be sharp declines in the near future.",

      "body": "Especially with the note we started this year somewhere between $15k and $16k, there were a lot of fuds and all those who used to comment like \"bitcoin to moon\" started posting articles like \"bitcoin is a bubble\", even that time I defended Bitcoin and said it wouldn't sustain a decade if it was a bubble like some of the NFT tokens and shit coins. Indeed it has been a good comback and I hope it continues at same pace and achieve new ATH. The best part about Bitcoin is that once it starts pumping all the other altcoin hodlings get converted to Bitcoin but one thing I am unable to understand yet is the fact that how come altcoins are having bullrun sort of price movement which Bitcoin has not going in direction of new ATH as the price is sort of struck around $35k because usually bitcoin bullrun triggers altcoin bull run.I don't think there would be any long-lasting negative impact it would have on Bitcoin even if SEC shows red flag to Bitcoin as it has crossed $30k even in the past without any support from SEC so we can ot narrow down ETF as the only reason for this pump I don't understand it has a role but not entirely. Bitcoin will prosper like it always does regardless of SEC's take on ETF.",

We can remember that there were applications for Bitcoin spot ETF coming from large financial institutions like BlackRock, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, ARK Invest, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and others. This was already bullish in a way. And then there was fake news spreading that BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETF application was approved by the SEC. It caused a quick rise. Then it was followed by the listing of BlackRock's IBTC on DTCC. It again caused further rise in the price. All these events which pushed the price up are related to Bitcoin spot ETF.",

We can't think of everyone of what these pumps indicates. But IMO, this is just the start since everyone is expecting that this is like just the beginning close to the halving. But if you feel that this is a trap, it's fine because it's unusual or should I say that you're not just used to the movements like those.Quote from: Wysi on November 03, 2023, 08:36:57 AMOn the other Hand The market is still waiting for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to give the green light to spot bitcoin ETFs, If the SEC delays or shows red signal to this ETF then I think there could be a massive drop as the market is always run according to the fundamental situation. Guys share your thought which can be expected?Prior to halving, yeah there can be some drops. But eventually, the recovery is there and I believe that the presence of halving is stronger than the rejection of ETFs.",
