At least we should say thanks to them because they did not write lorem ipsum dolor sit amet on their website. Anyways, there is no reason to trust these projects as they are not serious in their business and don't want to show their real team. It's better not to show any pictures instead of showing fake stock pictures as a team member. if you talk about ignoring the message, I do not see any reason for them to reply you unless they have any valid excuse. They are not here to build a reputation anyway.",

The result is that they get scammed off their hard earned income. Hence educating new investors about scams and how they operate is essential for them to survive in this sector.Also on of the reasons why I insist people to contact the person listed on team on Linkedin and check if they actually are involved and not that their image was used on the site without their permission.",

Btw, good catch! Quote from: coin-investor on October 06, 2023, 01:04:58 PMThey even use the picture of Elon Musk to make it appear that he has something to do with the projectTo be fair, they didn't claim that Elon is part of the team but instead that project is inspired by \"Elon Musk's youngest engineer\", hence the picture of Elon and that kid on the image.Quote from: coin-investor on October 06, 2023, 01:04:58 PMGood catch OP you've stopped this project from scamming investorsHe may have protected people on bitcointalk, but that makes just a tiny portion of altcoin market meaning many will fall for this scam nevertheless as I see KairanX will have sale on PinkSale (launchpad).",

Many may be familiar with these methods by now, but they use them to target beginners who are still new to the cryptocurrency field. They do this by posting stock images of well-known personalities or popular images in search engines, with the aim of attracting them to invest in their token project.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on October 06, 2023, 10:52:51 PMIs @1018367 aware of what he is promoting?

They are not here to build a reputation anyway. Once a project was caught using fake images as their developers, that's the end of their journey, all the projects that were caught tried to defend their project but nothing worked because a legit project will not post fake images, whitepaper, or roadmap.It's easy to catch fake and scam projects, they fake everything, they hire shills and they do pump and dump, if all investors just see this there will be fewer scam projects, and scammers are encouraged to launch fake projects because they are still getting investors to invest in their project.",

Before they share it, they should have confirmed it first before posting it since this affects everyone in the forum should a person invest in such project.",
