I believe the gold shield on the label implies authentication; however, as with all the grading houses, none are guaranteeing the load value.",

Tread93 here on BitcoinTalk knows the owner, or has at least met/spoken with the owner and asked him why they don’t grade/slab physical cryptocurrency coins and he stated “we only grade real coins”. Tread then said, well you slabbed those McDonalds Big Mac coins, and he replied “those are really nice coins”. Even if they start opening up grading for these coins, I’m going elsewhere..despite imo the NGC slabs being the best slabs by far.",
