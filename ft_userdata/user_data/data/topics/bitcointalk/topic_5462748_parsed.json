But I agree with the post above that astronauts are not nurtured here.Other than that, OP, can you clarify what goals you're growing toward? This is a forum, not an institution of higher education, that will ask you in the future about what you are studying and what you have achieved.Keep it simple; read when you have time; ask when you don't understand; but don't put yourself in a \"MUST\"  box.Everyone comes with different knowledge and a different level of understanding. Do not intimidate people with rules and strict requirements; this is a forum, this is the Internet, and everyone is free here.",

What you shared is just like \"What do you need in order for you to be successful in something\". I mean I know, I know that most of us here might some goals here. Maybe for some, their goal is to reach the highest rank. Maybe some want to learn the technical side of Bitcoin. Some wants to just learn the basics of it. I mean we have different goals here, but don't act like you need to follow these 5 things in order for you to be successful in reaching that goal.I don't have a goal (aside from being a Legendary of course), but I'm not following those 5 things that you shared. Not even once is what I'm applying. I'm just simply sharing what I know because that's what forum is. Forum is a place where anybody shares their opinion, and not kind of a working place where you need to have those 5 things. Ok I will just think that this post from yours OP isn't a merit-begging thread.",
