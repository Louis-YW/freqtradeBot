      "body": "Just like what is said above this doesn’t look like a frozen coin. The frozen coin sometimes comes with warning from the exchange. So it is definitely about you not having the knowledge to swap this coins. You need to wait for the limit order to fill since that is the default on Mexc trading and I believe that’s what you choose. But for future occurrences use market and not limit for instant swap. Also make sure the amount you’re swapping is ok enough because Mexc actually is a limit, but that full $20+ is more than enough. Thread belongs to exchange board",

Does this means that it solved your problem and you just have to cancel the order that you are wanting to withdraw? You really can't withdraw with the funds that you have put on a sell order with the price that you've set. So, as charles tim said, that's all you need to do and if that's the solution that you all need, keeps us updated on what has happened next. Cheers.",

Anyway, if ever he's back here he needs to lock the topic since the purpose was already served and he's got all the answer already and no need to contact any support for him.",

In your images, you might want to do away with the height next time as it might compress the image in an odd way that words and numbers end up difficult to read. You can just edit the width and the image would decrease in size but still proportional. Anyway, I assume everything's good now, but looking at the image, if \"Avbl\" means available, it is obvious that it's the only amount you can use. I'm not a user of Mexc exchange but they could do with using the full word instead rather than use an awkward abbreviation; it might just confuse their users.",
