With exposing scammers you are saving forum members their money, and warning them to be careful so they will not lose money, as for linking alts, it may not be a bad thing if you have strong evidence that they are cheating, but to continually link alts without evidence, and without them being responsible for breaking any rule, may be ruining member's reputation when they haven't done wrong, and the 'alt hunter' is not being helpful that way at all. Though going by DireWolfM's post history, it goes without saying that he is not a 'scam hunter'.Quote from: JeromeTash on September 04, 2022, 07:58:02 PMWhy not try and defend yourself if what is said about your account is not correct. In the other thread, you didn't even bother to say anything.If the evidence is strong enough, then will the accused person even have to defend themselves before action against them is taken? But if the reports have so much doubts, and the evidence is weak and still needing the accused to defend themselves, then should the report ever have happened. I feel people can decide whether they want to talk about someone's accusations against them, or if they want to ignore it and do other better things with their time in the forum.",

Yeah, I don't think I was the worst offender but I definitely stopped doing that recently after hearing what Timelord2067 had to say about it with respect to his local rule on merit-giving in the known alts thread.  I think it's a silly local rule, but his point was taken.I'm not sure that's the reason, though.  I always thought when I saw an alt hunter who was very low ranked that they were just trying to build a reputation, because those members have existed for years and before the merit system even began (I'm pretty sure).In any case, with the departure of a few old-time DT members who used to feverishly tag every offender of everything everywhere, there seems to be a sort of \"meh\" attitude toward bounty cheaters as of late.  Or it could simply be that over time people realized that sniffing them out and tagging them doesn't do much good and isn't really worth the effort.Quote from: yahoo62278 on September 04, 2022, 10:22:04 PMAre you trolling here?

Look at how many thousands of newbie accounts have been caught because cheats bounty, but nothing will stop them from creating new accounts after the old ones are tagged. They can easily change their social media account username, it will be used to work with other accounts. In my opinion, if the forum adjusted the rules about only full rank members being able to join the bounty then I'm sure less cheaters would be caught. This will obviously force every newbie to post something quality to rank up to full members and each and every one of them will no longer be able to go straight to the forum just to spam their social media with a new altcoin project.",
