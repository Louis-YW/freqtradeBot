If you can move large amounts of money in whatever form without the government knowing then they don't get their tax revenue. So they try to regulate & control ways of moving money so they do get their cut of it.Anything else is all smoke an mirrors and excuses.-Dave",

You should look at this article [1] where the money laundering using Bitcoin is completely far than using fiat money. Criminal can use Bitcoin as an option, but you need to spesk with the data and fact about how much the Bitcoin usage by criminal rather than talking like you're know everything.

Also, I feel like the crime argument was more popular earlier as an anti-crypto argument, and now it's more of a pro-KYC argument. As for a banning reason, environmental impact is mentioned more often, IMO, but it's a reason for restricting mining, not storing or trading Bitcoin.",

For example, the Internet has a very good side that contains millions of useful things, and the other side is bad and contains terrible things. Should we ban the use of the Internet because some criminals do terrible activities through Internet?",

[1] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comparing-money-laundering-cryptocurrencies-fiat-aly-madhavji-%E7%A9%86%E4%BA%9A%E9%9C%96Read my comment again. I´m not making most of the claims you are saying. I´m not claiming that criminal activities with fiat money are not happening. My 1% and 40% are not meant to be taken as a fact but as illustration. To give another example. Most of the guns owned by people are used for totally legal purposes. Yet depending on the country there can be a lot of crimes related to gun violence. This means that for politicains it can be useful to consider restrictions on guns. Of course even with gun ban crime can and will continue with other deadly weapons. Just so you would not misunderstand me again. I am not saying that guns and bitcoins are the same. Example of guns is just a useful example in this case. Even if 1% of gun purchases lead to gun violence of some sort, it can still be enough for countries to consider bans or restrictions. Likewise I am not saying that ban on crypto is a good idea. I am merely stating that it is obviously an argument in the discourse.",

All these problems are actually crimes only if you see from a nation's perspective. So this is the reason why countries have banned bitcoin to safeguard the income being generated from taxes. But yes there is a lot of tax evasion even if people don't use bitcoin. People always know how to find a way to evade taxes. Cryptocurrencies just form a very small percentage out of all the tax evasion that happens all around the world. So it's more or less just a Myth.",

Another I believe is tax evasion for which you would not hear them talk. Blockchain has cut government assess to people's wealth no more monitoring hence the tax evasion reasons for condemning Crypto currency.
