  "content": "Traders and investors who use DeFi to buy their tokens, do not use Balancer because they are undergoing a hacking attack. According to Balancer, only the website is being attacked but their smart contracts have been functioning normally.ZachXBT, an on-chain researcher, said that user funds are being redirected to an unknown Ethereum account, presumably the attacker’s. Roughly $238,000 is in the account so far.Balancer’s smart contracts are not compromised, according to a moderator on the project’s Discord. This means that only users interacting with the website are at risk.Source https://thedefiant.io/hackers-compromise-balancer-website-in-ongoing-exploit",

I saw that there is an amount of $238,000. Is this service popular for daily trading of these amounts? Where is the platform team for not tracking such vulnerabilities.",

Every protocol out there must upgrade their security measure as they need to defend from this group. You think the one that continously doing this came from a certain group? Like the Lazarus hackers from the North Korea?",

I haven't used the Balancer defi protocol since I've been using uniswap but I think this should be a serious concern for any DeFi protocol developer.The hack here was not for the smart contract, but rather for the service URL, where the front-end was hacked. when you click on the link, you do not reach the real site, but rather directly to the scammer’s URL, who may ask you for your data, link your wallet, or even seeds.Decentralized smart contracts cannot be hacked, but the bridges can be manipulated so that all deposits are withdrawn to the scammer’s address, and then some assets are recovered by freezing or tracking them.Quote from: bbc.reporter on September 21, 2023, 03:13:38 AM@cryptoaddictchie.

These mixers hide the trace of these hackers and some money laundering services.",

Sometimes the media is quite clever and putting blames on the hacker itself but I am finding on chain evidences that are more credible like how zach used to investigate before believing to it. Chances are Government are making it pinned to Lazarus Group but they just wanted to create like you said another executive and finding out reason for it. If theres none make one right? Haha.",

This is not the first time cryptocurrency platforms have been targeted for DNS attacks, certainly due to the nature of how the money is easily involved in the user process of website usage it became a lucrative target. This also reminds us of how not decentralized defi is.Now the main question is how and which parts of the chain the hacker is able to penetrate the vulnerability. It is from Balancer's owned domain hosting management account or does it contain the hosting interference, say their employee got socially engineered or something? Would be interesting to see how this would turn out later.",

I mean that the way the decentralized finance platform currently works is still utilising a centralized protocol, although since it became the norm people still call it \"defi\".Regarding the hack, technically it should be feasible to seek the root cause of the incident, it is only the matter of each party to address the concerning matter truthfully. The latest update by Balance said their DNS registrar got hijacked. They claim it in a clear manner.Quote from: https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704552288201883809After investigation it is clear that this was a social engineering attack on EuroDNS, the domain registrar used for .fi TLDs.We are exploring deprecating the .fi TLD in order to move to a more secure registrar and suggest that other projects using the TLD do the same.So, since EuroDNS hasn't made a press release, let's see how they handle the accusation by the Balancer team.",
