I am myself, we are both completely different. For Real Madrid versus Barcelona, I did not go for the match because I prefer just a single bet and I went for just Arsenal to win. If I should choose, I will not think twice to choose over 2.5 or both team to score. I can never choose Madrid nor Barcelona to win. I make my own analyses before placing any bet, all by myself.At worst, I will even prefer to go for prediction site instead.",

      "body": "Very few does this just because a celebrity have done it. With gambling it is unfair to follow the footprints of celebrities/influencers, because they don't play for money/win. For them it is part of their entertainment. If lucky the winning bet gets into discussion, if not the same fades off and it never disturb his lifestyle.For a common gambler who finds it hard to spend $10, even a loss is big and could keep him worried for some time period. I'll have my own choice, maybe I can take some references out of them.",

Few weeks ago there was a friend who always share some correct scores did post then I was picking up most of his games to play but I ended up losing instead of to win what I did was to stop picking his games to play, so for me I won't bet on those game maybe after my analysis I may decide to readjust the games before placing my bet.",

For everyone else, I'd imagine they could follow a bet like this with $1-10 for entertainment and still get that out of the game/wager. I don't think an advert like $840k bets are in good taste though either, although most people probably know how to edit page sources these days so might consider it a bluff.Also, if you're posting about spending $800k I hope you're not the one managing your account with the level of spam you'll probably end up getting from something like that.",

But there could be others though, his fans that are following him that might be throwing some funny not that huge as compare to him but just enough and see how Drake and their bet will go.

As it turns out, the game did not go as predicted for him and his bet lost. It depends. For some reasons, if you can live the life as a gambler and you are financially capable to play the same game from your celebrity idol, then there’s no wrong with it. But if I only gamble just for a minimal amount and have no extra money to spare on that particular game, I guess for my own advantage, I will just play the game that will suit on my budget and also on the game that I think I have more experience and expertise.",

I think experience and smart gamblers shouldn't follow anyone. unfortunately there are many people who place bets and play casino games by copying exactly what he is betting or playing. people have the following thought: if he gets it right then if i copy him then i will also win a lot",
