By checking Proof of Work of the whole chain. The strongest valid chain is the correct one.2. The valid chain is determined by the code, as I mentioned, there are many rules, and each full node has to independently validate everything from the very beginning, to the latest block.",

It rejects any that are not valid. The implementation is in the node's software.A node does not ensure that all nodes agree. Consensus is not enforced, it is only followed.If a node considers a block to be valid when other nodes consider it to be invalid, then the chain will diverge into two branches, and that is called a fork. Nodes that consider one branch to be valid will follow that branch, and nodes that consider the other branch to be valid will follow the other branch.",
