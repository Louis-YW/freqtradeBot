The operational expenses of the Treasury part is minimal, and the part that does have more expenses, which is Business Intelligence, has been consistently leaving around 75 million dollars of net profit for many years, that is after paying expenses. In other words, the ability to pay operational expenses does not depend at all on the price of bitcoin.",

Although they have their opinion and might be right but I still tell lots that for a very long term holder any price below the $100k is still a good price for now to invest into bitcoin. MSTR strategy doesn’t put them in position to forcefully sell because they usually take some profits during bull periods to help sort out some other things",

They happen to be the world largest corporate holder of bitcoin.I don't think microstrategy only buys Bitcoin when there is a dip. If I remember correctly, they bought some during that bullish movement that moved Bitcoin from around $70K to $90K plus in November. I think it was around $90k then, which proves that they are not really targeting a dip.QuoteThere decisions on how they accumulate more bitcoin, is just an indication that bitcoin is not going back to zero.

I think they choose Bitcoin for a reason, and that's probably the same reason some of us are part of it. Bitcoin will definitely never go back to zero, but seeing how they've Invested so much, it means they might have done enough research before putting people's money. They've made the right choice, and I think their investors are pretty much aware of what they've gotten into. They will probably be smiling right now, because saylor's plan was right all along. It's nothing special though, just that he believed in Bitcoin.QuoteI see no reason why some people will still be talking ill of bitcoin when such a company can do this and not feel bad about losing their assets. Microstrategy’s move should be an encourager to attract more investors to invest into bitcoin and not get the thought of their money not been profitable or lose their investment in the long time. Just like I said, Microstrategy must have done enough research before embarking on this journey. It should have been quite difficult to convince shareholders at first, but I guess most of them would be proud that they supported the idea. The truth is, there are some people or companies that would be very reluctant. Companies like Microsoft if I remember correctly, still feels it's not necessarily to invest in Bitcoin. Well, we've seen people change decisions in short period, and maybe they will end up buying when it has hit $200k and above.",

No reason for them to stop a sucessful money-making machine.I want to warn that it is bullish for long term, but in short term, market can be bearish and if it is bearish, it won't turn to bullish because of one purchasing batch of MicroStrategy.

Bitcoin is not going back to zero, because it has been growing up and becoming stronger a lot than in 2009. It's not purely because of MicroStrategy accumulation.",

You are right that Microstrategy vision is strong and they keep on buying bitcoin even if the value is bitcoin is over 100,000$. When other companies see these investments and how this company is growing, they will also decide to put bitcoin on their balance sheet. This is bullish for bitcoin and ofcourse it won't go to zero but all this does not mean that we will not have a correction in bitcoin. There will be corrections, market manipulation and all others news / fuds that will derive the market price but overall we will be bullish over the coming months and years.

Bitcoin has archived this milestone because of the consensus of the people. The whole or majority of investors out there believe so much, enough to keep whatever sum of money in it and be cool with the various seasons Bitcoin exhibit. That’s what makes it stick around very much, when you ain’t buying, there is someone out there buying and accumulating even more. Same applies when you sell.If people talk shit about Bitcoin, I don’t bother myself with that as, it can’t be all sweetened, don’t you think!",

They can not apply same strategy of MicroStrategy and other Bitcoin investors. They can learn basic steps and adjust it for their own investment capital management including risk management.MicroStrategy use DCA strategy, that can work for all investors but a prerequiste is they must have proper capital management to apply this strategy in a long time.
