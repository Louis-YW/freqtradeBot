  "content": "Hi colleagues. I use the \"Blockchaininfo\" as a source of the current BTC/USD rate in electrum. Usually, the info changes once a min or so. But now, I see the rate is not changing for the last 2 days at least. If I change the source to the Coinbase or Kraken, everything goes fine, the data changes dynamically. What could this be? The wallet version is 4.1.5p.s. Please advice what rate data source (from the electrum preinstalled list) is more close to the market average",

Exchanges do not have the same bitcoin price, there will always be slightly little difference in price. Use the one that you prefer.",

The wallet version is 4.1.5Electrum are querying the fiat price from those API/Exchanges using this code.github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/electrum/exchange_rate.py#L273-L277The sources are same in versions 4.4.5 and 4.1.5.From it, Blockchain, Coinbase and Kraken's USD tickers are very close to each other and all of them periodically update (tickers used by Electrum):https://blockchain.info/tickerhttps://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates?currency=BTC (downloadable json file)https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=BTCUSDI'm not sure what's causing the issue but if there's a connection error to the API, the fiat value would've been unavailable.But if you check Blockchain.info's market price chart, it's quite stable within these past two days.",

Perhaps the reason for this is due to blockchain.info blockchain.info API down?Quote from: serveria.com on June 08, 2023, 03:28:03 PMQuoteUnfortunately, we have stopped issuing new Wallet API keys and cannot provide any specific time frame for when they will become available again. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.Quote from: RickDeckard on June 08, 2023, 11:44:32 AMAccording to WBM, at least on the 15th of April you were still able to sign up for an API key[1], but somewhere between that date and 2nd of June the website became unavailable. Perhaps they have disabled the API signup page and now you have to be registered in order to get an API key? They do mention that on their documentation[2] page.[1]https://web.archive.org/web/20230415162458/https://api.blockchain.info/customer/signup[2]https://exchange.blockchain.com/api/#to-get-startedÂ don't know, but the problem is not related to electrum, so we can't expect good API from blockchain.info. Just stop using them.",
