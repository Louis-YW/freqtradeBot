  "content": "Hello everyone.We have a Software As a Service(SAAS) company and we offer a cryptocurrency mode of payment to our customers.We currently have an existing payment gateway but suddenly they have this issue about holding some of the transactions from our customers they want to ask our customers to undergo some KYC process and some of our customers don't want it.So right now, we started to find a replacement for our existing payment gateway.I can't mention the name of this payment gateway we are using. Anyone can suggest the best replacement or some actions to take? It would be helpful.",

It would be helpful.When picking a payment processor, ya gotta weigh the good and bad of each option to find the one that works for your biz.  I'd say if you setup your own self-hosted payment processor, like that BTCPay Server, you drive the ship.  And no one can mess with your payments or add crazy fees.  You make the rules and  now that ain't always easy taking things into your own hands.  You gotta put in the effort upfront.  But you get freedom in the long run - no middlemen mucking things up.  At least thats been my experience.  Maybe do some digging, see if going rogue with self-hosted makes sense or if you wanna use a turnkey solution.",

We often use cryptocurrency to protect our privacy when we don't want to share our personal documents. But when customers ask to verify KYC to make payment, they won't make payment through cryptocurrency on your site. So I think BTCPayserver would help you. There is also an altcoin payment option. Customers don't need verification, and you will have full control over the funds.",

On the other hand btcpayserver is good too as they have already api integration[1], much easier and cheaper than hosting it on your own. But take note it's only for bitcoin payments unlike the other two which has multiple coins for payments.[1] https://docs.btcpayserver.org/CustomIntegration/",

I don't think that sounds reliable. It sounds weird that they don't provide a help page to provide details on what transactions are KYC-able.",
