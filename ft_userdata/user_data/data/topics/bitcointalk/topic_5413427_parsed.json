  "content": "Alik BakhshiTo the results of the Russian-Ukrainian war     Concern for the well-being of the Russian, that is, the Ukrainian people, which, according to the historical discovery of the famous Kremlin historian Putin, is the same thing, forced Russia to invade Ukraine. However, Russian Ukrainians (that is, the people inhabiting the territory called Ukraine), apparently due to insufficient education, not understanding Putin’s discovery worthy of the Nobel Prize, met the tanks of half-brothers as German fascists in 1941, not recognizing the difference between them, not only visual, but also on the consequences of the invasion.           And what is especially offensive for the benefactors from Russia, the Russian Ukrainians, drugged by the Jew Zelensky, chosen by them as president, took advantage of their delusion and began to resist desperately. Moreover, they found entertainment in setting fire to Russian tanks with “javelins” begged for this purpose by Zelensky from overseas Jews. There, across the ocean, they decided to complete the work they had begun, if we recall the revolution of 1917, when the Jews clouded the Russians with the communist idea of ​​​​Marx, specially invented for the destruction of the Russian Empire. This Marx turned out to be an insidious type, his ideology, like a time bomb, ticked for 80 years, and suddenly, when the Russian people vegetated serenely in anticipation of the promised communist Paradise, it boomed so much that the Empire fell like a \"house of cards\". The javelins for Ukrainian Russians were followed by more destructive toys such as heimers, harpoons, Caesars, cheetahs, leopards and others, which, according to Putin, have no analogues in the Russian army. The Russian soldiers, who, due to the usual Russian slovenliness, were not warned about the existence of such a beast, gave up, frightened by the terrible names alone. After all, no one wants to be harpooned or bitten.    Putin, in order to avenge the shameful flight and show the population that Russian weapons can also, ordered the destruction of Ukrainian power plants using expensive \"calibers\" and \"daggers\", launching them from Russian territory. This is, so to speak, a gift to the Russian people living in Ukraine for the winter. For the same purpose, the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was taken out of operation. In short, the Kremlin fools began to bombard Ukraine with the remaining missiles, which will cause a backlash and I would not be surprised if missiles fly from Ukraine to Russian cities.        Of course, the merit of the Jewish-Armenian propagandists, who penetrated Russian television and set the fraternal peoples against each other, is also what happened. They deliberately assured with foam at the mouth that as soon as Russian tanks crossed the border, the Ukrainian army would run, and the population would meet the soldiers with bread and salt. It seems that Putin, like all Russians, believed when he started the war, and now the Russian Empire will finally collapse, and the Russian people will pay for the war with free gas and oil for many years.    The great-power worldview of the Russian people made Putin the master of the Kremlin (1), it will also be the cause of the popular revolt, the angry people will crucify Putin at the gates of the Kremlin for the loss of the empire, without which he cannot exist, because outside of it he will be lost.

Over and above the summit, BRICS cooperation in the past decade has expanded to include an annual programme of over 100 sectoral meetings. Cooperation among members is predicated on three levels or “tracks” of interaction, namely:...The ironic thing is, the USA is full of people who are Christians and talk about and believe in the return of Jesus in the last days. But they don't even realize that their own government is what is pushing the world into a position where Jesus will need to return to keep everyone from destroying each other and themselves.",

It was in Russia's plan to give this area up, since it wasn't doing anything to help their position in Donbas.Russian regrouping in Kharkov will speed up Battle of DonbassQuote from: http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2022/september/13/russian-regrouping-in-kharkov-will-speed-up-battle-of-donbass/No matter the Biden Administration's motivations in publicising its role in what western media is celebrating as a success story — presumably, with an eye on domestic politics in America — it could be factually correct. The media leak puts the dramatic happenings in the past 3-4 days in proper perspective. There are two ways of looking at the surge by the Ukrainian military: one, Kiev has inflicted a heavy defeat on the Russians and forced them to retreat, or, the American intelligence finally got wind of the unobtrusive thinning out of the Russian frontline in Kharkov that had been going on in the recent weeks as part of a larger re-deployment of military formations, and shared the intelligence with Kiev, who of course gleefully acted on it. The New York Times report effectively confirms the latter reading of the situation, which has been the stuff of hearsay and whispers so far. Indeed, there has been hardly any fighting as such in Kharkov region during this Ukrainian surge, and the Russian focus was, unsurprisingly, to pull out the residual forces in the frontline under the cover of heavy artillery fire. The Russian operation ensured that there was no significant casualty. The new frontline that was being steadily put together in the recent weeks (or months) along the Oskol River has crystallised....",

The weapons are simply showing us that the US controls Ukraine militarily.You are entirely backwards in your thinking. You seem to be pushing US propaganda. Are you well paid for it?  The fact that you are a Putin troll has long been clear to me, and you judge others, thinking that everyone, like you, receives handouts from a bloody dictator who in his country kills everyone who is against his power.You have been hurt. That is so sad. But lashing out at Putin or Russia isn't going top bring back family and friends. All it will do is harm you.Find a spirit of forgiveness. Having such a spirit won't help or hurt Putin. But it will help you. Do you know how it will help you? In your hatred of Putin/Russia, you are becoming just like them. Is that how you really want to be... just like Putin and Russia?Forgive. Talk peace and love. Anger and hate talk won't do anybody any good. And the one who it will harm most is you. You are turning yourself into a hateful human.Don't try to make an angel out of Putin. he will be condemned, just like Hitler. Russian fascism will not save anything from punishment and no one will forgive him for the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians and the destruction that he brought to Ukraine. And all his trolls like you will be discovered by payments.",

She has had some recent setbacks. They aren't anything more than seriously annoying.All Russia wanted to do was free trade with other nations. But other rich nations are stopping her free trade (if they can). So, what steps will Russia take to continue her fair trade with other nations? It should be interesting.Oh, they are not good, they do not want to trade with Russia. Well, then what, trade with others, what's the problem? You won't be forced to be nice. Or am I wrong?  Tell me, please, who is pushing Russia to war?Ukraine is the grass for the elephant's fight. Russia still keep their big allies like Iran, China, India etc, these are no small countries. At a point Russia even gave China a discount for the crude oil sold to them. Now Iran is sending drones, weapon and soldiers to Russia to fight the war. Germany insisted on trading with Russia irrespective of the notion of other countries because they need their crude oil and there is no other place to get it, so not all countries are having trade war with Russia, Russia is the one punishing them",
