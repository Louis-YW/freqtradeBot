If your tokens are ERC20 and you are using coinbase non-custodial wallet or any other non-cusodial wallet, you need ETH for spending your tokens. Of course, this doesn't have anything to do with your wallet showing the fiat value of your tokens.",

Anyone have experience of1 this?You are saying that you transfer USDT to Coinbase wallet and it shows that you have the USDT but it is not showing on your balance. That is weird. Be careful of recovery hrsse scam from social media that you will import and you will see huge amount of USDT. You will be scammed. You can tell us where you downloaded the wallet for us to know that it is not a phishing or scam wallet but the original.I have not used Coinbase wallet before but the wallet that I have used before the USDT will show but you will not be able to spend it until you transfer the coin like ether that you need for the fee.You can transfer ether to see what will happen when you know that the wallet is not fake and nobody is trying to scam you.",

Anyone have experience of1 this?Are you talking about the wallet Coinbase app? If yes I don't think you need to activate ETH but to be able to use their wallet app you might need to connect the app to your Coinbase account(it's a separate service) and they don't have USDT coin they only accept ERC20 token.You might be trying to transfer or send USDT to another address. If I'm right then without an ETH balance you won't be able to send USDT that is why it asks to connect your wallet app to your Coinbase account or deposit ETH, without enough ETH balance to cover the transaction fee you can't send USDT out from the Coinbase wallet app.",
