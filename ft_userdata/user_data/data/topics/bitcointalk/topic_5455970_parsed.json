  "content": "Pakistan has today officially given a statement that they want to join BRICS    I would like to use that same drug that Pakistan government consumes. I mean on what criteria did they come up with this statement? A country wherein the Military junta is in the process of gutting down  their own selected political party(PTI), now wants to be part of BRICS  What is BRICS?According to Wikipedia it is a group of emerging economies. Do you think SA or Brazil should be part of it according to the definition. I would say no, still China initiated it an again China compell Pakistan to come out with such an irrational statement. What happens now?Pakistan will eventually get rejected on the basis of its economy. They would need another 5-6 years or more to get accepted as a member of BRICS country. I don't think after a decade this organisation would exist.The reason behind is that China will eventually become a super power and India would be an up coming one. USA has already lost it's ability after choosing grandfather as a president. What happens next?This issue was supposed to happen. It happened now, O was not accepting it to happen so soon. I knew Pakistan would do what China says and vice versa. The issue here is why now and what not later? ConclusionPakistan and China have tried multiple propoganda to give a negative impact on India hosting the G20 events. This news is part of creating a new controversy. What do you think?",

As such, it is simply a group of countries trying to get more profit that other money systems are trying to hoard. Dabble a little here and a little there. Make all the money/profit/property you can get. That's all Pakistan wants.EDIT: Do they let individuals take part in the BRICS system? It might be worth joining.",

Others including Argentina, UAE, Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain and Indonesia have also expressed their interest to join.You'll notice these countries aren't particularly wealthy, so it's within their interest to form a pact with countries where interests may align. Except an alliance with Russia and China is an alliance headed for disaster. India was more allied towards the western countries when Trump was in office, now the Biden administration is trying to have Modi removed. IMO it's a mistake for India to participate but they border China and perhaps some geopolitical matters might force them to cooperate.Quote from: BADecker on June 10, 2023, 05:49:47 PMEDIT: Do they let individuals take part in the BRICS system?

      "body": "Pakistan and other developing nation that is seeking to join BRICS are seeking alliances that will improve the economic sector of their countries. But some of these countries are indebted to Western nations and banks and I wonder how they want to balance their aligns. And I doubt if Russia and China have the financial base and strong will to help these nations overcome their economic problems. The BRICS alliance may have good intentions but from personal experience, it will be better to be indebted to the world bank and IMF than to take Chinese loans. Therefore I am foreseeing that any nation that joins BRICS because of economic prosperity might be disappointed because the leading nations might be harsher lenders. All eyes are on the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg in August, the outcome of the meeting will determine how the organization will be viewed for the next one year.",

I don’t see any reason why they wouldn’t be included into the BRICS+ alliance that is forming right before our eyes as Joe Biden does nothing but accelerate demand away from the dollar. We’re witnessing a changing reserve currency and it is going to be extremely fascinating to watch.",

We’re witnessing a changing reserve currency and it is going to be extremely fascinating to watch. People seem to be confused about BRICS. It is not an economic alliance, it is not at all ditching the USD and has nothing to do with a Russia led coalition. BRICS has been used for decades to refer to Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa  and simply denotes countries of high growth potential.Now, Russia is no longer of high growth potential, and Pakistan has never been.BRICS simply try to steer the wheel to their interests, but they are far less influential than the G7 or the G20.",

      "body": "I am not an expert in Pakistan but I agree on their economy perhaps not being in conditions of joining the BRICS yet.On the other hand, there are some politicians and interests in the BRICS which would like to give the impression the world is becoming more and more sick of the USD hegemony and would rather to join the incoming BRICS currency (whatever it ends up being).If Pakistan actually joins, I would expect it to be part of the plan to push the narrative of a new balance of power in Asia, looking forward to the replacement of the dollar as a reserve currency. I am still skeptical it can happen as easily as news has claimed though. It requires much work and even tighter cooperation than the BRICS members have showed to this day, just my opinion.",
