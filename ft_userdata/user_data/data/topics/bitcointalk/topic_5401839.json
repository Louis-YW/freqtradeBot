After what can be said to be a wonderful run towards the end of 2021, the miners have now hit a rough patch where their revenues have been dropping. The previous week would prove to be no different, signaling a continuation of lower cash flow on the part of miners, as the daily miner revenues remain depressed in the first week of June.  Bitcoin Miners Take A Hit     Bitcoin miners have not had the best couple of months now. With the price of bitcoin dropping, miner revenues have taken a hit. This had seen their daily figures drop to $26 million the previous week and with a 1.47% increase last week, daily miner revenues had jumped to $27.19 million. This is a far cry from what miners were earning when the price of the digital asset had hit its all-time high.Source: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-miner-revenues-stay-low-as-price-decline-continues/",
