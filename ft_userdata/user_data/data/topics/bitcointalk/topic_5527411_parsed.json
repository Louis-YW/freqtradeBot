There are set of threat actors who are taking advantage of it in X.They used a fake but verified Ross Ulbricht accounts on X, then instruct people to a malicious Telegram channels, presenting itself as a official Ulbricht portals.And after you are re-directed to it, you will be walk thorough fake verification process name \"Safeguard\". And then mini app with automatically copies a PowerShell command and then it will instruct you to open the Windows run dialog and paste that command.Which eventually will download a zip file at Code:http://openline[.]cyouWith a Cobalt Strike loader (https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cobalt_strike).So never ever download or even execute or even run it in a dialog. Even if you are so called advance users, you don't know what's inside the PowerShell or that zip file.",

We should not blindly trust anyone to follow instructions just because of this news. Common sense and self-awareness might be the only tool that will save us from this cyber threats.",

But in any case, for most of us here, or at least have seen this kind of attempts, specially if you see that you need to execute one of the most powerful tools in Windows with is PowerShell (hence, the word itself), you should really think twice before executing it.And not the first case though, worst during the pandemic, and vaccine information, there are also criminal groups who created fake website to lure their victims to download with regards to the situation. So yeah, this criminals will jump on any news that will create money for them.",

The easiest place for scammers to execute their scams are on Telegram.  I don't really understand the reason we keep blaming others for our own mistakes. perhaps the names might look very similar but it's not. when you see a scam I think it's always clear to know because redirections is always the first approach so when you get redirected or notice a slight difference in spelling or alphabet then it should be regarded as a threat.

Even though we are too interested in R.U news I think most people let themselves get scammed because always in every scam there is always a red flag that indicates that it's a scam but we do pay deaf ears to those flags. one of the flags I know very much is redirection to different websites or requesting permission to take an action in your device.",
