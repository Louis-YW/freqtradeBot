You are really the cause of your loss, and that's because you saw a coin that just got listed, you placed to buy at market rate, and you ran off the exchange to relax. Wow!! It seems you are not yet familiar with the rabbit race of altcoins,  especially a newly listed coin. I have been in a situation like this before but not exactly what you discribe, and that very day, I was fully prepared to purchase the coin immediately it got listed on the exchange.

I think it can be possible if you close the app right away after you buy or you might have a very slow internet that causes this glitch/bug.Next time before you close the app make sure it syncs first before you close and always make a screenshot so that you have evidence to show when you contact their support.",

Yesterday, JTO was very volatile as it was being listed on various exchanges and when a coin has just been listed, there is very low liquidity in the order book, so the price is bound to go from $0.1 to $14 and back in a matter of second or within just one minuteFor example, look at what happened on Binance on the very first minute of listing the token. Those who bought at the top using the market price are still counting losses.",

When you have no control and have to leave the application, then do nothing, do it manually.The fluctuation of newly listed tokens is tremendous. With a new coin listed on exchanges, even it is listed on a big one like Binance, don't touch it after a like 7 days or 14 days. Because you simply can not know where it will go in early days.Wait like 2 weeks or 1 month to see it settles down and find your opportunities with its crash. You can get profit with its bounce but don't hold those new coins because they are very risky.Check their token unlock schedule too.https://vestlab.io/https://token.unlocks.app/https://www.team.finance/https://messari.io/",

If the wait of 7-14 days FOMO has passed and the market returns to normal, this will not provide profits faster than when it was only a few minutes of listing. Moreover, waiting for 1–2 months, it has entered the saturation phase, because most new coins will stop having large volumes and this also depends on what project is running.If the community is strong and the volume continues to increase fire the price is still dumped, it becomes a good opportunity.And the Unlock token schedule will provide some pump and dump, of course as holders need to be careful",

I have not experienced this kind of glitch before. I researched about a project and well aware of token price. bybit was showing 3$ price and there was huge buyer limit (bybit showing)when I placed market rate but the result was different. I also applying same strategy with new tokens and got short profit in many coins. Actually the screen bybit showing was listing time screen and then screen freezes which decieve me. I will be 1000% careful from next time but I also want everyone to be aware of this kind of glitch and always use Limit order for trading.",

So, let's thank OP for sharing this experience that he's got because if we do this on a such highly volatile market and especially with the meme coins, the movements are so rapid and skyrocketing but it can also revert with the prices for the dumping is always open to these pumps.",

That's the risk when we choose to invest in a token, you should always watch the price in the market while trading on it and you're right, using stop-loss might help you sometimes.  Those tokens aren't good for the long term like months of holding, you must watch it closely in the market and monitor the price.  What if you use an automated trading bot that automatically sells when the price goes down?",

I don't understand what actually happen because I set 3$ price as I remembered. now there is only one possibility which maybe happened. Actually when I trade then I click on last selling rate which automatically added to limit buying rate. Maybe I clicked on it but hence there was glitch in the bybit android app, the real price was 12$ but showing 3$ so the real price 12$ have been selected.
