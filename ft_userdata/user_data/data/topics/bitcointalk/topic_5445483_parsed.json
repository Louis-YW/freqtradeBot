If anything needs regulation, it is CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES only. I don't think about it now even though there are banks that have collapsed, because crypto cannot be regulated like a bank whose system was deliberately set up to be regulated by state regulations. Yes, a centralized exchange can indeed be regulated because some of the local exchange parties do operate more securely after paying taxes to the state. So I don't think that it is being regulated by certain parties now because it is indeed not suitable for a corrupt system to be implemented into crypto.",

Something that needs to be regulated is exchanges are not crypto or bitcoin specifically and there is no reason for them to regulate bitcoin as it is decentralized.They can give any reasons behind the regulations they make, the transparency they mean is their efforts to profit from taxes and one of the things they have to do is implement regulations and if they can it has been regulated a long time ago, but in fact until now they have not find a workable format. Want to be forced however bitcoin can never be regulated and for exchanges, some countries have made regulations for the process of its journey, so that there is legalization of some crypto as commodity assets that have been given permission to trade.",

Agreed, Centralized Exchanges play a significant role in the local domain in crypto adoption as I can't use Bitcoin only here because exchanges promote their own coins and other projects but in the end, everyone realizes what the best for them and why. For the centralized exchanges and their regulations, I do support them because with this the illegal outflow of the money in risk investment market can be directly minimized and governments can even track the user in entries and out entries as I will not care about it because i am not doing anything wrong in the open space. Yes, I consider my privacy a violation but when it will be regulated and in the hands of everyone then there will be alternatives to that too.I do support in my final words the regulation of Centralized exchanges but not the way how India did in back 2022 Q3 haha.",

Yes, I consider my privacy a violation but when it will be regulated and in the hands of everyone then there will be alternatives to that too.This would require you to trust the government. Personally, I don't really trust them because the people on top probably don't care about us either. Just take a look at the recent bank run and how they handled it, retail is the one who got screwed in the end. While it is inevitable, having the option to not use a centralized exchange is still a welcomed one to me, so that's that. At the very least, they don't force us to use one or two exchanges to monitor everything. If that does happen though, P2P is probably the only choice for me.Quote from: un_rank on March 20, 2023, 05:28:39 PMTheir entire financial system is broken so why would a superior system rely on their regulation.True, some even went as far as changing the law to make sure a bank can buy their competitor's stocks. If they can do it without any repercussions, then other regulations don't really mean much since they can just change it anyway. Even if crypto is fully regulated later on, I won't be surprised if they can change the law as long as it suits their purpose.",

That's right. If it's for us, we know what we like and that's why regulation must also be regulated. But long time ago and before all of these issues, we wanted the government intervention at least. Because we know that it will drive the price of bitcoin which is really true and became a reality. But then, we saw how it's making things not really interesting anymore and with all of the banking collapses. Then, they should look for some other things to be regulated first and take that action before intervening with the crypto market because it doesn't sound good that the regulated ones are collapsing while they're wanting to take action for the unregulated and decentralized market that's doing good. Anyway, it's all where the money is going and they know that it's in here, on this market, bitcoin and the entirety of crypto market.",
