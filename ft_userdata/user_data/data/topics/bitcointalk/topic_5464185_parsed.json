While being rich, the next level of having problems is likely about the management of their wealth which is easy IMHO. While the poor, there are tons of problems that people are dealing with every day. It looks easy but it's not when the ratio of rich and poor isn't par at all. We admit it or not, there are poorer than rich people, and problems that are being dealt with by most of them can't be tackled easily. Putting this on a serious note, I've been there and still trying to survive. Before helping the poor, I want to help myself first.",

Cause rich already has been rich so its possible the problems of the rich for example is his business failed or his company went bankrupt something like that. If the rich losses his company the staffs and employees would lose their jobs so it's also a worse case scenario. For the poor, it's literally a help that people who would lose hope on living and can't provide their essential needs if the focus of the government (my country). Thing is poor might not have the knowledge to get out of their situation unlike the rich one, they would think a solution to their problem since they have the knowledge. They still have the chance to recover even without pointing them out what to do.",

(support your choice with a reason)I will prefer to solve the poor person's problems because the rich person is already rich, and the rich person has what he wants around them, so what will be his problem that he cannot solve by himself? I believe he can solve it, so I don’t think I will help a rich person and leave the poor one, and you can see that I may have $100 to help 10 individuals who are poor, so which rich person will you  even give this amount to and tell him you want to support him? They won’t even listen to you, so I’ll prefer to help the poor person than the rich person.Quote from: Odusko on August 22, 2023, 03:54:32 PMHave you ever heard the phrase,  (the rich also cry)?

Yeah, it’s true, but you know, even if the rich can cry, but most will be a health issue, and even if it is a health issue, they will still solve it using money by finding someone who will take care of their health problems, whereas the poor individuals may not have the money even if they experience that type of issue. And you know, I may be the only person a poor person can be lucky to have as a helper, so if I don’t and choose to help the rich ones, it will make no sense. So I think that helping the poor will be more reasonable than helping the rich. Although both are good, I think the one that will be more helpful is the poor.",

Invariably what am saying is that poor people's problem is easier to solve in as much as money is at hand. Their problem is 99% related to money but for that of a rich man who already have money and yet can't solve it then that problem is something beyond the ordinary. So therefore, I'll prefer solving the poor's problem cause they're mostly resolvable than those of the rich .",

So the market is bigger for the poor man's issue but the ticket size will be low. So the game is to sell to mass. On the other hand, a rich man's problem will give you a higher ticket size but small customer base. Personally I will be more interested in solving poor man's problems for business because it will allow me to serve the mass.",

If any person in my sight need help and I know I can help me and make him/her trouble free then I love to help them. But mostly I belong to a poor and middle class family and people around me are also struggling and I have seen many influencers and Free lancers who are giving there time back to there community even if they are charging them. But still they are trying very hard and from the core of there heart they are opening many doors for the poor make some money. If by poor and rich you mean the lack and not lack of money respectively. If someone is rich but still have problems then that's not a something new because every time money cannot solve the problems. But I have seen many problems of the big rich people which can only be solved by some person near to them and poor do not want to go near them. I do not know the mindsets but this statement is not for every poor as I like my time to spend among rich ones because most of the time they are not talking about money but whenever I sit among poor they are always talking about money. But this case is sometime opposite too. So do no take any thing for sure on my words.",

But I can make assumptions from the current data that most of people are willing to help the poor because they deserve more help due to other problems they are facing amid financial problems and most of the time rich do not face financial problems like the way the poor face. But in my opinion, we should help each other until we could do it or until we have the potential or energy to do it amid the difference between poor and rich. But, if I have to answer your query I would help anyone before knowing or getting into the research of finding that either he or she is poor or rich. Let's say I saw a child or young boy or girl on the road who have broken his bike. Looking for help then I will definitely stop to help them. If I have enough resources then I will if not then I will still try to help them.",

(support your choice with a reason)Solving the problem of the rich individual means you'll get profits quickly as the rich will be willing to pay big for their problem to be solevd. One problem of the rich is security because they alway feel insecure therefore if you start up a personal security agency you can charge them big. The poor individuals mightn't have big money to pay you but you can use the advantage of their numbers therefore if you get millions of poor people to use the service you're offering, you'll get rich. We have problems that both the poor and the rich need solution to and that's where we should be focusing on as if you can find that problem then you can get customers of both the poor and the rich and that's the problem I'll prefer to solve as it has more advantage.",

One thing is to have a financial empire, another thing is to manage it and keep it thriving. The rich face challenges on their businesses that can't be solved by themselves, so they need smart and competent employees who will work assisting them on these matters. That is where OP's question fits, I think.In my opinion the poors always benefit from the help rich people receive, because the rich are the only ones who have funds to invest in technology and development through qualified labor force, which reach the poor classes (in minor scale, and never totally) after all. So it's like that saying: can't live with them, can't live without them.",

While the capitalist system is the best of the worst options available to us, in that it satiates what seems to be a basic human desire to compete and accumulate, it needs to be strongly regulated since billions of us share this planet together. Lack of regulation is probably the root problem and one that billionaires love to exist in, as it helps them get richer. Lobbying should be illegal for starters, because while it should be allowed by individuals with the right system, it is far too often abused by rich people to make them even richer by maintaining the status quo or even stripping back other laws designed to benefit the majority instead of the few.",

The underprivileged always need someone to lift them up and help them realise their full potential. It is not always necessary to give people money, but rather to place them in an environment where they can be productive. Instead of providing them fish to eat, teach them how to catch fish so they can be self-dependent the next time.",
