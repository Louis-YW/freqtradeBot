I got  here  that what led to his being booted out was due to his possible affiliation with the fallen FTX and for the fact that he has had past unfavorable incidences with the law. According to BJ investment, they believe the best way to help the crypto influencer was to lay him off, citing his inefficiency to work as a result of his relapse into drug abuse. They believe keeping him on would cause substantial damage to not just the employees but the community of Bitboy.",

      "body": "@348Judah, this is not the first time Ben Armstrong has had trouble with the law for drug abuse, I think Ben Armstrong can no longer separate himself from drugs.Although at this time Ben Armstrong, was dealing with the law for his own actions, many of the people who knew Ben Armstrong, expressed concern for what Ben Armstrong was, Even though there is a lot of news currently circulating BitBoy Crypto has fired him from the BitBoy Crypto company, we hope that in the future the BitBoy Crypto company will run as usual without the presence of Ben Armstrong in their midst.For me, whatever law will be applied to Armstrong, I just hope and pray for the best for Armstrong in dealing with the current cases and laws.",

It is kinda wild that it took this long until he got arrested, on livestream too. I don't think anyone familiar with the altcoin market thinks he is a good guy. Pump and dump aside his track record is really terrible. I won't be surprised if he paid people to follow or hype him up throughout the years. I heard he has more than 10 million on XRP but still asks for a donation (CMIIW). Hopefully, he'll pay enough to stop him from pulling some tricks when he gets released.",

The FTX exchange may be the most prominent example, but I am sure that there is something more important happening in other companies, and no one knows when these facts may explode.Of course, we don’t know what goes on inside companies, but we have a large practice of pyramids and scams. If a company begins to grow rapidly and is run by a young “genius,” then we understand how it will end.Serious people invest in companies that have been operating in the markets for hundreds of years and are developing well. There are no problems with management. And for the cryptans, the manipulators created a “sandbox” in which 99% of the assets are scams, so that they would play there and not buy the assets of serious companies.",

It was only a few days before this arrest when bitboy was on social media asking for donations to get his Lamborgini back hehehe. I am not quite certain why people donated money to him. They might be regretting this after watching the live stream. It was head shaking when the police asked him who was in his car. He cannot answer immediately because it was his mistress heheheheheheee!Also, GCR predicted this. I only saw this in social media, I have not confirmed if this is real.",

Looking in to similarities, Ben Armstrong apparently owned/owns a graphic design company (seen below). Also this article ( https://cryptoslate.com/people/ben-armstrong/ )  states Ben lost money on Mt Gox as an early btc adopter (despite not starting his shitcoin shill YT account until 2018) which BitBoy user here also discusses “having been one of the initial 500 account members” on Gox, and that he lost access to his account like many others during the hack. Not saying they are one and the same, probably not..but  Just found this all kinda interesting (came across all this by accident..long story, so decided to dig in a bit and this is what I found after some quick digging).",

I don't think that they should've been vague about the damage that he will do if he was still an employee of that investment company. It's a sad day for someone that's got a really good job and a really fun work but they still had a way of squandering the opportunity and here they are, they end up losing a lot of things.",
