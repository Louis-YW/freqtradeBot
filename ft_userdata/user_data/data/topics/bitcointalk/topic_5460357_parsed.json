Now I cant stop checking back for a good time to buy until i noticed that it trading on Bitget. So, I bought some because there is no tax and no huge fees and it now look more safe with the listing. So, im thinking of buying more to my holdings. Although, I understand the risk but what do you think?",

A Memecoin indeed which can make great profits but well is risky (The token has a pretty good community tho something important for this ones)",

That kind of token was just pump and dump token. There are so many pepe chain tokens in the market and all of these tokens are scam tokens. If you have agreed to take the risk by buying it and that's your choice. I can just tell you if you shall try to take care with your money. Buying meme token may able to make you lose your money instantly once the token goes into the scam token or something like this. If you wanna put your money into the risk and there's nothing i can do. If you are smart enough and i think you shall put your money into the legit coin instead of meme token.",

I think Dextool and similar sites like Poocoin are a home of the shitcoins and meme tokens so I agree with what you said that we should not take them seriously. They got trendy because maybe they are only being manipulated or they pay the site huge to have that trending status immediately.Pepe is the original meme coin and the rest of it is like you said, just a scam. We that are here in crypto already agree about the risk but many of us are wise enough to stick only on the less risky coins. It is still possible to earn huge on them. I think those who go for a much riskier investment, can't think of any good ways to spend their money.",

What could make someone buy something called pepechain and increase its price a lot that makes it worth for you to invest into it. If you can't come up with a proper logical reasonable answer, that is alright because there is none and that is why you shouldn't invest into it. Why do people are so adamant about losing their money the worst way possible?I mean this is obviously the worst possible way to invest and if you still insist on doing that then it is a bit your own fault as well. I believe that I would never invest into any meme project but even if I ever do, it won't be something as low ranked as this.",
