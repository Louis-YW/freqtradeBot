But it's really impossible for electricity and internet will goes out in this world, there's many renewable energy can be used to create electricity and internet connection.",

If such thing happen to the world electricity or internet, I don't think transaction will be running at the moment because the phones and the laptops we are using to carry out transaction are connected to internet, which you cannot have access to your wallet without internet.  People use internet to check the price of the market to know if the bullish season has come or bearish season still on ground, likewise Banks also use internet to carry out their transaction, which will be difficult for governments to allow such thing to happen to both decentralized currency and centralized currency in the world.",

Surely, some families could still enjoy most of their electric appliances at home because they could shift to solar, for example, or power generators, but things are not anymore running as usual. In a way, we're going back to basic. We won't anymore be spending hours in front of our phones, computers, and televisions. The internet money would probably stop together with the internet. But it doesn't die, of course.",

There's no exception! Bitcoin is highly reliant on internet even though bitcoin translations can be sent over radio frequency and by some other means. But it still needs the internet to run the nodes and to get the blockchain updated with the transaction information. Also it needs miners to authorize the transaction. Otherwise the transactions will never get confirmation. So yes, in case of total internet and electricity cut off, bitcoin will get shut off!",

Most utilities and services we use today are either powered by electricity or internet connection or both. So bitcoin would obviously come to a halt as with most things in use today. One would think it would be obvious enough. Personally, I think this question is rhetorical",

Everything that works today requires those two things, it's like water that is always attached to our lives, we can go without food, but not without water. Without electricity bitcoin will definitely stop working and that will be the end of bitcoin. Ang if that bad thing happens, I think we won't have time to think about bitcoin, there will be hundreds of other things to deal with.",

Business will stop operating, people can't communicate as everything must be powered though we can be using solar instead. As to internet, there is no substitute for it as of now...not unless Elon Musk and StarLink got something on their sleeve for it. Now, the question is: What are the possible scenarios that can create the stoppage of power and the internet at the same time? Maybe nuclear war in case Putin will finally go crazy to push the button?",

Bitcoin is no different. It's a modern technology which requires electricity. Without that, Bitcoin will have no value or meaning as it is stored on the internet. So without electricity and internet Bitcoin will be a waste. If you want to use it as a physical transaction system then the sole purpose of BTC being what it is now will be nothing.",

Bitcoin would also suffer from that, but all companies, industries and institutions will all suffer from it. It will make live very difficult. No computers or online device will work, these may lead to cause of death of many people like people that depend on both in hospital.

I especially like the tablet for this: it can last a few days.Bitcoin wasn't on my list of concerns.Youtube has several videos if you search for \"world without electricity\".
