And could be trading sideways at the start of this week. Nevertheless, investors now are bullish just like the first 4 months and maybe we can break that $30k price again and then maintain it this May. It's good to see this kind of correction this early so that many can get in and fill their bags. So hopefully, we can reclaim $29k-$30k again.",

      "body": "Yes, May has started as a bad month for Bitcoin, as can already see the price dropping back to the 28,000$'s. But in crypto market we never know if what we are seeing is really what is happening. Whales and speculators gave the tone of pessimism to the market. That is what they want us to think about the month of May, however, it might be just a trap to deceive investors into selling their holdings, so those same speculators and whales can acquire our coins cheaper and pump BTC again right after.",

I'm also basing this on the +40% increase in January, followed by consolidation in February, then +20% in March, followed by consolidation in April, which is a pattern so far. So taking this simplistic trend and considering a continuation of it, then it'd be a +10% in May into $32K.Of course the market doesn't always continue in the same manner, even if it has done so for 4 months already, but unless there is a significant change in direction in the coming weeks then I still think price has more room to the upside (even if less than February/April months). I also think price may well re-test $25K before reaching $32K, in order to create a bullish wick on Monthly time-frame.",

I did make up some research about on the reason on why we are playing around 28k price which supposedly we would be hovering around 30k but well these kind of movementsarent something that monumental in terms of decline or decrease in price. Having this kind of minus  isnt really that shocking anymore which this is really just that an ordinary day i would say.Sentiment for this month of May?Sell in May and Go AwayThis might be having that in correlation?",

If you are a long-term investor, then the price going down could probably be a chance for you to DCA and accumulate assets since prices are discounted. If you are an active trader, ou really have to scrutinize if you are in a market condition viable to catch market volatility safe enough to manage your funds and execute your trading system. You see, there are many ways to skin a cat. 'sell in May and go away' could probably true, but how is it working for you?The key is not to have the best strategy or approach. The key is To have an strategy that works best specifically to you.",

In contrast, the S&P did indeed have a correction followed by consolidation in May 2019 until around October.I'm not suggesting Bitcoin is going to increase by 150% within the coming months like in 2019, but that this may well be the time Bitcoin decouples (further) from stocks and traditional markets if they are to enter a period of consolidation or correction. This decoupling is what could lead Bitcoin to increase again dramatically as investors who flee from stocks take an interest in Bitcoin instead, similar to 2019.",

We need to take a breather and need to see something for the price to retest some kind of levels. Which means going down to $25k and then those who are waiting for a good price will take that opportunity.And then the price going on the and reaching $32K. That's some pattern that we have seen before, going down and then climbing up more than the previous high. So let's see this kind of scenario and hopefully the market will react positively in the long run or at this the next 20+ days of this month.",

We shouldn't talk about care or not, and we shouldn't think will happen in the next future. but for me, it's just a reference for us to calculate how to take action next. So when I glance at the chart, that looks optimistic to me. It fits perfectly with halving the time that ever happened in the past. That looks suitable and fits when I compare it with 2015 and 2019.I don't care about charts, if my intuition feel I must entered, I will do that.",
