  "content": "There is no absolute government who wants to take the country for themselves will survive it. What is happening in Nigeria is inhumane. The government has decided to rendered the country useless by impoverishing the citizens. The whole country is under pressures, the country's general elections is coming up on 25th of this February but before now the policies was changed concerning their currency in order to reduced the high smuggling of cash by politician who will wants to use it and intimidate their counterparts.But in due time, the government ask the citizens to stop using old money when the new currency is not in circulation. Banks refused to give out new notes and refused to collect old notes from the citizens or better still banks aligned with POS agents, POS took over the banking work and charge the citizens high for any withdrawal but the worst of it is that today as am speaking no single in the country, people cannot buy or sell, everybody is confused of what next to do.Citizens have start protest in different States in order to reduced the level of masses suffering in the street of the country. Government needs to understand that's the interest of the citizens they're ruling and leading, not making politics to look like national interest for selfish reason.",

I think what's killing Nigerians is the issues of political parties, educated people, youths and aged parents who where supposed to stand up as one to fight, defend the peace and pride of the country, rather everyone is divided into one party group or the other. This no unified system of protest, no common interest. Nigeria is be used by those politician for a pea nuts people sell off their conscience, brother is ready to kill is followed brothers because he or she is be pay by those politician.Yes Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa described as Giant of Africa but political division has never allowed unity, it has been political rivalries, ethnic wars, land disputes, resources allocation fight, power tuzzle and wicked occultic groups of cartels, cabbals and tugs of deadly people. That operates with this popular saying; if you can't beat them, you join them. Is really pathetic.",

Is really pathetic.I would love to know what type of Governance is in the country?Is it a federal system of Governance with different states, like it is in the US?Because if the Government cannot control and bring order to the country and allow cartels to operate, then things there are pretty messed up.Secondly, I think it's time countries in Africa and other parts of the world resorted to their traditional and cultural types of leaderships along Ethnic and tribal lines and avoid the toxic modern politics based on colonial partitions and boundaries.",

All Nigerians want to do it, no one wants a stupid, greedy government running the country but the problem is that everyone can think of, but no one will dare to rise to revolt to overthrow the old government. Everyone is afraid of death, afraid of being imprisoned, and everyone knows that the government has the army and the weapons, and the people cannot fight them. This is not only happening in Nigeria, it is happening in many 3rd world countries, but still, no one dares to rise up to revolt.",

Government people can always get out of being slaves by quitting the job.But if the citizens are the slaves, the only way to get out is to rebel... which means war.

Power corrupts and changes people, exposure to power can make the real nature of someone show. Someone who you saw as good can change and start behaving differently when exposed to power and the person will not want to let that power go. Only a few individuals do not get affected by power they finally get a hold of it or are exposed to it. If we get exposed to power, we have to watch ourselves too because you may not know when that power begins to corrupt you.",
