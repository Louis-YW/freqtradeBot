The media has always been under control, and this is just another example of it. It is very obvious that the people behind the control of the media may actually not like him at all, and do not want him to continue.",

But you're right, it's just another day in crypto-land. Sure! They're both right because. Trumps has a great influence on bitcoin liquidation as the media may speculate it and also, haven been active in the coin market cap, you'll also notice that since the conference which Trump made the address, the price of bitcoin has been stably encouraging for holders. Although based on market sentiments, the $67,000 - $68,000 at a current price might not interest some holders yet probably because they expects a hike to surpass the $73,000 ATH before being appreciated.",

But medias, mainstream and specialized, don't care about reality sometimes, they just do clickbaiting with appealing titles in order to get more views, more readers and above all, more money thanks to advertisements watched by readers. I guess most announcements from Donald were already expected and known by the market. So nothing really new today. But the likeliness of Trump election could change the prize in the coming months though.",
