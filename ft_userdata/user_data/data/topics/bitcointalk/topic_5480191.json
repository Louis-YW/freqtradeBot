The 50 bitcoin coinbase reward is unredeemable, as it was omitted from the transaction database. This means any attempt to spend it would be rejected by the network. Whether this was intentional or not still remains unknown.A total of 0.00 BTC ($0.00) were sent in the block with the average transaction being 0.0000 BTC ($0.00). Satoshi earned a total reward of 50.00 BTC $0.00. The reward consisted of a base reward of 50.00 BTC $0.00 with an additional 0.0000 BTC ($0.00) reward paid as fees of the 1 transactions which were included in the block.The Bitcoin Genesis block reward was sent to this address of Satoshi Nakamoto 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNahttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/BTC/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNaPeople still sent satoshi to the address.

A decade later and I'm glad I found out about this fantastic innovation I am so impressed because you digged a hole and got hooked by it for years. The impression is mainly because you learned about Bitcoin, not only to use it like other Bitcoin users but you actually learned deep enough to become one of Bitcoin experts in Bitcointalk community.I read your posts many times and see they are very knowledgeable, insightful and admire you a lot but I don't have technical background in programming to understand it all.",

Oh and let's not forget they also hold a big chunk of share out of those millions of Bitcoins so who knows how that master mind is still in play? Yes but it's not only a matter of price. I mean perhaps Satoshi wouldn't believe Bitcoin would be worth $45k usd, but there are some other aspects that Satoshi imagined that didn't go exactly according to plan.I am a bitcoiner, don't get me wrong, but Satoshi's whitepaper had a promising title \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". Unfortunately, Bitcoin is worth a lot today if you exchange it for USD, but in terms of usage it is still too far behind from becoming a proper P2P cash system. That said, we must focus on this and make Bitcoin a better cash system than the current one we live with.",

Some years ago, after a significant drop in the price of Bitcoin, many people who were against it said it was Bitcoin's obituary because, to them, Bitcoin was going to die, but surprisingly, Bitcoin is still waxing strong. The technology is just 15 years old, meaning it's still a teenager  , but yet it's the greatest asset that many people desire to have. What if Bitcoin becomes a full-grown adult in the few years to come? It simply means that there are more great heights that Bitcoin will accomplish, and for those thinking that they are late to investing in Bitcoin, they are still very early to the technology.",
