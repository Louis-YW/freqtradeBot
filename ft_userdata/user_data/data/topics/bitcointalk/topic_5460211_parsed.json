I definitely wouldn't trust an MLM to maintain or protect my privacy, or uphold quality/true encryption.Feel free to counter anything I have said, as I'm interested as to whether or not the company is an outright scam or if there is actually some form of innovation behind this idea. I doubt it based on the OP.",

The job description is clear but it seems you are keeping the name of the company secret. If you want to attract the best hands for the job you would have to show that the firm is a reputable one. Prove to us that it is not a Ponzi scheme. You don't need to talk much about the project if you can just throw more light on the the the project. The location of your job suits me. But I wouldn't want to promote a project that will send me to prison or force me into hiding while some persons will be free enjoying their lives.",

People are sceptical these days of such and are very careful so as not to fall a victim of such scheme anymore. As a result of failed mlm schemes, people lost their lives and some lost both life and funds. So nobody in their normal sense would want to associate with anything mlm schemes when they hear much. They would run away from it while pointing at their experience or what happened to any one close to them that was involved in the mlm scheme.I agree to your motion of OP to mentioning the website for clarification purpose and also state how much each work portfolio would receive for their task.",
