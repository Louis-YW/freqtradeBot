I have opened a ticket and I wrote with the livesupport. The livesupport asked me which plan i have ordered (although he could see it on the screenshot I uploaded to him). I told him which plan I have ordered but didn't receive an answer till now. So I am waiting for a reply in the livesupport since 18 hours now. I will update the post when something happens.",
