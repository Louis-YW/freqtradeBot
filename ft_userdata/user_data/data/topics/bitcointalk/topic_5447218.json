Understand how is it related to Bitcoin.How Bitcoin Addresses are generated? Understand the Math behind BitcoinThanks for compiling these threads @BlackBoss_. It's been a while since I last wrote a detailed thread. I think it was a good idea to do technical threads on Bitcoin in a relatively simpler way in the Beginners' section. I will start doing this again as Bitcoin had some major improvements in the last 3 years.Also I was going through the threads and it seems like I have included some less researched stuff in those. I will edit these and make the threads more technically correct while keeping those easier to understand at the same time.",
