As for ETH going to 0, there are no real indicators because it's srill the second mosr popular project out there and is planing a next dev milestone at tue begining of next year, and people want to see what that will bring.",

If bitcoin is the king of all of these cryptocurrencies then Ethereum is the king of all the altcoins. I doubt that it will go to zero and I haven't seen people telling it that it might go to zero. Maybe that's just because of the recent problem with the UST and Luna going to zero but if it's Ethereum, it's very unlikely.",

Tell me your thoughts and why?There may be anything surprising in the prices of cryptocurrencies because you know that the market is volatile, but for a currency the size of Ethereum, the equation is difficult because this currency is considered the mother currency in the crypto market. It has a huge market value and is the second-largest currency after Bitcoin, so there must be catastrophic reasons It makes the price of the Ethereum go down to zero, for example, the Luna coin, its team linked it with the TerraUSD, which led to the failure of the two currencies and their prices collapsed.",

The knowledge that many individuals are losing money or large funds are also preparing to liquidate the asset if it continues to fall, but the effect and ability of ETH in this market is not simply wishful thinking. Be wary of those who are trying to fabricate information and want to hold on to it more like whales, where the market is easily navigated and controlled with news. See for yourself if it is true that such is happening. Maybe because I bought ETH at a cheap price, I feel there is no problem.",

In the crypto world there are only months, sometime even weeks or days between \"XX is the future and new world currency\" and \"XX is dead and will go to 0\". I remeber a couple of months ago, many people were convinced the (ETH-BTC) flippening is only a matter of time and now ETH is supposed to go to zero?  The fork and update causes insecurity in the market, investors don't like that. If you are convinced the update goes through without larger trouble, then now could be a good time to buy, because in that case the price will go up after. However, it could get also worse only time will tell.",

Tell me your thoughts and why?FUD related to ETH is not just new. Ever since the coin came out, I have heard too many FUD issues about it. But from a neutral point of view, I fully concede that ETH is much better than the ongoing and ongoing defamation. But the person who missed the opportunity to buy it cheaply tried to talk about the limited technology it operates on, and over time I see the adaptation and growth it brings. It would be more realistic to acknowledge it as the most powerful altcoin in the crypto market.",

Don't just give a few bad management and operating cases to account for the whole thing that happened. I admit that Luna is a lousy thing for not having acted more clearly to get to where she is now. But let's be more honest when it comes to ETH, which has been around for years in the market.
