The Russian air force only had success in places like Syria because they were fighting rebels, stuck in a civil war without an organized government. Russia has shown they are no match for even a semi competent military and that truly is pathetic. The military in Russia was run by corruption, just like every other part of the country, and they never thought that one day they might actually have to utilize the equipment where they skimmed that money. It is crazy how badly trained they are and there is a distinct lack of communication even between troops 20 meters apart.Did you miss the part where they landed paratroops next to Kiev and had to retreat because they cannot control the air space? You seem oblivious to so much.",

      "body": "It cannot be said that Russia does not use all its power in Ukraine. On February 24, eight Russian armies invaded Ukraine from three sides of its borders. The number of invading occupiers is roughly estimated at 190,000. Moreover, they all invaded on the corresponding military armored vehicles. The large length of the borders of Ukraine, which was attacked, did not allow a good rebuff to the enemy from Ukraine right at its borders, especially since the number of Russian troops and equipment many times exceeded the Armed Forces of Ukraine and if they began to defend themselves at the borders, they would be defeated . Therefore, the Russians were allowed inside the country and began to be beaten in small mobile groups. As we moved towards Kyiv, resistance increased until the large columns, sometimes tens of color meters long, stopped completely. The Ukrainians skillfully used the landscape, setting up various ambushes and blowing up bridges in the way of the aggressor. The Russians were not ready for such a war. Near Kyiv, the Russians were finally stopped and methodically destroyed so that the Kremlin soon realized that they could completely lose the invading forces. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw the rather battered parts of Russian troops from the northern part of Ukraine and concentrate only in the east and south. Kyiv and the main cities in the center and in the northern part of Ukraine were not captured by Russian soldiers.Now, after the failure of the first stage of the war by Russia in Ukraine, the second stage is also ending without tangible results for Russia, in which Russia tried to completely capture the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and its southern regions, as well as encircle and destroy the main army of Ukraine.As of yesterday, Russia lost in Ukraine 26,900 soldiers killed, about 70,000 wounded, 1,205 tanks, 2,900 armored vehicles, 200 aircraft, 162 helicopters, 542 artillery systems, 193 multiple launch rocket systems, 88 air defense systems, 2,042 vehicles were destroyed, 405 UAVs, 13 ships and boats. As can be seen from the scale of the battles, this is the bloodiest war since World War II.Russia loses in it thanks to the professionalism and heroism of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and its people, who defend their freedom and independence, while Russian soldiers are absolutely unmotivated and, moreover, poorly prepared for it.",

By the way, the reason is pretty much clear, if they use the full of the military forces in the war, they will be vulnerable to many countries, and since the relationship between many European countries and Russia is not a good situation they prefer to do not send the full military forces. But if you are to looking at this case economically, the reason can be another thing, maybe if they send full military forces they will need to spend more food and money, also they have some unhappy people inside the country and it's not surprising to see them saving some military forces inside to protect the government against possible protests.",

I will now digress a little - we have a desire to erect in Ukraine a monument to Russian corruption and the habit of lying. Honestly ! I'll start from afar: can you name at least one military operation of modern Russia (this is over the past 30 years), where would it have a confrontation with an enemy commensurate in strength? Do you understand why I'm asking this?Now about the monument to corruption and total lies. Thanks to this, we were able to show the whole world what really is what was presented to the whole world as \"unparalleled weapons and technologies that will not be available to the West and other countries for many years to come.\" Planes allegedly of the 5th generation, which are shot down by the ancient Needle. \"Invincible tanks\" of which we already have about 1200 burned and torn into spare parts lying around (thanks to Javelin and NLOW). About the tanks, I also want to convey a huge thank you to those idiot designers who welded gratings to the tanks and assured the crews that now they are not afraid of Javelin!  Maybe the S-300 or S-400 turned out to be excellent air defense systems? The cruiser Moskva was sunk by only two Ukrainian-designed Neptune missiles, but the air defense in the Crimea and on board this cruiser did not notice anything! You can still list the fakes that fed the world for decades, passing off imperfections as advanced weapons. The only thing that is a real problem so far is a huge amount of manpower. Which is collected from all over Russia, just to satisfy the perverted, morbid fantasies of their Fuhrer. Statistics of the destroyed resources of Russia, by the forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Territorial Defense and volunteer battalions, on the territory of Ukraine:1. Manpower ~27000 killed2. Armored vehicles, destroyed ~ 29003. Tanks, destroyed ~ 12004. Artillery systems, destroyed ~ 5505. Aircraft destroyed ~ 2006. Helicopters, destroyed ~ 1607. Ships and boats, 13 destroyedThis is reality. This is what happens with the army, when money is stolen, and fairy tales are told to the commander in chief, and instead of real developments, cartoons are shown ...PS By the way - Kyiv has never been captured by Russian troops! There was an unsuccessful encirclement attempt, and there were several breakthroughs by unorganized groups (including tanks, armored personnel carriers, armored personnel carriers, and manpower) in several areas of the city. I personally observed this in Kyiv, Obolon district. But all attempts to enter the city ended sadly for the terrorists. By the end of the second week from the beginning of the terrorist attack on Ukraine, all such attempts ended and were not repeated.",

I think that Russia thought they would act as they did before, they would fulfill their goals and then everything would continue as if nothing happened. Now, the west supports Ukraine, giving them money and weapons. Idk if Russia really has full force somewhere hidden but if they have, it won't be wise to go full force because the world is watching, everyone is watching and it's definitely a red alarm for them, the world won't ignore full force bombing and war from Russia towards Ukrainians. Ukraine did nothing against Russia, they are just punished because they want a better future instead of Russia and their Soviet Union ambitions.",
