You would need Paypal for it.There are many jobs out there but for a newbie, it's challenging to get one because most employers are going to look for the fast worker. What you would do is offer low pay for small jobs just to get a high rating. It requires patience just to get started and then gradually increase your rate. It doubles your chance if you also provide on Fiverr.",

In every aspect of life and work practice, rookies are less sort for so what I know they do and has worked is that they do alot of sacrifice. Even in the medical profession, they are the one doing almost all the tedious jobs. In freelancing, some work for free only to get known and showcase what they can do. In physical jobs graphic designers, photographers do alot of jobs and display them on places that they can be seen and now they put some on internet. The buttom line therefore is about sacrifice, don't always look for big paying jobs but you need some smaller works to keep your identity going until a time you get your big break. It is always a gradual process with life and that is why as a baby you have to learn how to seat, craw, stand, walk before running.",

This is a common thing that happens in every field of work, whatever it is. There are no businessmen or employees who immediately reach the top point in their career, they must start from point 0. Except for those who have privileges in life, it will make it easier for them to reach the point they want.Be consistent in achieving what we want, because from what I've seen of some people who fail they are not consistent enough to do that. And get out of your comfort zone, this is very important, because from my experience, I'm quite sorry that when I have many opportunities I don't want to get out of my comfort zone. I thought if I could be braver to get out of that zone, I would be more than I am now.",

What honestly worked for me may not be suitable for you regarding your current financial situation but here goes anyway. I took up clients for free, in my early months of being a freelancer, I just ask that they refer me to their peers and friends who are in need of my talents so that I may start getting leads. That's the hardest part as you have to take your client's word for it and some of them may actually just forget about the promise they made with you, but all in all, with enough hard work and perseverance I was able to get by and receive clients to and fro who have helped finance my daily expenses without having to go to a 9-5 job. If you're still a rookie the best thing you could do for yourself is not quitting even when the road gets all rocky.",

In a Up work getting a job isn’t that easy you up against lots of competitions so you need to have experience to survive and like you said you are a rookie so it would be hard, also upwork are more interested in themselves than their community. You need a coin to apply for jobs and when that is exhausted you have to get more. They take some percentage of the money when ever you get employed. For a rookie freelancer I encourage you to go and learn get online certificate, get recommendations this would help your confidence level and you can be an independent freelancer, promote yourself and your work.",
