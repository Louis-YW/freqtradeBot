The new app is easy to use and is full of features.Please note that in some cases, you can be asked to undergo a KYC verification. These two sentences are contradictions. You cannot say that the service is non-custodial wallet and then say that you can be asked to undergo a KYC verification. This means that the service is custodial wallet and that the code is closed source and that you can access the private key and freeze the client’s funds if he does not complete the identity verification or on At least there is a custodial service and a non-custodial service.I did not find the download links and I do not think the code is open source.There is no reason to use a closed source wallet, so it is better for the service to be a DEX and CEX exchange",

And this is certainly good, because FRWT is the same scam as its “ancestor”, Freewallet.But despite this, I want to warn everyone, if you have installed this application, delete it and do not deposit coins. If you have already deposited it, try to withdraw it. Otherwise, today or in a month the administration may simply block your account!",
