Reaching a moral stand on which is a better option is not an easy decision to make.Personally I don't see how a CBDC would help accelerate China's bid for more dominance, they would get early bird privileges but other nations would be able to successfully replicate it in their own States and create a more decentralized network.",

This digital currency of a thing is not as important as many of you are viewing it, it will benefit more Chinese and will add only a few extra to Chain. The country cannot function in isolation, and there is no way Yuan can be trusted like the USD, at least not for decades when it comes to stability and reality. There must be a currency that fits a lot of characters that are dependable and peggable for the global economy. That is what the USD is doing right now, and it's doing it well, only that the Chinese are only looking for ways to defeat it, but such would not happen in just a day.And as long as Chinese people are also moving around the world and transact globally, the USD will always be needed since it penetrates deeper.",

China may get some benefits in connection with the launch of its digital yuan, but this is only an improved form of government cashless payments. These advantages must be consolidated in practice. But so far, we do not see feedback from the Chinese or from other countries about the circulation of the digital yuan. So far, this is unlikely to have any noticeable impact on the dollar. In addition, the US is also going to issue its own digital dollar.On the other hand, China is largely dependent on the technologies of the United States and the West. Therefore, it is hardly possible to talk about some kind of his dominance over the dollar.",

It allows them to leverage their future expenses, for every dollar they are owed, they could spend many times of that today, saying they will pay later when the debt they are owed to is paid. This is why I do not believe the whole discussion about them not wanting to use dollars anymore, they are very much in love with it because the whole world uses it, and they could own literally nation sized lands in all of Africa by using dollars, they are literally growing their landsize by just purchasing using dollars.",

But regarding the US dollar, we have an open economic system where they allow people to use and invest in any asset they want including cryptocurrencies on the other hand in China Yuan they have a communist country and they won't allow any other asset like bitcoin to take the place of their fiat which can have a bad effect in long term and that's why between these two I would go for US dollar.",

I wouldn't expect the global commerce sector to pick up worthless digital tokens that are controlled on a whim by the communist Chinese party. It's taking a large gamble.",
