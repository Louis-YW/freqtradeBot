All new video cards are involved in mining, but due to the fall in the price of ethereum, the profit of miners is falling. It takes time for miners to switch to nicehash, but not many miners will do this.",

      "body": "I think it does make difference as LHRs card has been sold a lot but mostly for PC gaming users for quite some time. Those users can turn on the miner program on their PC and earn a little money on their LHR cards, especially during downtime, going to sleep, etc. Before this LHR unlock, I saw people trade their non-LHR card for LHR one if they only want to game, and receive a cut in price different cause non-LHR have more hashrate = more value in the view of miners. The ETH networks now will be more fluctuating since we have more 'tourists' to the networks and you perceive it as 'woke up sleeping rigs'?",

Here are the tests of the new version of the dual lol miner.https://t.me/koliamainer/7136But this will not increase the sales of Nvidia video cards. This will only slightly reduce the profit for older video cards.",
