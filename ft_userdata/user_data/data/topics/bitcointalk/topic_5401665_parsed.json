  "content": "iPlanet. Our VisioniPlanet is a new next-generation SocialFi/ NFT platform! iPlanet will be the biggest dating social-fi on web 3.0 and is constantly growing and changing like the universe itself. But more importantly, the users grow and build up their characters through this journey of astonishing social experience also. The two-way influence grows on both users and iPlanet, see what you become on this planet and see what this planet is with you.A Social-fi entertainment metaverseiPlanet is a blockchain-based social entertainment platform. Through engaging multiple forms of entertainment such as Live-stream and virtual concerts users will be able to meet, chat and befriend all sorts of different users sharing the same interest. With years of social dating platforms development, overcoming the loneliness in humanity has always been our number one priority. But as distrust and hatred grow on current social networks the harder we tried the more we drifted apart from each other.We strive to create a whole new era of social models. Instead of being bound to the given value and frame, IPlanet allows users to decide the form of entertainment. Forming communities, building relationships. Creating trends that the people truly desire.MissionThe ultimate goal of iPlanet is to build a full circle of social life in Metaverse that eliminates the two biggest problems web 2.0 social platforms have:1) The incapability of verification: People distrust social platforms because of fraud, false claims of possession, and scams. It breaks basic trust between human beings and constantly forces users to re-evaluate whether to take the leap of faith. iPlanet will be able to verify if the user actually owns the assets and virtual wealth.2) Over-Governance: Centralization of social communities kill not only good content but also suffocates good content creators, there are countless creators out there that brings huge fortune and payment flow to the platform without even knowing they did, and users should be able to claim the ownership of their contents, followers, and cash flow.WalletIf users already have a wallet, they can log in with it and make sure all the crypto wealth and NFTs tag along to this new platform. They bring faith, memories, and achievements.If not, all existing social platform accounts are on the table for signing up, not to mention phone numbers and email. Keeping the simpleness of Web 2.0 but with the security of web3.0. This way the world can finally plunge into the wonders of the Web 3.0 metaverse without an unnecessarily high bar.To ensure users maintain the highest ownership and authority but also an easy way to approach their assets, wallets can be login both in-app and on the web using a plugin. Users can browse, flex and access all their NFTs and crypto wealth. Meanwhile meeting new people with the same vision.Personal NFTs GalleryThis key feature of iPlanet is closely related to the matching system. When users log in to their wallet not only are they verifying their accounts but also creating their own galleries automatically. All virtual assets/wealth will be exhibited in a virtual display, from all forms of NFTs to crypto tokens.
