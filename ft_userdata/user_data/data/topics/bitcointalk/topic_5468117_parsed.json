  "content": "STEM is an exchange where each sports team has its own token, the price of which is formed based on the results of games, ratings and the value of the team's players.Based on the analysis of open statistics of teams and future games, sports fans can make decisions at auctions and earn money by monetizing their knowledge about sports.Since 2021, significant progress has been made in development and testing, and the project is now fully ready for active use and global expansion.The first pilot launch took place at the end of 2022, followed by optimization efforts. During the summer football break in the 22/23 - 23/24 offseason,work was carried out to improve the exchange's functionality, and development plans for the next 2 years were outlined.STEM announces the creation of the DAO and the first public round of selling ownership interests in the project, which can be owned by any investor.Ownership rights are granted to all holders of the STEM DAO token, which in turn acts as a share of the project, gives voting rights and the right to receive profits from the STEM Exchange activitiesYou can find out more information on the website: https://dao.stemx.pro/",
