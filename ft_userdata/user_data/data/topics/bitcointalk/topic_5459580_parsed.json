      "body": "Don't you think that a Facebook page and a simple email address are a bit flimsy for motivating people to send you their ASICs?What's more, you're not even talking about the cost of hosting ASICs? Is it included in the price paid for electricity? What about import taxes on ASICs in Russia? + Won't international sanctions make it difficult for European countries or countries like Canada and the USA to import ASICs?You should offer more details, legal mentions, in short, something to make you look a little legit. Reading your post, I personally have strange vibes, it seems shady honestly.If you add to that the fact that you're a totally unknown newbie here, I think many members will be full of doubts about you, and will probably  prefer to turn to reputable companies, even if they have to pay a bit more, at least they'll have the guarantee of not being ripped off.",

The price of electricity includes security and maintenance of ASICs. And the law on mining will also not be the same for the entire large country. There are many regions in the country where mining will work without registration.In my area, electricity for commercial use costs 10 cents. For citizens, electricity costs 3.5-5 cents, but I don’t have such a limit for ASICs, and mining is unprofitable in my region now.Power engineers are beginning to take an interest in private homes and organizations with reduced tariffs, where energy consumption is very high.",

In regions where it is minus forty degrees outside, every house has a stove that runs on wood or coals. Siberia in Russia has very cold winters, so people use these stoves in private homes. In Russia, it is very expensive to build power grids in Siberia and give each private house a limit of 25 kilowatts, and in apartment buildings the heating is not electric.",

My boiler is equipped with the Italian EUROSIT system, which does not require electricity. This system is very simple, which you can repair yourself.
