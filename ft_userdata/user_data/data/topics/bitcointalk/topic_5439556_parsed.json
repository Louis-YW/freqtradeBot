  "content": "QuoteThe Atiku Solution, a campaign support group working for the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has called on the party to take a decisive action on Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike.Speaking in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, on Saturday, the Deputy Chairman, The Atiku Solution (TAS), Mr Christopher Abarowei, said the party is supreme hence Wike should respect the party, its leadership and right of other persons. Abarowei, who is also a member of the Elders’ Council of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), therefore urged the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP to act immediately and caution Wike either persuasively or wield the punitive stick of sanction on him either by suspension or expulsion from the PDP.Why will these two people be having issues with each other when they are supposed to be on the same page? The reason being that they are in the same political party (PDP). This motion they move against Wike by the Atiku campaign committee, I believe, is because of the dismissal of the approved site for the presidential candidate campaign, which was scheduled to hold on the 14th of February 2023. According to the River State Governor, his claims for the cancellation were based on the information he received that the proposed site was going to be used by both the PDP and APC political parties and that it would result in campaign violence, etc. To me, I believe that from the start, the River State Governor was never going to support his political party's choice of representative for the presidential candidate. There are photos and videos of the River's State Governor parading along side the Labour Party's presidential candidate, Peter Obi, which many are saying he is indirectly campaigning for the opposing political party.",

      "body": "To me wike is fighting for his right based on his own interest, it's normal that if the presidential candidate of PDP should be from the north then the national party chairman should come from the south, so why are they changing the narratives now, national party chairman is from the north and the presidential candidate too is from the north, I think that's the reason why wike is angry, because the major two offices of PDP have been drafted to the north, so the Atiku group and and wike group should come together and iron things out for themselves, if not PDP will lose the election at the federal level, they should forget about suspension and make peace within themselves, that's my say though..Las Las na peter obi I dey kuku support, PDP matter no even concern me",

Wike is a leader on his own and don't care about who you are or how much you have because in his own state,he is the number one and does things with force,regardless of who you are. We all saw these when Ameachi was the governor of River state. Ekwere is partially from the East and the blood is still there,Peter Obi will not leave his brother and support those northerns who are been sentimental in their decisions when it comes to power. Mr Christopher Abatowei is confused and carried away with the little money he is benefiting from Atiku,where was Mr Christopher at 2014 election that Atiku wanted Goodluck Jonathan the incubant president to step down for him in PDP primary, which Johnathan refused and Atiku got angry,left PDP and went to APC to work for Buhari against Goodluck Jonathan.",

If he is suspended from the Party, It will not stop his political career or reduce his political relevance. He will simply move to another party, and continue from there. Personally I dey reason say Wike still get e presidential aspiration for mind, so he is playing it safe both with APC candidate and LP candidate wey e know say people like normally. PDP loose better thing as dem loose Wike support, he is a very influential politician.",

But we have seen in the build up to the election that their has been unrest in the parties of PDP where we see some of the governors under that umbrella not actually supporting their candidate which I think it’s a selfless act and on the other hand we can see the problem between the present president who is an APC member having some disagreement with APC candidate.",

Wike and Atiku dey fight from when both parties come out to contest for the presidential ticket to represent PPD. Now Atiku dun use money wey Wike dey claim say him get loyal am so Wike dey do gra gra in return.  Wike no wan loyal for Atiku and Atiku been the numnyome now in PDP no fit bend for Wike if not others go stand up wan ask for their own.  I no blame the support group wey they ask for Wike to dey suspended as I believe Wike dey olit graph to use fall this party.Wike na dat kind man wey if him no get wetin him want, e no go easy for anybody wey get am. Even though them give Wike the chairman, him go wan still use that power dey control Atiku so Atiku dey right to deny Wike everything hom dey ask for but make him still find way to calm am down as others dey watch and for midnight dem go come lobby wike which woke will access since Atiku no dey regard am. Sha make we dey watch how the thing go play out. Anything wey make Atiku win, Wike better run from Nigeria if him no ready to loyal.",

His statement: Quote“We will not support those who say when they come to power, they will kill me.“We will not support those who say when they come to power, they will jail me.“Will you allow them to k!!l me? Will you vote for those who do not want us to exist?

Politicians and their tricks are so numerous. They would claim they are voice of the masses and I will begin to ask myself questions as to when did they become freedom fighters to become the voice of the masses. They are just busy fighting and deceiving themselves there. The issue of Wike crying foul about the national party not being sincere and playing a lopsided politics  is what they really need to look into so as to sort themselves out ahead of the presidential election which is just few days from now otherwise they stand a very big risk this election. Whom ever needs to be recognized in PDP should be accorded the regards before it is too late otherwise the chances are minuit if election commences.",

Because of that em come decide to the attack Atiku front and back just to make sure em destabilize Atiku's structure for em state. You see this our politicians na for their pocket them they find. Na why matters concerning them are not to be taken seriously. Shey the G-5 governors wey Wike and the rest governors create to fight against Atiku, don scatter. Now, Wike the support Tinubu. Ortom the support Obi. Makinde the support Tinubu. Ikpeazu the support Atiku and the last person wey be Ugwuanyi d confused on whom to support.
