He mentioned new clothes. I mentioned used clothes which is common to buy in Nigeria and some people are buying it which can be  those that are less privileged. That people are cutting cloth according to their sizes. Some people spend more during festive period, but not that they are not wise.Quote from: Mr.suevie on December 16, 2023, 01:13:35 PMif you not you would understand the notion the OP is driving at because during this period alot of Nigerians tend to do all sort of crazy things especially the average and low standard and they do all these in name of trying to meet up and some of the youths even go as far as kidnapping and doing all sort of vile act such as human sacrifice just to meet up with the season spending spree.So the festive period should not be celebrated? Who is wasting money during the festive period to show off will continue to waste money to show off after the festive period. Festive period are what we planned ahead and if you like it or not, you will spend more during that time. It is a time you will but new cloths and spend more on family, but to still spend wisely.",

Many Nigerians don’t really have a good plan on how to spend their money but that shouldn’t make it look like all Nigerians will spend without managing their funds against the new year. Those that don’t spend according to their pocket mostly are those doing that to impress others for that deceive period, after that, they go back to square and this is now how it is suppose to be. No one is saying you shouldn’t have fun during festive period but let it be limited to just the budget you can afford to spend on it.Quote from: Doan9269 on December 16, 2023, 02:33:38 PMWhy had it always been that people like you will always make use of Nigeria as a case study in things like this, are there no other challenging countries than Nigeria that people are there suffering out of ignorance and personal indecisions, maybe you should even consider a larger numbers of countries that were even below the standard of how an average Nigerian lives and be grateful for once and stop being great fools, missappropriation can happen to anyone in life, stop the castigation on Nigerians or using it as a scape goat for bad manners. The OP might be using Nigeria as a case study because he is more familiar with the happenings here than what is happening in other part of the world. Not to support him fully, but bringing it up here is better than him putting it on the general board for discussion. Things dey happen for other part of the world wey worse pass dis one but if OP no go on research about them, him no go get wetin to talk about dem for here. Nigeria is good and better dan many countries but saying bad things about naija always no really make sense.",

Those who don't have new clothes can wear the old ones. In those days this is the only periods people used to visit their communities, greet elderly people and dash them money. But things have changed. Everything now is cost so things are not like that again. The real Africa culture is fading out. Those who struggle after the festival to settle their bills didn't plan well. When transport fare was very low travelling in this period was really a fun. Food in this festival period is undisputable. It is the period of merriment and sharing of food. Those who have it give it to those who don't have it and those who don't have it visit friends and eat.  Lolz!!! Landlord and tenant quarrel will start after festival period.

I think there is time for everything and season, and the season is also here for the Christian's why Salah for the Muslim. But that doesn't mean one should over spend their fund. It would be unwise to spend the total fund generated from January down to December just for one time spending.  Tips to avoid over expenditure on festive period1) It is good to have a scale of preference in oder of demand and the necessary requirements in other not to over spend.2) settle the necessary things that are important before festive period. Like paying house rend, paying School fee ahead of up coming year.3) buying things cheaper before December period4) save your money in an account you hardly termper or had no ATM card and use the proposed amount needed for the festive period in other not to spend more.5) If you are married, shear your budget into 3 part give your wife 2 part and hold 1 and warn her to use It properly. because some wife's are the reason behind over spending because of children clothing and their cloths and hair. moreover they have enough in there Waldrop. If the need is beyond the 2 part you have given them, then you can give half from the one you hold. Otherwise they will drive you to unnecessary spendings.",

So while spending it's also important to remember to save incase of emergency.",

Someone who's earning 50% monthly he have saved up to #200,000 yearly but it's because is fastive period he wants to spend it all during that time not planning or thinking of other things ahead of him, like what my mentor normally say who so ever runs around concerning about a responsibility in starting of the year his not planning.
