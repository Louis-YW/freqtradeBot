  "content": "Hi. I found this service googling but there is not many people talking about it and the website counter seems frozen, therefore numbers are possibly fake. I wanted to know if it is a trustworthy payment processor. If you know a better payment processor that doesn't enforce KYC and is non-custodial, please let me know. Many thanks in advance.",

Ethereum support did exist at some point, but it was removed since it's implementation wasn't very user-friendly..",

Or using centralised service with KYC requirements and control on your money.Can't say anything about Atlos.io as it's first time when I hear them. Have you checked list of proccessors above?

It's non-custodial, and you don't need to go through KYC unless you want to link your Coinbase account for automatic fiat conversions.Another way (since you seem to have the technical knowledge for it?) would be to just accept BTC and then write something that would use an exchange's API to convert the BTC to USDT as soon as you receive the funds.",

There are various options that you can find in the link above and you can compare between them according to the fees or your personal considerations, even if you are lazy, tell us what you are looking for specifically, such as a description of fees, type of altcoins, KYC or not, and we will choose the best alternative for you, but it will definitely not be Atlos.io.If you want to promote a service, create an ANN topic.",

Some people search for payment services by searching on the Internet without having sufficient knowledge about this service. Is it reliable or unreliable? In the end they fall victim to these fraudulent services.The members mentioned above several reliable services, so it is better not to venture into using unknown services unless you have no other options because some services are banned in your country or do not suit you. In such cases, if you are forced to try new services, it is better to try with a small amount at first.",

Have you checked the thread and see if Bitcart serves your purpose? I'm not familiar with them but it sounds like it can be an alternative if you want to accept Bitcoin and Altcoin on a lightweight server. From what I understand, running a full node is optional, unless you want full control[1]. CMIIW.I'd definitely try them out first before you try a relatively unknown processor in the market. While both of them are quite unpopular, I think an open-source alternative is preferred.[1] https://github.com/bitcart/bitcart/discussions/277",

In fact, we developed it exactly for people like you, who don't TRUST others (as you should).As a non-custodial payment processor, ATLOS is 100% trustless. It's also permissionless. This means you don't have to trust it in order to use it. In contrast with other crypto payment gateways, ATLOS never holds your funds, so it can't steal anything. And, it cannot be hacked. All funds flow directly from the buyer to the merchant. There's a demo on our homepage. You can try it with a payment of $1 to see how it works.",
