Though you could, for example, prove that you have the required amount by signing a message with an address that has sufficient coins. Alternatively you could go through an escrow, though that of course requires trusting a third party.",

      "body": "Practically something like that is not needed since the receiver should see the transaction immediately in their wallet/node as unconfirmed. Additionally \"canceling\" transactions is not a good option to have although I should mention that any unconfirmed transaction can be \"canceled\" so to speak (by double spending the inputs).The closest thing I can think of is for you and the receiver to create a \"script\" and then make the payment to that script that contains a condition. The only problem is that the receiver has to spend this output to send the coins to their address to prevent you from spending them after the deadline. But it could be useful in some cases like a purchase where you want the purchase to become final but have a deadline after which you can cancel it. It also solves the problem regarding the need for proof of funds.Code:OP_IF  <receiver's public key> OP_ELSE  <1 hour>OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP <your public key>OP_ENDIFOP_CHECKSIG",

Yes, obviously I would do several test transactions first, but it comes to sending the $100 million chunk the transaction is still an  individual transaction.Therefore there is always the chance of human error. Once the bitcoin is sent. It is gone if there was a time delay more so away to cancel the transaction. Would mean if there was human error, the funds will not be lost in limbo.",

No you don't need to do test transactions in this case you could just edit the time your transaction can confirm, sign it and then send the signed transaction to the other person/wallet and get it imported there so they can verify the funds credit that wallet before they're sent - either of you can broadcast that unsigned transaction too once the time it was signed for has passed.",

I wouldn't make a $100 million dollars worth of transaction peer-to-peer, unless I had billions. But that's what bitcoin is. Peer-to-peer cash.

The sender must be cautious when setting the locktime.For that reason, it is needed to wait for more than one confirmation. Imagine a pizza transaction for 10k BTC, when the block reward was 50 BTC. This case is similar, just amounts are different, and hashrate changed, but still, the math behind it is the same: you can accept a transaction, when the cost of reorg is higher than the amount of coins sent.",

Send that to the other party and have them confirm that their receiving address is correct. If it is, great - broadcast it in a few days. If it isn't, you can invalidate it and have your invalidation transaction several hundred blocks deep before the timelock expires.Even better - include a small input of a few thousand sats in your original transaction, so you can invalidate it simply be moving this small input while leaving your input of tens of thousands of bitcoin alone.",
