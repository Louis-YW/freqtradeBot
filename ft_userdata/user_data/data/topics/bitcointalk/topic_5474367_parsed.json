  "content": "If you are in dam need to invest in Bitcoin, you can buy with as little as $10 and above. Bitcoin is divisible, meaning you can own some fractions, and not a must you will buy the whole of it. I was inspired to write this topic seeing some of my close friends who had shown interest in buying some Bitcoin some time ago, talk about how they want to invest a significant amount of money, one of them even told me that the little he can start with is $200, and which he missed the opportunity to buy BTC when the price was around $25k in the process of waiting to buy when he has up to $200. So I guess we have plenty of people who are interested in investing in Bitcoin today but have this kind of mindset, and they want to start investing only with a huge sum amount of money and in the end, the money never gets completed the way they want it and these make them keep missing out on buying opportunities at this cheap price we have for a year plus now. Bitcoin is created in such a way that you can invest even with as little as $10.If You face this challenge, you can try out this method to achieve your investment goal in Bitcoin, which is saving some money in a Box and which some people found yielding positive results in the end, and believe me, with time, your goal will be met too if you properly apply this method of saving. For instance, back then, There was a time when I wanted to save money for something crucial, so I gave myself a six-month target to achieve that, I started cutting down those unnecessary expenses of mine and started saving those side changes in a box, and after that duration of six months, guess what? I marveled at the amount of money that I saved in that box. So what does that tell you?, it tells you that if you want to invest in Bitcoin but don't have that Big amount of money, give yourself a target and start buying with the little you have $10, $20, 30, $50 and above depending on what that suits your income, I promise you from my experience you would be amazed in the end with the amount of BTC you would accumulate for that 3 months, 6 months or even in 1 year you would give yourself. The bottom line is that it is better to start buying now with the little money you have than waiting and the time passes by.Bitcoin is still fucking cheap right now to compare the price it would be in the future. Hope this can encourage someone who may find him or herself in such a situation.",

After reading this your post, many still won't buy as they'll consider the money they have at hand not big enough to buy some Bitcoin. Human beings are used to buying something's at whole instead of fractions and that just happens subconsciously. One thing people's are yet to understand is that you're better off dollar cost averaging than buying at a go because you buy more quantity f Bitcoin when you DCA. Don't wait until you have the amount you feel it's big enough to buy Bitcoin before you start buying, just buy and hodl. Smart investor's don't wait to buy, they buy to hodl and the good thing about Bitcoin is that there's no limitation on the amount you can buy unless you're making use of a platform that sets a limit so they can make gains from commission (like trading fees on exchanges). You can always create a request on the forum and someone from you localized will be willing to sell Bitcoin for you and you pay with your local fiat. The more you wait, the more you miss out on the opportunity to acquire Bitcoin at this price because this meant just be the last time we see Bitcoin trading this low again. Your investment capital should be that, that won't break your bank and you won't panic if the market doesn't go exactly as you expected in the short term so while you Invest make sure you're not over doing it or you won't be able to hodl to benefit.",

Just start with a small amount at first, an amount that you are comfortable of losing. And by doing DCA, you will continue to increase the volume of your investment throughout the years. That's the easiest way so you will find your bitcoin investment grows despite of your little cash onhand. This is the reason why bitcoin investment is not only limited to rich but even poor and average individuals are free to invest. As long as you know the type of investment you are entering and you know how it works through long term hodling, then I guess your money will be safe as long as you don't resort into panicking and selling your coins at a wrong timing.",

      "body": "It's more like what we call DCAing (dollar cost averaging) which means buying regularly a portion of Bitcoin which is largely supported by many members of this forum there are other method one can consider when investing on Bitcoin which are listed by JayJuanGee in his thread Quote from: JayJuanGee on December 15, 2021, 02:10:25 AM Once BTC accumulation targets are either established or at least there is some directional appreciation that you have to accumulate some bitcoin, then the next strategy would be to consider how to go about BTC accumulation.  Surely, the best three ways to consider BTC accumulation is through 1) dollar cost averaging (DCA), 2) lump sum investing and 3) buying on dips.  The consideration of these three strategies is also best in the order that I presented them.  DCA has the advantage of having a kind of regular flow into your BTC investment that can really add up over time.  Lump sum investing is many times not available for the vast majority of normies, and sure of course, if you have some abilities to lump sum invest there is nothing wrong with exercising such option because having a lump sum gives you options to invest it all at once or to even engage in some kind of DCA approach with investing the lump sum over time rather than all at once.  Buying on dips is not a bad idea, but it requires timing the market But your method though still supports buying in a whole because saving in a box before buying will still end up trying to buy in a whole which is not what anyone should be advised it better to buy regular because time matters if you don't buy at a point which you have the money something more important than saving might rag off your savings like health issues that is why we more support DCAing.",

It's not \"your\" funds if they are being held by a third party. But as I mentioned finding a balance that works is the best option. Leaving them on an exchange up until it will not be too expensive to transfer out, this is my opinion is when the cost of the transaction is less than 10% of the transaction amount. This could means for a period of 2-6 months you will be totally deoendent on the third party.The downside of this is users get complacent and decide to just leave the funds on the exchange, pointing out that it has been safe during the period they left them there.",

      "body": "If someone is able to buy bitcoins in large portions due to their financial capabilities - then I don't expect it to be a wrong action. But of course - buying with a lump sum is not always good because the price of bitcoin can fluctuate sharply and can be lower than the previous purchase price. The DCA strategy is supposed to help them buy at a lower average price - but even if they want a lump sum then that's not a mistake.I understand the point of this thread - of course one doesn't have to have million of dollars to start investing in bitcoin, but even with $10 they can start. If I can afford $50/week, then I won't push to buy $100 or more - but buying as much as we can afford without interfering with other priority needs will be fine compared to holding fiat.",

In most situation dividing your capital into 3 or 4 parts to buy in bulk every time there's a significant drop in price will give you a much greater profit.
