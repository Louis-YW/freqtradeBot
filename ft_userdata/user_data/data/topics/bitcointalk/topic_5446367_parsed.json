Here I met many new telegram members and everyone trying to Scam with with me. Mostly of them are from USA, Nigeria and UK. some people use Women voice and they trap new people to join investment scheme and other such things. As telegram is much more secure than any other Social media that's why there are a lot of Scammers than any other platform. And I think that sucks.

I have a problem,\" just wait for a few minutes and see your account flooded with messages, most of which have a custom name and picture similar to the real admin, and they will attempt to offer you a solution, but their main objective is to scam you, penetrate your account, and make away with your funds.  Some of go through almost every telegram group and search for members active ones most especially and send them a DM with investment offer some go as far as sending broker website link, telegram channels which they update with there fake transaction history. Do you know some funny fact of this lies, most of them don't actually know how the Blockchain transaction works, they upload a different transaction ID, different wallet and a different amount which they claim they might have just paid there investors. If you scan the wallet you fine out that some of them have never even received any deposit since the wallet was created, why some are some old transaction of years ago. We can keep on reporting there accounts but that won't stop them, we just have to be smart enough to avoid them and not fall victim of such scam. Quote from: Maxre on March 26, 2023, 02:23:54 PMwe have to change it. How do you plan on changing it?",

Internet is a product of technological advancements indeed but behind its advantages is also its disadvantages especially for those who are not that knowledgeable with the potential and risks involved. This simply won't stop as long as they have people being victimized by them. Same scheme will be present as long as there are people who keeps on falling for it. What's best is to equip oneself with knowledge in order to be aware of the do's and dont's not only in this industry but to all possible means.",

Most times it happens when you go to the official channel of a project or anything that has to do with crypto and then make a complain, you'll see so many of them running to your PM claiming that they are part of the project's team and they can help you solve whatever issues it is that you're struggling with. But in the end all they want is an opportunity for them to request a sensitive information that you won't easily give out. You have to be careful when dealing with strangers online most especially when it has to do with you putting your money into it or you giving out any personal information.",

It is probably not difficult for anyone to guess that people feel impunity from the fact that they assume that they are anonymous. On the Internet, we can introduce ourselves as anyone, from a successful trader to an investor who hit a big jackpot on this or that crypto project.In my country, groups advertising to attract naive people appear daily. Of course, we cannot warn everyone, but we must inform those who are close to us as quickly as possible, as scammers are proactive, each time telling the victims that they have little time and need to make a decision quickly.https://newdaycrypto.com/a-resident-of-novokuznetsk-invested-6-7-million-rubles-in-a-crypto-fraud-project/",

Here I met many new telegram members and everyone trying to Scam with with me.  From your post OP which talks about the airdrop here, its not only about the scammers that trying to engage new users to invest but also they drop fake airdrops when you click it, it will drain your assets. It would be better to surround yourself with a group with good background because seems like you can already tell the difference about scams and legit. I also salute you from trying out different way of earnings.QuoteMostly of them are from USA, Nigeria and UK. some people use Women voice and they trap new people to join investment scheme and other such things.

Of course it will be a group of scammers so they can easily work together to scam newbies like acting that they are like you trying out airdrops. If people think already think that telegram is secured then they will let their guard down causes them to get scammed. You could simply report them online for the others to be aware of specific group or person to avoid them.QuoteI have blocked almost 100+ Scammers and there are more people coming and everyone has their own strategy to Scam with us. Is this happened to you or only me.That's a good effort for your security, you could actually edit your privacy settings to avoid getting unknown messages from unknown numbers. It already happened to me before but once I edited my settings its all clear and you could actually use telegram without scammers but always double check.",

I think you mean the opposite with telegram being the most secure. The security you get on telegram is as much as you give it. It is really loose and serves as a window of opportunity for scammers to refer you off a secured platform where your convo could be monitored and in turn blocked to a more free space like telegram where they could communicate with you without fear of getting bursted by the security team behind the platform.Good enough you've taken steps in blocking accounts you've associated with scam but, that won't keep you away from them just yet. The ease of creating new accounts and channels actually means, your still up for more adds or communicated by these scammers with a new name.Setting your privacy settings would go a long way to limit who adds you to what channel, who sees your contact, views your uploads and more. Meanwhile, you be mindful of how you portray yourself in certain groups.",

And I think that sucks. And these are the people in which new People don't believe in crypto and we have to change it. <...>I'm not really sure about this claim. While Telegram does have some features that can enhance security, such as end-to-end encryption for messages and a two-factor authentication option, it's still possible for scammers to operate on the platform and try to deceive users. Therefore, I'm not convinced that Telegram necessarily has more scammers than any other platform solely because of its security features.Scammers can be very convincing and use a variety of tactics to deceive people, including creating fake profiles, offering fake investment opportunities, or impersonating legitimate businesses or individuals. It's possible that scammers target Telegram because of its large user base, but, most likely, Telegram is a breeding ground for scammers because of the many naive and gullible people who fall for scams. However, scams can happen on any platform, and it's up to individual users to be cautious and skeptical of any messages or requests they receive, regardless of the platform they're on.",

All social media has the same potential for someone to deceive us, so nothing is safe.We cannot change or fix fraud for other people.
