  "content": "Overview:QuoteBitcoin Ordinals is a new protocol that enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis, which can include unique data. The protocol uses “inscriptions,” which are arbitrary content like text or images that can be added to sequentially numbered satoshis to create unique “digital artefacts.” These artefacts, which are NFTs in effect, can be held and transferred across the Bitcoin network like any other sats.Source My general opinion about NFTs still remains the same, just another bullshit way of getting money from gullible noobs by \"creators\"Now the issue is these NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain have started to spam the Bitcoin network. The mempool usage is moving towards 300 MB consequently spiking the transactions feesWhat happens if the spam stays on for months or even a year plus (Well, we know what happened to Ethereum)?Will there be a case where the community decides to improve the Bitcoin network to get rid of the spam?",

It's good, not harmful in long term.Waiting transactions in mempools are low transaction fee rates. People don't join fee race too much as I see. Fee rates are about 10 sat/vbyte are good enough and if you can wait for weekends, you can use lower fee rates like 3 to 5 sat/vbyte.https://mempool.space/It is different than 2 or 3 years ago with low Segwit adoption, people joined fee rate race and use very high rates like 50 sat/vbyte or 100 sat/vbyte.",

      "body": "Yeah, the powers that be are sabotaging Bitcoin to make you flee to a parallel blockchain or a more centralized \"workaround\", rather than genuine Bitcoin. Their plan seems to be going fine, they found a vulnerability and are exploiting it...tbct_mt2 when you say \"people join the fee rate\", you seem to skip the fact that its the wallets doing it automatically. If some exchange wants to move coins around from a cold wallet or whatever, a domino effect spreads \"automatically\" thanks to this \"guess the network fee\" algorithm. Rarely people know to disable the guessing and go with a manually set tx fee, they will just blame it on Bitcoin being \"expensive/useless\".So now that spam is pegging the mempool to the max, what will happen the next time such event occurs? What when the next Ordinals comes and joins the spamming because its more lucrative for them to sell spam than do Bitcoin transactions? Of course recommending \"other\" methods of payment, soon the Bitcoin blockchain will be dedicated to this since they are willing to pay more than mere transactions would.No doubt to the benefit of altcoiners, etc; that want to bury Bitcoin.",

The first mempool congestion at the time was after bitcoin halving, when more people started to buy bitcoin that resulted to mempool congestion. The second was when Chinese government banned bitcoin mining to the extent that mining hash rate reconded in china at the time went down to zero, over 60% of the bitcoin hash rates were from Chinese miners, this resulted in reduction of mining hash rates and increase in block mined time getting beyond 10 minutes most often and this resulted in mempool congestion until the mining difficulty was adjusted.",

Sooner or later it will calm down, the volume of this type of transactions will drop by 99% and everything will return to normal, because as you yourself pointed out \"just another bullshit\"High fees will also push such transactions to other chains (like BSC).",

This is not a long term solution though and it would bring many inconveniences to people who want to make transactions daily. You cannot use a currency for every day use if you have to wait for the weekends to use it. I think something needs to be done about ordinals and maybe making lightening network mandatory is the best solution.Can we make a new fork and stop ordinals from congesting the blockchain by not allowing the data to be posted?",

Or any solutions for the second layer? Just like it happened with polygon.The problem of fees is considered a problem by increasing the alert, which is the real transactions that must be conducted on the network, and therefore the more users increase, the more this problem appears, but its solution will be by developing more and more solutions. As for spam, it is temporary and linked to a specific trend such as NFT, and it is not sustainable growth.",

The only other thing is to ban ordinals, but that opens another box, this time it's Pandora's turn.

Everyone's warranted to their own say, in any case I see this issue with Bitcoin Ordinals as having both good and bad sides to it. For instance, since this spams the mempool and jacks the transaction price high, at least in the future coz the effects aren't that much apparent nowadays, this will cause huge problems for the growth of the network and the industry itself, might even cause a huge collapse as more and more people switch to a different network that is not as congested as bitcoin could be in the future.There's also the story of the past where a certain challenge (which I forgot the details of really) urged the whole network to improve upon itself and better cater to the general public, I can see this being the more apparent outcome in this situation but the former could still pose some truth, especially nowadays.",
