  "content": "Blackjack is one of the most prominent games that can be found in every casino anywhere. It is one of the games where I have been able to make a lot of money.There are those who believe that Blackjack was invented by the Romans, but the majority agree that it was invented in France at the beginning of the 18th century. It was called \"Vingt-et-Un\" which is French for \"Twenty-one\"                                         The story goes that Blackjack has its origins in a game that was very popular among the French royal class, the Chemin the Fer. It was later brought by immigrants to the Americas and turned into what we know today.",

I really like both game but Blackjack became more popular since its much easier to understand. Blackjack is my favorite gambling because it relax me when playing it. There is no precise documentation about the actual origin of this game since it was just mention on old novel which means it already exist way longer that then.I do some research about this game before but I can’t find any material that will lead me to its  real origin to provide a better history for this game. Add some facts here about the game to make this thread more informative.",

There is no precise documentation about the actual origin of this game since it was just mention on old novel which means it already exist way longer that then.Ok, when I played on land based casinos, I saw this game Pontoon and I'm not sure what kind of game it is, so it is a variant of Blackjack being played in Britain. Yes, the set of rules are  very easy to understand, and majority of us here are addicted to this game.And yeah it was made (in)famous by those gamblers who can read the card and have advantage against the casino, it's not cheating per se, but if the casino find you doing this trick, they have the right to call you out and then they will escorted you outside.",

Yes, the set of rules are  very easy to understand, and majority of us here are addicted to this game.The variance isn't too far away from blackjack. The main differences is a 2:1 layout for a royal card and an ace and the chance of winning by a five card trick - which beats all but a 2 card 21.I actually just thought pontoon was the non gambling version of blackjack until I looked it up though because it's normally a game I've played among social groups and without any win incentive except the gloat.",

Of course, it's hard to read or count the cards when there are like 10-12 or even more in a given session. Online casino like shuffle every deck of the card so that card number can't do their trick.But yeah, very interesting history of Black Jack, I mean just what the game is called is just genius.(ace of spades and either jack of clubs or spades).",

I just saw a movie on Netflix several days ago, the title is 21. The method cheater used to cheat a blackjack game is counting card. For sure to use this trick the user must have a mathematical brain because they must calculate the card until got want they want.

You will probably have had some good winning sessions but the net total of your blackjack bets over your lifetime will most likely be a loss.Related to this, I miss both in the short article and in your brief summary, how there was a time when it was relatively profitable and in reaction, casinos banned card counting and introduced various decks.See for example this article:7 Sad Realities of Blackjack",

Dice games, roulette, and slots rely solely with one's luck while baccarat regards strategy most of the time but luck still has a role with the cards. This is gambling industry and luck will always be a factor, just don't rely on it too much because it can maximize the risks involved. Card games is a bit tricky especially on live casinos wherein even gestures are important to somehow 'bluff' the ither players with your decision. I'm not quite sure if same thing happens in online gambling because ut is on a virtual setting.",
