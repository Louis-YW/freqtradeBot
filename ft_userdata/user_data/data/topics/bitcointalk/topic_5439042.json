This forum is free for everyone as long as the questions and topics are significant to the boards where you're asking them. There are traders that have started with forex and stocks and they're all discussing their techniques and sharing some of them on the Trading Discussion. But if you're for those investing-related topics then follow the links that have been suggested to you by mk 4.",

I've read some advice given by members, but might not be exactly what you or the forum wants. Just be technical in asking it wherever you wish to, it should not be obvious.And on a closer look at what you really want (advice, advertisement and contributions) on what is not crypto-related, no place will fit it best than Services: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0 if you have all it takes. Economics: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0 might be good too, but be more technical about this.",

There’s an Altcoin discussion board which you can talk other crypto investment aside from Bitcoin and Economics board to discuss a general investment discussion that involves fiat.This forum name as Bitcointalk because this is the forum where Bitcoin last discussed by the founder before he leaves. By that time, There’s no altcoin so the name only focus on Bitcoin because there’s no other crypto to talk about. Crypto is already evolve that produce tons of altcoin which means this forum is already not exclusive on Bitcoin discussion alone.",

There is hardly any discussion of other investments like forex or stocks, or real estate. But in addition to discussing crypto investment, we have areas to discuss and share about the economy, politics, and life, and the part where people are most active is gambling. I think it would be great if the forum could add an area to discuss forex or stocks, that's just my wish.",

Because years ago, Bitcoin is all and even there are altcoins generated after that, they are not abundant like now so the term crypto market in the past is more narrow than nowadays.Nowadays, I think people join cryptocurrency market by being exposed either about Bitcoin or altcoins. I somewhat believe that they are more exposed with altcoins and by social media like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube than by traditional forums.However, after experiencing the market, they will come to a phase of needing to find classic evidence, things from the past or technical advice, they will likely join Bitcointalk. Many posts of Satoshi Nakamoto still have high value today. Satoshi is like a time-traveler.",
