I've no seen prop firm accounts relatable to crypto, rather there's golden chances of embracing good chances of earning and also losing in the system. I rather choose forex when it comes to emphasize made on prop firm accounts, Forex is consider the best option when it comes to choosing the best prop firm accounts, a trader could easily find one and make good use of them.",

      "body": "I think like 10 years ago or so I joined a prop firm. They had some crappy ad while driving one day and I decided to try it out.Was a disaster. Basically when you were new, your losses were capped. So unless you knew what you were doing at the beginning you would never make any decent money. Also the rest of the group had no idea what they were doing either. I donâ€™t think anyone there was a successful trader. A year later I think the place just shut down.",
