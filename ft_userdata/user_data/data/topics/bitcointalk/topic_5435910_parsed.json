Thinking about it, there are so many things I enjoy & to be honest, working isnâ€™t one of them. Thatâ€™s probably the same for most people though. Who enjoys working, not me.The biggest stress release is just relaxing, there are so many things you can do to just switch off & forget about work & all the stresses that surround it.",

Trying to do this is very hard, knowing that I have responsibilities at home that I am expected to do while Iâ€™m still trying to let go of the day. Trying to schedule my downtime to disconnect from the world is a must. I take a candle lit bath, exercise out of the house so that I am not being cooped up indoors all day. Not relaxing can be physical and most of it does mess with the brain. Mental conditions can deteriorate and can be taxing to your future, so I recommend that to start off with.",
