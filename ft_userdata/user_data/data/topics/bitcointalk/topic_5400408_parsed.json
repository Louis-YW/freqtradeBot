      "body": "this process is not like typical 3d printing as seen on yours krogoth - it does a layering system where it lays down a layer of \"powder\" or \"filament\" like dust and then uses lasers to precisely target and melt the filament together. once completed you then have to sweep away all the left over filament from the item. My guess is that somewhere during the process they pause it and add the key and then continue the print - thus truly enclosing the key and requiring it to be broken to expose the key.",

      "body": "I reached out and asked a few questions and got a prompt response:Hello Mark, we have no third party evaluation of our process at the moment.Our security concept is the following: running one single script \"OBOLITE MINT\" for generating encrypted files containing private key, adress, converting keys into QR code and serial number as picture files; using said files for texturing with preset OBJ and MTF, encryting the same for an also encrypted print job file and deleting print job file after printing. At the moment we sell so called pure wallets at Etsy. At our own shop obolite.com we start to sell wallets with small amounts of bitcoins and some altcoins (up to 15 USD/EUR) for people with minor interest in peer-to-peer-technique. Regarding the physical safety: It is not possible to scan the coin via x-ray to get the secret key. Furthermore, there is a nice en-passent feature from the printer itself: a thin layer of polyamid powder sticks at the inner QR code (which contains the private key). So I think its difficult to manipulate the coin as made them look like locked if once broken. In the future, we try to implement some optical features to prevent any counterfeiting.The sold coins come from the pinter as they are (with some sand jet cleansing). However, we think to use pearl shooting for a smoother surface. At present we have a more or less rough finish (which I call sandy finish at Etsy).BestIngolfI sent him a link to the board, I hope he participates!",

I wonder if either the machine that generates the keys or the one that prints them is ever online. Since, most printers are sort of going the online route these days, I think it would be best to assume that. Ideally, people that want to be selling these types of things, can prove the process rather than just saying the steps they take. Even, when it comes to highly trusted users in the space, it only takes mishandling that process to potentially unknowingly compromise it. Things like printers having storage, and storing previous files, then later selling that printer, something that someone might not at first thing of. So, yeah I'm probably in support of avoiding funding these, unless there was a provable way of generating them, and manufacturing them, which there probably isn't in this specific scenario or is probably too much effort for the potential sales they could get. Again, I'll echo the sentiment here, I'm not accusing anyone of anything, I just think it's good to be as security conscious as possible when it comes to things like this. Personally, I wouldn't want a large amount stored on a physical thing like this anyway.",

Of course you can order BTC coins with denomination from the website shop. I suggest you to pay with BTC.Than I wait for shipping the Etsy order and but the two orders together in one package. Please be aware that at the moment we should expect very long shipping times. DHL published up to 60 (!) days for shipping (due to Corona issues at European and/or U.S. harbors).I am also sending you a link to a video at google drive.https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LD5OKj7yaKzaEaVU9Bv9elvCFCHbO9G/view?usp=sharingThe video shows how to open an Obol and how to expose the inner QR code. You can see the powder layer, which I call the security layer. And also how to remove this layer. The QR code is very robust as the dye additive stains the nylon material (PA 12) about 70 microns deep (which is quite a lot).With regardsIngolfIngolf Bodemod note: PI redacted upon requesthttps://obolite.com/In any case, the denominations that are on it, I am not too concerned.  I agree completely, I would not use them to store any significant value of BTC at this point.  However, as a novelty they are really cool.  I might give them for a Christmas gift to some nephews.  I doubt these will be limited, but it is a good question.  Perhaps we can get him to join the forum (I mentioned it to him) and be part of the community.",
