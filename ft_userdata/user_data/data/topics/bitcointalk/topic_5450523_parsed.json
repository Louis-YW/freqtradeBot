I am sure the dead guy would really appreciate our efforts to diagnose and treat his mental health condition posthumously.",

One thing we should always realise is that we shouldn‚Äôt allow our problems to overcome us in such a distressful manner whereby mental disabilities and depression sets into our lifes. Everyone has one or two things they are going through in life, life itself is not perfect neither are we. We should always ensure that we let go every worries in no time so that our life‚Äôs can balance alongside our mental state.",

These days AI bots are better at having conversations than humans because humans lack the basic qualities that all mammals should have. And for that reason, I look forward to a future where AI dominates the planet. But to get that future, you will need to invest in reversible computing technologies, but you have not done that. Instead people like you are full of intense hatred and unrelenting anger because I want to do whatever I can to bring about the future filled with reversible AI. What a shame!",

For ladies it can vary Some could be body shaming, others lack of contentment, some relationship and abusive homes. Depression is one thing no one should ever wish for during my undergraduate days I got depressed when I could not afford my school fees and it got worst when the deadline came and I wasn't able to pay which I ended up repeating a full session. I got depressed it almost took my life but I am grateful to God almighty who helped me scale through that tough time.",

She was so good at what she was doing.Along the line, she lost focus and began to take life more like a competition, she was so glued to her phone that she ignored friends and family members and like flash, all her friends left her...She was still okay until, she became glued to her phone, neglected friends and family and like a flash, she lost not 1, not 2, but all of her friends....Depression set in when her closest friend gave her a piece of his mind in the most weirdest ways.Then she realized how much value in human forms she had lost and it seemed too late to retrace her steps..So that was it, gradually she began to see her self as less and not worth the kind of life she had, not worthy of anything good at all..***Depression sets in when you desire to have a particular life and it's not forth coming...Depression can come in from the loss of a loved one, just anything.Check up on people you love today, not everyone smiling is happy.Your *I love you*, can go a very long way and so to you reading this now, I love you and I wish amidst all odds, life favours you üôèüôèüôè",

Depression although is a mental issue in some cases, cannot make you slump and die when you did not try to kill yourself intentionally to be free from depression. Depression can lead to suicide, not sudden death. There are many depressed people walking about daily pretending to be alright but don't you have a conversation with them you find out that the exhibit some characteristics of depression. Depression is real and given a listening ear to someone can safe them.",

      "body": "Depression is a complicated mental health illness with numerous causes and contributing variables. It's crucial to remember that depression is caused by a variety of causes, including biological, psychological, and social influences. It's essential to remember that depression is a highly individualized experience, and what may cause depression in one person may not apply to another. Some common factors that may contribute to depression development include: 1. Biological : There is evidence that specific abnormalities in brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, can contribute to depression. Furthermore, genetics can add to a person's susceptibility to depression. If a person has a family history of depression, they are more likely to develop the disorder themselves.2. Psychology : A person's predisposition to depression can be strongly influenced by psychological variables. Individuals with low self-esteem, a negative self-image, or a tendency to be critical of themselves may be predisposed to depression. Furthermore, some personality qualities, such as being very critical of oneself, perfectionistic, or overly dependent, can raise the risk.3. Social reasons: A person's mental well-being can be influenced by social support and the quality of relationships. Depression can be exacerbated by a lack of social support, loneliness, or problems in personal relationships.4. Medical reasons: Chronic illnesses (such as cancer, diabetes, or heart disease), hormonal imbalances (such as thyroid disorders), or neurological conditions can all raise the chance of developing depression.Thanks !!",

A person who has someone that they can talk to will not easily get depressed unlike someone who always is reserved and barely has anyone to talk to.

Did he carry a placard that read \"I'm depressed?\". Well, thats not the issue. The thing is depression is a like a parasite that slowly eats at someone but most of the times, it has power only if we let it. We all go through so many issues that can cost us our sound mind but at times, allowing it to fester to the point that taking drastic decisions is the only option left most times proves harmful because then we get disconnected from loved ones who genuinely want to help.¬†I've seen first hand how depression can suck the life literally out of someone and asking the question about the reason people get depressed can be as a result of so many reasons; not meeting up goals, expectations and more.",
