  "content": "Are you interested in earning a $10 Amazon gift card for a 1-hour-interview? I am Linh Le, Ph.D. Candidate in the Rosen College of Hospitality Management at the University of Central Florida. I am conducting a research study to understand people's perception and intention to use cryptocurrency payment for travel, hotel, food and drink purchases. We are seeking adults from the United States (ages 18 and above) who own cryptocurrency and have made a hospitality or tourism purchase (i.e., hotels, restaurants, flights, car rent, traveling trips, etc.) within the last five years to participate in a research study. The participants will take part in a one-on-one interview with a researcher via Zoom. The interview includes several open-ended questions about whether you used or intend to use cryptocurrency for hospitality and tourism purchases. The interview will last approximately 45-60 minutes in length. Please leave a comment below or contact me at linhle@knights.ucf.edu if you are interested in participating in the interview. Thank you!",
