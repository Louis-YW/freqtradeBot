It will state it like this:Code:Enter the BIP39 passphrase for keystore: BIP39Under it is the master fingerprint. I think I did something wrong while importing my seed phrase. Is there anything I can do that Sparrow will not ask me to enter the passphrase anytime I just open the wallet. I prefer only the password.Or probably I will have no other option than to reimport the seed phrase and the passphrase.",

Thus if don't like to enter password twice restore wallet with your SEED and choose one of the two  opts- either use password to  encrypt wallet or use it to harden SEED phrase.",
