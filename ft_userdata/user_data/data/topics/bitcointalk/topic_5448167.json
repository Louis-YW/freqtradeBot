  "content": "We all have this dream of becoming a Satoshi millionaire, many people have the target of making their first 1 million dollars and yes that's a good thing, this is possible with crypto and Bitcoin and I am not here to discourage you.I have seen people taking this holding of Bitcoin too far, where they are doing all they can to accumulate Bitcoin. Like limiting their spending by all means, eating less food, and doing harder jobs, I just want you to know that we are living on borrowed time.Life isn't ours forever, take good care of yourselves, it is better to enjoy your labor than working all your life and leaving it behind for some people who aren't friendly to you while you are alive to enjoy your sweat.I am talking from experience, since my father died, everything he worked for, all his properties was taken over by those who despise him in the family when he was alive, since we have a very weird culture in the family we the children can't do anything about it. Bitcoin has a longer life span than our lives, we are going to leave Bitcoin behind one day unless the government finally killed Bitcoin  .Time is not on anyone's side, as you are working hard to make sure your dream becomes a reality make sure you are also spending on yourself and make sure you stay healthy. If you have to spend your Bitcoin to stay alive, do spend it, you will get another.If you have to spend your Bitcoin to save a life, do it, this is not the end.If you have to spend your Bitcoin to have a better life, do it, Bitcoin or Crypto isn't the only way to become successful. Take Good Care of yourselves.  Happy Easter",

I think like that, the point is to use bitcoin as wisely as possible to make you better and stay alive.But I feel wrong about saying that the government can kill bitcoin? in what way and how? The view that lies in me is that bitcoin will never die if electricity and the internet are still used on this earth.",

There have been people that discourages the holders because they've sold before the bull run. So what if they do that?

Not giving importance to one's health is a common mistake for everyone.  I have seen people thrifting themselves and buying unhealthy cheaper foods in order to save money and in the end spend their saved money to cure the illness caused by the accumulated lack of nutrients through years of savings.",

The main goal of saving is to have something to use when a financial emergency arises in our lives. Denying ourselves the pleasures of life, even when we desperately need them, is a betrayal of ourselves. This does not imply overspending to impress others when you do not have to. We all have to make some small sacrifices for something bigger in the future, but that should not be traded for the comfort of living a good and healthy life while it lasts.",

[health is wealth]But it does not matter you did not need to have an investment, if you earn $10 a day, there should be at least $2 for saving because you will never know what happen in the future. Perhaps some people criticize others for selling their bitcoin before a bull run, but it is important to remember that everyone has different financial goals and circumstances. What perhaps be the best decision for one person may not be the same for another. If selling your bitcoin during a difficult time or before a potential increase in value, then so be it. It is your money, and you should feel empowered to make decisions that are in your best interest --at least in the bad time, it solved your problem.",

If you can not spend to help better your life while you are alive, your relatives would help you to spend a little for your funeral and share the rest among themselves. There's no point in saving for the future while living a pitiable life if there is means. However, spending unnecessarily all in the name of no body knows tomorrow without saving is also not ideal.

This entails forgoing immediate gratification in order to secure a greater payoff in the future. What makes Bitcoin appealing is its predictable four-year cycle plan, which enables investors to reap profits at present and simultaneously plan for the next four-year cycle. It is important to note, however, that traders must diversify their investments to mitigate the risks and make up for losses in bear markets.",

I think what the OP is trying to point out is that it's good to save and have bitcoin and make profits out of it, but we all should understand priorities in life. That there is more important things that we need to take care of like our health, or help someone in our families financially if they are suffering from health issues.Quote from: Outhue on April 09, 2023, 05:11:05 PMIf you have to spend your Bitcoin to stay alive, do spend it, you will get another.Yeah, still doing since since day 1, used my bitcoin on whichever way I want, pay my bills, from credit card to internet. Exchange it to cash most of the time if I needed to buy some stuff. And then obviously, I used my crypto to gamble.Quote from: Hatchy on April 09, 2023, 05:31:32 PMIf you have to spend your Bitcoin to save a life, do it, this is not the end.I think I have mentioned it before here, my sister was hospitalized 2 years ago and diagnosed with cancer.

Don't hesitate to invest when it comes to your health.But don't feed too much yourself it should balance between enjoying the present and preparing for the future.  By practicing self-control and wise spending habits, you can ensure that you aren't sacrificing your current quality of life while still investing in your future financial stability.  Being financially prepared can also provide a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that you have a safety net to fall back on in case of unexpected events in the future.  So IMO, it's important to find a healthy balance between spending and saving to secure a stable financial future for yourself.All I can say is spend wisely your Bitcoin.",
