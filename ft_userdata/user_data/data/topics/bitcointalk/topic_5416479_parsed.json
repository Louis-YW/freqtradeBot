      "body": "The bear market is still ongoing, and has no signs of ending. So to predict whether Polkadot coins will be pumped in 2022 or vice versa. I'm sure the price of the coin will dump far from its current price. This is not the time for a bull market. If in October there is no sign of coins in the pump, then we need to wait until next April.",

      "body": "I didn't know DOT has fallen out of the top ten until I checked it just now hehe. Maybe take a look at the coin's previous ATH and go from there. Investors and retail traders usually expect projects to exceed that point in the next bullrun. That's the best I could give since I don't have this coin in my portfolio and I don't follow the development in the ecosystem.",
