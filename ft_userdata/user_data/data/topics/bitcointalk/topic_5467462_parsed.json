  "content": "Lately I have been reading a lot about the identity and the search for the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It has to be said that the person has given the world a new perspective with a very simple code and algorithm.When I look at the industry that has emerged from a simple algorithm, it seems enormous. To the point that it is still burning governments and unfortunately the SEC for the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Hence her and publicly in Satoshi Nakamoto's favourite forum, the opportunity to ask questions. Questions that have so far been waiting for an answer rather through the formation of myths? Questions about whatever? Also about Satoshi Nakamoto's upcoming projects?Ask! ----In der letzten Zeit habe ich sehr viel zur Identität und zur Suche nach der Person hinter dem Pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto gelesen. Festzustellen ist, dass die Person mit einem sehr einfachen Code und Algorithmus, der Welt eine neue Perspektive gestiftet hat.Schaue ich auf die Industrie, die aus einem einfachen Algorithmus entstanden ist, scheint enorm zu sein. Bis dahin, dass sie Regierungen und leider immer noch die SEC für die Person hinter dem Pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto verbrigt.Daher iher und öffentlich im Lieblingsforum von Satoshi Nakamoto, die Möglichkeit Fragen zu stellen. Fragen, die bisher eher durch die Bildung von Mythen auf eine Antwort warten? Fragen zu was auch immer? Auch zu den kommenden Projekten von Satoshi Nakamoto?Fragt!",

I have no questions for him, I admire the hard working individual that satoshi was and hopefully is today.",

The magic of implmentation lies in the fact that very close attention has been paid to the way analogue trade can be mapped in reality for the internet. And!How every trader who markets an analogue trade or service can participate in the value creation. In other words, it is not individual big players who decide what the price is for this or that, but the business partners who negotiate the price among themselves. [/quote]The idea here was much smaller than developing an entire industry out of it. Today, again, only whales share the BitCoins and others are allowed to put their money into a highly volatile investment.The original idea was that each person would run their own node on a normal computer. And thus is a participant in the wealth that is generated through this interaction. Even the seamstress in Bangladesh or the programmer in Bangalore would then be paid fairly via the network. By those who use their services.Quote from: jeffhight on September 27, 2023, 07:45:34 AMThe search for Satoshi's true identity continues to be a subject of great intrigue and speculation, as the impact of this pseudonymous innovator is undeniable.It is not important to stand on a pedestal in order to call an idea into the world. The decisive factor was that a few very good programmers then joined together in a collective and founded the network. All other cryptos today are derived from it.I am very sure that the idea had not been thought through to the end. And Saotshi Nakamoto will cause a stir with one or two more projects from the peer-to-peer stack. As a little birdie told me, there is still something to come. Stay tuned and enjoy.Quote from: jeffhight on September 27, 2023, 07:45:34 AMI have no questions for him, but I am very interested in how he looks.He looks like a normal person. You would pass him on the street. He is inconspicuous and sometimes modest.

He had nothing more to do with it. It was, in the sense, the clear takeover of the network by speculating on the BitCoin.The aim is to tie up enormous amounts of money. This money is then not available for other projects and an inflation of the BitCoin through professional BitCoin mining causes an inflation. These are old rules of the financial market: bet on something that does not exist or that does not represent a real value, then this system or network will be destabilised and eliminated.What was not expected in this respect is that the #Zero node was never found. Thus, the network virtually maintains itself without collapsing. It thus becomes robust. However, if the idea is expanded into a network based on peer-to-peer, people can lose their money, just like in a real collapse in the capital market. The peer-to-peer currency is a much more exciting project about the backbone on which value creation can be tied. And not money on the capital market, which does not reflect any real value or real value creation.We very often forget that!",

I'm just asking what questions people who think they have vestenaded BitCoin are asking themselves. Yes, there were some people who called themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. At the end of the day, these people were focused on speculating on BitCoin. They manipulated the price of BitCoin upwards or downwards.And from today's perspective, no one has been able to reflect the real power of the peer-to-peer currency concept.I am interested in serious questions? And who knows if there won't be an adequate answer.So, be brave! And ask!",
