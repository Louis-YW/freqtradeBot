  "content": "This post aims to show my appreciation to the ideals and goals of Maya Protocol towards a decentralized future.Maya ProtocolÂ  aims to build a permissionless, decentralized exchange as a backup service for the awesome THORchain, therefore contributing to the development of a truly decentralized future, where there is no single universal provider, there is teamwork between projects, and collaboration instead of competition.As Maya describes in their white paper; real competition comes from CEXs and traditional DEXs. Any user that Maya and THORchain bring from those alleys is a net positive for for the entire DeFi space. In other words, it is a game of adoption, and Maya will help drive this adoption forward toward a decentralized future.So yeah, I appreciate the effort towards true decentralization, therefore I like writing little posts like this one to show it.",
