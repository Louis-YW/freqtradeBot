Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/gemini-allegedly-suffers-data-breach-5-7-million-emails-leaked?utm_source=Telegram&utm_medium=socialCryptocurrency exchange Gemini appears to have suffered a data breach on or before Dec. 13. According to documents obtained by Cointelegraph, hackers gained access to 5,701,649 lines of information pertaining to customers’ account numbers, email addresses and partial phone numbers. In the case of the latter, hackers apparently did not gain access to the full phone numbers, as certain numeric digits were obfuscated.The leaked database did not include sensitive personal information such as names, addresses and other Know Your Customer information. In addition, some emails were repeated in the document; thus, the number of customers affected is likely lower than the total rows of information.",

Only the Gemini folks knowExactly, only to reduce user panic a few sentences in the report can be omitted.Just an assumption. I don't know how many types of databases Gemini has, just looking at the associated hacked data types I think it's a special database for users logging in to the Gemini interface. However I didn't find the phone number request as an optional login method. It is quite possible to say that the data leak is from a database that also contains information on all user data.",

So I guess a lot are indeed using this exchange not only because of this BAT earnings.",

In the end it does not matter since the data was entrusted to Gemini.

It’s far better if we just keep our coins in the wallet and only use exchangers whenever really necessary to do so. In fact it’s not even needed if we do peer to peer approach all the time.",
