The comments that I have read on Ammous from social media are not very good and have also been skeptical in his qualifications as an economist.The prominent people in bitcointalk appear to like him and find him a highly intelligent lecturer, however. It might be a good hiring.El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has onboarded Saiffedean Ammous – author of The Bitcoin Standard – as an Economic Advisor to the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador.In his role, the author will “advise on matters related to various economic policies,” while supporting Bukele’s policy of “economic liberty and bitcoin,” according to a Bitcoin office statement.Read in full https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvador-president-hires-bitcoin-standard-author-as-economic-advisor/",

Considering that El Salvador adopted Bitcoin just two years ago, it means that the country greatly needs individuals with broader experience and knowledge about Bitcoin.Ammous's contributions are quite convincing, as he has shown willingness to educate several students about Bitcoin in the past. This demonstrates Ammous's significant dedication to the progress of cryptocurrency worldwide.Ammous's presence can also provide solutions from a different perspective, thus ensuring more informed decision-making processes. The emotional support from an expert can have a profound impact on the advancement of cryptocurrency adoption in El Salvador.",

El Salvador paid its debt to IMF. Bukele seem to be doing it right and still got the support of the people despite the negative publication about him on the media outside their country.Ammous is controversial though and has opinions that some of us may not agree. But I think Bukele needs a mind of someone who has an anarchist mind but at the same time educator. Ammous I believe is qualified and most importantly he believe in decentralization.",

I am sorry but I do not have the same assumptions on the people in social media as you have. I cannot say for certain if these people are leftists, socialists or communists because they are also users, traders and holders of bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, scamcoins, memecoins and many more categories. These people might be very much similar to you and me.In any case, I am certainly skeptical, however, I wish Ammous the best of luck in his new job as El Salvador's economic advisor.",

Wasnt the president of Ukraine a comedian beforehe ran for government?You are right also in terms of \"advisor\", because of the point above government leaders cant be specialists in every area of government, they need advisors who specialisein a particular area.I think it's an ok appointment, it would be different if he hired him for the department of health...",

Probably has some talents in economics that need to be refined, which education from good quality school, experience possibly from Bitcoin or from someone who have mastered economics could possibly do.From my experience, learning about Bitcoin and its economic model could actually transform a person into a better economist. But it would be hard to replicate the model in centralized system without issues. Could work in a True libertarian society though. I hope the president would truely implement the standard like Decentralization of Power for this to work out well for the country.",

It is crucial for him to understand the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin. If he intends to compel people, either directly or indirectly, to engage with Bitcoin, it may not be a wise decision. Bitcoin should be embraced as a flexible and accepted form of legal tender without excessive overthinking or attempts to coerce the citizens.
