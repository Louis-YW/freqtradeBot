      "body": "Yes! You can't just do nothing by asking us of our favorite subject in school and only list subjects studied in school. You should have made it a professional writing by using your topic question to solve problems of interest. Sad to say, sincerely, this is exactly how not to write a topic. See, we are all here to learn lessons, and so far this platform has given us almost everything to learn from. Read posts with the intention of learning something new. Continue to study the thread until you, too, would grow up to maturity.",

So when other people exercise, I like to lie down in the school health room.but i used to like my english teacher. so I feel at home with English not because I like the lesson but I like looking at the beauty of the English teacher at that time hahahahahaoh shit, now i remember that i loved art lessons. because in art lessons such as painting, the situation is very quiet and quiet. and that makes me comfortable. and I happen to be good at painting. because I'm a loyal audience of cartoons or anime from Japan. sometimes I make manga.",
