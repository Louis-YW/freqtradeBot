There are gears that are being set in motion in the US government to clamp down on Bitcoin, so miners will be the easy targets for the government. This is how everything started in China and other countries where they banned or restricted Bitcoin activities. It is just a question of time, before a blanket ban or very strict regulation will be released by the US government... all the signs are there. (Tip : Relocate to Bitcoin friendly countries, before it happens)",

There are gears that are being set in motion in the US government to clamp down on Bitcoin, so miners will be the easy targets for the government. seems to like the game theory built in to bitcoin's design will work as intended thoughthe more that people try to consolidate mining into bigger and bigger organizations, the more likely that those big companies will get targeted by the gangsters from the legislature. this simply creates more incentive for decentralized mining, in all shapes and forms. That's the alternative side to the ordinals screeching that I've not heard mentioned much: fees outperformed the block subsidy quite consistently, and I think it's reasonable these days to say that we no longer have immature markets for both fees and BTC itself. in some super-censored mining scenario, large numbers of small miners can risk ignoring the diktats (whatever they may be) that the big miners cannot. smaller miners would be more profitable, and uncensored mining simultaneously reinforces their own ability to spend their unsanctioned block rewards. It's perfectly, beautifully balanced, and it was designed that way right from the start@ the aforementioned gangsters (desperately) trying to control this network:you've had nearly 15 years now. we're still waiting for some kind of faintly credible response",
