Certainly because 4CryptoBetNet is still quite unknown and not many people from here there have an account. Or it's due to the rollover of the prize. That might make it uninteresting for some people, but I can't understand that. Even with the roll over of 15x you can have a lot of fun even if there is no money left to withdraw. Well, I can't think of any other reasons.",

I don't mind rollover as long you can use the bonus to play and neither the deposit requirement as long as any amount counts.",

They have some ridiculous requirements that make it impossible to win anything. Participating here is a waste of time tbh.- 15x wagering requirement- deposits requiredNo idea why these kind of \"giveaways\" are even allowed here. They want to lure you on the site to lose money, this doesn't feel like giving back to the community.",
