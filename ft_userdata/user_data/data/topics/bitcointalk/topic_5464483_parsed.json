Why did you resized the image you posted to a small seize,  trust me the first seize fit perfectly fine for me. Edited:  now I can view the sportbets section with all the tournaments,  good luck hommy and let see what the next promotion/bonuses you have to offer to forum members,  because that bonus is what motivates new players to try out your casino.",

But it seems that Telegram gambling is not really an ideal way of getting customers and have people onboard on your platform.It is still best to have your own website and be focused there since you already have your own domain. Btw, welcome and be more conversational with the potential customers that you'll have on this thread of yours.",

The only thing that i dont like is this;When a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding EUR 2000 or requests a withdrawal of any amount inside leetbit.io Platform, then it is compulsory for them to perform a full KYC process.I would say that it is really just that a small amount which it could be easily be achieved out on that 2k eur deposit.Then asking these?A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back depending on the doc)A selfie of themselves holding the ID docA bank statement/Utility BillSource",

But full KYC when we reach a $2k deposit/withdrawal is a bit funny in my opinion. Why not from the start? I only see slots and e-sports... an interesting choice for a start. I see many good providers and the site generally looks nice and simple. You definitely need some promotions and bonuses if you wish to attract more people.   Welcome to the forum and good luck!",
