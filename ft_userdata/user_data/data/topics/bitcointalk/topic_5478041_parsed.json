Thanks, MartinCorrections are common and to those people who had been liquidated are the ones who had been hit up by counter trend. So this is something that new anymore.You want some heatmap.? Check in here.https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationDataTalking about liquidations then this might be not updated but this could at least put some picture out.Roughly $260 million of longs were liquidated on April 19; this is the biggest liquidation for longs in 2023.Roughly $250 million of shorts were liquidated on April 14, previously the most liquidations seen this year.Source: https://cryptoslate.com/insights/biggest-long-liquidation-event-for-crypto-in-2023-took-place-on-april-19/Numbers are counting adding up into those recent liquidations.So why would you care that much about to those people who had lost up their trades?What specific details you do really want to hear? Aside on getting liquidated?",

Thanks, MartinThis is the risk of being too greedy and not setting your stop loss price, we know that the market is still not stable and yet we choose to be more greedy. The correction is normal and you should always anticipate it. Futures liquidity always at a bigger risk, I’m still wondering why many are not using the stop loss feature especially when they are away from their monitors and still have an open position.",

Bitcoin halving is around the corner as it will happen in April 2024.With this view, you will see corrections as very great chances for you to accumulate more bitcoin with discount prices.",

Then another thing you say you saw is just your assessment, and it's not 100% certain that it will actually happen. Even if you say that you have a source link for that, if there is, it will still remain speculation.  Even though I see a correction in the market, I cannot say that this is what will happen; it can happen and it can also not happen. Because the market is so volatile and unpredictable, the same thing happens to the ecosystem we live in for a few years.",

And 10x leverage is not considered that large.Over the past few weeks it seems bitcoin has actually set a support level above that $40k price which could actually make them save from liquidation but I am thinking that will change should either it will go up if the ETF spot gets approved or will break it if it gets rejected or postponed.

For re accumulation I will advice you to start DCA because with bitcoin rallying up again and looking to find support between $40k to $42k I am not so sure that would break now except the anticipated ETF approval takes a different turn.",

Losses are counted on regular basis in the market, losses are only recorded after failing to spot out promising projects in the system. The indication is mapped out as good sign of winning but we just have to be careful on confirming opportunities in the market or in a single trade. Whenever I'm in the market, I ensure to triggered good position on confirm entries. Market correction can only be triggered during bull and bear season.",

Thanks, MartinIt was not some fundamental factor that cause that temporary correction instead it was a technical one therefore we are calling it a correction and to be honest I was expecting one but did not expecting one so soon therefore I was also shocked but fortunately as a Muslim I avoid future trade and many of my fellow too.Therefore due to this avoiding I was saved by the market as I don't trade in future but profile looks red when it dumped but I had enough belief in the market that it will recover soon and will try to cross the ath of this year again and will break through. The dump was so quick that more than 500 million dollars were liquidated at that day and people were really frustrated but they should not do future trading until they see a good opportunity.",

Were you or anybody you know involved in a losing trade that day? If so, would you mind sharing some details about it? Thanks, MartinI am a private trader and a careful one for that matter, I do not take excessive risk and I know how to liquidate my positions when seeing the warning sign of a potential retracement or reversal on the chart. This is why I plan my trade very well before I open the risk and I do this in such a way that it helps me have enough margin that can sustain my account in time excessive drawdown before the positions get liquidated. This was what I observed this time on Bitcoin too, because I saw the trouble coming early enough, which I believe every reasonable trader should know as well not after the damage is done. Also, I don't know traders who got caught in the web of this recent retracement. I always advise the ones I know right before issues arise. But for so many others that are known, they are investors rather than traders, so they do not have to worry about a mere retracement. The market will always retrace against those who HODL it, but it's certainly not a cause for worry. The market that retraces is the same market that will double the earnings for them when the time is ripe.",

Thanks, MartinOf course, many people's accounts have been washed,but in futures trading we must not always ignore that if we can make a very good profit, our risk of loss is also greater than that.Therefore, people who trade with high leverage usually suffer more losses, so you should always protect yourself with low leverage and stop loss.I personally don't do futures trading and never intend to, because it doesn't feel right to me anyway so I always prefer spot trading.I often see the market go short where people try to go long and the market goes up where they expect to go short,and thus people's accounts lose a huge amount.This is the cryptocurrency market, there are often cases like this.What details will they provide to you Everyone knows how people's accounts are treated in such a situation.",
