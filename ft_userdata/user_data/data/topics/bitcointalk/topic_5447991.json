      "body": "Bitcoin mining hashrate should technically increase in countries with the most amount of energy where the price of it is also super cheap. In other words if what you said is reliable, it is just an energy related natural growth which has little to do with the \"situation\".In any case I have yet to see a solid work with reliable data that proves the percentage of hashrate coming from each country is what they say it is. So far the existing stats is disappointingly based on news hence it is either fake or unreliable. For example the stats about US hashrate is mostly based on a fake news a while ago that \"Chinese miners migrated to US after the ban\" among other things whereas in reality the Chinese miners migrated to Kazakhstan and other countries in Asia and some to Hong Kong.Or for example last year during summer a news came out that \"Iran has banned mining during summer to prevent network overload\" and then all these stats sites which pretend to report \"reliable data\" started reporting Iran's hashrate as zero while in reality that was just a news of a proposal that was never enforced hence the hashrate never really changed.",

Therefore, it is rather difficult to assess the progress of any country in an industry dependent on the supply of equipment from China.",

The climate is quite cooperative compared to the need for ASICs in terms of temperature, and above all, the electricity is really cheap.I had wondered during the mining problems in Kazakhstan if iall the ASICs were going to end mining in Russia or not at this time.I am really curious to see what consequences the changes in American law will have on the taxation of mining etc.. I wonder where all these ASICs are going to be hosted if things are not going well in the USA, Russia seems pretty good bet, but in some North Africa nations it's starting to open up on the mining issue and they have unbeatable power rates. I think that when the infrastructure will allows it, they will emerge",

This shows that despite regulatory challenges, the crypto industry is still thriving in Russia.My opinion about the growing Russian Domination in Bitcoin mining has potential geopolitical implications. As Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance and adoption, countries with significant mining power may have more influence in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency. This has the potential to give Russia more leverage in global discussions and negotiations involving Bitcoin.Russia's rise as the second largest Bitcoin miner is a significant development for both the country and the cryptocurrency industry. This demonstrates the growing interest in Bitcoin mining and highlights the potential for other countries to become major players in the space. It will be interesting to see how this trend continues to develop in the coming years.",

Russia could take advantage of this due to its vast reserves of energy raw material and eventually become the first. Miners have their businesses but they don't have to stay at any location and nation because of any lifespan contract. All are temporary and they are flexible on where they locate their mining farms. If they feel the local government and / or electricity source is no longer friendly and cheaply with their operations, they will switch to other locations and nations.Since the Mining Migration by China Mining Crackdown, many big farms move to neighbourhood nations like Kazakhstan which becomes one of biggest nations for Bitcoin Mining and the USA. Now and in future, if regulations on Mining change in USA. like USA Mining Crackdown, miners will move to other nations.Data on mining and where miners come from are not correct because we can not know where they are actually from just base on their IP addresses.Many Assumptions in methodology of CBECI's data collection",

Yeah, they will have to find a way as well to stay afloat in their war with Ukraine, so they might as well take advantage of their cheap and renewal energy to mine bitcoin.And who knows, this could be state sponsored in the future, meaning they could be as friendly to bitcoin as anyone has been specially bitcoin mining since China has ban it already.

Imagine if Bitcoin becomes worth $10,000,000 after the next halving following the one upcoming. $1.375 million per block at a rate of $10,000,000 per bitcoin would mean:- $1.375 billion per 1000 blocks generated- $13.75 billion per 10000 blocks generated- $137.5 billion per 10000 blocks generatedThe United States has already submitted to Bitcoin by imposing the 30% tax on mining, validating the switch from banning to support. As miners leave to countries with less tax, the US will have to reduce their tax further to try and keep miners within the country. In my opinion, it's only a matter of time before government sponsored mining operations become a part of the network.",
