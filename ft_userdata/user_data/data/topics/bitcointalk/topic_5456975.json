  "content": "I am a small Bitcoin holder with less than 0.01 bitcoins. I understand to some extent the importance of keeping my coins safe. Most of my coins are stored in my software wallet, while a few are kept on exchanges for quick transactions in case of emergencies (PS: I wouldn't be feel bad if the exchange shuts down). I recently came across multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet technology. I am still studying it, but I am wondering, as a small Bitcoin holder with less than 0.01 bitcoins, if I should really be concerned about using it. Considering that I am an average user, do you recommend multi-sig wallets for Bitcoin holders in my category?",

      "body": "If you do it properly, multi sig is very secure. If you do it improperly, it's no more secure than anything else. A secure method two devices one of which is preferably not Internet connected holding your keys an. A non secure method just having them both on one PC.The more you have separated the better it is. The other question then becomes what works for you, 2 of 3 or 3 of 5 or 4 of 7 and so on.For that choice a lot of people could give you advice. But you have to figure out what is going to work for you.That, or get a hardware wallet. Which also works quite well. Once again, there are dozens of them you have to figure out what works for your particular situation and how you want to do things.Starting now, where you have a smaller amount of coin makes it a lot easier to get into and stay with good security practices. After you've accumulated more and you've had no issues, it's easy to say meh I don't have to worry about it all these people are too paranoid. But if you've been doing it since the beginning you don't have to get into a more secure habit you've already been doing it so you're already there.-Dave",

There are in fact two additional costs to using multisig.The direct cost is the increased fee. A mutisig transaction requires multiple signatures and public keys to be included in each transaction so the transaction size will be bigger than a single-sig transaction. So you pay more fees.The indirect (or non monetary) cost is the extra effort it takes to set the wallet up correctly and safely and also to keep it safe specially when using the wallet each time you want to create a transaction. Depending on the number of signatures (eg. 7 sig!) it could be a tremendous amount of effort. Not to mention the time it consumes.",

Mostly used in commercial tx (kind of joint account), so didn't bother to have a look.Here are a couple of example transactions.https://mempool.space/tx/39f7408cce01667633e28e76fb824ebf3f671d861f2a174596accde2ea858a49This is a fairly standard 1-input 2-output transaction which uses all standard P2WPKH segwit addresses. If you scroll down and click on \"Details\", you'll see the actual transaction data which is being paid for by the fees. The total size of the data for this transaction is 140.25 vbytes.https://mempool.space/tx/68abd912ebd0e0303c803e61a70418cb6fd56fd4700a1d4f1560b26e06dd9249Here is another segwit 1-input 2-output transaction. However, this one uses a 2-of-3 multi-sig for the input, and sends the change back to the same 2-of-3 multi-sig. Click details on this and you'll see the transaction data is much larger. Instead of the input containing one signature from the one public key as it did above, it now contains 2 signatures from 3 public keys. This means instead of the input being 68 vbytes, it is now 104.5 vbytes. You'll also notice that sending the change back to the multi-sig address also uses slightly more data. A P2WPKH output takes 31 vbytes, while a P2WSH output takes 43 vbytes. All in all, this transaction is 188.5 vbytes, so around 48 vbytes larger than the one above.",

So you need to take care of that matter as well.I always suggest backing up xpubs alongside each seed phrase. For a m-of-n multi-sig, you can back up n minus m specific xpubs alongside each seed phrase and still have full redundancy while preventing a single back up from revealing all your xpubs and therefore allowing an attacker to spy on you wallet.Taking a 3-of-5 as an example, then alongside each seed phrase you need to back up 5-3=2 specific xpubs. My 5 back ups would look like this:Back up 1: Seed A, xpub B, xpub CBack up 2: Seed B, xpub C, xpub DBack up 3: Seed C, xpub D, xpub EBack up 4: Seed D, xpub E, xpub ABack up 5: Seed E, xpub A, xpub BAny three back ups provide everything needed to fully recover my wallet, whereas the compromise of one (and sometimes two) back ups does not allow an attacker to either steal my coins nor spy on my wallet.",

Multi-Sig is definitely worth trying even if you only have 0.01 BTC and there is no restriction on having a certain amount of BTC. As you said, 0.01 BTC in the future might be very valuable and worth more than it is now. Maybe when BTC reaches $100k or $1 million ATH it will provide more profit.
