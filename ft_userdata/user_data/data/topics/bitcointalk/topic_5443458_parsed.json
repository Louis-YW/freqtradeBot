You must do two other important things1. Keep your backups safely from others to avoid risk that they will steal it (if they are greedy) or throw it away (because they did not know importance of that piece of paper).2. Make sure you assign a place for your backup storage and it's always in your mind. In case there is emergency, you can quickly know where it is and can take it to run away.",

It's essential to keep your backups in a safe and secure location that is inaccessible to others. This can help prevent theft or accidental damage to your backup, which can be devastating if you need to access it in an emergency and if you find yourself in a situation where you need to quickly access your backup, you'll know exactly where to find it.  This can be especially critical during emergency situations when time is of the essence.",

Ideally, you want somewhere that is accessible and permanent but if the air becomes unbreathable due to chemical fires, you won't be able to access it. Having a backup location, with your seed phrase is probably a good idea. It is also showing me the importance of using BIP39 passphrases to add a layer of protection if I need to ask a friend or family member to keep a copy for me.",

Your mom put your backup phrase into a garbage can, so it was probably on the floor which is why she was able to sweep it and throw it with the garbage. Read the OP a little better, because he just showed an example of another member, it's not his story. Regarding the topic of backups, there are hundreds of similar threads discussing how to achieve the best security and reduce risk to a minimum, but there is no single method that can be considered absolutely safe. One backup is generally a bad idea, but multiple backups in the same location also doesn't make much sense. Unfortunately, most people cannot afford to keep their backups in different locations, so you have to be innovative and creative. Whatever you do about it, don't talk about it to friends and acquaintances, but also to family members who don't know how to keep their mouths shut.",

Imagine you have teach your family members about Bitcoin and your backup, they will remember today and maybe until the next few weeks. But after a year, they might either forget or they might accidentally mention if it's your Bitcoin backup when your family members discovered it.",

Write the seed down in a strong book and keep the book where you can lock it up, or stainless steel is even more reliable,  this has been discussed too many times on the forum, find one and use nail or a sharp object to carve the words on the stainless steel.",

If it was neatly written and kept properly, maybe among other of your important things in a way that it is not obvious that it is a seed phrase but enough to show that it is important, your mom will not have thrashed it. Asides you not keeping your room clean which should be your responsibility, you also have failed to properly keep your recovery phrase. If your house, room or space is always messed up, it will be difficult to know if someone entered and touched your things since everywhere is always scattered. But if you keep a tidy space with things always well kept, unless you are not the observant type, someone cannot enter and touch/tamper with your things without you knowing.",

Having an alternate backup spot in a separate location is an excellent idea, and it's crucial to ensure that both locations are safe and secure.I agree with Lucius that there is no foolproof method for protecting our backups, but having multiple backups in different locations can certainly reduce the risk. It's good to be innovative and creative, especially when we can't afford expensive high-end commercial solutions, like safe deposit boxes in banks and the like. Overall, it's important to consider all the possible scenarios and risks and take the necessary precautions to protect our assets as best as we can.",
