  "content": "Something happened on my way to work today: I saw a young girl of about 18 years or so old wearing a skimpy dress and looking disorganized. Her mother was with her, and the woman was wailing, telling people that she didn't know what to do with her daughter, who had been introduced to drugs by her friends. She was crying uncontrollably. This reminded me of an incident that happened years ago while I was hospitalized. I was in severe pain due to a major surgery I had undergone. A nurse gave me a particular injection that day, and immediately, I felt a sense of calmness and joy (euphoria). I asked the nurse what drug it was, and she told me its name. The next day, I requested the same drug again from the doctor. I know some people get addicted to drugs through this means, but I never allowed that to happen to me because I understand the dangers of drug misuse, and I value my life. abeg I no won die youngðŸ˜ƒ.Â We all know that we will eventually pass away, but we should not hasten our demise carelessly through drug abuse. I would also advise medical practitioners to refrain from providing patients with controlled drugs, as it can unintentionally introduce them to addiction.There is no benefit in misusing drugs, as the disadvantages to your overall well-being are numerous. Drug abuse can lead to kidney problems and weaken your immune system, making you more prone to infections and illnesses. It can also result in mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Drug abuse often leads to financial problems, strained relationships, and legal issues. It can also hinder Â your educational and career prospects, and contribute to a cycle of addiction that can be challenging to break free from. Therefore, it is very very crucial to avoid drug abuse and seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with substance misuse.I advise her to seek professional help from healthcare professionals, therapists, or addiction counselors who can assess her situation and provide guidance and treatment options. She can also look for a rehabilitation center that specializes in helping people with similar issues. I come dey think if we have one around. It is well, my people. Be careful out there and don't allow peer pressure to lead you into destructive behaviors.Do we have rehabilitation centers for cases like this in every state?\"",

In my neighbourhood, almost all the teenagers are into drug abuse. The funny thing is that they dedicate more time to it and spend heavily on it, without thinking of the consequences of it. The society has a way of involving these youths into drugs, either through their friends or role models.The rate of drug abuse is increasing every day and government needs to do something on this matter, because it is making them to become useless to the society. We have rehab centres but how well are they functioning is what I don't know. What annoys me most is that, when you will be telling these youths about the disadvantage of drugs abuse, they wouldn't listen to you because they think that they are on top of the world.

I also thought it was going to be a story about you, how you survived addiction to drugs or something similar to that but it turned out to be another personâ€™s story. The story is interesting and this happens everywhere. Most of this cases are caused by socialization through peer groups; which is one of the primary area of socialization where the child is vulnerable to anything that comes their way. With a good home background, the likelihood of it happening could be reduced but cannot be avoided.QuoteDo we have rehabilitation centers for cases like this in every state?\"Rehabilitation centers are in every state in Nigeria I think, because in some states, more rehabilitation centers are being built in major towns (LGA) within the state to help caution drug abuse and reduce it to its minimal level.",

Be careful out there and don't allow peer pressure to lead you into destructive behaviors. You really did a good job. I agree with the advice you give, but drug abuse is one of the major problems or issues we have in Nigeria due to some factors that we donâ€™t take seriously and think are normal. The high group that is being affected by drug abuse is the adolescent and the young adults (youths). These ages range from 13 to 30 years of age, so if we actually want to bring an end to this issue of drug abuse in our country, we need to know the factors that influence the youth into drug abuse. These factors include the following:* poverty * lack of parental care* depression * lost of loved ones* peer group influenceAnd so on, so when you look at the major factors that cause drug abuse, you can see that we can control some of the factors ourselves before a child or youth get involved in drug abuse. Let's take the lack of parental care as a topic for discussion based on your story. Op you said it was a woman with her daughter aged 18, you said the woman was crying that she didnâ€™t know what to do with the girl, base on the story I can say the affected (the daughter) was into drug abuse due to lack of parental care because if the mother spent enough time with her daughter and also create a sense of friendship with her daughter ,the daughter will be open minded to her mother because she will feel that her mother is like a friend to her and the daughter will also tell her almost all her feelings and some secret and the mother can identify if her daughter is depressed or if she is being introduced by her peers but our Nigerian mother donâ€™t create that friendship with there children why am saying this is because I studied health counseling for some years now so apparently I will say I also a heath counselor and also a psychologist, so this issue is not we stay and fold our hands and say is only the work of counselors money is now hard to get in this country so let play our role in our community to see the end of drug abuse in our country",

In the health line, we donâ€™t address only expensive hard drugs as the only drug used for drug abuse; we also address those low-cost drugs as drugs used for drug abuse, for instance, cigarettes (indian hemp), marijuana (weed, ganja, and loud), codeine, and so on. All these are low-cost drugs that can be affordable for the poor because many poor people feel depressed, rejected by rich friends, unemployed, and other factors that increase the risk of many poor people being involved in drug abuse.And again you say that person wey never chop bellyful no fit abuse or afford drugs. I am against this sentence because those involved in drug abuse are very cooperative in the sense that they can contribute money within them to buy hard drugs and use it within themselves; some of them even borrow money to buy them; some collect the hard drugs from the dealers in depth to pay later; so my putting poverty inside the factors causing drug abuse is not by wish but by research and survey, and it is well confirmed.",

Some of them have been mentioned by a poster here for your perusal. It would be nice you go through them and possibly do your research online to see more for yourself.Drug abuse is now a big challenge in our society today. It does not only bother around the youths alone but the teens and elderly also are involved in it. I remembered my youth service year while serving there's this guy that usually takes codeine and he does that without the doctors prescription. He takes it any how and when I asked him he said it is his sleeping tablet and that is how he is able to sleep which makes it very difficult to stop as he is fully addicted to it. I told him the risk involved and how to be able to stop the addiction gradually. He was all ears willing and ready to stop and I talked him through and that was close to my POP. I believe by now he must have stopped it. Sometimes they do need somebody to talk them through not to want to make it looks like as if they are criminals and outlaws. Most people into drugs are Â people going through lots and all they could think of is a way of forgetting their past or experience by getting involved in drugs just to do away with their past.",
