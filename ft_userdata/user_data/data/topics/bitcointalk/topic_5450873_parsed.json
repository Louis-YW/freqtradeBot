  "content": "I've read from some forum members expressing Sentimental analysis wrongly, hence the need for me to explain it today. Perhaps, it could be useful for some people in theory and in practice.Basically, there are two types of analysis, and they are Technical and Fundamental analysis, however, they will always be the only true analytical types in trading. The sentimental analysis on the other hand relies on what other traders have analyzed and concluded through Technical and Fundamental analysis and research. To make it clearer, Sentimental analysis is the act of sorting for or collecting established signals, data, market biases and commentaries of other traders/experts. This happens mostly when traders don't believe in themselves. They might want to solely rely on the external signals/data they trust or use them to confirm their own analysis.The screenshots below should give further clues: Does Sentimental analysis work?Yes, it does if used rightly, and I'd used it before getting to my present state in trading. All you need is to find the right channels for your information and you will be fine. The people using this analytical type can collect as much as possible data for a particular asset before they eventually use the ones with the highest number or percentage in a particular direction as their chosen signal/bias.Image sources: Online (Investing, ActionFX, FXSSI)",

So from my POV, it's totally manipulating the market based on someone's personal comment. Which has nothing to do with the original analysis and doesn't rely on any data.

You can also add some technicals to filter out some bad trades but in general, nothing is the holy grail method.Like I've iterated, it would work if you used it well. It worked for me back in those days and I learned my trading through the commentaries of the experts I read their work. You see, the sentimental analysis approach is many but the best is to look for sites that give daily commentaries and biases, you may use other ones with percentage dashboards, but should use them to compare your own analysis first.And if they tally, you can open the trade without fear. Most people are entering into trouble with sentimental analysis because they solely rely on external sources. Still, some external sources are good, only that you just take time to verify them first. At least, I know two of them back then, and they didn't fail me, they as a matter of fact thought me part of what I know today.Quote from: tjtonmoy on May 01, 2023, 07:51:45 PMQuote from: EarnOnVictor on May 01, 2023, 05:34:47 PMTo make it clearer, Sentimental analysis is the act of sorting for or collecting established signals, data, market biases and commentaries of other traders/experts.

This could be Buy/Positive, Sell/Negative or Neutral depending on the demand and supply in the market. This is in no any way related to sentimental analysis, you should know the difference.Quote from: Hamza2424 on May 01, 2023, 08:06:49 PMHmm, I would like to know which user can you particularly mention, because I think I have also recently covered this topic, and if you have read it then there is a possibility if you have read it completely you might misunderstand it.I've certainly not read your post in this regard, once a topic is similar, you might think it's you the finger is pointing to, but no one should feel this way. It's just a general conception of what I have been reading from posters regarding sentimental analysis. The main goal is for everyone interested to learn from it.",

You do not rely on the fundamental and technical analyses, but just believe that after a massive rain, that the sun will come out and shine again. That is what I see as sentimental analyses. Sentimental analysis is the type that an investor do not rely on fundamental and technical analyses but still able to use other means to predict what the price of a coin can be in the future.

It is unavoidable since you get somewhat outdated data if you rely on another party to collect and aggregate the market movement for you. It is true that sometimes it works, but a broken clock can also do the same thing if you let it run long enough. At the end of the day, most indicators can fail for various reasons. I doubt people only use one type of indicator to decide their trade anyway. As long as they know and realize that they can get tricked by self-fulfilling prophecy or being used by big players as exit liquidity, they should be able to filter the information.",

Apart from data gotten from technical and fundamental analysis, you refuse to talk about the emotion of traders that also arise from same data analysed. Greed and fear are majorly what makes sentiment a factor to be considered in trading. It is not enough to trigger sell or buy because they are what are shown in trading channels, what about when market is over sold or over bought, this is why late emotional comers pay the price by losing.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on May 01, 2023, 05:34:47 PMThis happens mostly when traders don't believe in themselves.

It is true that if used correctly, this will give you an edge over your trading. It is a double edge sword.What's difficult in this is your dependency on the channels you are gathering information. How much trust can you put on other people's analysis? As long it is true, as long as the information you get is helpful and beneficial to your trading, then simply use it. And don't use it as your signal, use is as an information to come up with your own decision. Otherwise, you're gambling other people's analysis.Quote from: Dunamisx on May 02, 2023, 12:08:15 PMIn bitcoin trading and looking it from the general perspective, both the fundamental and sentimental analysis were both required for a proper trading experience, one cannot rely on one against the other because they were both useful in making market strategy and speculations on the price, one thing we may not get as an assurance is the use of any of these analysis as a guaranteed means to predict right and always make positive outcome with increasing income, everything though work together to make the market favourable and to aligned to the direction of how we've seen it already. Absolutely right! Not because you use many things in your analysis means you will have great returns in your trading. Analysis and Trading are two different things. The main goal here is to get in line where the market is likely to reprice and as a trader you have to capitulate that move. Trading is simple, and that's also what make's it hard. Its simplicity.",
