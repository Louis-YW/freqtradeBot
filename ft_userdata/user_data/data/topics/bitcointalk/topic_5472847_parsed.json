It's main purpose is to discuss all relating to btc price. You can just lock it and reply over there instead. Replying to your topic of discussion, I don't think there's been any significant decrease or change in price of Bitcoin for some weeks now, it's still hovering around the 33k-35k price.",

And if you dey follow the bitcoin news and follow the price in different exchanges and trading view, you would have make a good thread from it. But that is not withstanding. You tried Sha. But bitcoin price never go down from yesterday go and check it again though I don't know where you got the information from. For about a week now the price is $34k+ and the price is unpredictable. We all know that the price will go up to the ATH. Before the halving in next year, the price will hit $40+k and in the bull market the price will hit $80+k so everything will okay at the bull market.",

If what you mean was that it's unusual for crypto currency to fall below or within %50 I think you are getting it all wrong. Crypto currency expecialy Bitcoin is not stable and that is what makes it unique from normal fiat currency. It's volatility makes it profitable on investing. I think if not it's volatility I don't think if people would be able to invest in it. The primary aim why people gain from Bitcoin is the price changes. Just like Michael J Saylor CEO of MicroStrategy, who invested on bitcoin on the 8/8/2020 with the sum of $250m at the rate of $11653k  per btc. on the 14/9/2020 he also baugh Bitcoin worth $175m at the rates of $10419k per btc. he fother baugh Bitcoin worth of $50m on the 5/12/2020 at a total sum of $475m at the rate of $19427k per btc and a total of about 40,824btc today he is Worth $1,134,639,838.34b. if not for Bitcoin volatility how on Earth would he have made this huge sum of money I will show you the spreadsheet Link source==>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005331/en/MicroStrategy-Adopts-Bitcoin-Primary-Treasury-Reserve-Asset",

Although we have not had this kind of topic here to discuss the volatility of the bitcoin market and how we can program and prepare ourselves towards it because making the right move and plans in line with these market forces will increase our chances of making the best out of the market at per time and being able to take advantage of of the market.",

Even as price dey go up, some people go dey sell and if the people wey dey sell over a period pass people wey dey buy, price go start to go down until buyer plenty again to make the price continue to go up. Na like this the price dey behave and if we take note of this thing, we no go dey panic when price go down small. Many people dey like buy when price go down and them dey call am buying the dip. The good thing about buying in the dip is that the price go dey very low when you check am with when price dey for up. The only problem wey for buying at the dip be say e dey hard to know when the dip reach or if price don actually reach the dip. Because of this, many people dey miss the chance to buy and price dey move leave them as them dey drag leg.",

For now with the looks of how the price is actually pumping it will be hard for someone to guarantee a reduction in the price but all the same past experience have show that this particular time is not actually the period that Bitcoin touches or reaches a new ATH but although we could say it's gathering momentum for the bull season pump that normally occurs after the halving period.",

Bitcoin price was not listed on exchange at $58k, it was around some scent to a bitcoin I understand, now imagine you have like $50 dollar worth bitcoin since that year and hold it to now. What you should even be comparing is what $50 dollar can buy 10 years ago and what it can buy now, but if you have bought that amount of bitcoin 10 years ago, you will worth a millionaire, you didn't just beat inflation, you beat poverty as well.When you want to invest in Bitcoin, what you should be looking after is the long term return and not this short term loss, the loss is not even a loss yet until you sold, the negative 50% you are complaining is unrealize loss because if you didn't sell your bitcoin, you have not actually loss. It's not like I'm giving you assurance of tomorrow but one day, we will discuss how $37k was so high for people, that was how I believe $20k of the previous all time was discuss that it will never pass that price but look at it today.Keep it in mind that bitcoin has a rule, what goes down must surely comes up and when it comes up, it will make another journey and may return again before sailing off again for another all time high, that is what bitcoin price has been doing historically. So buy the amount you think you can hold and enjoy the ride in profits.",

But you are right though because with all the recent happening with Bitcoin we should have built alot of confidence on it by now because the volatility itself is the main reason and chance given to people that have actually missed the past opportunity to buy when the price was freaking low. Let's take another good illustration, imagine buying 1k$ worth of Bitcoin as of late last year when the price was still low in the bear season around 19k and holding it now that the price is getting to 38k$ , you would have been getting close to doubling of your actual capital used for buying and it's also a good gain if you ask me don't you think and this is just the beginning of the price going up, because we might even get to 50k$ who knows? Nothing is impossible with the price movement of Bitcoin.",
