These things can happen which is why all precautions must be made, he shouldn’t have left the gun loaded in the vicinity of the dog if he wasn’t actively hunting at the time.I hope his family can find peace & the dog is looked after & loved. I hate reading about death, life can be cut short in an instant, such a tragic loss.",

      "body": "Such a heartbreaking story, that this man was shot, literally by his best friend. A dog, of all things, what an obscene way to pass away. This would have not been something the dog would have ever wanted to happen. This man had a death wish by loading his guns already. I guess that when you live in another country there is no such thing as gun safety. We never know when how long we are left on earth. I believe what is ethical this is an accident, the dog should not be disciplined or put to death. At least that man passed knowing that he lived his life to the fullest.",

Maybe the dog wants freedom, or the respect it deserves. It is a queer story indeed, and the most faithful animal does kill a murderer",
