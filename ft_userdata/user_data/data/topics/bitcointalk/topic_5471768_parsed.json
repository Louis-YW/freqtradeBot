It's just reguler baccarat ?Hi ryzaadit,Currently it is just a daily email where I play one hand of baccarat everyday. The daily email comes with a poll attached where you can try to predict who will win the next hand (Player, Banker or tie). You can see a test email on https://baccarat.beehiiv.com/p/baccarat. My subscribers that predict the hand correctly get rewards and get a higher chance of winning giveaways in the future. We are also in the middle of creating social media groupchats for the community. I didn't expect this to take of so quickly so please bare with me",

It's just reguler baccarat ? That is what I wanted to comment on. It is only subscribe that is there and some Chinese writing supported by small English explanation of \"Today\" or \"Tomorrow\". Op at least even the casino is from non English speaking countries let it be that English language should be used in the general boards in the gambling section so everyone can participate and if you want it to be locally participation then you you should write it clearly that it is only for the country gamblers so with that non native speaker can avoid such thread. Or preferably, drop it in the local board. And your site still need a lot to work on. Now if I subscribed what will I do or received? Or the main link will be send to the subscribed email for me to continue? Baccarat is a nice game which even household use to play to pass time and most for fun. So make things easier for user to participate here.",

Over here in the forum, we care about working products rather than people farming emails and hoping to make the most out of email marketing.There are services offering database filled with emails where they can give, for a considerate price, emails of people within a particular niche so as to achieve your set goals.",

Ordinarily one would have ignored it but OP tries to get email through the wrong way for his or her own future advertising and marketing gain and sending people email which is not appropriate and against good ethics. Possibly, this type of people are likely the type that leaks emails  for pay just because they do not care and are after money.Your intuitions are correct mate and I see that OP has a motive for doing this and without any fear saying that it would be monetised.
