Using higher leverage is discouraging because of liquidation and if someone want to open a position for long, like 3 months or more. What about 1x, I think no collateral involved at all?

Which means nothing to be paid than trading fee?Future traders generally don't keep positions open for more than a period of 3 months because generally the contracts expire in 3 months so at Max you will see them trading just for a few days or weeks only. And the reason why people prefer leverage is because it obviously increases your capital and the rate of return at the same time and experienced traders generally practice a healthy stop loss as well so liquidation isn't really a major issue for them.",

The only logical reason to use 1x leverage is if you're shorting.Assuming you are having USDT or USDC, you can open a long position for bitcoin, if the price of bitcoin increase, you gain, that is where your point is valid. But you can open short position, if bitcoin price decrease, you gain, that is why future trading is different from spot trading, it is not only about the leverage.Quote from: logfiles on June 03, 2022, 08:26:05 PMWho lied to you. If you open a Bitcoin position right now at 1x Leverage.Longing right now will get you a liquidation price of around $148No, but maybe exchanges differs. I use Binance and OKX, the liquidation price for 1x leverage used to open a long position is infinity, no price stated unlike using more than 1x. I can do it and snap it for you to see.

I say this as a true believer of Bitcoin, but when it comes to markets, anything can happen.Look at the case of Luna, for exampleWhen the price was at let say $90Long on 1x Leverage ---> Liquidation price $1.8How much is LUNA's price again right now after the dramatic crash? $0.000096",

They show \"there is no liquidation price For a time being\" I hope you know what that means  I shorted LUNA on Binance until my position was closed by the ADL engine, that was before they delisted it.

I think it is not also good to open a position for long which is what I want to get from this thread. Thank you all that contributed.",

I mean, why trade in futures if you're just gonna do x1 leverage, right? The most small leverage I've seen is x3 by pro traders with big margin, mostly this entry is for the long run trade. Chances of making more profits is wasted for sure when you're just gonna put x1 in your leverage.",

Such as in the case of Luna then it makes sense but otherwise, there is no reason to use 1x leverage.You get a better liquidation price and hence more safety indeed but you have interest on your head even when you haven't borrowed any amount technically.",

Future trading is like driving on the highway. Learners don't drive there. I like spot trading and taking things slowly. I don't get to lose anything with it, except my patience.
