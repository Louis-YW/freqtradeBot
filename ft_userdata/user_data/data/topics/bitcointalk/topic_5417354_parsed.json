It’s all about passing on the traditions to future generations … This also has a huge impact on the culture, because it’s not all about satisfying one’s immediate desires, but building a better future. Today’s world doesn’t offer much hope because nothing is valued, partially because the money is broken — just like it was in Ancient Rome. The Benedictines helped rebuild civilization 1,500 years ago and I believe that the life of the Abbey is like a citadel, a popular term with bitcoiners, that will help to rebuild civilization in the 21st century.”What I find more interesting is that, The Bitcoin Standard has been referred in the church amongst the priest already, just as it use to be in the old time, it's the 21 century and being part of the revolution leaving fiat currencies and poisonous Government behind is the key.The above was a brief from the priest.

It is not that the nuns have done any work or any investment to get Bitcoin. They simply received the funds in Bitcoin and used them to build the church. What I find quite positive is:QuoteIt was Father Bartulica who set up the sisters with hardware wallets and taught them how to send, receive and get on the path toward financial sovereignty. He is on a mission to convert local Catholic parishes to a bitcoin standard. So far, the Benedictines of Mary have been most ready and able.(from the article quoted in the OP)I am not very religious but I welcome actions like this.",

They not only build the church by donation of Bitcoin, they also follow St. Benedict’s rule to buy Bitcoin, which means they don't only receive the Bitcoin by donation.Quotehttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/.amp/culture/catholic-nuns-building-church-with-bitcoinThese traditional Catholic nuns are a monastic order who follow St. Benedict’s rule and buy, receive and hold bitcoin in cold storage on behalf of their monasteryQuoteIt is not that the nuns have done any work or any investment to get Bitcoin. They simply received the funds in Bitcoin and used them to build the church. It says the nuns were growing their own produce and raising their own cattle and chickens.The nuns were able to sell proceeds for the purpose of building their church, which means they not only built the church by Bitcoin donation, they may have bought some Bitcoin too.Quotehttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/.amp/culture/catholic-nuns-building-church-with-bitcoinSo despite the reputation that Bitcoiners may have as miserly hoarders, generosity shone through and the nuns were able to sell proceeds (tax-free) for the purpose of building their Church.[growing their own produce and raising their own cattle and chickens.Quotehttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/.amp/culture/catholic-nuns-building-church-with-bitcointhe sisters’ prudent embrace of technology has paid off. I am glad indeed the sisters' embrace of technology paid off well, without disregarding other support they got too, apart from the Bitcoin donation.",
