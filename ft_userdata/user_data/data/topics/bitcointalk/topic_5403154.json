Coinbase you have ZERO options in regard to buying at a set price or putting in your sell price at higher than the current price.Bittrex for Example i can put in a BUY order for BTC when it hits $15K and just go about my business and once bought i can put that SELL order in for whatever price i want and walk away.Coinbase you have 2 shitty options buy or sell right now at the price right now.Why would anyone use this shitty generic welfare exchange? How is it still in business?",

How is it still in business?Are you using coinbase pro? Maybe you are using the basic version of the app which is design for a normal user to quick buy and sell. I never try using coinbase but it’s impossible for a top tier exchange to missed that important feature while the rest of the exchange does that. Bittrex too is now not that good compared to Binance, Okx and Kucoin which has a user friendly interface and almost has the feature you are looking for.Check the version.",

How is it still in business?Let me tell you. Coinbase is more trusted than bittrex and that's why many app developers will use coinbase payment system instead of something else. Try Google playstore app that pay bitcoin. Most use coinbase. It is easy to use. You could exchange your earning there with ease. The user interface is not as complex as bittrex. Most people choose simplicity over options.",

When they started asking KYC, I stopped using bittrex. But then, binance started asking KYC at all levels, so a lot have no choice but to comply. In my case, I feel more confident submitting my KYC to binance as I am a regular user of their services. But bittrex, I have this feeling that they can go down anytime. But that's just my feeling. When it comes to coinbase, I really haven't tried this exchange. Maybe, the OP should try binance or binance.US if he is in the US.",
