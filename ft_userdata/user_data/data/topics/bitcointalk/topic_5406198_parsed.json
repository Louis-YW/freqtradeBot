These investments still might not return as well as funds that invest globally though or in certain growth areas.There's a chance other currencies could face a decline thoggh soon as termoil increases...",

      "body": "LMAO. Asking whether to buy fiat currencies to \"capitalise\" on a bitcoin forum.If you want to capitalise, buy bitcoin now that it is cheap, in a few years these prices will seem like a bargain. The fiat currencies, whatever they are, are designed in such a way that they lose value over time, tending to 0. Bitcoin is designed in the opposite way.",

If there is, I don't think there will be parity between Euro to USD. As long they are fighting inflation by printing arbitrary paper with values written on them, they will always struggle to maintain them during crises. Don't ever make the mistake of buying a currency as a hedge against inflation, you could buy as many bunches you want but trust me, in a few years time, you will only be able to spend them on pairs of shoes, clothes and dinner.QuoteJust a thought I've never had before.I hope you have heard of Bitcoin, buy it, secure it, and hold it for some time, you will know how transparent and very efficient it is to capitalize your investment on Bitcoin.",

      "body": "I don't think fiat currencies are considered a hedge, especially considering that the global economy is having a hard time and that inflation is rising to levels never before seen in many countries. But you could definitely play with what's going on in the foreign exchange market. With the USD being very bullish right now, you could probably make use of it to acquire certain currencies that are currently cheap against it. You could buy Euro, for example, 1:1 at this very moment. My hunch is that Europe will eventually recover and that having a position in Euro against the USD would probably give you a profit sooner or later. N.B.: This isn't a financial advice.",

EURO is very much plummeting, the Forex market must have been in the turmoil in the pair USD/EUR. USD still is the global currency reserve. Its good to still hold USD due to its high value while your local currency is not rising. But be prepared to also sell your USD for BTC or your local CHF.",

There could be other commodities to get a better investment, but nothing beats crypto though. So I will stir away from buying currencies as a hedge.",

I mean they've never been great, but more, and more bank accounts are now either turning to offering no interest rate at all or comically low compared to past times. The bank I was with a few years ago recently within the last two years announced they will no longer offer interest rates on certain accounts. I imagine they only offer them to saving accounts, and premium accounts that you have to pay monthly for. There's also the challenger banks which usually don't offer any interest rates on their current accounts, unless you lock your funds in a \"pod\" or something along those lines. So, to further your point, fiat is quickly becoming a investment people should be running from, especially since it's a well known fact you'll basically get less for your money as time goes on because of inflation.",

DYOR.US dollar just became equal to euro, so I believe you could look into market which are inversely correlated to Euro. Which are: Japanese yen and the Swiss franc(that you already mentioned).I would prefer Japanese yen over swiss. Because I am predicting a surge in import of Japanese products.Also, you could try commodity-based currencies(silver would be my preference)",
