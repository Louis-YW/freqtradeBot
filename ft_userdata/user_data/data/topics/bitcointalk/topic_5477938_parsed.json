      "body": "If you are talking about yesterday evening experience then I will tell you that it is just a maintenance issue as they made a notification on their app for users to see that they are running maintenance. I had similar experienceÂ  last night when I was trying to subscribe but the notification popped up and I had to halt my ongoing transaction. While waiting for them to finish upgrading I made use of another app and that did not waste much of my time.It is advisable that you do not keep all your funds in these micro finance Bank app with no office to locate them. You can use them for payment and transfer when it is urgent but not to save with them. Bank apps are still much available that you can use to save your funds. Maybe you could transfer from the app to your micro finance app to do transaction and after which you remove the remaining back to your bank app. People use the micro finance Bank app because of the speed at which the transaction takes place. Quick alert confirmation and transfer compared to banks.I will advise you not keep your life savings under the custody of micro finance bank you do not know their office.",

      "body": "But OP, I'm still wondering why you have to creat three different topic thread all on the same matter about Kuda alone, that is spamming and is frowned at here all you should have gone under one of the thread incase of next time.By the way, is it enough reason to panic this way despite hav8ng huge amount inside you should have known by now that Kuda is CBN verified and can hardly fraud people of their hard earn money. If Kuda wants to close operation dey will announce it so everyone can withdraw their money as the government has close watch on them.What happend earlier was a glitch or maintainance and it happensÂ  at specific interval so try as much to get use to it and stop the panicking",

Other fintechs too: Palmpay and Opay sufferfrom it too.The problem is that most of these fintech basic rely on a bunch of APIs in order to deliver their services.Â  So if anyone of those APIs goes down, it takes the entire infrastructure down with it.I treat fintech banks like hot wallets (wallets just used for immediate transactions) not for long term management of asset/funds.",

It's understandable to keep one's savings in the bank since they've proven to be trustworthy to a reasonable extent but saving much amount of money in a micro finance bank is a no no for me.What I do most of the time is that I save only the amount I need for my weekly expenses and the rest is left in the normal bank to avoid stories that torches the heart.",
