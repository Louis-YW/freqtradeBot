  "content": "Quote from: coindesk.comA string of cryptocurrency news outlets reported that HSBC Hong Kong is giving its customers access to bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds on Monday.The news was first reported by crypto journalist Colin Wu and reproduced by a number of different sites, including The Block.However, this appears to be something of an overreaction. HSBC's customers in Hong Kong have in fact been able to trade such crypto investment products since they were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in December, as the bank allows trading of all publicly-listed ETFs.Crypto ETFs debuted on the HKEX with the listing of the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066) and CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068). These were joined by the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF (3135) in January.Today's development would appear to be that HSBC customers can now also access these ETFs from the bank's investment platform.The overreaction to this modest development demonstrates the excitement in the crypto community for any and all adoption of cryptocurrency investments by mainstream institutions such as HSBC in major financial centers like Hong Kong.Now we can say that the adoption of cryptocurrency is becoming wide. I hope someday in this country where I am working will adopt cryptocurrency, specially in banking. I hope someday we are all accessible in trading/transfering of funds through crypto. Someday, banks will completely embrace the positivity of crypto.Source: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/?fbclid=IwAR2qJhwZQe6NnL0XzigWTn9_2zN2w8IsAVQdAKUT0X5r1ALQnFlH24TcIQo",

This goes a long way for citizens in HK who are Bitcoin users as it has given a wide space for them to freely conduct their business with crypto considering how a lot has changed from 2021 where strict measures were placed against it, causing discomfort and hampering business growth for crypto elites.I even read somewhere that the Hong Kong Monetary authority where pressuring major banks to accept crypto exchanges as clients. They have even gone as far as introducing their own crypto legislation. It looks like they aren't joking when they stated their desire to become a crypto hub in Asia.",

And for allowing crypto usage and exchange running a business on their country this is a big slap for other who rejected it or been skeptical about allowing it to be use by their people.I guess we can say good impact on crypto adoption on what Hongkong did since if they became successful to be a crypto hub on asia provably we can see other asian country to do the same.",

But according to the news, not that they hold bitcoin directly, it is the exchange traded fund (ETF) of it, which is good too because it is a way bitcoin adoption continues.Quote from: bbc.reporter on June 27, 2023, 03:20:18 AMIt is head shaking that uncle Gary, the SEC and the American government are cracking down on the cryptospace while a communist country like China are slowly allowing it through Hong Kong as the go between.Another head shaking thought is only 2 years ago, China and Hong Kong were banning people under their jurisdictions from using crypto hehe. They were also closing people's bank accounts because they had transactions related to cryptocoin exchanges and services.Also that in China, you can hold bitcoin as a property, it is legal. But I do not know what the stress of the Chinese government that they continue to ban bitcoin several times and later the ban is no more effective. You can see that after bitcoin mining was banned in China, Chinese miners again increased in hashrates and they are the second to US now.",

These are existing products and people already have access to it. When a bank integrates such existing products for their customers, it's usually to earn brokerage. Unless these ETFs are physical in nature, that's no use for the crypto market either. These kind of things are good to create awareness but not really impactful for the market.",

Well, the point was the same which is if you do not own the key then the coins are not yours. But TBH, i do not really have a great idea behind the working of ETFs, so before writing anything more, i will look into it too but i do get the idea from your post that ETFs mean getting registered with the government and then buying the government's verified BTC, which will be own by Government.

As, crypto is decentralized and shared by all countries on the globe.",

Someday, banks will completely embrace the positivity of crypto.The adoption of crypto in the Banking sector doesn't affect the main purpose of decentralization proposed by the very first crypto BTC? Yet, in the quoted text, they have written, this slight adoption must not have that much impact on the market in popularity way. But still, this news is being shared as something big has happened. Even, though you showed your excitement too, which of course is not bad but Hong Kong has already a second hub of China to test its limits on the adoption of crypto and in what way it could impact its economy with it. This news has proved that something is being manipulated in the market. That we will see in the near future. But for now, why not fill our pockets with profits? This is no doubt good news but for newbies to manipulate their mindset to lure them into thinking that crypto is all good now and it is ok for them to invest now in it.",
