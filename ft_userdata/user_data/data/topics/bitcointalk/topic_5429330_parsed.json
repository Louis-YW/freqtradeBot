This type of service will take scammers and also this will be a false document or stolen document. So we should avoid this type of user and/or this type of service to avoid scams. Hope you got my point of view of mine.",

If any bookies find that you are providing fake KYC documents, then they gonna block your account simply and won’t reply you for the rest of your life. If this happens, then forget about the winnings, they won’t refund your deposit money also. What’s the issue with giving the KYC details? If your hard earned money is at stake? Be honest with bookies, and they will be honest with you. Moreover in the OP you have mentioned about 22bet, to be honest I haven’t heard about them. Upon researching, I found that there are many scam accusations against them. So it doesn’t matter now, you might not get your money back, if you submit the real KYC documents. From next time onwards choose a legit and trustworthy casino.",
