Even if you have no interest in coding, knowing how something works (you can easily find some guides on Youtube) can help guide decisions in investing etc as you will be way more familiar with how something works.I wish you luck on the learning journey",

My only advice is that, you need to choose either Short term or long term with this you can be able to detect how much you can hold your bitcoin or not, naturally altcoin investment are always advisable to be short time if those coin are not reputable coin maybe a newly launched coin be subjected into short term since you don't know much about the project you are investing. You can always enjoy bitcoin while you hold for long term by then you could be that tension free, again before venturing into market always utilize the bear market and wait for the bull to strike only if you are interested on short investment.",

And they make fiat currency look like it’s not used for any illegal activity just because they know they can control fiat currency, but they don’t have power over bitcoin. Quote from: Zanab247 on September 18, 2023, 07:22:21 PMWhy newbies are more afraid of bear market than senior crypto users? Is it because they don't know that bull market will come up later? When beginners are afraid of bear markets, I don’t blame them since they are new to the crypto space, so I think it’s normal. Even beginners who have the mindset of holding for a long time will be scared if they witness a bear market because they don't know how it will end. But people who have witnessed bear markets before do not have to panic, they already know that after a bear market, there will be a bull run, and they have witnessed both bear and bull market before.Quote from: Zanab247 on September 18, 2023, 07:22:21 PMCan you impact us how to eliminate this spirit of fear in crypto investment by sharing your idea or experience because, I'm ready to learn crypto so that I will be bold in any season I will come across in the future.No matter how you try to eliminate the spirit of fear in newbies, you are just wasting time because when there is a bear market, people are still going to panic, they might not sell, but some might be regretting why they invested early, they should have been holding a stable coin so that they will invest when the price is already down.",

But you need to be careful with your learning process, don't rush into it, take out time to do your studies thoroughly.In eliminating your fears as a new investor, you need to start with small amount and grow through the process little by little, with time you will build your expertise.And don't be controlled by emotions too much as an investor, learn how to study the market forces before making a move.",

No, I believe they know already but because of their doubtful minds and less experience, they've been influenced by their emotion and worried about the situation. It is normal for anyone who is new to crypto, the lack of trust because negativity arises and many people talk about when the market is in a bear situation and this will affect their thinking. But it all gonna change when we fully embrace and understand the volatility of the market. And of course, when having faith in crypto, especially for Bitcoin.",

There could be some rare cases that looked on this market in the short term, invested and then profited from it. But that fear will only be removed if you ever experience how the volatility of this really is removing those that have weak hearts.

But you still put in your money because you believe that you will gain something from your investment. I have spent just a few years in the Bitcoin environment and have learned some ways of defeating the fear of investing in Bitcoin.  One of my strategies is to keep learning every day. I ensure that I gather basic knowledge of the past and recent developments in the Bitcoin space. Reading about the past will enable one to understand how Bitcoin works and knowing about the latest developments is important in making investment decisions. Knowledge is a potent instrument to fight FUD triggered by lies from the media. Secondly to limit my fears and worries I don't invest more than I can afford to lose or bear. Acknowledging that the sector has it's level of risk has made to invest only funds I can survive without. There is no need to be greedy which can spur one to borrow or sell valuable assets to invest in Bitcoin just to make a huge profit. I have learned to be content and invest only what I can comfortably afford.",

Many newbies don't know that because they are only afraid of losing money. but there are some newbies who understand that and secretly bought it. Many people don't know this either because they judge the newbie is still a beginner who doesn't know anything, as you know he was just starting out in crypto, but have experience investing on stock and Foreign currency before.",

All cryptocurrencies are not legit. I was reading a thread by 1miau a few minutes ago, and I think it's important for everyone to read. Here is where you can read it: Important to know: Difference Coin / Token and shady marketing practices. Scammers created thousands of cryptocurrencies to steal users' money, and those cryptocurrencies are centralized.

The difference is seniors know which coin they bought and have an expected time to pump. If the time is over already, they know this toke won't make it anymore. So you have to choose the right coin, Bitcoin.",

While some established members of the forum would seem that they are coordinated and not afraid of the market. There are other old members that are also afraid. What brings about this perpetual fear is the type of assets invested in. I can see you have been mentioning that you want to learn crypto. There is a big difference between learning crypto as a whole and knowing about bitcoin. If you invest in Bitcoin and the bear market stays very long, your fear will not be much if at all you are supposed to be afraid. But if you bought a shitcoin or a random altcoin and the bear market stays longer, you should be afraid and if possible say bye to your Investments because those altcoins in the period of bull run might not see another all-time high till they extinct from the market",

I wanted to make some corrections here, that, not every cryptocurrency is not scam, as most of the currencies (in crypto) are scams, and developers and rug pullers are making projects just to gain the attention of the audience and to get investments. And once that platform got enough funds then they rug pull and fly away with all the money. Besides all that, cryptocurrency can not be used as an asset, only BTC can be used as an asset because it is a proven hedge against inflation. As we all know, BTC is the best asset to hold your funds for a longer period of time, and if a person holds their funds in some other token (ALTs) then the results will be unexpected.

Why newbies are more afraid of bear market than senior crypto users? Is it because they don't know that bull market will come up later? I think that's because newbies have less knowledge and experience than seniors. As, when I was a newbie I always tried to predict the market using my emotions and always fell prey to market sentiments. And lose a lot too. The point is, knowledge is the main factor that one should get before investing or jumping into the market. And when a person (newbie) will get aware of the terms used in trading, crypto and what types of scams are going on and how to avoid them, then that person is not a newbie anymore. Note my words that, knowledge is power. And some will try to modify my words and will say that with knowledge practical experience is also necessary and I am also agree with that.",
