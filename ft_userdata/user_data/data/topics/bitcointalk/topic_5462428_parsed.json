  "content": "At first I want to use this medium to introduce myself, I'm a Smartgoat and I have being studying the futuristic of Bitcoin and finally I have developed a hundred percent love to Bitcoin. I have be wondering why people are queuing up in Bitcoin, then I began to ask if Bitcoin can make provision of food in our table. Because many people I know testify of Bitcoin and after I made my research concerning Bitcoin, I found out why people are comfortably investing in Bitcoin, is because it's a decentralized currency. then I have to come with the idea that Bitcoin can make availability of food in our table when we learn and understand the basic things of Bitcoin especially understand trading and long term investment of Bitcoin.I think with trading they will be a provision of food in our table, when we understand the rules and regulations of Bitcoin, I don't know if this my concept can make a provision of food through Bitcoin. But I'm well convinced that with this my views over Bitcoin investment and trading it will provide or sustain human, if profit are been made. I know that Bitcoin should not be dependent on, and we suppose to make Bitcoin our side hustle but with seriousness on Bitcoin investment and trading, we can achieve a success.",

So when you are opportune to make it through bitcoin that simply means that bitcoin make a provision of food in your table.",

FTM maybe the good choice that I can tell you, it is cheap and you can use it for day trading, but if you tend to lose in trading then better hold it for 1 month approximately until october 2023. I made a simple analysis about this coin, I think it maybe reach the lowest price which is roughly 0.18 usd and most probably it can reach 0.33 usd in bullish of it. it is just my analysis, it will not give you guarantee. so only do with your own risk.",

Bitcoin is similar however it’s more volatile and most stores do not accept it so you need to use an exchange or Bitcoin ATM to sell your Bitcoin for fiat and then use that fiat to buy whatever you want.It won’t give you passive income. You aren’t guaranteed 5% a year like some Us bonds. It’s similar to stocks pretty much. There are no guarantees.",

While we can secure our food system by trading in Bitcoin, we can also support and secure our daily life from Bitcoin. It is true that when we invest and trade in Bitcoin we have a customer perspective to profit from. We use the profit we get from trading and investing in bitcoins for various necessities including food around us or on our table. So Bitcoin is an important part of our life where we depend on Bitcoin. But Bitcoin should not be depended on because there is a lot of risk when market volatility starts then our essentials will not depend on Bitcoin. So it is not right to depend only on Bitcoin for our livelihood, we should definitely save the money we get by investing in Bitcoin. And if we invest Bitcoin and hold it for a long time then we can earn good profit from it. Since we will not get much profit by short term investment but good profit by long term investment, it will be possible to keep trading bitcoins to ensure food on our table.",

It's not even just about food, but includes other things. So if your question leads to the truth, can investing in bitcoin really be profitable and earn money, I can answer \"yes\". You don't need to be afraid or doubtful, if you are really 100% interested in bitcoin. The most important thing at this time, first study the sciences related to bitcoin, so that you are not mistaken and don't end up being deceived or experiencing losses. Because even though bitcoin is labeled as the first and best cryptocurrency among other cryptocurrencies. But investing or trading in bitcoin, while knowledge and knowledge are not yet qualified, usually the results will be less than optimal and tend to be caught in the trap of fraudsters.So the point is for now, you first learn all the knowledge about bitcoin, how to trade it, and its analysis techniques, price cycles, and all the systems that work. So, even though there is a lot to learn, for the initial stages if you want to invest in bitcoin, you must be willing to learn all of that.QuoteI know that Bitcoin should not be dependent on, and we suppose to make Bitcoin our side hustle but with seriousness on Bitcoin investment and trading, we can achieve a success.Every bitcoin investor has a different point of view on this. Because some say, investing/trading in bitcoin is good as a side income, but there are also those who argue that if you invest/trade in bitcoin, if you make it your main income, the results will be good and profitable (as you think).So to conclude, it all depends on the busyness of the investors themselves. Because if a bitcoin investor has a business in another field, he must make bitcoin as a sideline. But if a bitcoin investor who has spare time, he can make bitcoin his main income, by trading daily (short time / medium time). So in conclusion, there is nothing wrong with these two opinions. But it all depends on the investors.",

The point is, simply taking advantage of volatility will never ensure you meet your daily needs.The tip is that you get a job for bitcoin income every day/week/month. This makes more sense.",

Freelancers, those people who are working who wants to be paid thru Bitcoin. These are the most common examples of \"Food being provided with the help of Bitcoin.\" and many more will be in the future for sure. I guess that 10,000 Bitcoin for 2 pizza event was a good example for your question OP. What's good is that you are doing your research with regards to Bitcoin. There are some newbies out there who aren't researching at all, and they are just asking on how to make money with crypto to other people. Anyway, Bitcoin can provide not only food, but anything as it serves as a tool for us to buy something. Good Luck OP.",
