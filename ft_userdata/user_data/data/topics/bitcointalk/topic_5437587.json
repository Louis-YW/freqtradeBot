Both could be argued to have worth that could be tendered for their value at their prevailing rate, so they are the same in your context.But in the proper context, inflation has affected fiats differently since some are risk-on, while others are risk-off. Take the USD as an example, it's a risk-off asset, it appreciated throughout last year while the risk-on fiat sold off just like Bitcoin. Also, those risk-on assets sold off in varied magnitude.",

The government or central bank cannot print more currency to raise prices.Bitcoin's decentralisation and lack of government make it a great currency. It is less subject to monetary policy changes, political instability, and other economic issues than traditional currencies. Supply and demand determine Bitcoin's price, thus inflation is improbable.Despite several circumstances, bitcoin's inflation rarely climbs faster than currencies. Bitcoin is more stable than most currencies due to its limited supply and lack of government supervision. Remember that the bitcoin market is young and untested, so short-term instability is possible. Over the next few years, the crypto market will be intriguing to watch.",

It is made to be minted in such way that every four years you will have slow production of the bitcoin thus it will short the market severely. I mean the difficulty increases in such way you are definitely shorting the market by that technique. However, with the time the demand is always rising as the popularity of bitcoin keeps going up. The more it gets adopted and used on the daily basis the more it will stay away from the inflation. By definition things are costed many times more than the actual prices because the fiat itself loses the value. However, here bitcoin's supply and demand is such that it keeps the formula intact and goes without any obstructions over the time.",

Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset class and unrecognized in the world, so no country would risk making bitcoin a national reserve asset. It's like they're going to destroy their own economy. Inflation is terrible for any economy, but it is also part of the world economic cycle.

The total supply is capped, and the number of coins that can be mined decreased by a fixed amount.Volatility is not inflation. Inflation is a supply and demand principle. Money supply backed by fiat can be modified by printing more new currency units. This causes demand to go up and consumer goods start to increase in price causing inflation.Important to note that you can still see consumer prices go up even if the demand remains the same if the supply isn't steady. But you expect prices to stabilize once the supply recovers. Currency induced demand increases (ie introducing more currency units into the economy) essentially means prices never go down because it becomes difficult to take out money from the economy that's already been introduced.Bitcoin doesn't have this issue so it doesn't make sense to take inflation and apply it to Bitcoin.",

No. Bitcoin is not like fiat which has an unlimited number of supply, but like others have opined, it has a fixed supply rate of 21million. Also, scarcity is another key to making a store of value resistant to inflation. Unlike gold which can be discovered, it's not the same for Bitcoin and this adds to make for a unique predictability.  Although Bitcoin experiences inflation, as more of it are being mined, investors are willing to overlook this little upset as the amount of new Bitcoin mined is reduced by 50% every four years.",
