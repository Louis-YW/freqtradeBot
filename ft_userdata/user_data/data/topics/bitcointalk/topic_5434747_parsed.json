      "body": "Thanks Miner Jones, but this wasn't a sales post.  The 2022 prototypes are no longer available and have all been claimed/sold. The remaining 36 prototypes will have 4 slightly different designs and will be finished in a month or so (Family's Coming) . Â Of those, the spanish version will only have a mintage of 5. Only 1 has been pre-sold so far. Â  The mass produced pieces (1000+) cheaper pieces for circulation will be created later in the year and manufactured differently. Prototypes have slightly different wording which I'm looking for the best public perception and understanding. Such as denominations listed in bitcoin, sats or bits. Â The prototypes are usually picked up and hoarded by collectors being that they are so rare. $475 is a small price. The weight doesn't matter. They could be made of 1/2 oz lead and still be priced the same. Its just the canvas they happen to be made on. If you are a silver stacker and it does matter, you will probably want to buy the mass produced indian head rounds or 100 oz silver bullion bricks. Those are closer to spot $25-28/oz silver right now.Thanks",
