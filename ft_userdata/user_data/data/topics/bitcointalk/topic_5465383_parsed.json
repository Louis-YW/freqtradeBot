  "content": "Pepenet is a project forked from monero with features similar to twitter (without mods  ). Basic blockchain info*****************************Forked: YesReference project: MoneroTotal supply: ~18.2MBlock time: 2 minBlock reward: dynamicMining algorithm: Cryptonote v0*****************************Mining pools: https://ekapool.com/ppnet/http://pepenet.cobrapool.com/Explorers: http://explorer.pepenet.info:8081/*****************************For now there are only two social features: pepping and posting.but more will be addedhttps://pepenet9.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-from-2023-08-27-17-48-22.png?w=1024Users can make a pep or post by adding json arguments to the transfer command in the pepenet-wallet-cli. This will include the social feature in the transaction data. To avoid blockchain bloat all social features are compressed and serialized with protobuf.As of right now the only way to use pepenet is via pepenet-wallet-cli but the long term plan is to add a http server to pepenetd that will host a web based UI (html web pages for: daemon management and info and a web interface for the rpc wallet).Users will also have the ability to host their own simple websites with pepenetd via this http server. If enough people like this idea then a page social feature will be added. It will enable users to \"publish\" their website on pepenet and allow others to find it.Please share your thoughts here or check out the links below:More info: pepenet.orgDiscord server: https://discord.gg/vvwNGeV76kJoin discussion on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/pepenet/Github repo: https://github.com/pepenetsocial/pepenetLatest release (windows-x86_64 and linux-x86_64): https://github.com/pepenetsocial/pepenet/releases/tag/v0.2.0.0-betaGuides: https://pepenet9.wordpress.com/guides/Mining guide: https://pepenet9.wordpress.com/guides/mining-guide/",

But I hope that we just don't know how to setup our firewall. Maybe someone has experience with running monerod on windows on a home network.edit: fixed",
