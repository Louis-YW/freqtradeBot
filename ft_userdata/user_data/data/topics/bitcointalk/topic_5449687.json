  "content": "Bitcoin - solves or trying to solve financial institute problems, like inflation,  and its fully decentralized, yet it has slow transaction speed, it wasn't built for fast transaction speed anyway.Litecoin came, and has faster transaction speed, a problem on the horizon from Bitcoin, well noted.Ethereum later came, brings the smart contract, but still has it's problem right? These old projects are good example of what solving a real problem looks like, but today it's a different thing with new projects. Fast transaction speed is no more a problem now, it's feature, and features and solving a real world problem are not the same thing, some projects are coming up saying they have faster transaction speed, which project doesn't have that today? Even shit meme coins now boldly rant about fast transaction speed. This is not solving anything, because this problem was already solved. Too many times.Don't invest in a project that has the same utility that has been around for years, there is no point having the same thing over and over again, if the project is not solving a known problem in cryptic space you are simply throwing your money away. Adding fast transaction speed is now an extra features, not solving a real world problem, almost all projects now has faster transaction speed.",

Things like transition from POW to POS, lower transaction fees, faster transaction speed and a very high Return on Investment. We have all seen how all of them have faired since then. these are ways to lure people into those alt coins just like how Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin decentralization and hedge against inflation can’t be match and with the regular BIPs it will be hard to have any alt taking bitcoin place",

On the other hand, how many transactions per second is, say, the Solana blockchain capable of carrying out? It's 50,000. But why do people transact on the Bitcoin blockchain and not on the Solana blockchain? It's because the Bitcoin blockchain provides the most security, among others. My point is that you cannot just single out a certain feature in choosing which crypto to trust. You have to look at the parts as well as the whole. Is Solana, for example, even decentralized? So even if Solana is better than Bitcoin in terms of speed and scalability, it doesn't mean it is better than Bitcoin.",

With fiat payment channels, they accommodate lots of transactions which does not involve any transfer of value, just change of digits between one account and the other, like what you got when you trade within an exchange. The actual transfer of value between bank accounts take place at a much later time, far slower than on the Bitcoin network.Bitcoin involves secure, irreversible transactions with actual exchange of value between one address and the other.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on April 22, 2023, 03:34:20 AMThe problem that LN has is the opening of channels, although in most cases, for a user carrying low amounts on his mobile, this is usually not a problem.

I think still fast transaction is a problem and even BTC is not capable of solving it. Like we all talk about BTC's mass adoption by countries adopting it as legal tender etc. but we should also ask ourselves that, does BTC blockchain is able to process the transactions of a whole country at once. AFAIK, No. BTC cannot process the transactions of a whole country at once. i had already discussed this topic. For example, El-Salvador has almost a population of 7 million (let's say) if 5 million are using BTC as payment and if they make transactions on BTC all at once how much time will blockchain take to process/validate, it will take around 10 days. I have already discussed this topic here. Plus i totally agreed with your point and the shit or mem coins are just new opportunities or products of venture capitalists to earn extra money, first, they come up with DeFi based coin back in 2020-2021 and in 2022 they came up with Web3 and now we are going to see projects with Artificial Intelligence Ideas. All they do is flow with the trend to gain funds and after that 90% of them scam investors and early adopters.",

We've seen it over and over again, even projects with less market cap like Kaspa and Saito, they all have faster speed. Yeah, High TPS on blockchain project is already typical because new blockchain just copy and improved the other fast blockchain technology. But these new blockchain is still not stress test on actual heavy transactions real time for long period of time that's why most of them still get scalability issue later on once TX's flooded. Tron is now charging +$1 compared to their old fee which is just a mere penny. This new blockchains after Bitcoin is just doesn't have consistent high volume of TX's that's why they can maintain a fast blockchain. Imo, The problem of new blockchain now is how can they attract user to use their ecosystem while there's a lot of competitor blockchain that offers the same fast feature. They are now competing on dapps but still nonsense because developers nowadays develop dapps in multiple chain. I agree that blockchain industry is starting to become a shitcoin like meme coin plague.  Open source is a bitch for them.",

If he does not know, tell him about that and the deal will be completed within 10 minutes or 30 minutes. It's more safely for you.QuoteWhat then is speed about the Bitcoin network?We are talking about either Average Time between blocks which is about 10 minutes. It's 10 minutes 54 seconds in the last 24-hour blocks. However, there are blocks can be mined within a few seconds or a few minutes but shorter than 10 minutes (the average) or longer than 10 minutes.QuoteThe funds goes in immediately to your address balance, but needs at least 1 confirm before it reflects on your wallet, just to secure the funds from double spending.No. You don't receive your bitcoin if that transaction does not have a first confirmation. What you see in your wallet is just a note for the incoming transaction which might come in or might never come in your wallet.QuoteI've met some people who don't wait for the confirmation process before they send me what I've paid for, this time, the speed of a bitcoin transaction has to do with trust.

Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000.
