  "content": "I will try to keep it as short and simple as possible. I know there are many ranks and positions in Bitcointalk. Like newbie, Jr, member, full member Sr, hero, and lastly legendary. Also, there is donator and copper member, moderator, and global moderator. And there are those who are most trusted known as DT members. Lastly staff, administrator, and founder.I wanted to know the capabilities of these ranks and positions. If I say more specifically, I would like to know the difference between moderators, staff, and DT. These 3 position holds much influence in the forum. I want to know the extent of these positions. And who holds the power to ban a user? As far as I know, moderators are in charge of different boards for spam and illegal activities and reporting them and deleting them. I don't know what the staff does, maybe they check the reports and ban them. As for DT they are the most trusted members of the forum. Do they hold the same powers? Like banning somebody? What are their limits? Can a DT be staff or moderator and vice versa. As for the rest of the ranks, I know enough. I know it may sound like a stupid question but I created this thread anyway. It was just a curious mind question to know the forum and its members.",

This is based on my little knowledge here though.Staff: Employees of the forum.

I have already read that thread many times. It just says colors and symbols and others of those positions. But not any comparisons.DT-1 are those who Thymos trust their ratings and can not ban a user if that’s what you mean. Staffs and Moderators are picked by Thymos, regular or local moderators through applications though but are just members that are limited to their assigned boards. I don’t think they can ban a user probably a global moderator can. As for Staffs it seems to report to Thymos and have the ability to ban and Unban a user. They are specially employed by Thymos, the criteria is something we don’t know but you must be a very good contributor to the forum and also understand it very well.

I’m not sure whether staff member can ban user too but the known difference is their scope of work since staff is limited to the local boards they are assigned.DT on the other hand is just a special position due to the democracy of the forum.

Some staffs can moderate different boards but they must get assignments from forum admins to moderate boards that are not their local boards.DT members: they don't need to be admins, global moderators or staffs to be DT members.Default trust changes are what currently applying for forum DT system.

They have to file their reports to global moderators and admins who will consider unbanning a banned user and refusing to do it.Previously, only admins can unban users but it was changed since 2019 and after that global moderators have unban button too.Quote from: achow101 on May 14, 2019, 02:42:37 PMPosts are reported to moderators who check out the report. If the poster needs to be banned, the moderator sends a ban report up to a global mod or admin. The global mod or admin handles all of the ban reports they get at around the same time. Either the admins or global mods don't need to check every account because they trust the moderators to have already done so, or they check quickly because every such report contains references and links to the plagiarism post and to the source text so checking takes little time.Quote from: hilariousandco on May 15, 2019, 10:32:46 AMGlobal mods were given the ability to ban signatures only yesterday.
