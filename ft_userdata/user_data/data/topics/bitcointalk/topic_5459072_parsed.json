Well done You're a low-class BM who directly helps scammers tries steal money while you only care about your stomach (I don't think I should care about your problems either). You ignore our warnings in trust feedback that something is wrong with all the projects you promote, and there seems to be no effort to improve the quality of the research.Anyway, why was the previous post deleted?https://ninjastic.space/post/62520702",

The fact that you're paid or not by the project is not the whole point of everybody's reply on this thread.You've been warned several times that you made a poor judgment on selecting bounty campaigns, that you directly enabling scammers to scam crypto community by facilitating and promoting them through the bounty you managed. The communities did their contribution to point out the suspicios aspects of those projects, each of your project had their own scam accusation thread published by several members, which seems to fell to deaf ears, I even sent you a DM and invite you to discuss the matter thoroughly when you still use your ahmim pseudonym --which evading ban, by the way, another violation of the forum-- of which you only replied with a simple dismissive answer.And now when you finally did not get your payment, you cried and complained here? What about your bounty participants in the past? Or worse, those gullible investors who put their money and lost it on those projects you campaigned? Are those not important to you managed to get some money from them and only this one is crucial because you directly got \"scammed\" too? I honestly can't fathom how can you sleep at night with these.",

Btw, Op have you ever conducted research on any project you have been promoting? And if you should continue like this I'm sure you'll face another scam in no time.",

This could translates as they did small to no effort to filter out projects vs. scam before accepting and promoting them. Participating on their campaign as well as investing on the project promoted by them should be taken with serious consideration.About the MetaSystem Bounty Token project, but you still advertise the campaign: ðŸ’¥[Bounty Open]ðŸ’¥ Pi4ur Bounty Budget: 30,00,000 Token | 4 Week |, with the same outcome and fate.Op, How hard is it to make an agreement (Escrow) with your client before running a campaign, so you don't promote scam projects.It's useless for you to make a topic about the Pi4ur scam project, your permanent person's judgment is wrong, because you are not guided by the Escrow agreement, you wish you want more profit, that is the risk of a manager if without prior consideration before proceeding with the campaign, no one can help you, except: yourself.",

Of lately I saw all the articles you have posted the one that baffles me most is that of the government investigating Pi which I believe something must have prompted that action. It is all over that the coin is trading via p2p market with no exchange value while i also saw some companies and automobile are accepting the coin for trading with their products. Some people are complaining that the adds on the app are what the founder of the coin is using to generate funds for himself so i was wondering what the coin was for if the founder would be using adds on the app to generate funds for himself and the listing has been delayedÂ  for years before now.",
