Someone who randomly clicks a link attached to their emails is really attracting these viruses and other malware that we should avoid by just being aware that they exist and, how we contain them through malicious links. Just never click and entertain any unsolicited and unwelcomed email, those random emails that are being sent to us. Some email providers have them put on spam and make those links unclickable but not all providers do that.",

Worse still that people still expose personal information like emails, etc on various, unverified platforms.",

That would be the most likely option when it comes to Ledger Live or for some other HW+Electrum combination. However, this trojan may also have some more sophisticated ways to attack HW owners, perhaps redirecting them to various web locations where it tries to steal their seed or through some other data it gets if it succeeds in infecting the victim's computer.Given that it's been around since at least 2016, I assume any good AV must block it - although few people pay attention to online security these days. Of course, everything starts from the fact that you should not trust links that come from suspicious sources, no matter how credible it may seem to someone at first glance.",
