(none of your comments count as financial advice)If you love BTC, it will stay with it because love will give you a lot of happiness and it will be given BTC when the price goes back up in the next bullish and if you still want to have an altcoin, that is my question whether this action requires you to sell what you love BTC? If yes then it's better not to have Altcoin but if you buy Altcoin not from the money from selling BTC then do it and some Altcoin is still good enough to have ETH, BNB or Dogecoin the rest you have to start learning yourself.",

(none of your comments count as financial advice)I have ETH, BNB and ADA on my list.Other's might recommend low cap coins as a good buy, but for me, those are solid projects to begin with, they might not give a huge returns as compare to others, but still the risk is not that big and but on their past performance, they will be one of those solid project that will make a new all time high when we hit the bull run next year in my opinion.",

Ethereum2. Binance3. SolanaThat's the list for me. Best of luck on which coins you are going to invest long term.",

Then for new projects watch out for sei network and sui network. These two might be a good projects to look forward too. I am holding avalanche, fantom, evmos and some ron tokens mostly L1 tokens that can be staked over time.",

Are there any other coins you guys could recommend I buy next? (none of your comments count as financial advice)Well with your Bitcoins you already have the safest and most stable of all cryptocurrencies in your portfolio. I think it is fair to say that a x10 of Bitcoin is not as likely as a x10 of an altcoin simply because Bitcoin already made several x1000 so the space for another x10 is just pretty limited in my opinion. On the other hand Bitcoin is very stable for a crypto.So for your altcoin investment it depends on what you want to achieve with it. Do you also want to be relatively safe like with your Bitcoin? Then i would invest into big and already established projects like Ethereum, BNB, Cosmos and so on.If you want to gamble, then invest into small and new projects, but of course you need to be aware that, it is totally possible that you lose all of your money then.",

(none of your comments count as financial advice)For altcoins, if you want to limit risk, then invest in top altcoins, if you are a risk taker and willing to take risks, then try new projects, meme projects. They are quite risky but have a high potential for return, if you are looking for x10, x100 investments then new projects can fulfill that need for you. But in my opinion, you should invest in ETH and BNB, these are 2 altcoins that will also give very good returns in the next bull season, if not more profitable than bitcoin.",

(none of your comments count as financial advice)There is no need to buy other coins besides BTC if you don't have any information or don't know how to find other coins you can invest in. Just hold on to BTC and you'll be fine.If you want to invest in other coins, you have to painstakingly analyze each coin, determine the purchase price you want, and hold it until the price increases. And it's not easy to do, especially if you buy the coins based on suggestions from other people. I can only suggest looking at the list of the top 25 coins and analyzing them one by one to find the coin you want. Don't just listen to other people's advice because it is your money, you have to be responsible with your money.",

Are there any other coins you guys could recommend I buy next? (none of your comments count as financial advice)Bitcoin is a safe investment now, but there is one problem. If you have 10 million dollars and you buy bitcoin, then maybe in 2-3 years you will receive 200-300% profit, but maybe 400 or 500%. But if you have 10,000 dollars, then it is not profitable to invest in bitcoin. If you buy the right altcoin, then you can earn a lot more. I have Polkadot and Cosmos in my portfolio, Ethereum too, but I bought it cheaper. Ethereum is expensive right now.",

L1 project has less risk to die because they are backed by big investors. Also you will have a better chance of profit once new dapps trend rise again in crypto like NFT since this kind of dapps usually benefits L1 project. You will surely ride the trend when you invest on this project.Second best choice are those L2 project like Optimism & Matic.",

Apart from bitcoin, I am also keen on Ethereum and BNB which I hold a little and planning to buy more this year and early next year. I also have my sights on Hedera and Syscoin. Apart from these potential coins, I am also looking for very small market cap coins  I can invest for a chance to earn x10 or more since I don't think my main coins can increase to x10 in the next bull run. So far, Rebelbots and League of Ancients are 2 lottery coins I am watching and I might buy some soon.",

And, accordingly, on the contrary, when the dominance of bitcoin increases, it is necessary to convert all your savings into BTC. In this case, the safest coin for exchanging BTC for altcoins may be ETH.",

(none of your comments count as financial advice)Good to have Bitcoin on your wallet and this is one of the best decision that you can make in cryptomarket.Now since diversification is a must, its also good to hold some altcoins for your long term goals. Considering the marketcap ranking, I can safely advise to have ETH and BNB on your wallet, all you have to do is to timing your entry with those altcoins and maximize the potential profit on any market trend. If you are still a newbie, top coins are safe to hold while you are learning, long term player also need a lot of patience because the market is very unpredictable.",

Yes, it was indeed great to not just focus on Bitcoin alone but also spread to some altcoins because for some instances that altcoins are even more profitable compared to Bitcoin especially when you are too lucky in investing hypes project but never I suggest this to you due to it was too risky.",
