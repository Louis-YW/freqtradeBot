OP is right this is the last chance to get out of this scam project if someone is still holding on.This is not the idea of crypto and I am not aware of the ongoing occurrences in the Safemoon community and the insincerity of the team as regarding the sales of tokens but if the allegation is actually true then I can only say, it is appauling, to hear of one of the most successful meme project in the last bullrun become compromising in delivering their services.If the shakedown by SEC on founders of memecoin projects with no utility is a measure to further sanitize the system then I will applaud it as a move in the right direction. Someone needs to rise up to the occassion we are currently experiencing.",

I prefer to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum or BNB, it makes me feel safe and the risk is not too bigJust so you know, the project SAFEMOON was created during the first hype of meme coins, and that's somewhere around 2021 I think, but the project isn't new.I knew it because I invested into it, and this is the first time I invested into a low market cap coin. I almost lost I think half or more than investing into it. TBH, I really thought that this project is kind of dead already because there's no development about it that makes them more popular. Anyway, I don't really care anymore, and I wish that SEC will do the same with not only with meme coins, but with other coins as well. I just hope that no one here is holding that shitcoin for a very long time, hoping that it will go to the moon again after what happened.",

It was like following a weird money cult.And sadly people don't seem to understand that they didn't get sued just because the price went down. That was going to happen anyway as things don't just moon all the way. After it becomes obvious, people start selling to get out before they lose everything.Hopefully that fraud charge added to the top will act as a warning. Sadly there are several other scams out there operating on same principle, but sec has time only for biggest ones.And i am assuming that no one will learn from this. Not the investors or next pump moon token creators. Everyone will think they got sued because the price dropped. But that's just a byproduct of a scam.",
