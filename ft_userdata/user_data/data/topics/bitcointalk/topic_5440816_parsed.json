People are really accepting it and giving the value as they are giving to fiat payments.Are you guys accepting crypto payments for your business?Yes! I’m encouraging my customer to pay using Bitcoin whenever they do a purchase on my shop and online store through giving them an exclusive discount. I have a Bitcoin investment and I’m usually converting my fiat into Bitcoin every month. This way, I can save fees on converting since I’m using my shop crypto sales as my investment then I give my fiat salary to the shop balance. But also it depends on how you handle your business capital. It’s not advisable if you need to liquidate your capital immediately for restocking of your items since the price of Bitcoin is too volatile and the fees on converting it to fiat is sometimes high. You might get a negative profit with I wrong move of conversion to fiat. But in general it’s good if you can manage to add an extra fee on their purchase instead of discount.",

This demand is achieved by individuals.The important percentage now is that stores continue to accept cryptocurrencies.",

So for now I don't accept crypto but I don have plans to adopt Bitcoin into my business as soon as my business starts to grow and maybe later on add some more like BNB, LTC and maybe DOGE (I'm adding BNB because it's transaction fee is lower than that of Ethereum). But for now I'll stick to my fiat.",

If only a small percentage of your customers are paying you with BTC, you can use that income as a form of dca to hold BTC for the long run, but to do that successfully you must be sure of the continuity of your business with the fiat income you are receiving. BTCpay is a recommended payment processor you can use to accept BTC in your business.",

People are really accepting it and giving the value as they are giving to fiat payments.Are you guys accepting crypto payments for your business?It is very good to accept Bitcoin as payment because it offers diverse benefits to customers and to you as a business owner. It's privacy, fast, reliable and security attributes are some of the benefits of using it. It could also help to attract more customers from different countries to your business. International financial transactions are done with little or no restrictions. The problems most businesses encounter due to the inadequacies of conventional banks are limited.But the first thing I will consider before accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment is government policy on cryptocurrencies. If the government favours cryptocurrencies it would be a big boast to consider it as a means of payment. There are some countries that have banned crypto transactions, using it as a payment option might attract punishment from law enforcement agencies.The goods or service you offer should also be considered. If you sell products that are very cheap, using Bitcoin might not be advisable because of the transaction fees. The popularity of Bitcoin in your location is also important. If your customers are asking for Bitcoin as an alternative payment option, then it is important to include it. But there are places where people are very ignorant of cryptocurrencies, this option might not be effective in such areas.",

Who doesn't want to skip a fee when you're buying your own Bitcoin or trading it from fiat to crypto. If someone pays you directly with Bitcoin, I believe the buyer would  usually eat the transfer fee for you to have the item or service's whole amount paid. Other than that, the merchant also has the opportunity to multiply those payment made with Bitcoin, when the price starts to rally again. Those merchants/service providers who accepts Bitcoin payments actually have foreseen the potential of Bitcoin's future.",

Majority of businesses today are done in fiat, and now, few merchants are moving towards Bitcoin. It's a matter of time before we will see the benefits of accepting bitcoin as payment. In my view, the main hurdle in accepting bitcoin is regulatory compliance. There are governments that want tax on every payment made while with bitcoin, it's impossible to tax every transaction.",

Because Bitcoin is not legalized in my country. I have put a hold on introducing crypto currency transactions in my business because of the administrative hassles.

But before you want to accept crypto payments for your business, you should check the laws in force in your country because if the use of crypto for payments is not allowed, you could be subject to penalties from your government.If your country allows crypto payments for businesses, you should find out what it takes so you don't break the rules. Regulations such as tax issues, licensing, and others. Don't get yourself in trouble for using crypto improperly and receive a warning from your government.",

Are you guys accepting crypto payments for your business?So far this is one of the best decision I have made in business. I accept bitcoin payment for my consultancy services and some other transaction I get involved in the course of doing business. If the people I am dealing with are digitally inclined I will relate with them about bitcoin and see their response. Atleast I have been able to onboard few business associates and they are all doing fine and thanking me for showing them the way about bitcoin.  Bitcoin acceptance is gradually growing in fact, that was amongst the sole reasons why Nakamoto invented bitcoin so that business can be done through bitcoin payment whereby everyday individuals can transact with bitcoin without any third party interference, no much charges, no much delay in transactions as a result of the nature of the deal, the mobility and scalability, safety and lots more.",

You need to understand that cryptocurrency 8s extremely volatile. So if you are willing to accept crypto payments for your business, you will have to accept the volatility as well. So decide wisely if you are ok to accept that volatility or not. If yes, go ahead with it.
