After carefully analyzing the situation, we realized where the problem lay. In fact, you ordered cards and made a payment in Bitcoin, which took several hours to be confirmed due to network congestion. Meanwhile, the cards were \"reserved\" but not paid for. The stock was not reduced accordingly and in the meantime, someone paid for the same cards by VISA. These were the last cards, hence the backorder. Again, sorry for the inconvenience.",
