And it simulates it so well that it scared US banking/government into kicking it out - as much as they can, of course.Putin and BRICS have a ready made form of money in Tether. It at least is a form that they could use, attaching gold to it in some way.Since the US dollar debt money and Tether are similar, why not?",
