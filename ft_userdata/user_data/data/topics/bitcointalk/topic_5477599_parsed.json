Manchester City can do it in this competitionthe other teams, such as Fluminense, will go into the competition without much rhythm in the game because the Brazilian championship ended a few days ago, so the players will not have the same motivation and speed they had, I don't know anything about the team from Mexico and Japan , but I know a little about the Egyptian team, they are a good team, but I highly doubt they will win this competition. so the favorites to win this competition in my opinion will be Fluminense and Al Ittihad",

Karim Benzema have nice experienced with FIFA Club World Cup because he won 6 trophies when still playing with Real Madrid. Benzema can certainly help the team a lot, especially as he's known for scoring important goals. In a difficult match he can score a goal and solve the problem in a minuteQuote from: criptoevangelista on December 13, 2023, 06:01:15 PMLook, my team (Flamengo/Brazil) won't be in this year's World Cup, I'd like to see Manchester out of affinity, but anyone is ok for me.I just hope that FLUMINENSE doesn't win this...

It seems to me that even despite the low status of the tournament and the “easy” attitude on the part of the one who wins the tournament (European team hahaha, this year City) there is a very high probability that the opponent simply will not be able to score a goal.By the way, is this the last year that we are watching the world championship among clubs in this format? I know that FIFA seriously planned to reform it and multiply the number of games and participants. Starting next year, the European Champions League will be held in a new format, so it would be quite logical that this competition would also be held in a new way. But in fact, in both competitions, this will lead to the fact that only the games of the final stages (starting from 1/4) will be interesting, and everything else, as always, will be a tedious prelude (with rare exceptions, like this year’s group F in the European Champions League).",

Al Ahly SC's goal came from a penalty kick which was successfully taken by Ali Maaloul after 21 minutes of the match.Benzema CS is still trying to do their best to equalize the score in the first half with the various attempts they have made so far.In my opinion, Al Ittihad's opportunity to score a goal was still open because for 35 minutes Al Ittihad's possession of the ball was still dominant even though Al Ahly also carried out attacks that could endanger Al Ittihad's defense.",

His goal in that game also took his total number of goals in the competition to five goals which makes him the third all time top scorer in the competition two behind Cristiano Ronaldo and one goal behind second all time top scorer of the competition Gareth Bale.That being said, Benzema scored again today but his stoppage time goal wasn't enough to stop African champions Al Ahly from defeating Al Ittihad and send the out of the competition. The performance if Karim Benzema and his teammates today was very poor in my own opinion and that's why they were beaten by the better team in the game. They return back to the Saudi Pro League to continue from where they stopped in the league. Benzema is currently 35 years of age but judging by his current strength and general performance, I think the former French international still have few years to play professional football again.",

I hope they don't win a single match. I hate the Fluminense team lol     As a Flamengo fan that I am, I'm very sad to see that we're back to the times when they didn't win anything, before Jorge Jesus went to Flamengo, they were a weightless team, they were a weak team. But with the arrival of Jorge Jesus, Flamengo became a team that won games and I really enjoyed watching their games, but after Jorge Jesus left, they started to play badly and were no longer the same team. One thing I've noticed all this time is that all the teams that Jorge Jesus is their coach, these teams play well, they play in a way that makes it exciting to watch that team play. we just need to see how well Al Hilal from Saudi Arabia is playing, the team that Jorge Jesus and coach are at the top of the tableNow talking about Fluminense, I don't like them either, but in this tournament they are a team that has a lot of free time since the Brasileirao ended, Manchester City is busy with the premier league in which yesterday they lost points again and it's already Seeing the title is very far away and for this reason Manchester City will not put their good players in this tournament, even the good players who just sit on the bench I really doubt they will play. but there is the Egyptian team that beat the Saudi champion, so it may be possible that the Egyptian team can beat the Fluminense team in tomorrow's game, perhaps we could even be surprised with the Egyptian team winning this tournament.",
