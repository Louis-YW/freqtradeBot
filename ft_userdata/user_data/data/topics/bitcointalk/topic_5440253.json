  "content": "Is good to share testimonies sometimes to boost the fate of others, when I lost my both parents in 2012 I became confused of life where to start or what to about my life and I always desires to be educated. One day a friend was sitting close operating on bitcoin and I ask him what bitcoin is all about, he put me through bits by bits, I didn't rushed to put my money into it, I took time to learn for about months I was still learning.Then I finally took a step by investing and trading by myself, though is not always colorful as we expect but with due patients, I scale through the mindset of failures but keep enduring the ups and downs of bitcoin prices and to the glory of God, things went good over time.I was able to go back to school, relocate to city, rent a small apartment call self-contained, and I have a small shop where am managing. In as much as people have failed in bitcoin, many also have benefited from it, is all about being patients. So patients with whatever you're doing in due time, you will enjoy your labour.",

Although my story isn't as complete as yours but I have been able to handle my school bills by myself without having to worry my parents, although I don't haven a shop yet but I'm still hoping that in the nearest future I will be able to establish one after I have successfully acquire the knowledge required for running and managing the business. Btw, may their souls continue to rest in peace.",

We should keep both the positive and negative sides of crypto in mind as an investor. Wait sometimes I don't get what people understand by the term only source of income anyways because all understand about income is to have a sufficient balance that can pay all your bills and have some savings left in the account.So as a trader if ops can make enough profits over time that will sustain his financial well-being and pay for his bills that is good enough to be a source of income for ops.So we should avoid this statement of saying one should not take cryptocurrency as the only source of income but we should promote diversification of income, one can take cryptocurrency as the only source of income and later diversify into another sector.",

Is it that you missed something in the story? By the way, sorry for the lost of your lovely parents. In life something must happened for you to progress and move to the next level. Probably your parents dead encouraged you to face real life and conquer it. Coming to bitcoin investment.Understanding bitcoin is a rigorous process in which the learner must be patient to learn and he or she must have the eagerness to learn. And bitcoin is not a get quick rich scheme where people go and be scammed. One must understand bitcoin at least to some extent for investing, trading and for transactions. Risk management is a daily activities in the trading and invest field so you have to be aware of that.",

This is because bitcoin only crashes and with time it will recover completely and give even more profits. What happens is that when bitcoin price crashes those amateurs will sell their bitcoin on losses making it impossible for the price to recover.So with the nature of Bitcoin and especially from inception, no one should be saying they lost all in bitcoin.",
