  "content": "Alik BakhshiPutin's American hand will be cut off              Former US President Donald Trump has finally been formally charged by Attorney Jack Smith with a crime against the United States and its citizens in attempting to deceive the results of the 2020 presidential election. The charges on four counts are so serious that Trump could end up in jail for the rest of his life:   1. conspiracy to defraud the United States   2. conspiracy to obstruct official procedures   3. obstruction and attempted obstruction of official procedures   4. conspiracy to violate the rights of citizens.  In the old days, for such accusations, everything could end in an electric chair.    A month after Trump took office, I wrote an article about Trump's secret connection with Putin (1,2) and Russian interference in the 1916 presidential election. I hope Trump gets what he deserves, and dictator Putin finally loses hope of softening the US position towards Russia on the issue of war in Ukraine, given Trump's promise to quickly end the war if he is elected president in the upcoming elections. 1. Putin's hand in the White House. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/31426.html2. Putin's hand in the White House (continued). https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/32474.html    02.08.2023",

Though, that will only happen if prosecutors manage to corner him before becoming the President of USA once more.Because as far as I am aware the President actually enjoys from some immunity against procecution. And given he does not plan to spend time in prison, he may try again to remain in power.",
