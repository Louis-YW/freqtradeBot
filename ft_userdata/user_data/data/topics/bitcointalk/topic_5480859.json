These investors are making Bitcoin more popular and accepted but it is gradually moving the sector towards centralisation. Some mining pools are even asking for KYC which is a clear indication that they want to kill privacy. I am afraid that most of us here don't have the financial or political power to stop these moves but at least we could do our little bit by sticking with decentralised platforms. We have to enjoy privacy as long as it lasts by avoiding all platforms that ask for KYC.",

I mean sure a govt could technically make it illegal to own bitcoin yourself, though that would be preposterous. But that isn't how bitcoin works so it would be unenforceable. You'd just have people migrating away from centralized crypto exchanges to decentralized exchanges or other ways to buy bitcoin.And identity verification to create an address?? what?? You can literally create an address on your own. You don't need anyone's approval or verification to create an address, so again, unenforceable.Let's not worry about loony conspiracy theories alright. Let's focus on making Bitcoin better and growing adoption rather than talking about dystopian conspiracy theories. Just sayin. Don't worry so much dude hahaha.

The sudden change of SEC policy just to allow the approval of ETF which has long been rejected by them seems like a way out for them right now. If people could hold spot in institutions like Blackrock then they don’t have anything to hide as I believe the benefits the government is getting from this ETF saga is that they can Atleast kill the focal point of privacy and properly manipulate the market too. After this ETF I see them coming hard for non-KYC platforms or decentralized ones. Sadly most investors are not aware of this or maybe they don’t care, all they are after is it’s price pumping because this new scheme will bring adoption",

We are sleepwalking our way into a dystopia where Bitcoin is no longer \"A Peer-To-Peer Digital Currency\". For most (almost all?) holders of Bitcoin and other cryptos, the net-effect of their holding isn't peer-to-peer anyhow since they keep their account on some brokerage like CoinBase or Binance. Privacy-wise this is not that different than having money in a bank account and spending it. You can make anonymous payments, but I can't see a lot of people doing that since it's so slow/expensive.And things like buying a car is pretty much free of any earthly advantage since you need to... register the car in your own name, etc.And then there are rumors (or are they actually rumors anymore?) that the FBI is able to effectively trace bitcoin transactions. Net-net, just like cash, if you try to cheat the government out of relative pennies e.g. food servers not reporting all of their cash tips, most likely the government won't go after you (I am in no way endorsing tax evasion here!).But if you try to cheat the government out of a \"lot\" of money, you'll probably make it worth their while to catch you, and... using cryptocurrency probably isn't going to help you escape.Cryptocurrencies are a speculation instrument and nothing else, and there's nothing wrong with that. If people could just get used to that idea, they would stop worrying about all of these non-issues that cryptos keep having e.g. their lack of adoption as a mainstream means of payment.Quote from: NotATether on January 08, 2024, 05:26:03 PMBut what if it wasn't like this?Short answer: it probably wouldn't make much difference to Bitcoin's price since the percentage of people using cryptos to evade detection by their government is probably very low (not saying it's \"zero\" or anything of the sort, but percentage-wise, I suspect it's very low).",

Bitcoin is mostly used as an investment, so governments will focus on regulating just that - having exchanges do KYC/AML. They are not even worried about people using it as a currency and not paying taxes, because people don't want to use it as a currency for many reasons like fees, volatility, deflation.",

We don't have to report holding bitcoin and we don't have to report selling it for other cryptocurrencies. The bottom line here is that this legislation is mainly the problem of the US where brainwashed democrats like Senator Warren are trying to turn people's lives into a red tape hell. The silver lining is that from dozens of anti-crypto projects she submitted not a single one was approved by the Congress.

Currently, what we all feared has almost happened, where most exchanges, gambling sites and other platforms have already requested KYC, and countries require it, if exchanges do not want to comply then one day their business could be closed.But on the other hand, I believe there are always parties who disagree and can be a way to hide our identity, such as mixers, darkweb, and/or P2P exchanges. maybeIn the end we can only wait, wait for the future to come and hope that what we fear does not happen but I lack confidence",
