Why try to use that particular notification when you already have a good suggestion made to you in your first thread? The OP of the thread for which you dropped the link here has been inactive for years, which probably means there is a possibility of the bot being outdated as no fixing or update has been done to it over the years. The V2 Bitcointalk Supper Notifier is really an easy-to-use bot; you don't even need any coaching from anyone before you can use it. I will advise you to save yourself the stress and use the one recommended to you by the first person that commented on your post.",
