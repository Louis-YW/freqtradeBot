  "content": "Dear Community! Welcome to the AgroGloryTime board!We are a Ukrainian-based agriculture company, aimed at changing the landscape of investment attraction and the principles the synergy between the company and investors lies on.Getting weary of unfair terms offered by banks, we've looked for a proper solution in the blockchain field. Here's how the idea of $AGTI, the AgroGloryTime DAO's native asset, first appeared. Simplicity is genius - $AGTI allows our business to attract direct private investments, avoiding the loss caused by the high interest rates. The investors, in turn, access the asset with a guaranteed yearly interest of over 25% APR, which is binged to the shares of a currently operating business, regulated by the governmental watchdog.August 2022 is marked by the long-awaited $AGTI blockchain release.  The company is running a presale campaign with CEX and DEX listings planned in the mid-term.

There are several reasons we consider $AGTI and our tokenization platform to be a thing both for the company and investors. First, AgroGloryTime is an already profitable offline company, valued above $50 million. So it already brings profit, as well as has polished all processes related to raising crops and distributing them to the market. Therefore, the success of the tokensale won't affect the existing state of things. The company raises money with $AGTI not to become a business (as it's already on air), but to force its growth. Hence, even the lack of investors in the early stage won't hit the company, its plans, as well as its capability to comply with its obligations.Secondly, the model we offer is really attractive, although it might look a bit uncommon for today's market. Our investors earn both from the token price increase, and the profit from our online business, which is shared quarterly in stablecoins. Last year AgroGloryTime raised over 1,000 tons of vegetables, while the company constantly increases its productivity. And the potential here is almost limitless, as it now manages almost 5k acres of highly fertile land in a promising location. You can explore more HERE.  Last, but not least, we are building a truly fair and transparent business. AgroGloryTime is a white company, regulated by Ukranian watchdogs. Also, we make a big stress on consistent direct communication. For instance, you can find our owners answering questions in Ukrainian chat, so you can get your Qs answered firsthand. We will help you with translation there:)So, these are just a few points. Again, we are not in a hurry, and we are not too dependent on the fundraising campaign success. Whether it will go faster or slower, we and our early investors are backed with real already working business, which won't be cancelled or disappear, like many crypto startups.Thanks again for asking! Feel free to explore our company on social media!",

Great, we are thinking the same way. Here's why the $AGTI value is not binged to any other token's performance, but backed with the revenue of a $50 million registered Ukrainian company. Last year, AgroGloryTime harvested a crop exceeding 1,000 tonnes. This year we've already surpassed this level. Do the math - what is the ongoing trend for the next few years regarding the food market? This is where $AGTI value comes from.

As far as $AGTI is quite an untypical utility token, we do not publicly announce the soft and hard cap. This is because our main offline product - the AgroGloryTime company and its agriculture businesses are already operating. So, although we run a pre-sale, the product itself already works, as well as the token functionality. The USP of $AGTI token is its share from our real business profits, so we don't wait here until the campaign reaches any certain level. Every adopter is already accessed to the quarterly paid APR, no matter how early they came.",
