(BAKE) is it good to have in long term?Bake is a dex type token also and they are competitor of cake which is I believe the biggest dex on bsc network. So in terms of competition, its not bad for having there some alternative like bake. However, they need to improve more if they want to be on long term since many dex platform are doing their best to fit in environment.",

Bake was just only copy cat from cake. I do believe that bake will be stagnant at this moment. The question is why are you picking this token instead of real one like cake? Bake has been dumping so hard. It may potentially to rebound but it will not as big as cake.

I don't see any good reason to use this as an investment other than gambling with random pump that may come anytime. This token has no yet recovered and the chance for pump to come is still there.",

We have seen instances wherein 'copied' token concepts resulted to a countepart of the 'original', one instance is forked coins such as bch. It has advantages over btc but why does it seem that Bitcoin is considered still to be a bigger crypto? It uses a bigger or larger block size for faster transaction but was still left behind on a long run. There are also cons for related token names such as with Terra Luna, wherein they have released a new version but the impression towards the past one has been tangled to the new one which pulled its potential down as well. Much better if you'd either go with new coins having new concept or utility , or go with the big names in this industry for a long run. I guess that would result to a bigger chance to generate profit.",
