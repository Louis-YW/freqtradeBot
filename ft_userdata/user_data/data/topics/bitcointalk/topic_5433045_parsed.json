  "content": "Hello to everyone I‚Äôm in a likely situation so I wanted to ask some questions. First of all, I never opened another sportsbet account. I opened just one account on sportsbet and I don‚Äôt have any else. My nickname is ‚Äòdoktor17‚Äô.On 1st of January, I win a bet and won 6472 usdt totally. I tried to withdraw 6000 but couldn‚Äôt. There was a notification that tells me I must contact with safety team of SB by email. I tried to connect live and ask about the withdrawal problem that I had but there was no live support button. So I mailed to safety and assurance team and they wanted me to verificate identity. I did the verification successfully and told them. They mailed me that my verification is successfully completed, they‚Äôre making an investigation about multi accounting on me and they also said that if I have any other accounts, it would be nice to tell them. I told I never had any other then they sent me 3 account nicknames that I don‚Äôt know and never get in touch with. They also told me that I successfully got over second level investigation (I dont know what it is). That was the last mail I had. During this proccess, I tried to withdraw my money and get a notification that tells me ‚ÄòI cannot withdraw money in 48 hours since I deposited money for security reasons‚Äô but I had not deposited any money for security reasons. After all of these, I deposited some more USDT in my account because of that ‚Äòsecurity reasons‚Äô notification. It‚Äôs been 1 day after my deposit. I cannot get any answer from safety team, my budget is still same in SB. I cannot take bets on the site. I want to ask that how long does it take to investigate an account? My bets were clean, I‚Äôm just a person who likes betting and 6400 bucks is a big money for me.

Sportsbet.io's representative won't join all topics created by you. Additionally, forum members will have more difficulty to follow all discussions and evidence from two or many topics.Second, if a casino detects and announces that you are cheating with multiple accounts, it seems you have very slim chance to appeal. Their decisions are usually very correct.",
