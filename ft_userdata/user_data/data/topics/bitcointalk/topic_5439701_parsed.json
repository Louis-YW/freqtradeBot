  "content": "There are people for whom the only way they have heard about crypto currency is from being referred to an airdrop by friends or through online ads, and this is my neighbor, who is one of them. I live in a rented apartment where others are also living. There is this guy who is kind of close to me. I'm always active online with either my phone or computer, which always made him ask me questions like, \"What are you always busy doing online with your phone or computer?\" Abi you don they do fraud?\" I told him I'm a Bitcoiner, and I am also learning online. has ask how can he become a holder, I told him it's simple but the risk is huge. made him understand that holding Bitcoin is simple, but the risk of losing your starting capital is high, and that before you can consider buying and holding Bitcoin, you should prepare your mind to count loss sometimes, which can later turn to profit if you don't sell out of panic. Ask him to go and think about it first before rushing into it, and when he has come to a conclusion and is ready to accept the risk and take responsibility for anything himself, he should let me know. Yesterday, while watching a Manchester United match together, he brought out the topic again and told me he had some spare cash he was willing to risk, which he called a \"bold step.\"Today I helped him purchase bitcoin using Binance P2P, and it was a success. The crypto was deposited into his funding wallet. since he was already participating in airdrops and had a crypto wallet on his phone. I asked him to copy out all the phrases from the old wallet into his mobile wallet and back it up in a safe place where he would be the only one to access it. When he was done, I asked him to wipe the app data, and the mobile wallet was as clean as a new wallet. switch off the internet connection and create a new wallet again. After the successful creation of the wallet, I asked him to write down the new phrase and safe-keep it again, which he did successfully. We then generated a new Bitcoin address, which was used to withdraw the purchased Bitcoin to his private wallet, over which he has control. He asked me why not just leave the coin on Binance so that when ever he wants to sell it, he can just use the same method; that's when I brought to his notice \"Not your key, not your coin,\" and he was convinced.",

This is the only way you can be held less responsible if anything bad happens, I only bring in stubborn and self-ready people into Bitcoin investment, I always make sure to scare the heck out of them, to make them want to quit. This is the only way to find the strongest at heart among those who want magic investment without any risks.",

I wouldn't buy BTC for anyone for many reasons, it is better to go on a long teaching with them on how to buy, sell, hold BTC, the risks in it, privacy, the best wallets to use, etc, after sometime and if the person still shows interest, they will buy BTC themselves without any assistance.If you buy BTC for your friends, they may blame you later if they lose it, or when the price plunges. With even experienced bitcoiners making mistakes and losing their BTC's, i always believe people should hold fiat until they believe within themselves that they can hold BTC themselves and control their money.",

If you will just gaslight the advantages of this technology then you are simply dragging them to danger. A friend won't do that. Been there; I was just wanting to share how I got my profit so I encouraged some of my friends. But little do I know, the market is just unpredictable. When a correction occured, they suffered from huge loss and they immediately sold to somehow cut it. Make sure they have the knowledge to invest first.",

Helping him to do the purchase and the rest is good but I hope if anything happens to his investment, you wouldn't be help responsible? if not a good neighbour will turn out to be a bad one. He has an investment that he doesn't know anything about which might lead him to lost,if he thinks bitcoin is for making quick profit.You should teach him constantly and if possible introduce him to this forum so that he can learn on how to keep his coins safe at all time. You would have taught him on the wallet aspect and tell him to create his wallet himself because from your explanation,he has zero knowledge on bitcoin. Private keys that two or more persons have seen is not private anymore. Hope you also told him to keep his seed phrase secured from third party.Quote from: Easteregg69 on February 13, 2023, 01:09:02 PMPeople think they are better is what it boils down to.Pls stop spamming, you should have written the two post you did in one post.",

It is possible that OP is so excited that he wants to share his experience with the community. We have indeed had so much of this kind of thread created with the intention of merit fishing which is not proper. And I think it should be highly discouraged. Although everyone wants to receive merit but let's focus more on quality than reward. And the truth is that quality posts will always attract rewards (merit).But I don't also think we should just conclude that their sole intention is to seek merit. These attacks might discourage some members that have genuine experiences about Bitcoin that deserve to be shared in this forum. My advice is that if you think a post is targeted at merit hunting, just don't give merit to the post. If these merit fishers observe that they are not getting merits, they would no other option but to abandon this strategy.",
