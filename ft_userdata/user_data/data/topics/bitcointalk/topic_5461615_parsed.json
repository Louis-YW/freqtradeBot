If I say something wrong please correct I will take corrections. I doubt this, as most newbies who come to this forum these days are always good at creating new threads expressing themselves and using them as a form of introduction. On this thread, a lot of members always take the time to drop links to those rules and guidelines on how they can survive the forum.With the rules being stated out to them, it is left to them to follow them up. Because it will be cumbersome for them to cover, others also try to make it simple by breaking them rather than to their understanding, pointing out the ones that they believe newbies should be aware of. Sometimes their ignorance is actually what gets them to break the rules.Quote from: Hatchy on July 31, 2023, 07:09:35 PMthere's no need to bring old threads back to the top when we can explore new ideas instead.

If any newbies or forum members are searching for past discussions, they can use the search bar or browse through the oldest pages to find what they're looking for.New ideas are always welcomed to be studied and discussed; this is to be applicable to other discussions that do not concern the forum rules. If I understood the OP correctly, the Topic is centered on the rules that newbies are not aware of, so instead of creating an entire new thread with new rules and ideas that will be a little complicated to some, It's also important to note that Rules are what govern an organization and keep it going, so constantly changing them won't be healthy. Changes can be made, no doubt, but the main thread where the rules were first shared will always be referenced, or they will even be updated on that same thread. but for the official and non-official rules of the forum.",

If I say something wrong please correct I will take corrections. So far as it's important and the reply you want to make in the thread correspondents, commenting on it to bring it to the front headline of the board isn't disallowed and I have seen many old thread too that are being moved from far back line of the board to the first page. For the rules and regulations it's actually pinned in the first page of the board so I doubt any newbie will miss it. As for old thread, no doubt we can learn alot from them as I also learned a vital information from an old battle between two users on a particular thread over a particular users copying someone picture on the internet and the argument was if the action can also be called plagerism or copy pasting.Here is the link to that particular old thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1926895.msg55511429#msg55511429",

If there be any thread that needs to be recycled or bumped, it will happen naturally. How do I mean, that post can be found through search option and then be bumped. Besides, there's some thread that the information in them is no longer valid with the present situation, bumping them will cause contradiction. Such can be seen in the speculation board.Quote from: rachael9385 on July 31, 2023, 06:45:56 PMSome users do get band because they have forgotten so of this threads that stats forum rules.
