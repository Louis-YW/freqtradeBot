Hey, maybe I’m wrong, prove it by linking to products from thanosmining.com, d-central.tech, or parallelminer.com (aliexpress.com or even eBay.com) from now on.Not saying there is absolutely anything wrong with Zeus but sly marketing like this is highly distasteful. This isn’t really new or clever but you have to disclose affiliation if you hope to avoid the backlash.",
