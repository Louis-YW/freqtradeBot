  "content": "Stateless clients in general are something between Full nodes and SPVs or light nodesThey do not store the full system status, but still they verify every TX in the block with the help of a stateless server that sends them proofs.Utreexo, and other previous designs like Red-black trees by Andrew Miller originally introduced in this group back in 2012 I think, they all send proofs O(log n) by storing some form of a Merkle Tree.Now, when I started learning Zero Knowledge Proofs, I'm wondering if there's something like Ethereum Verkle Trees have been implemented on Bitcoin(a stateless design that gets Constant size proofs { instead of O(log n)} using a Zero Knowledge scheme called KZG that treats data as polynomial coefficients) .I'm just exploring what's new in the area before seriously working on the idea.Thanks",
