  "content": "Hello dear forum friends, let me tell little bit about my bitcoin story.- First time I ever crossed ways with bitcoin was in 2019.I was in a country for holiday and had lost my wallet and passport, so I was in urgent need of some cash. My family could not send me any money online (at this time I did not know about bitcoin)BUT.. maybe i don't remember but I had some hundreds of dollars in my PayPal account, so I asked around if anyone wanted to trade PayPal for cash. (People thinking i was a retarded robber maybe  )Anyway.. When I realised it was impossible i went back to my hotel room and open Google and brain storm and looking all online \"How to change PayPal to cash instant\".... But only came up to scam webiste's at least what I thinking in the time... Then after an hour I did find out localbitcoins and at that time, my life was gonna to take a huge positive change.I had a copy of my passport in my phone so with that and do a selfie i created an account on LCB.Then I checked it out and looked the offers and I was so nervous and skeptical about this  . Anyway! I find somebody that sold BTC with PayPal so I started there. I bought my first bitcoin ever (for the reason to get cash in a later stage) Everything went smooth, I paid he released and both was happy.Now my next problem to get the BTC to cash in the country I was in (Thailand).. After just a couple of minutes I find a lot of people buying BTC with the offer \"Cash at ATM\".It works like this I open a trade from his offer, I go to the ATM and put in a code and got my money then I release the BTC. I was so nervous the first time and thinking it will never work  , But it did! I had my cash now and all my panic problems solved. Thanks to bitcoin & localbitcoins.Thanks to this when I looked around the website I saw the opportunity to actually make money from BTC with \"buy for one price sell for another\"I started my \"buy&sell BTC\" carrier and it went amazing, i started to get quite huge profit relativity fast.But... I still wasn't in a happy place in life, drank a lot of alcohol, used drugs and was generally not happy and in a dark place, i was just out from prison 2019 and was living my life like its no tomorrow.And so it did go on until like a year ago, when I decide to stop drink alcohol and using drugs and focus on build up my life and get in touch with my family in a good way again.So I did...I started to save a lot of money and had a lot of money over now when I did not drink or use drugs. (I been always making good money - but ending up spending it very fast)I signed up on the forum this year in February and since then I have bought BTC and some other currency's that I store and never touch at any time. I just letting it grow.Why did I not invest earlier? Because I wanted to understand BTC and crypto currency more before I invested money in it, and this forum is a great way to actually do that. (THANK YOU TO ALL MEMBERS HERE) - For helping me answer all questions even if them have sounded stupid.    Anyway.. since February I have started to invest and keep the BTC i earn from my p2p-trading profit instead of selling it and get cash.With that said. I have bitcoin to thanks for so much. I am happy with my life today, me and my family are much closer and happier and I have a good economy and it all is because of bitcoin! Thank you bitcoin for giving me this opportunity.So how look my portfolio look today?BTC       - worth of 13.200:- USDT     - worth of  4.800:-DODGE   - worth of 3.740:- SOLANA  - worth of 1.760:- The amount is not in US DOLLARS its DKK.This is how much i have in my portfolio today.The more important is the thing that I started my invest journey. The portfolio grows in value every month  I know USDT is probably not the invest currency to go, but I bought some because of avoid the problem I had with BTC transfer that happen like a month ago when the fee's was so high.  Do I miss some \"need to have currency\"? or have missed something else? All tips are welcome! But one thing I can promise you all, that my BTC/CRYPTO-Journey has just begin and I will go much deeper in this and learn and explore a lot more. Im still a rookie in the game",

      "body": "Definitely you changed your life because you mentioned you were out from prison and started doing all these so it's really a positive and now you have over 20K in your crypto portfolio which is great achievement too. But I advise you to have some cash as well unless your Fiat is going through too much inflation and also you can minimise the allocation of USDT and increase the BTC portfolio value as much as possible.You are doing great and keep learning about trading and in general of making money then you will reach certain heights that you never dreamt of.Good luck buddy!",

TBVH, i am a religious person and i have never used any kind of alcohol or drugs and i always tried not to spend time in bad company such as gambling and another type of people involved in small crimes which leads to bigger ones. The point is, i know how it feels when you give up your bad side of life and try to run for a good one and i am also so amazed that how you met with BTC in that journey and how much you understand its potential. I am so amazed, that it is that much hard to change your PayPal currency into a local one while it is easy to convert your BTC into local currency. Well, i do know how it becomes easy when you have BTC ATM which we do not have in our country but still, i thought Paypal works everywhere (except our country hehe). I have also gave a though to become a p2p trader of BTC but you do need cash for that and as a student i do not have that, so i gave up that idea, now i am focusing on earning BTC via my skills.",

I just had an idea why people see \"light at the end of the tunnel\" at btc. I guess it has to do with hope. If OP up to a certain point introduced the wrong way of life, then after interacting with bitcoin, his life orientations changed. Why? Because he gained in faith that btc will change lives through investment. Because he will not have to remain a beggar after many years of work. Why save money if it will depreciate very soon - it is better to spend it on dubious pleasures. Perhaps the author felt something similar. Not knowing how best to preserve the value of money. Until found out about BTC. Bitcoin gives hope for the opportunity to secure a future with at least an acceptable level of prosperity. When you don’t know what you will live on tomorrow, it creates discomfort due to uncertainty. Bitcoin gives some certainty to its investors, hope. Am I right @CYBER_COWBOY?P.S.

I’d advise you to never do this again and try to find out ways to buy BTC without having to deal with personal documents.Especially because you’ve withdrawn the money in cash. What do you do if next week you’d be asked to prove you haven’t made profit? Or scenario 2: there’s a coup in your country. The new leadership decides Bitcoin users are criminals.I bought using a Bitcoin ATM that requires no personal documents to allow you to purchase.You bought from localbitcoins who now has your name, face and ID.Which one of us gets caught and punished?I’m really curious, why did you buy so much USDT? BTC fees are high but if you asked me it’s pointless to hold that much money in a digital currency that is 1:1 with USD. It’s probably easier to just buy physical USD instead.  Do you have a reason you have that much money in a crypto that is highly centralized and provides as much as (or less than) ole fiat does?",

It's actually not easy for me to read through such a long thread, especially not this one.Secondly, congratulations to you, the OP, for starting your investment life. Every amount of money anyone decides to invest in something is actually what is called an investment, and as such, the person is qualified to be called an investor. Investors mean you, as an individual, You have willingly channeled some part of your assets into something that can give you some financial return, either in the stock market, Bitcoin or any other crypto, or real estate. The invested amount does not matter; it's what you have that will give you a return, and profit is all based on the invested amount. When profit is shared among investors, no matter how little your investment is, you will definitely get your own share.",

Spaceman1000Yes a bit strange, anyway thank you  20kevin20I just swapped some BTC to USDT because I wanted to have it, just because avoid losing to much if BTC fall down very much.Or if this problems with BTC FEE's happens again.And also I have a small loan service here on the forum (that is dead but anyway) it can be good to offer USDT there to. Maybe its better if i swap back and take to small loss the exchange fee cost.Nwada001Thank you for the kind words and good tips.AdbitcoCool  I just wanted to share my story and give the forum the chance to learn me a little bit better.",
