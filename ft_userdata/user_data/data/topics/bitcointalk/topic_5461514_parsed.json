      "body": "I gotta give my vote to Tommy Fury here, KSI is good and all, for a content creator boxer and I'm not sure if his past bouts ever game him the opportunity and the experience to give him all the cajones needed to fight a professional boxer, and a lossless one at that. Although for sure, considering Tommy's 9 fight record KSI's bound to be able to do something on his end that may upturn the fight but I wouldn't really rely much on probabilities. And while my vote remains to be on Tommy's end I for sure know that KSI's not going down without a fight, and may even not go down considering he's built like a mini-tank lol. Really excited about this fight and I hope they are able to prepare generously for this since there's only 2 months left before the bout.",

Tommy Fury has proven how good he is by beating Jake Paul I don't think KSI has a chance at all what will interest the public here, it's going to be a lopsided match Tommy should be fighting real boxers if he wants to achieve what his brother Tyson achieved.His career as a boxer is going nowhere if he keeps fighting Youtubers because its a no-bearing match and it's not a stepping stone to have a good rank in boxing, we can understand if its a match again Jake Paul because the first match is close, but fighting KSI is like he is not taking his boxing seriously and if something goes wrong and KSI upsets him, he'll have something to regret.",

KSI is in trouble here if he doesn't prepare Tommy's last fight shows how he improved as a boxer I wonder why he turns to fighting celebrity Youtuber again, after fighting Jake Paul he prefers doing this stuff because he has no chance against the elite in the light heavyweight, I guess there's money doing this kind of fight, let's see who among the best Youtube boxer will be in the card Salt Papi has good boxing skill I hope he gets after his last fight which ended in a loss, I'm sure he will try to make a comeback.",

KSI usually laughs at people in his videos so he doesn't want to be laughed at and trolled by critics and supporters if he goes down easily or completely dominated like a kid. He'll at least try to make it a respectable effort close to how Jake did.QuoteReally excited about this fight and I hope they are able to prepare generously for this since there's only 2 months left before the bout.Promoting the fight and all interviews will eat some of that preparation time unfortunately.",

This is getting closer to having a fight between KSI vs Paul though.  Maybe they will be the next.Tommy also agrees after all he made a good tune-up against Paul. The Furys are really making sacks of money with the sports they chose while picking opponents lesser than them.",

I know he already fought Mayweather but it was clearly a rigged match because there is no way an experienced boxer like Mayweather wouldn't knock out Logan Paul.",

You can say that, but you also have to keep in mind that he's not that dedicated when it comes to training and preparing for fights, not to mention that he's taken a break which may have made him rusty over time but I still believe he'd put up a great fight, especially against KSI who never really had a dedicated boxing training as much as athletes do, maybe not even at the level of training that Jake Paul's subjecting himself these days.

It is true that commitment and training are essential in boxing, and Tommy's break may have had an impact on his abilities. He might still do well in the battle, though, as experience can be a big factor. KSI's training history may not be as long as that of athletes, but his prior success in boxing competitions may be an asset. Since this is a boxing match between YouTubers!!!rather than a title match, the adrenaline could not be as high, which might change how they approach the bout. Watching how everything plays out will be intriguing.",

KSI is a decent fighter, I'll give him that, but Tommy Fury managed to beat Jake Paul - an okay-ish fighter that proved to go against some of the (washed up) fighters that have made a name for themselves on their previous sports. I would love to see the lines for this, and see whether the bookies will favor Tommy Fury. If the odds between them are almost even, I'd pour my money out to Tommy Fury. Though if this is one of those fights that already has a winner decided even before the actual fight takes place, KSI will surely win. You'll never know in these kinds of events.",

But despite the considerable age difference and height advantage which all favor the younger brother of Tyson, it seems KSI is athletic enough to give Fury a run for his money.
