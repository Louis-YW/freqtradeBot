  "content": "Hello,I've noticed bitmain and canaan are starting to enable the spot buying on their official website. The prices are really low compare to the price weeks ago, especially Avalon brand with maximum 51% discount.As I know the asic hardwares are usually short-provided products, but suddenly factories are promoting them, does that mean fewer buyers in the market?What do you think of the asic mining future?",

It took me more than 2 years to fully understand this.",

It took me more than 2 years to fully understand this.This is a good set of info.I will add that if you want to buy some avalons be able to buy 4 not 1.Buy 1 or 2 now and buy 1 or 2 later and maybe buy 1 or 2 after that.this is a dca method (dca is dollar cost average)the worst thing you can do is buy 4 avalon shoot the load and then have them drop even lower.Back in 2018 I grabbed l3+ from bitmain I dca purchased 12 of them the price kept dropping I kept buying 1 or 2 say 1300 all the way down to 500 a unit.I made a ton of money on these when doge mooned.If I jumped in at the first price drop I would have got maybe 6 or 7 I ended up with 15 from them and later when price dropped more I got 10 more .  So dca was great for me.Note I gave you a merit with my philipma1957 account",
