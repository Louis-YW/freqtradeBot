I registered on a local gambling site, I went to a fiat ATM machine to fund my betting account. I chose four matches with 2 odd included and I won the accumulated bet. That made me thought gambling is easy, not knowing it was the beginning of addiction and losses to come.",

I found a lot of information and big events here, so I felt more comfortable doing gambling activities, of course trying some deposits. I play blindly and learn at the same time, because I want to quickly understand and can play, more precisely I start gambling learning + practice .",

      "body": "My first online bet was on Plinko. I think it was introduced to me by a friend. I do not remember which gambling site it was but there are free sats or faucets that I used to play the game. I never won any, I always lost. I got disappointed with that game and just stopped it. I do not really lose any money because I used the faucet to get something I can use to bet on it. It was a good past time but sometimes frustrating since I do not really win. Later on, I discovered sports betting and that is when I fall in love with gambling online. I never looked back to casino games anymore. I can easily bet on my favorite teams or sports without even having to get up from my chair. It is very easy and convenient. That is why most people get easily addicted to online gambling.",

They first have to figure out how to buy Crypto currencies and then they have to figure out how to transfer those coins to the casino.  I have added 3 x referrals from Brick n Mortar casino players to my online Crypto gambling site... and it was a mission to show them how to buy Crypto and also how to deposit those coins at the Crypto casino. (Then you need to explain the crypto values to them.. which is even more difficult) - Some of them are just playing with the Fiat values that are provided on this site.",

So I stumbled upon the most famous \"Martingale strategy\" that made me money initially. As we all know, that's not a complete proof strategy, and it can bite you in the butt if you have managed to continue and be greedy with it. Everybody has that experience where it's an \"aha\" moment, and you lose. So then I just relied now on luck.",

That happened before I got to know online gambling sites, after I got to know online crypto gambling sites, of course I learned more about gambling, how to place bets, how to play and all the ways related to these gambling sites, be it slot games, sports, dice, poker and so on.Conclusion: at first I was involved in gambling betting blindly and changing with the learning method as time went on, until now.",

I was betting on a sports betting site in 2011 where I was in some trouble with KYC as i failed to collect at the moment some required documents at that time. But there could be betting without KYC. I often won matches there. I first made a deposit of $100 and built my balance up to $700 within a few days. But when I submitted the required documents and got my KYC approved i started losing matches like that and finally my balance was zero.",

My parents still hate gambling to this day, but my grandfather taught me a lot about it with out them knowing. Also my first few card games I learned from him. So I was interested in casinos and gambling at a very young age. During high school I had some probability lessons and we did some roulette and blackjack games in class without money of course. As soon as I turned 18 I wanted to visit my first casino with some friends. We did have some strategies for roulette and blackjack, but lost all our money. We left the casino completely broke. I still remember today that on the one roulette table was a red steak of 7 or 8 numbers in a row and I placed a large bet on black only to see red come one more time. For the first time in a casino it was still fun and a great atmosphere.",

I had always been a strong lover of Football, Basketball, and Hockey. This interest built the desire to try and predict outcomes on sport matches and then eventually led me to try and test out my permutation skills on some bookie platform. My strong interest in sports was not actually replicated in actual gambling, and I gave upon it soon after, only now playing periodically, out of sheer curiosity on what the outcome would be, and sometimes for fun.- Jay -",
