How?\" A Reddit user thought they were following best practices until two days ago when their Bitcoin wallet was completely cleaned out.He said he used a good way to generate a paper wallet. HD wallet was created a very long time why are people still using the unsafe way to generate paper wallet.There are many HD wallets available that can be used. Example is Electrum.I checked the site on this forum, it has been known for scam vulnerabily since 2018. TryNinja, please edit this your 2017 post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2047618.msg20403112#msg20403112Re: walletgenerator.net, I find no way to verify the download with PGPDisclosure: Key generation vulnerability found on WalletGenerator.netIt was known to be a good site before, but now it is vulnerable that you will lose your coins if you use the site. I am wondering that someone will not make good research before using those generators. It is not good to even use JavaScript again to generate paper wallet. To generate a paper wallet, use HD wallet. How can a scam site like this be taken down?",

Google doesn't care, nor do they carry out any research whether certain sites are scams or not. It's also possible to purchase ad space and advertise scams in Google ads to other users. Remember when ChipMixer was still alive and you couldn't find the official website on Google? At the same time, there were loads of phishing sites that appeared on top of the search results. It's the same with other mixers, like Sinbad. The phishing versions aren't the first result, but they still appear close to the top.",
