  "content": "Inflation is a powerful factor in an economy or investment decision-making, it has driven Bitcoin to lower levels in recent years, which is why I don't like joking with it. I've also developed the habit of alerting my fellow BTT member about what I envisage on it before it actually happens.That said, the US CPI and Core CPI are the highest-valued inflation gauge for investment plans all around the world, and the next of such news is on the 13th of December (next week Tuesday) at 2:30 PM CET.See the expected figures:It's a day that BTC will be volatile towards either side depending on the figures released. Also, it's worth mentioning that the last US CPIs were unexpectedly released lower last month as shown below;CPI m/m:CPI y/y:Core CPI m/m:This helps the risk-on assets to rise against the USD, and the effect has lasted for a full month, although Bitcoin and other cryptos did not benefit much from it as it coincided with the FTX-induced issues.Now, I have my reservation about the next US CPIs figure to be released, it would possibly rise, and it might cause the risk-on assets like Bitcoin to sell. How do I know? The last US PPIs figures were released on Friday, this is another inflation gauge, only that it's not as powerful as the CPIs. The news was released higher than the expectations of the economists as shown below, which is a clue to know what to expect for the CPIs news on Tuesday.Note: As much as I would like to read your views about this, I hope it guides us better, but note that it's my personal view, anything could happen in the actual event.Keywords:CPI: Consumer Price IndexCore CPI: CPI where food and energy are excludedPPI: Producer Price IndexCore PPI: Producer Price Index where food and energy are excluded",

Its an admission that math and science aspects were thrown out the window, decades ago. Now we have entered the realm of makeStuffUpAsWeGoism. Many prefer this format. As there are fewer details, numbers and statistics to consider. Some say facts are too confining. In which case, they prefer a \"facts optional\" approach to the economy and job market their lives depend upon. Its the type of mindset that led to individuals like SBF operating billion dollar crypto funds. What could go wrong? What indeed.",

There are some doubts on which direction each world area is heading - it can be stagflation, it can be sustained inflation or it can be back to low growth and low inflation. Potentially, it could even get to mid growth low inflation.All these scenarios are possible, but my take now is that there should be more taxes and this being used to reduce debt, that is quite in general for the western developed worls.",

      "body": "I think it's a bit odd to decide whether to buy or sell Bitcoin based on inflation, especially CPI, most especially US CPI. I don't think I will ever make Bitcoin investment decisions based on this monthly data. For one, Bitcoin is global. I'm not sure if Bitcoin investors or traders are taking this data as an indicator for them to either long or short or buy or sell. That Bitcoin's price fell during the times when inflation rates of countries across the world have gone through the roof, was more of a result of global macroeconomic factors. Nothing was safe at that time. The entire global economy was suffering. There was the ongoing pandemic and the invasion in Europe and all their implications. Bitcoin's price was as much a victim as the high inflation numbers of many countries around the world.",

Though bitcoin should be different part and must not be included into CPI because it is neither providing any service nor its a good that can be utilized in the world. It's merely alternate medium for the current fiat system. To date everyone understands it as virtual currency or often as an asset which really confuses how it is considered in the traditional books anyways. What would balance bitcoin?Unfortunately, BTC has come very far but its always measured in terms of USD and with the time the volume of BTC-USD is rising a lot. Most of them are here to use it as means of earning more money by trading it and not utilizing it as medium of transaction. For example sending money to your aunt overseas or may be buying street food in Thailand with it. So this particular relation between USD and BTC is what making it move just like the way fiat is moving. Its complex. Bitcoin should have been left alone really.",

The higher-than-expected increase in November finished off hopes that inflationary pressures in the US would slow down. I do not think that a slowdown in inflation will occur in the coming periods. I can say that the world is preparing for the recession that will take place in 2023. The inconsistency of expected economic data supports this situation. I think that the figure announced in the November consumer price index report, which will be announced on 13 December, will be below the expectations. However, it is clear that chaos will not disappear without lowering producer prices.",

Since the PPIs figures were released higher on Friday, definitely, the CPI will be higher as it would definitely have a direct impact on it, which is envisaged to be higher.",

In November, my country's inflation rate has increased to 8.0%. Whatever the data in the US says, I wouldn't sell my Bitcoin. November data shows inflation in the US has cooled down, but other countries still has double figures. Annually, some have 3-digit numbers.

Do you want to compare just two months of depreciation in CPIs to many months of appreciation in it? I bet not. And what I wrote was pure speculation which might be in line with the actual figure or not, my disclaimer was also attached.My point was purely in line with economics where the producers' price could affect consumers' price in direct proportion. When you read the news, always digest it with what people say, and mind you, my point was made before the news, maybe a single month decrease in the CPI (then, before the last figure) could be called deflation as you seem to know better.",
