  "content": "Hello,On this page:https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/usdt-vs-usdc-vs-busd-differences/... there is a table with the title \"USDC vs. USDT vs. BUSD: Differences\".In the first line \"Blockchain\" of this table are mentioned all blockchains of USDT.So when I understand this page right, USDT is on the following blockchains:Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, Kusama, Algorand, Avalanche, Tron, Polygon, EOS, Liquid But further in the text it is a saying:Quote: \"Having different blockchains results in a variety of advantages, such as the speed and utility of transactions. While USDT only runs on a single blockchain, USDC and BUSD have multiple blockchain options, allowing buyers to trade and transfer across them.\"So this is a contradiction. First it is said, that USDT is on the blockchains Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, Kusama, Algorand, Avalanche, Tron, Polygon, EOS, Liquid.But then it is said, that USDT is only on a single blockchain.Very confusing.Would appreciate if anybody can explain this.",
