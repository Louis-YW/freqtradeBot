  "content": "Mood swings are sudden changes in one's emotions. People can change from being happy to being sad in a Twink of an eye without a particular reason. Consciously or not people's mood changes, these changes may last up to a minute, a day, or weeks depending on how one can control them. Some believe it is a sign of depression. I experience mood swings at least 3 times a week, this happens wherever I am idle, or alone. When the mood changes I tend to be very quiet, depressed, and lonely, and my food cravings increases, sometimes my mood swing got me thinking about life in general and what I should have achieved if given the opportunity. Sometimes I find myself daydreaming about the future ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.I control my mood swings majorly because it doesn't only affect me but also affects my entire day and people close to me, I hate to see people suffer or be unhappy because of me. What I do is, listen to music, watch videos, be optimistic and motivate myself, go for a walk and force myself to talk to people around me. This has helped me overcome my mood swings, I hope it helps you too.",

      "body": "you are almost the same as me. if there is a change of heart to be sad, I daydream about the future. but I always quickly get rid of these thoughts, and immediately think positively and then watch comedy videos or chat with people closest to me, so that I can reduce my sadness.",

      "body": "Well I do not get a lot of mood swings. But when I do I have the best way for me to control it.Â  I like to practice meditation so I can avoid letting myself get so upset from mood swings.If I have meditated I tend to let the anger pass through me. I will observe it but I do not let it control my behavior. If I havenâ€™t meditated sometimes I count to ten or even 100 and then I usually find myself more detached and less affected by my negative circumstances.",
