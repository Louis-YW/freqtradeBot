  "content": "QuoteDuring her appearance before Nigerian lawmakers, Aisha Ahmad, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), told lawmakers that out of the nearly $1.8 billion used to manage the local currency, over 90% of this total was reportedly used to fund expenses associated with the production of banknotes.The Growing Cost of Maintaining the NairaAccording to Aisha Ahmad, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), between the years 2017 and 2021, the apex bank spent an equivalent of nearly $1.8 billion, or 800 billion naira, managing the local currency. The production of new banknotes alone accounted for more than 90% of this figure.As per remarks published by the Punch, Ahmad, in her recent appearance before Nigerian lawmakers, also claimed that the cost of maintaining the local currency has been increasing by over $22 million annually. Before Ahmad’s disclosure, Kingsley Moghalu, a former CBN deputy governor, had also told lawmakers that the central bank uses approximately $336 million to manage the currency.In addition to incurring high costs associated with managing the naira currency, the CBN has to contend with the increased risk of counterfeiting, the report said. Meanwhile, in her testimony, Ahmad partly blamed the spiraling costs on what she characterized as wholesale hoarding of the naira by the Nigerian public.“An observation supported by statistics shows that cash outside banks consists of over 80 per cent of the currency in circulation; worsening [the] shortage of fit banknotes in circulation. This portends [a] negative public perception of the bank and increases [the] threat to financial system stability,” Ahmad is quoted as saying.To help the central bank overcome some of the challenges identified by Ahmad, the CBN introduced into circulation newly designed naira banknotes on Dec. 15. At the same time, the bank said Nigerian residents in possession of the old banknotes should return these before or by Jan. 1, 2023.Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/report-nigerian-central-bank-spent-over-1-8-billion-managing-local-currency/As I dey read this news wetin dey flow through my head is how true are this figures.

      "body": "First of all he dey hard to trust figures from this people but regardless the expenses to maintain paper money they very expensive because even USA Don complain about this thing. Watin she also talk about hoarding affecting it is true but my issue with them was una know say people gather this money for house and una still bin dey print more instead of finding solution to the problem then.On how to reduce the cost of maintaining the naira I think the solution should would be the printing of limited notes that's y I support there recent withdrawal limits. The best solution would have been an electronic currency and instead of government to think of how to bring bitcoin to work hand in hand with naira dem go create E-naira. The CBDC no bad but irregularities go still they the thing. So the best option right now na make them print less new notes and make he no dey outside bank plenty",

The cost of producing local currency is determined by a number of factors, including the materials used in its manufacture, the design and security features included on the currency, and the quantity of currency produced. that was one of the reasons for they redesigning of the naira to reduce some of the color and features, the naira note was becoming very expensive to produce.In general, the cost of producing currency rises as the amount of currency produced falls. This is because producing small quantities of currency is generally more expensive due to the fixed costs associated with producing currency, such as the cost of designing and printing the currency, as well as the cost of incorporating security features.",
