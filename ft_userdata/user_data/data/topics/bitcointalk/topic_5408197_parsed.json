I need someone that has far more braincells than me to please explain this LOL.It all sounds like his hardware wallet is used to unlock a normal electrum wallet, meaning that it somehow sends a password to Electrum and unlocks an encrypted file. A very bizarre setup, to put it mildly. Normally, a wallet file created by a hardware wallet won't contain any critical information - only metadata like xpub, addresses, transactions, labels, etc. No private keys or seed phrases. All private keys are always held on a hardware device completely offline. So, unencrypting a wallet file with no private keys gives nothing - you still need a working hardware device to sign transactions. I think that the crux of the matter is that he made a rookie mistake, he should have written down his recovery phrase somewhere, but he obviously didn't do it. If he had his recovery words on hand, he could insert them directly into a new Electrum wallet and get access to his funds.",

I need someone that has far more braincells than me to please explain this LOL.I might have exactly the same setup as the Twitter dude. My hardware wallet is a PiTrezor and for safety reasons using a mnemonic seed passphrase is recommended, because all wallet data and secrets are stored on the microSD card of the Raspi Zero.I'm still evaluating the PiTrezor, therefore I used it only with Testnet Bitcoin wallets so far and I try to replicate a lot of test scenarios. The Electrum Testnet wallet I setup with my PiTrezor is locked by the PiTrezor, so a potential thief should not have access to the funds without the mnemonic seed passphrase and can't open the Electrum wallet either. He wouldn't be able to see my transaction history nor any other details of my wallet.The error message indicates that the mnemonic seed passphrase has been entered wrongly. As every character counts, even trailing spaces, and UTF-8 is internally used the user needs to be careful.I'm not going to look into the Twitter thread if and what exactly is screwed up. All I can say is if you use it properly it works as it should.What I totally don't understand is: doesn't this Twitter dude have the mnemonic seed words and mnemonic seed passphrase as backup. That is all he needs to restore his wallet.In a safe offline environment (e.g. boot TAILS in offline mode) he could recover his wallet with the mnemonic seed words and mnemonic passphrase and check if his public addresses are correct and the wallet recovery worked properly. Then he knows that his mnemonic data is properly documented and a wallet recovery is no issue.I have no idea why this Twitter dude writes that there's no \"seed phrase\". It could be semantics, whatever he means by \"seed phrase\". I call the seed words as mnemonic seed words to avoid ambiguity. The optional seed passphrase I call mnemonic seed passphrase, not e.g. 25th word or so as it's not necessarily a single word.Quote from: witcher_sense on July 31, 2022, 07:03:40 AMI think that the crux of the matter is that he made a rookie mistake, he should have written down his recovery phrase somewhere, but he obviously didn't do it. If he had his recovery words on hand, he could insert them directly into a new Electrum wallet and get access to his funds.This! In the onboarding process when you create a new wallet with your hardware device you usually get the very clear instructions to write down the mnemonic seed words. How and why do people mess this up? Usually you also need to confirm that you documented your mnemonic seed words properly.OK, I'm no rookie with HD-wallets and I fairly know pretty well how they work and what is important. So I might lack the understanding why rookies screw things up.",

If you have already created an Electrum wallet paired to a hardware wallet which has a BIP39 passphrase, and then try to open that Electrum wallet file with the hardware wallet attached but with a different passphrase enabled, then you get this error. You can reproduce this on Ledger and Trezor devices too. It's just Electrum's error message of saying whatever wallet is open on the hardware wallet does not match the Electrum wallet file, and therefore it cannot be decrypted. This would also fit with the fact that he said he tried a different passphrase or no passphrase at all and received the same error when trying to open the existing Electrum wallet file, and also that he could create a new Electrum wallet file paired with his hardware wallet but it was showing a bunch of empty unused addresses.",

It should conform to BIP39 and as far as my experience goes, the hardware device communicates relevant details to Electrum. There's not much to tweak here, when you setup such a wallet.A user needs to understand some basic HD wallet and hardware wallet device details. The hardware wallet device can be unlocked by a PIN or Password/Passphrase. For convenience and ease of entry usually a PIN is used. You're usually allowed to enter only a few tries for PIN entry before the device resets itself. I consider this safe enough as long as you use no stupid PIN (I'd recommend at least 6 digits and no trivial numbers like 123456 or similar brain-dead combos).The HD wallet is determined by its Seed, represented in safely human readable form as Mnemonic Words, maybe an optional Mnemonic Passphrase (any unique Mnemonic Passphrase derives an unique HD wallet) and Derivation Path. With these details you can usually recover the HD wallet and every user should safely check if this works. This isn't very easy if you care about proper safety but it's no rocket science either.You can choose to have the Electrum wallet be encrypted by the hardware wallet device.

I have no idea what you mean by \"not a standard BIP39 passphrase\". How exactly Electrum derives the wallet file encryption key from the hardware wallet device is something which might need to be checked with Electrum devs or by simply inspecting the Electrum wallet code for those capable of reading and understanding the code.I have such a Testnet Electrum wallet encrypted by my PiTrezor. The Electrum wallet file looks like any fully encrypted Electrum wallet file. The Electrum wallet encryption key was never shown or exposed to me. The PiTrezor \"wallet\" is BIP39 of course by default and I use a Mnemonic Passphrase for safety reasons as the PiTrezor can't protect secret wallet data due to its data storage concept on unencrypted microSD card.When I want to open the Electrum wallet, I have to connect the PiTrezor, unlock it with the PIN and then I'm asked to enter the Mnemonic Passphrase and confirm it on the PiTrezor. Provided no input errors have been made which I could've spotted at the confirmation step the Electrum wallet gets unlocked and opened. I'd assume it's the same with a Bitbox02.As far as I remember, I tested that I can reset the PiTrezor, recover the HD wallet with saved Mnemonic Words and Mnemonic Passphrase and the PiTrezor still be able to unlock my PiTrezor encrypted Electrum wallet. But even if that wouldn't work because some specific serial no. of the particular hardware wallet device is mangled into the Electrum wallet encryption key (which is never exposed to the user in such a setup): no problem, no coins lost as you can create a new Electrum wallet file based on your hardware wallet device and the saved HD wallet details in it. (You might loose transaction comments/labels and active LN channels are an issue, so you may loose some Sats due to LN channel recovery/closing).",

But usually, the seed is produced from mnemonic words (not the other way around) by means of a key stretching function called PBKDF2. This function produces a 512-bit number - the seed.",

Checksum is needed to \"discover\" the last word, as each word from dictionary requires 11 bits known. That way for example 128 bits of entropy gives 11 words * 11 bits = 121bits, + 12th word is composed from 7 bits from entropy + 4 bits from checksum build from 128 known bits. 256 bits gives: 23 * 11 = 253 bits, so we have 23 \"hard\" words + 24th word created from 3 entropy bits + 8 checksum bits.Then, mnemonic phrase \"word1 word2 ... word12\" is converted into seed using PBKDF2 (sha512) etc. At this moment extra words are used. Then seed is converted into master priv key, which is used to obtain child keys. That's why having master priv key, you cannot find mnemonic phrase!",
