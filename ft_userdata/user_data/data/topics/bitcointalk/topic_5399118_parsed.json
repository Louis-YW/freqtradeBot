  "content": "I think USDC is making their move to introduce CBDC into the market. The problem with the US is that if you operate a money transmitter business in the US , you need to have a Bond for each individual state which starts at like 1M USD+. Other states have varying rates for their bond but it operates as an insurance for sending money. Now Banking licenses are also hard to acquire but USDC (Circle) has purchased their own Bank and they are acquiring their own Banking licenses.My theory is that with that , they can turn fiat -> USDC direct for their users. The SPAC they held for the acquisition of the bank itself would allow them to become the bank. I think this is the one thing that was missing in the US regarding crypto. Coinbase couldn't do this but Circle i believe has been able to succeed and i think they will be catalyst to the CBDCs. So the question is... Are you ready and prepared for the CBDCs? What do you think this will do to the crypto market with USDC becoming the standard?Tether? Any other stablecoins? https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/circle-getting-closer-to-applying-for-digital-bank-license/",

For anyone holding USDC, it doesn't add a lot of extra risk to stake with them (as they are the issuer of the coin)The only down side are the KYC and privacy implications.There are however some other good paying alternatives.In Binance you can find 10% APY for BUSD and USDT up to 2000 BUSD/USDT locked, which is amazing as well. It adds some risk, as you are now keeping some coins in an exchange. https://www.binance.com/en/earn",

They got Blackrock backing them. I remember they were holding what ,like 11T in assets?I think personally the smartest thing is Mortgage Backed Securites (MBS) in crypto form , Give it backing so you can earn a yield over a period of time. Makes the most sense to me. Turn slums into A AA AAA. People are over leveraged on their mortgages and with the market acting the way it is , We are at a point when a lot of people are broke. Crime Rises , People can't pay their mortgages , and foreclose , Black rock swoops in and buys all of the property at a discount and then turns them into MBS on the Chain. Ultimately if you print the money... Who governs you? No one. Are you accountable? No. Â You can print governments GDPs. You can overthrow governments and cause coups... All you gotta do is Quantitative ease.

In response to stablecoins being risky from hugeblack, I don't think we should fully compare luna (a non collateralised stablecoin) with one that is. Sure if you've put funds into the coin, there'll probably still be somewhere and it might not take much to prop it back up (perhaps 20% or something to restore the peg). I don't think anyone running a stablecoin well has decided to mint coins and give them away or has expectations of losing their billions somewhere else (it's likely they're invested to bolster company profits - likely in stocks or bonds - so can just easily be used to restore the peg). Stablecoins may die out when crypto stops growing, that's not happened yet and their main purpose currently is to offer faster transfers (when fast exchanges aren't needed, neither will they). They may be incurring a loss on that usdc or using it for other products or assets.I'd say 3% is probably a stable amount that can be offered to customers if you don't lock funds, I've seen uninsured investment services last quite a long time after offering over 5% fixed interest for locked funds which could be what circle are doing.They might also be able to get higher interest on loans given to crypto related companies but with good backing/insider knowledge to be more assured those loans won't collapse.",

I believe that they are going to end up with something like offering this type of situation for a while and then they are going to drop it and make it more sustainable when they have enough. This is the same with banks, and same with all the other places that offered a high amount return APY for the stablecoins.Let's assume that you offer 50% for people who put in USDC or USDT and then there are 10 billion dollars invested, and then you drop it to 10% which is sustainable and then there will be some people who leave but you will still have a few billion dollars left and people will not leave. That's what they are trusting it.",
