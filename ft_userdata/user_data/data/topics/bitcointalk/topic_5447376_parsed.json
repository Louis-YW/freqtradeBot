  "content": "Hello @sportsbet.io,It has been over 5 days since my account got locked and I can't withdraw any money from sportsbet.io and also no replies from security@sportsbet.io.My original deposit was 219 mBTC, and later I won the rest upon playing a slot \"Chaos Crew\". Went to withdraw my profits which was declined. Contacted sportsbet through email and found out that they have linked me to some account which I have no idea about and stopped my withdrawal in relation to multi-accounting.I was then asked for KYC, which didn't make sense to me since it was a bitcoin betting platform and the whole point of betting with BTC was being killed i.e. staying anonymous. Having no option, I went ahead and completed the KYC.\"Thank you for completing our online identity verification.Please note that your account was disabled due to being flagged for multi-accounting by our security systems. As this is strictly forbidden by our terms and conditions (namely terms 3.5 and 3.6) we would like to extend you the ability to explain.\"https://prnt.sc/b7Q612jfpfWmhttps://prnt.sc/-ubzSwWhILWsThe withdrawal which it says is confirmed, thats not true. Never received that withdrawal.I am looking for some lead where can I go from here. Since none of my emails are being replied to.Thank you",

He'll know what to do. Check that \"my messages\" button on the top side of your page.And if I may add about KYC, most casinos asked for this, not only sportsbet, and that's not because they're being nosy about their customer. It's one of the method to double-check account abuse and, more importantly, it's part of the requirement by government bodies that they have to comply to fight against AML-ATF, crypto casinos are threading a very fine line between complying with authorities and protecting their customer's privacy.",

Based on what the previous comment or reply says I think you were caught up in the process of enforcement of their new policy on their casino so they could be on the safe side as they felt gamblers are misusing the platform based on their standing policy then hence they had to review their policy for kyc and withdrawal and that likely affected your withdrawal. It is nice they have a representative here and are fully on ground to settle and resolve disputes with their clients.  You should try contact their representative and explain yourself to him and see how it goes. I believe that would solve your problem as long as you had no ill intentions before you were caught up in the web.",
