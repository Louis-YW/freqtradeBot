Because DeFi is more related to lending not trading.",

Share your thoughts and experiences with DeFi trading or any unique insights you've come across in this domain, can anyone recommend an event where one can test their trading skills?Every Forex platform offers a demo trading option and it is a good opportunity to learn the basics.You also have a platform present here on the forum, as far as I know when I registered there once, they also offered a demo account, and they were completely crypto-oriented. Here is their website https://app.simplefx.com/ Or ANN [ANN] SimpleFX.com - forex broker with BTC and LTC crosses and 1:500 leverage Note: I have no affiliation with SimpleFXWhat you should keep in mind is that there is a significant difference in trading on a demo account compared to live. The psyche has a huge influence on trading skills, and you are certainly much more relaxed when it comes to virtual money compared to real money. The demo is only for learning the basics, familiarization with concepts, chart watching, etc...",

You will be trading with a very small risk and have to do this for at least 6 months, and if you indeed pass, then you are good to go. Alternatively, you may want to join trading contests, FX brokers often do this and you will hardly see any top names in the industry that do not.What you will do to be more serious and certain is to find the ones that offer the conditions where traders are restricted to a certain leverage and maximum account opening size. I'm sure these would help you if you want to test your skills against the others.",

Share your thoughts and experiences with DeFi trading or any unique insights you've come across in this domain, can anyone recommend an event where one can test their trading skills?I wouldn't use demo platforms to learn trading because demo and real life are like day and night. When you trade on demo platform with play money, you risk easily and you trade differenty because you know there is not your fate dependent on your trades but when you trade in real life and see that you lose or profit from your budget, then you start to ger nervous or excited and will make mistakes. That's why I think that the best way to learn trading is to trade with money that you can afford to lose but also is not some bucks. For example, $1000 is something I can afford to lose but this is still the amount of money I care. You can choose your number, it's not necessary to risk one thousand but you should remember your lessons carefully and improve your trading skills and emotions.",

It's true that there's a big difference trading on demo account and when trading with real account. The difference is simply the involvement of emotions. Knowing that you are risking real money in one while the other, you have nothing to lose.But that does not totally eliminate the importance of demo trading. Using the demo account remains the best way to learn trading. It will help you master strategies, study the UI of the trading platform and if you are disciplined, it will also help you learn risk managementHowever, when OP used the word \"event\", it seems they mean something more than demo trading account. Maybe something real like a competition.",

Demo might not be your real money in the sense that, you can easily get over it in events of a lose and it could steer you into over estimating your wins which could reflect in you not taking calculated risks when you go live, Demo remains a way to go and practice trading.While placing your trade, you would still have a good percent of the adrenaline rush and this would be you trading the same condition as those trading live.To test just how you good you might have been and you don’t want to be focused on the demo applications, you might just buy the ETF idea where you hope to get something out of your good works and you might be responsible for some of your actions even though, it’s just your reputation.",

There are many emotions that control your decisions in real trading, such as fear and greed, but this does not exist in demo trading.",

Many trading exchanges give you a demo account with a virtual amount that may reach 25 thousand dollars, which you can use as if it were a real balance and use all the features that the platform provides you. Usually this does not even require making a first deposit.For example, the e-Toro platform provides this feature to all new and experienced users. e-Toro is a reliable and licensed platform that can be used after the trial period with real money without any concerns.",
