A 100 years is so far to think people will look back because people are already looking back to 10 years ago and wishing they gave a shot at Bitcoin when it wasn't upto this.Even now more people also want to and still wish to join the moving train of a faster growing and evolutionary digital currency Bitcoin but are been held back because of lack of purchasing power(money).I know of a friend who strongly wish he can sell his land just to buy Bitcoin and I'm certain if he sees a buyer now, 80% of his money is heading straight bto Bitcoin fir long term.",

We are living through one of the most important times in human history. I am very happy that I am a part of those witnessing the growth, development and spread of bitcoins from a community like this in the front row of bitcoin discussions. In the nearest future when bitcoin has become relevant, it will feel good telling the stories about this time where bitcoins is still just gaining importance and acceptance. The people who stay hold on their bitcoins till after this period will be proud and happy that they did. I want to be among the set of people who never stop believing in bitcoins, so I am trying to buy and keep bitcoins as much as I can.",

I really do not get your topic. Your message or post somehow does not align with your topic. If I may ask what were your trying to insinuate?  Going by your topic, one would think otherwise but reading your content, one would see another. I think you should rephrase your topic a bit to suit your content that would be nice. Back to you content, Bitcoin as we all know is a strong store of value and has kept up with that standard for years since it's inception. I believe this is the  innovation/adopter stage so therefore there are still lots to come. For the now, this is just the top merriment one can derive as a result of the innovation called Bitcoin. There are still inovations yet to be developed and technology yet to be built. But one thing I know for sure is that Bitcoin would stand the test of time.",
