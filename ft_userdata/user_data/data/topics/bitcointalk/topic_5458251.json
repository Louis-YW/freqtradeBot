  "content": "Before I started trading Bitcoin there is this good friend of mine that I have always looked up to. He was a full time Bitcoin trader and I admire his courage and dedication in Bitcoin trading. So seeing all this energy in him I promise my self that once i lay my hands on a reasonable amount of money I will run to him to guide me through. But something happened along the line. On the 21st of October 2018 he had a fatal accident with his power bike and he had a serious brain injury that lead to a  brain surgery.So after the surgery he recovered but then his mental state became unstable up till now. And prior to the accident he has over 7 Bitcoin in his wallet and now he can't even remember his name sometimes talk more of remembering his password. So my people is there anything anybody here can suggest that will help the family recover this Bitcoin because right now the family is financially down and  my friend is still on treatment.",

      "body": "Well that is so sad for what happened to your friend. It is good news to know he did survive this terrible accident on the power bike. I do not want to be only one who gives you this bad news. But I think you must know it is not going to be so easy to get the 7 Bitcoins. I think if he did not write down the password, the 7 Bitcoins might be gone for ever. I hope he can remember the password, it is life changing money we are talking about.",

So my people is there anything anybody here can suggest that will help the family recover this Bitcoin because right now the family is financially down and  my friend is still on treatment.In case like this, the right thing to do is to let the human recover fully first, as it takes alot of effort to think or process information with the mind. If the password is well cemented in the human he will remember it once fully recovered. If he has his private keys hidden somewhere, you can just hope that the place it's hidden can easily be remembered by him once he fully recovers. For quick recovery of the mind (especially) , the human  should be fed with good/healthy foods that help lubricate the brain and boost memory. Feed him with good/holy information in orderly manner to help strengthen the mind and aid full recovery.  Once in a while get him to sit where he usually unlocked the password... like where he worked or traded Bitcoin before the accident. Give the human sometimes to be alone in a very quiet place to avoid distractions and to remember. Distractions create disturbances in the mind like how fallen leaves constantly creates ripples in still water below it. Images, information or reflection won't be able to form properly in the mind/water due to disturbances or ripple created by noise or fallen objects.   This is why the issue of noise must be taken seriously in any sane society otherwise fools will be used by an enemy to prevent the society from receiving divine ideas from above and becoming productive.Just let the human recover fully.*Edit:  password recovery option could simply be used to recover lost password assuming the human was trading on exchange/platform that allows such recovery",
