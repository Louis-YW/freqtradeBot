  "content": "Hi, thanks for letting me join your forum. For anyone keeping their eye on tips - there is a setup alert on my website. www.bitwoohoo.com I just added a new feature - arbitrage strategy. It will send an alert when one coin price is different in all exchanges. You can set up the percentage of the difference, and you will get an alert for the highest price exchange and lowest price exchange.",
