Basically, exchange site must have been waiting for the result from the fork and not creating so many announcements about supporting the fork which would not happen as well. Those exchange sites were making so many people become confusing about ethereum hardfork. That was also making so many people didn't understand about the main aim from the hardfork is not to generating the new coin but fixing the inflation in ethereum through using new consensus.",

In addition, gas and transaction fee reductions are other objectives. However, will they solve these issues or not, we can not say now.If they succeed with their works, price will soar considerably but now during uncertain conditions, lot of fud, speculation and different thoughts that all affect the price of Ethereum negatively. The drop of Bitcoin has bad effect too.",

      "body": "Ethereum's proof-of-work mechanism is what makes it a viable cryptocurrency. If I'm not mistaken As a result of the hard fork, ETH coin holders will get both new coins (bundled with ETH). The result of this is that the share of cryptocurrencies in the portfolio of multiple users will increase by one coin. As a result, we can witness an increase in the bulk purchases of ETH coins, and thus their value can grow. However, it is difficult to make predictions in this area, as other cryptocurrencies are still gaining momentum and accumulating more potential.",

Exchanges are just confusing listing different kinds of ETH. There is nothing that is going to change, the supply will remain constant, the circulating supply will remain intact, only the network will be switched and this will be supported by other exchanges. I read that some exchanges may list some forked tokens, so if you have real Ethereum on your wallet, it is better you live them on your wallet because some exchanges will not support fork Ethereum. There is no also ETH2, if there is, it would have been announced that all ETH holders should deposit their tokens into exchanges.",

And we must remember that the merger does not solve the issue of the size of the commission, since it does not expand the network bandwidth.",

I really thought POS would bring shit value to ETH since it would be dumped by thousands of mega ETH miners around the globe to profit themselves from dropping out of mining career. It seems they will have to switch to new coins and try to recover the investment at this point. However, if they don’t sell and if ETH 2.0 overcomes the inflation problem of ETH with consensus approach then it’s best for the ETH in the long term holdings.",

Exchange sites are always seeking the opportunity like this to attract people to trade their fork coin and increase the liquidity. Even some exchange sites have been introducing IOU for fork coin.
