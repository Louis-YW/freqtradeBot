  "content": "It's official, USA is banning the right for women to have an abortion, revoking Roe v. Wade (1973), a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States generally protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion. We're practically running 50 years behind, something that was fought for in the past is now banned, a right that many developing countries are fighting for (In India for instance, it's only allowed for very specific cases and is often overlooked).Honestly, I'd never expect the USA to revoke such a right, we're not in the 19th century anymore, but yet, the U.S. Supreme Court is revoking such rights, with over 13 states quickly adopting the ban.Today it's abortion, tomorrow it could be something else, like LGBT rights or who knows what else.What's your take on this matter?Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/24/global-reaction-roe-abortion-supreme-court/https://news.trust.org/item/20201231112641-qfynt/",

Is the state really responsible for what happens in the vaginas of female citizens?Whatever the legal points might have been for the abortion ban, the basic point, legal or non-legal, is that after conception there is a new person. The first 9 months, usually inside the body of the mother, are simply a stage in the life of a person. Why? Because it is judgmental to suggest when the new life becomes a person. Nobody has proof for when. So abortion (if there is death) could be murder. Let's err on the side of caution, and not potentially kill a person.Why is this important to both, those in favor and those against abortion? Because, since there isn't any proof for when a new life becomes a person, legalized abortion based on it not being a person yet, is really saying that \"government\" has a right to decide who is eligible to be called a person at any stage of life.This means that anybody could be euthanized just because a governing body decides that such and such a person is not really a person, but is simply a lump of excess cellular tissues.Let me recap. The important part that could make abortion an okay thing is the absolute proof that a new life is not a person before such and such a time. Since there isn't any proof, but only judgmental guesses, we just don't know that abortions are not murders, at any stage.And again, why is that important for you? Because someday somebody might legalize the death of excess tissues, based on its IQ of less than 190. That would mean that you and I and most of the people on the planet would be simple cannon fodder, simple excess tissues, to be exterminated without any kind of due process or rights. Do you really want to be in that position? The new life in Mommy's tummy doesn't want death without proof, either. How do we know? Because he or she is growing faster than at any other time of life. They want life, not death.",

There are many scientific and medical consensuses that have been overturned when the truth came to light. A simple one is the belief that there were canals on Mars. Another is the Theory of Relativity, which does not work regarding all microscopic physics, though most people aren't aware of this. A current one is that Covid is a pandemic in virus form, when it's really a media pandemic.Although it is unlikely that we will be executed for having an IQ of under 190, such a thing might become the norm at a distant future. But when you are 80-y-o, do you want to be in fear of being euthanized simply for being 80? Because we don't know if the faulty consensus is the truth or not, why are you so willing to die when you might be in the best of health? I mean, the laws might become such, if abortion is made easier.Further, since we are dealing with the life of a person, it's the promise being held in trust when the parents get together. Of course, science uses their metaphysical soul/spirit/mind to say that there isn't any metaphysical, so it seems right to them. For the parents, why not use contraceptives? And if they are worried about wealth circumstances, things change backward and forward, and they can make it work a different way, without taking the chance of murdering their own offspring.",

I/we are not saying that the scientific community is able to provide facts, since we are still not really able to determine the meaning of death, i.e. when the body turns into a corpse. All that science offers are theoretical interpretations, just as it does with all theoretical sciences. From this point of view, it is inevitable for us to acknowledge the most compatible result and act on it.And if legalizing abortion may lead to complications at the level of legislation, then laws can be specified to describe the specific cases in which abortion can take place without allowing this to happen on the basis of classification.I am now trying to present ideas with you because I find the subject interesting, frankly, and I am not going to defend a private point of view, but I support you in almost everything you went to in your analysis.Thanks again",

Men are abolished and we do not actually hear from them, perhaps because the mother is the one who carries out pregnancy, breastfeeding and most of the basic functions and almost most of the complicated cases in which the woman is the direct victim or the number one concerned.There is a point that I would like to mention, which is that despite the existence of legislation prohibiting abortion in almost most societies, including the most open societies, reports speak of large numbers of abortions that take place outside legal frameworks and may not be in appropriate health conditions at all, in addition to cases that the statistics could not include, which I think are much larger.
