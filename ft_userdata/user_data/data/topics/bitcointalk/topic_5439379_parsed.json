  "content": "Do you have an old Electrum wallet but can't access it anymore because you lost both your password and seed? I may be able to help.As a cybersecurity professional with strong Electrum expertise (*), I am fortunate to have the right skillset as well as sufficient computing power to perform critical data recovery jobs.I've had some success in helping people retrieve coins that were locked in old wallets, which is why I've decided to start an Electrum-specific wallet rescue topic.(*) Some of you may remember me as one of the earliest maintainers of Electrum builds for Windows (mostly in 2012-2013). I've been busy with many other projects after that, but have never lost interest in Bitcoin.PricingFor values above 1 BTC, the fee will be 15% of the recovered funds, only in case of a successful recovery. There is ZERO cost otherwise.By contrast, most recovery services charge 20% and have months-long backlogs. How to proceedBefore I can start working on a case, I will need some initial information that will help with the search. If you have a case you would like me to work on, please respond to this topic or DM me so we can have a detailed chat.ImportantPlease note, the wallet must be your own. I will not work on a wallet with unknown ownership.",

Under Windows, it can be produced by running electrum2john as follows (python must be installed first):python.exe electrum2john.py C:\\path_to_backup_fileOnce you have the hash, feel free to DM or email it to me.",

What kind of hardware?A good common setup would be 2 to 4 RTX A5000s - The more the better, obviously.Just keep in mind that successful recovery is not guaranteed. Â If the password was randomly generated by a decent password manager, chances of recovery are practically zero.",
