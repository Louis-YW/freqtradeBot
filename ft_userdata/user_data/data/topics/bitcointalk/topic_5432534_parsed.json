Already it is shitcoin because it has no potential and the best it could be used for is pump and dump. You definitely don't have to trust someone you don't know but for me I will sell for returns and turn over before it gets to $100,000 that is the best to DCA and acquire more coins.",

Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 31, 2022, 05:21:54 PMAvoid Shitcoins with no potential They call it shit coins, I don't know if their is any shit coins with potential, if any coin is having potential, then it should be called altcoins and not shit coin. Just avoid shit coins completely, because I don't think any shit coin is having any potential. Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 31, 2022, 05:21:54 PMAvoid exchangesI don't think their is any way you can avoid exchange, if you want to buy or sell your bitcoin easily, it can easily be done on exhange, but make sure you use a reputable exchange. The only advice am having for everyone is avoid leaving your coin on exchange, immediately you purchase your coin from exchange, make sure you transfer the coin to a non custodial wallet. Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 31, 2022, 05:21:54 PMTrust no oneWhen you trust anyone on the internet, then you are going to be scammed easily, don't trust anybody no matter what the person is say, trust only yourself. Just assume that anyone you meet on the internet is a scammer, it will really help you.",

As long as the bears are there, altcoins are likely to continue to crash, die, or be replaced by more potential altcoins, so choosing and investing in altcoins remains risky. The year 2022 is over, I have also accumulated some bitcoins, and my expectation is that bitcoins continue to drop more in 2023 so that I can accumulate more. I'm a long-term investor, so I don't expect the market to go up anytime soon, and it would be better if it continued to fall.",

If you just focus on accumulating and holding bitcoins, there is no reason to put your bitcoins on exchanges, right? But if you are a trader using CEX is a must, to avoid risk, leave a small amount on it or always withdraw all funds to a non-custodial wallet at the end of the day.
