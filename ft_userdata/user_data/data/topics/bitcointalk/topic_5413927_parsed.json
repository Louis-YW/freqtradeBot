      "body": "🔉 We are happy to release our NEW Signature Layer 7 Bypass Method. 🌐HTTPS-CUSTOM:The latest and greatest in our arsenal of methods, unlike other methods before it that attempt to \"emulate\" browsers, HTTPS-CUSTOM uses real browsers to attack your targets. This means that it has the highest bypass rate out of any method ever. This method also auto-detects all common protections such as Cloudflare, VShield, Sucuri, and many others along with being able to solve any JS Challenge that exists. HTTPS-CUSTOM will also automatically solve all HCaptcha and ReCaptchas within a few seconds on any bot protection pages. (With support for more Captchas soon).HTTPS-CUSTOM:One of the most advanced methods we have ever offered, and with that comes a lot of advanced arguments to be used, with this announcement we will attach a basic manual on how to use the method. If you require help please read this manual or contact us via Livechat or Telegram for assistance, but the quickest way is to read this manual.However, because this method is insane at bypassing ANY protection and requires huge amount of resources to keep it running, we have limited this method.For example:Customers will need a minimum of 3 concurrent attacks to send.1 Concurrent = 3 slots However, if this method receives positive feedback we can consider decreasing the limitations for our customers 😊Layer 7: Network has been updated, with over 45,000+ unique IP addresses. 🇺🇸🇨🇦🇷🇺🇳🇱🇨🇳🇹🇼🇭🇰🇯🇵🇹🇭🇮🇩🇻🇳🇰🇷🇧🇷- The technology used by STRESSER.ORG is years ahead of any other platform and our infrastructure is much bigger. We have endless capacity. 🔥Website Tool: stresser.org ⭐️Telegram: @stressernet ⭐️Discount Code (20%): BYPASS20 (Expiring 8 days) ⭐️",

Browser Multiplier:Sets the speed that the Browser type will send requests, recommended to not go over 5.Request URL:This changes the Target URL to a GET request, and allows you to send a POST request to a secondary URL (Request URL).Example below:------------------------------------------------Target: https://website.com/login  Request method: POSTRequest URL: https://api.website.com/login Post data: username=%RAND10%&password=%RAND10%------------------------------------------------This will send a GET request to https://website.com/login and then send POST data to https://api.website.com/login with the post data above.Post data:Set the POST data such as %RAND%/%RAND10%Try it now at 20% Discount Code (20% OFF): BYPASS20 💸 (Expiring in 8 days use now!)Website Tool: stresser.org ⭐️Telegram: @stressernet ⭐️",
