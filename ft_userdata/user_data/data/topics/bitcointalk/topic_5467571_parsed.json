If you know that your government are devaluing your local currency, bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies is what you can go for. Some people see it easy to buy stable coins as they buy some bitcoin but the best against inflation is bitcoin.The advice that I have for you is to not leave your coins on those centralized exchanges and to protect your noncustodial wallet not to be hacked. If you want a well protected wallet, wallet on airgapped device would be good or buy a hardware wallet.",

I understand your confusion related to your banking system and it is a good option for you to invest it in cryptocurrencies. I see you are interested in cryptocurrency and there is a valid reason behind it. In your country, the devaluation of your local currency occurs and for that, you want to minimize your loss and you are willing to invest it in cryptocurrencies. But bro it's not that simple, Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and can fluctuate at every movement, and you could lose your money. If you are serious about cryptocurrency then I recommend you start more research on it and learn more about it. Once you know about it completely then you will minimize your loss and maybe you will succeed in it. Knowledge is everywhere about cryptocurrency like a library or YouTube etc. which can easily help you.",

As you already know, adding bitcoin to your portfolio can be a good way to hedge against inflation. My country also suffer from the same problems you speak of, the value of our currency keeps falling down against the US dollar, and this makes the cost of living to go high because we import most of what we consume. Bitcoin is the cheapest way to beat the current system, people living in poor countries understand this the most, that is why Bitcoin is more popular in developing countries than developed nations.",

Your concern about banking system problems and currency devaluation is a problem that cannot be avoided by everyone. And you are absolutely right, if we want to survive in these uncertain economic conditions we must be able to follow and study existing developments to maintain and improve the value of the assets we own and to establish financial freedom for ourselves.If you want to learn and deepen your knowledge about cryptocurrency you are in the right place. In this forum you will get lots of threads or discussions that are very useful and of course will add reading reference material to help you understand cryptocurrency more broadly.Congratulations on starting your journey OP and most importantly make a clear goal for what you are learning about crypto to increase your enthusiasm in continuing to learn and increase your knowledge about cryptocurrency.",
