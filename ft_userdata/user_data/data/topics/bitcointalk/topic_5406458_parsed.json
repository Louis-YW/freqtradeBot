There’s a lot of campaign already that is being escrowed, you can participate on that and do the job. Again, better to have your own analysis as well so you can know if that project is worth your time, some bounties are still paying good money here just have more patience.",

You'll only see a few of them become successful to pay their participants. That's why they're giving a rule that's favorable to them and it's like if they become successful, you'll be paid.But if the project fails and marketing, you don't get paid.Quote from: Sunrise360 on July 15, 2022, 09:48:54 PMConsidering this senerio, how can one know which bounty is a good to participate in?There are too many factors that you can set but even having that, you'll still like floating in the air choosing what's good and bad.",

Bounty enrollment is a game of chance and that means it involves luck. About escrowing of the rewards this does not matter anymore because a coin in your wallet when distributed but it is not in exchange, then it is waste of effort when it is not listed. Also some team luck up the coins for a long time and you can't sell even you having the coin in your wallet. It is luck but better to participate with reputable manager and coins escrowed because you can be lucky as I said. A bounty that will scam partipants will eventually do scam.",

You'll only know if a bounty is good paying once you receive a payment from it and if the payment would be in Bitcoin or other tradable altcoins with good value. We can't say at the beginning of the bounty if it's a successful one because even the developers aren't sure about it but if it's being handled by a trusted manager, there's still an advantage. It's just too important that you'll have a continuous connection with the bounty managers in the platforms that they use.",

Now the matter has become such that the work is more and the reward is less.  Although its work are almost entirely done by copy and paste.  As the quality of work has decreased, so has the quality of payment also decrease.
