  "content": "Reading this article, I couldn't help but wonder about a lot of things that have gone wrong and is going wrong in companies. Some of these companies are know that employees leaving are a problem and are making efforts to fix it while other who know, ,amy have chosen to ignore it. Below are some important points highlighted in the article.According to the report, more than 6.5 million people (20% of the U.K. workforce) are expected to quit their job in the next 12 months, according to estimates from the Charted Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which published the data in June after surveying more than 6,000 workers. That’s up from 2021, when 16% of the U.K. workforce said they plan to quit within a year, according to the CIPD. Meanwhile, in March Microsoft’s global Work Trend Index found that 52% of Gen Zers and Millennials — the two generations that represent the vast majority of the workforce — were likely to consider changing jobs within the following year.Data do not lie. If these companies do not want to keep losing this battle they have to start caring about their employees. They have to treat their employees great. In this day and age companies need to start to try to be human and actually care about what their employees care about or at least putting it on the same pedestal with the degree at which the company cares about making profit. We need new generational leaders who are high on emotional intelligence. What do you think? Are companies losing the battle for long term employee retention?",

I've seen a lot of arrogant employers on social media that say it might not be worth hiring people who change jobs a lot (the example given being 8 in 5 years, which might be excessive or not depending on the industry - someone working for startups might expect to go through 10-80 in that same time, someone working for a fairly good employer and receiving constant and consistent pay rises and promotions will probably only change jobs once in that time: if at all). If you don't expect to pay your employees well and are in a market sector in high demand (more jobs than qualified people), expect them to leave.I've known companies lose good employees because they won't offer decent pay rises, some office and hybrid jobs don't offer higher pay either to cover the travel expenses - so why wouldn't you work from home if you could? (a 40 minute journey is over £150 in fuel a month - assuming 40 mpg).A lot of companies retain employees by adding personal touches and ensuring people are well compensated and know they're needed in companies. I know people who have worked for a company for 10-40 years though and I couldn't imagine doing that, it might also look bad too if you're not switching employers (you only know how to do one job then).",

      "body": "I think the stage is being set for people to become more motivated to learn about economics, business and finance.Failing to comprehend basic fundamentals of business makes workers powerless in this world. To earn their fair share and maintain a stable working environment, workers must understand what is happening in order to make the right choices and support the right things. Unfortunately, in many cases workers do not recognize the trends and precedents in play. Which leads to them supporting the wrong people and things. As recession sets in and standards of living decline. It could provide people with incentive to acquire knowledge. Prior to 2020 there was no need for people to care about business or finance. There was no motivation to learn. Now that people are being directly affected by it, their attitude and mentality could shift. They could suddenly start to care about and appreciate many of the things they took for granted.I think we're already observing this to a degree. People used to be completely apathetic and lackidaisical on the topic of politics. Suddenly everyone cares about politics, as it is directly impacting their lives. The same precedent could apply to business and finance.",

      "body": ". . . And does the employee know what are they actually doing? Most of the time they switch because they want to have higher salaries in very less time and also above their skill sets. Many of them try to do “moonlight” jobs and thus end up disturbed work environment into both companies for which they are working. This reduces the work quality and many times employer end up paying higher money than is needed. We can not blame it to the employer all the time just because they are sitting up there and we think they won’t suffer from recession or losses. They do actually, if work quality goes down with the time it could happen that they will loose their contracts too and it’s the vital source from where our salaries and benefits come to us. That’s cyclic economy, it comes around and goes around. I am not saying it’s totally employers or employees fault, what I am saying is it’s a balanced workout. If it is maintained then there is no need to lay off the employee.",

      "body": "The main reason why employees leave companies can be on lack of incentives or rather lack of growth. Some of these companies are too rigid to the extent that its workers have less time to spend with family or even time for themselves. Some work six days in a week at at least 10hours daily. Another thing that prompts some workers to seek greener pasture else might be because they are not comfortable with shifts allocated to them, lack of growth within the company like raising in ranks easily like government owned work places. It could also be due to fear, some companies scare there workers with sack and they feel threatened so when better jobs opportunities come they turn to jump on it. Some of this companies also don't have retirement plans like pensions and workers tend to look for pensionable jobs since its hard to save for some during their active working days. Irregular transfers of employees by employers can effect the switching of jobs or people seeking to be independent.Concerning millenials they tend to give up on eventually everything, they can't withstand even minimal pressures older generations face. There career impatience or overall impatience leads them to been layoff from works or even leave them selves. Although it's a great thing some things are changing in this century like speaking up when there is pressure but dedication, respect towards work shouldn't change",

I don't think they will ever change and they don't really care if their employees leave because they know that they can still get an immediate replacement.You know our world now, jobs are very limited and then many people are looking for work only to survive so they are not that choosy. Saving up money is hard if you're stuck in a low paying job and setting up your own business is also not easy. There is no guarantee that they will succeed so they better think twice about quitting their jobs.",

But in a private company where there is not port retirement benefits, even 5 years can be considered long term. For a private sector employee, it is advisable to keep on switching jobs every 4-5 years until they turn 45. otherwise the company will take you for granted and you will never be able to experience significant financial growth. Let's be very honest! We all work for money! Awards and accolades might motivate you for some time, but at the end of the day, it's all about money. So if someone is getting a better pay, it makes sense to release that employee unless he/she is holding a key position. Everyone else is very easily replaceable! If a company doesn't want to loose talents, they should beat the inflation effectively and provide a pay revision whenever required. otherwise, it will always remain as a loosing battle only!",

Most firms still treat workers like machines without considering their career and emotional needs. Some companies pay less attention to training and development of their staff because they feel that they might leave the company after the firm have invested much on them. But they fail to understand that workers tend to hate monotonous jobs that lacks the opportunity for workers to face new challenges and become creative. Some workers are also fed up with employers who care less about their informal life. When an employer mandates a worker that has a sick child to still come to work, it shows that their focus is only to get the best out of the staff and nothing more. Most people now are considering self employment  or online jobs that would give them the opportunity to combine both work and family responsibilities.
