They likely are getting targeted and ensure they continue their services and have no problems with their regulations and business. That's fair and could prevent possible slip-ups or something to that extent. Some people are probably not happy about this, but that's why there are DEXs.",

Isnt that shocking anymore yet we are really that heading that way and it isnt really that new that platforms are really that being regulated or really needs to comply on what had been mandated.Of course this would be pertaining about regulatory pressure on which if they would really be still wanting to continue their operation then they would really be having no choice but to complyon whats been asked out or else then we do know on whats next with these platforms and this is why users would really be having no choice but actually we do still have platforms which we could really make use on having no mandatory KYC but of course you would really be expecting that there are lots of restrictions or features arent that available on an unverified account (nothing new).",

True, most of the new exchanges are the ones that do offer non kyc because they're still new players in the market and they don't have much restrictions for all of their users. But once they gain traction and popularity, they'll be noticed and that's the start of the calvary for those users that are anti-kyc because they've signed up for that and not entirely because they're new. Even so, these are the situations that are inevitable for most and I guess those exchanges that are also advocates of being non kyc should learn a lot from kucoin.",

I have been using this exchange for a long time, and even if it used to be associated with the fact that there is no KYC on it, but there is nothing wrong with it. I discovered bybit for myself when I needed to buy a cryptocurrency using the p2p method, and for this I was needed of a verification. I passed it and my experience was positive to buing crypto, so the news of mandatory verification did not scare me.",
