No offense, dude. It's easy for you to believe rumors‚Äîjust rumors that were said on Reddit. When you show like that, people will think you are easy to fool because you immediately believed their stories on Reddit without sources to make their discussions over their platform credible.I hope next time you do your own personal research so that you can make a comparison between the research you did and what others are saying so that you can have fine thoughts on the matter you want to know here.",

If there are time travellers or such, they are millionaires now. It's ridiculous that someone actually believes that kind of story about time travellers or such. Anyway, it can't be helped; some websites could experience a bug or glitch.And also, it can't be helped that some will manipulate an image; it is easy to do that these days. So maybe someone just trolled and edited the image because, based on the lines in the picture, it is impossible to be created with a glitch or bug, so the most likely cause of why it looks like that is that someone edited it. Don't believe in anything you see on the internet; now a days it is easy to manipulate and edit something.",
