Or it doesn't matter?Do I understand things correct that it DOES MATTER?First replace wallet.dat, then sync.And this is the only option.Is it so?",

That's why is important to put the correct wallet.dat in place earliest possible.Of course, Bitcoin Core must not be running at that point, you better restart computer or check the list of processes before copying wallet.dat.Maybe this helps too: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directoryhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/52612/how-do-i-retrieve-my-backed-up-wallet-to-bitcoin-core",
