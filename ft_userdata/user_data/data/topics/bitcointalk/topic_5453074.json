If you are dependent and just a little cogwheel in the system, they can easier monitor and control what you do.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on May 19, 2023, 02:22:15 PMSee how they promote the new serviceQuoteLedger Recover is a potential solution. Securely encrypted secrets stored in the cloud are the future, not pieces of paper or steel plates stored under your mattress or worse in a bank vault It sounds like they aren't sure themselves. \"Potential solution\" makes it sound like maybe it will be ok, maybe it won't. We know already that it lowers the security of your money drastically no matter how they present it. The goal is clear: explain to the customers (existing and new) how dumb they are, and that they can't keep their recovery phrases safe. After that, suggest you'll do it for them.",

I mean a hardware wallet is a pretty basic device that does not really need to be renewed every few month.The thing is that it is very unlikely for hardware wallets to decrease their prices through times, because two main reasons, in my opinion.1. Open source hardware wallet makers do not have a way to monetize their products once they sell a single unit. They sell you the hardware once and then they provide free updates and features as long as they can, for free and free for anyone to verify the code.That means they need to increase the price of their hardware to keep up their operations going.2. As the adoption of Bitcoin grows the demand for safe hardware wallets continues to surge as well. This translates to an increase in the price of those wallets, for simple law of supply and demand.",

While most of the hardware wallet companies are already there, some adjustments could also be made by them taking advantage even if the supply is already there and they're meeting the demand. This is common in most products and companies when they see that they've been on the all time high demand.

They have a few ways to make money. They can sell hardware wallet accessories through their shops. Trezor and Ledger have partnered with several exchanges allowing users to make instant exchanges, sometimes KYC-free. I am not going to discuss the quality of such services or if you should be using them or not. They can add a little premium on top of the spot price to earn from each trade.And as Ledger presented recently, they can think of godawful new features and ask their clients to pay to use them  Fair enough, accessories can help but I personally took a look at the exchange service which was launched by Trezor to buy Bitcoin with the help of third parties and many of the options ask for KYC, even those who do not have a price which I personally (and others around here) did not find to be favorable or competitive enough.So I still believe that the model of business of Open source wallets heavily depends on selling their hardware at relatively expensive prices (in comparison to the cost of materials), so they can continue to keep their updates and features for free as long as possible. I actually made a thread here on Invity and most of us agreed that the prices Satoshilabs/their exchanges offer are bad.",

It's because of those premiums (their profits) they add on top of the regular price. They hope there will be users who don't care, and will gladly take a worse deal compared to having to go elsewhere and sign up. My guess is there always will be such people. Consider instant exchanges as proof of that. Everyone knows they have worse rates than traditional exchanges. Still, there are many around and all of them take a piece of the cake.",
