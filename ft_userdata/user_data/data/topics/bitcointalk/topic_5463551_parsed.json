Miners won’t need the block reward because their revenue will be the transaction fees due to usage by many people around the globe.In the past there were times when transaction fees were higher than the block reward. With ETH it was more apparent since they always had congestion.So no block rewards are not a problem as long as people use the network.",

Now, really?It is always a big question since 2009 but after many years, two past halvings in 2013 and 2017 as well as some past market cycles, we can see that halvings decrease block rewards for Bitcoin miners but in a correlation of Bitcoin price which increases after each halving.Yearly candlesIf you look at Bitcoin Yearly Lowest (Min) price, you will have a better view.Bitcoin lost its $30,000 hours ago but its price today is far better than 2020 min price that is $4107.Quote from: tranthidung on October 12, 2020, 05:27:44 PMYearly low price of bitcoin:Data source: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/Observed period: 29/4/2013 - 06/10/2020.min_l: Min of daily low price for each specific year.percent_change: % of changes in min_l between 2 consecutive yearsDuring the period of almost 8 years, the lowest yearly price of BTC has 7 years with increase (positive in percent_change), only has 1 year with a fall (negative in percent_change, at -40.7 % in 2015).Min and max percent of increase is 6.3% (2019) and 341.5% (2014).Also, see median_l, p25l and p75l (in statistics and in chart) to see the continuous growth (yearly low price) of bitcoinMake double check with another dataset from 2010 to 2020 that I made in WORaw results:Code:     +---------------------------------+     | year     min_l   percent_change |     |---------------------------------|  1. | 2013     65.53                . |  2. | 2014     289.3           341.48 |  3. | 2015    171.51           -40.72 |  4. | 2016    354.91           106.93 |  5. | 2017    755.76           112.94 |     |---------------------------------|  6. | 2018    3191.3           322.26 |  7. | 2019   3391.02             6.26 |  8. | 2020   4106.98            21.11 |     +---------------------------------+",

Then the subsequent block reward halving occurred in 2016, and 2020 been the last time it occurred. The 2013 and 2017 year would have actually be the years that bull run occurred base on past trends that bull run happens a year after the halving period Quote from: Die_empty on August 17, 2023, 06:50:59 AMHigh transaction fees will discourage people from using bitcoin. It will end up becoming a currency for only people that can afford the transaction fees. I was thinking that cheap transaction fees will increase adoption and when many people use the network miners will make more money from the transaction fees. Exactly should the transaction fee become high many people will be discourage to use the network for daily payments which is the sole purpose of bitcoin in the first place. But if read through you will know where NotATether is driving at. The miners spends lots in buying the mining equipment and maintaining it should the reward for block mining stops they would certainly be after just the transaction fee which will definitely not be enough. Except if there is another innovation integrated before then but I fear many of these miners will leave mining and that brings me to the worry that; should there be few miners, wouldn’t that cause centralization by these few?",
