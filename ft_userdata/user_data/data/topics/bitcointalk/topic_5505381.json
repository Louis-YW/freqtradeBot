Your bitcoin is intact, undamaged with time while your real estates will be damaged with time, physical things like air, rain, sun, erosion and more. One more difference is, rate of new built real estates is higher than rate of new bitcoins will be released with future Bitcoin blocks.Quote#3) unfavorable tax treatment since it cannot be depreciated like many types of assets can be when used for business purposesIn many countries, you have clear guides on Income tax and Capital gain tax. The Capital gain tax is the same for stocks and Bitcoin as I know in countries that have rules on it.",

Investing in cryptocurrency isn’t like investing in a company, in order to pay a yield to holders, altcoins need to inflate their supply. Having a fixed supply is one of Bitcoin’s core features. This creates scarcity, which in the long run will make it more valuable.There are still some ways to earn yield on BTC, through lending or staking on a exchange, although there is the downside that it requires trust in centralized third parties.",

If you are looking for dividends stocks, there are plenty and sure they do guarantee stable dividends income like REITs but they aren't as favourable due to their low potential for growth.A fair comparison would be precious metals and Bitcoin. Not stocks, or bonds.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on August 07, 2024, 02:14:35 AM#2) risk of extended drawdowns which could cause loss of principal unlike in a real estate investment where the property only goes up in valueThis is inaccurate. There were instances where property actually lost its value due to certain factors like market downturn, real estate policies, etc. There should not be any assumptions made about any form of investments, stocks, commodity alike.I'll take the point of view that there is no guarantees that Bitcoin will rise infinitely. Definitely not using past performance as a predictor either. You should be able to make sound investment decisions accordingly however. If you're assuming that certain commodities only goes up in value, then you haven't done your research properly.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on August 07, 2024, 02:14:35 AM#3) unfavorable tax treatment since it cannot be depreciated like many types of assets can be when used for business purposesthe fact that it doesn't pay any type of periodic cash flow while it is owned is a serious issue. for these reasons i don't really like bitcoin as an investment.That is not true. In certain places, capital gains doesn't incur tax burdens. In fact, there are ways to mitigate or reduce the tax that you're paying if you hold commodities. This is a point that is nitpicked; it differs for different jurisdiction and it is unfair to compare it that way.",

And if you are a bitcoin holder, this is what we call paper losses only. real estate investors don't necessarily care about what the value of their property is as long as it is \"cash flowing\".another thing i notice is with real estate you can sell your property and buy another one and not have to pay any capital gains taxes if you do what is called a \"1031 exchange\". A 1031 exchange is a tax break. You can sell a property held for business or investment purposes and swap it for a new one that you purchase for the same purpose, allowing you to defer capital gains tax on the sale.https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0110/10-things-to-know-about-1031-exchanges.aspxtry doing that with bitcoin. it will be impossible. so bitcoin is automatically at a disadvantage taxwise as an investment. compared with real estate.with real estate you can use leverage but you can't do that with bitcoin. you have to put 100% down to control it.",

At least in where I live, this is hardly a good way to reduce tax and there are better ways to go about it.By definition, depreciation is the loss of value of your assets.

Have you tried out real estate investments yourself? Larry, could you share how easy and practical is it for you to invest in real estate? Of course, include upfront capital costs, upkeep, bookkeeping expenses, taxes, etc. Websites that have a vested interest in having you invest in real estate doesn't count.From what I'm hearing now is that it all seems to be a rather complicated process for very little gain.

Bitcoin doesn't have \"unfavorable tax treatment\". Not sure where you got that idea. It is taxed the exact same as other assets. You sell it: you pay capital gains taxes.Bitcoin isn't an \"investment\". It's a currency. Currencies don't pay a cash flow because they ARE cash, Bitcoin isn't a business. You don't \"invest\" in Bitcoin, you save in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best long term savings instrument in history.",

It is difficult to explain what an elephant looks like to someone who has been blind since childhood, but currently Bitcoin is increasingly popular with various levels of society because it is considered a very promising investment. The profits generated in Bitcoin have changed people's perspective in choosing investment media, Real Estate and other stock investors have started to shift investment flows to Bitcoin because of the huge returns.Politicians like Trump are also starting to open their eyes to the power of Bitcoin, he is very aware of how valuable Bitcoin is and the growing Bitcoin community, he brought up the theme of Bitcoin in his speech because he started to see the great power of Bitcoin. If you don't like Bitcoin as an investment, that's your right, but without your involvement in Bitcoin investment it will not have any impact on the Bitcoin market.",

I personally have not sold any Bitcoins since last 2 years due to a 30% tax treatment in my country. That needs to be addressed by the industry stakeholders.
