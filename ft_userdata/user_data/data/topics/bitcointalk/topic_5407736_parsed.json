Let me translate: The SandBoxCasino.io is not a sponsor scammer on this forum, so they are not allowed to scam.Let me quote their terms and conditions:Quote3.13 You warrant not to use any form of VPN or other methods or program fit to hide your IP or your state of origin. Users or customers found to use a VPN without the companies consent will be excluded from all services on the website, and all remaining funds will be frozen indefinitely. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for all losses that might occur to you over your VPN usage without the companies consent, including but not limited to financial losses and the loss of your account on the website.OP while you played on their website, you've agreed to their terms and conditions. Haven't you read them?On the other hand, the same case of 120,000 dollars with the scammer FortuneJack here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5368279.0Does not get support because FortuneJack is a scammer sponsoring the forum",

It's hard browsing on mobile and I may have missed it. I only saw \"using old posts on forums\" and not a direct admission.Another thing I would like to know is what happened to the separate investigation of the game provider? It seems they already abandoned that and just focused on the use of VPN and deposits from Coinbase. Maybe they already have the report which says nothing irregular on the part of the player.Quote from: PaperWallet on July 27, 2022, 09:36:03 AM....Quote3.13 You warrant not to use any form of VPN or other methods or program fit to hide your IP or your state of origin.

It doesn't matter. This does not mean that the player did in fact agree to these terms and conditions upon registering on this website, and thus he is solely responsible for his loss, as it says in their terms and conditions.By the way, there was yet another similar case with Stake, they were advertising they don't do KYC, and a player had his winnings frozen because they wanted him to do KYC: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5390206.0 and he couldn't do that because he was playing from a prohibited jurisdiction.This case did not get support from the forum.You just can't fool anybody that all of the following messages supporting the player are not because he was a victim of a scam but because the scammer is not a sponsor on this forum, contrary to other websites that are scams but that are also sponsors.",

It's my pleasure to work with you Guys and I am pretty sure we will work together in future. OWL team decided to pause this campaign for now due to a bad experience with bounty cheaters.
