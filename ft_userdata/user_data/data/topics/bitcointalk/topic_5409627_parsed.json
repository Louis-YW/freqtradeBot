Seeing the article headline, I automatically assumed it was solely a centralized database interaction à la like Coinbase<->Coinbase transactions. Well, surprisingly it actually uses LN.its a hybrid of both. people WITH smartphones that are internet enabled can go to a retail store, buy a certain giftcard and redeem that for LN msats via bitrefills. and then send them msats to the service.where the service then uses its central database to credit peoples SMS number in its mysql database with a allotment of sats(custodian) on its centralised databasethose using 2g only (GSM) can then send a message to the central service to request transfers of central database balance/custodian to other peoples SMS numberthis system is not about setting up a LN channel for every single SMS user. as there is just is not enough liquidity or (i wont mention al other issues) to perform that.the important thing is the OR in their description of the service. it reveals alot that its not 100% LN nor 100% bitcoin networkQuoteEvery registered user can send and receive Bitcoin to their phone number from other Machankura users or to their machankura lightning address.",

This is a custodial Bitcoin lightning wallet. So we hold and transact sats on behalf of users. Depending on how they were sent the sats are allocated back to the user (if they were sent via lightning then no way to allocate them back so best the sats are gifted using the service). It is a third party service. Users that can use non-custodial solutions like bluewallet and phoenix wallet are more welcome to do so (we highly recommend they do so). Bringing Bitcoin to more people should not contain more risk as compared to what? We invite anyone with the capital to push Bitcoin adoption without the risks associated with the African infrastructure to do so and they will have our full public support as they are doing it. On a seperate note, we see this as a stepping stone to Bitcoin adoption (a hot wallet if you wish). But at the end of the GSM medium will be the medium we will be exploring to bring Bitcoin adoption moving forward. We also will have an open source project where we explore using the sim card as a hardware wallet (because of javacard functionalities). And create a GSM interface for the \"electrum\" like features.Screenshot from original messageshopefully this answer give an informations about our concern.",
