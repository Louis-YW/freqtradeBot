On the reference link Royse777 simply asked people who appreciated him to remove him from their trust list. What does that have to do with not trusting Royse777 to make trades?I think it was no only unnecessary, but also incorrect.",

The hedgefx drama backfired and if I am not wrong, he wasn't in the DT network before that drama already. Do you see his feedback by default? If not, just ignore it and move on. Sometimes he asks some valid questions and gets to the point. But that does not mean all of his feedback is legit/valid. When I say you are a scammer but you are proving every day that you are not a scammer, it does not only mean you are right, it made me wrong too.",

A lot of feedback was made on same day, and several bear same format as comment: an older date which assumably the date he made his previous feedback, followed by an explanation.",

Maybe the best way is to ignore this problem and be thick-skinned, as long as Timelord2067 is not part of DT then everything will be fine. But I'm curious how Timelord2067 will explain thisI don't think @royse777 has to worry about his reputation because all the members know how he runs campaigns and manages money. If the trust system is used to avoid fraud, the campaign managers here distribute large amounts of money every week and everything is distributed well.

These \"votes\" are limited. - You must have at least 2 people directly trusting you with an earned merit of at least 250, not including merit you yourself sent. These \"votes\" are limited.[...]As you can see, the only way to be eligible to be a DT [well, DT1] is by having the \"citizen\" voting for them, this is not DT electing each other [congress members get elected by the votes of other congress members]. In fact, there is no criteria in the system that require a DT1 to be elected by other DT1. IIRC, there was a situation where someone without any other DT trusting him and he still got elected as a DT1.If you're talking about \"dis-votes\" instead of \"votes\" though, i.e.: where DT members \"elects\" another DT to be kicked out of the system, was it not the very practice of democracy too? There is no absolute power where someone can not unilaterally kick someone else, there has to be an enough agreement between the DT to kick the said user [who abuses their power, if I may add] from the system.",
