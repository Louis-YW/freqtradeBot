Sometimes it might be normal for your withdrawal to he suspended, is either your bank details which you made available in time of your withdrawal don't associate them self with online trading platform and might makes it difficult for the platform to interact with the bank which might be the reason why they request you create another account with a different bank, or it might also likely be an excuse to withhold your withdrawal for reasons known to them either to scam you or something else.",

Op is talking about Webull trading bots. Here is the URL https://webulltradingbots.com/. It seems this is a Ponzi scheme website that is copied https://www.webull.com/ theme and design. I never heard of those websites. I don't know anything about those websites. It seems https://webulltradingbots.com/ is trying to pretend to be Webull.com. I don't know if any of them are legit. Both might be scams, or maybe they are legit. How do you guys still fall for investment schemes online? Always do your own research before you invest a penny online.

I don't blame victims much this days I just advice them to be more careful in other to avoid their mistakes repeating it's self next time.",

The link you provided is the original link the OP is referring to, because going through the OP post history, he once created a thread Using crypto Trading bot, I think the OP was referred to the trading bot by some YouTube influencers which so many forum users advised him to make some research and gain some knowledge before going into it, but maybe the OP jumped into it without deep research and this scam is about to happen to the OP.the OP’s reply when asked about the linkQuote The Youtuber is:  Eddie MoonI joined his Patreon and Discord.https://webulltradingbots.com/",

However, you insisted on your claims, citing YouTube videos about trading bots and the potential for making significant profits. At one point, you even argued that the site couldn't be a scam because you were able to withdraw $10,000 back to your bank account. And now you're saying that you're facing difficulties in withdrawing your funds? So, I have to ask, what is the issue here? Why can't you realize that you've fallen victim to a classic scam and won't receive any money from them? Why do you continue to create new threads about the same issue when multiple members made it clear to you that it is a scam site? What are you trying to achieve here?",
