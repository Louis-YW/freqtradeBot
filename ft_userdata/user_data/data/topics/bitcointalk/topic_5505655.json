You are doing these kind of shot post either you think they are great or you feel they will get merits for you. I would say, I am not going to fall for your trap next time after rading the title. It doesn't make any sense when you keep on creating such low level topics that does not have any sense to Bitcon or Bitcointalk. In the next topic like you posted today you should see my negative feedback. If you want us to appreciate your work. Start working out on tutorials as we as a community lack them now.",

I don't need your merit my friend. I like reporting crypto news and any news crypto enthusiasts may find interesting. I don't recall Bitcoin promoting censorship and there's no rule that says I must conform to your ideals.",
