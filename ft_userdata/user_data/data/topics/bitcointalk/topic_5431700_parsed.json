And unfortunately helps a lot people who say crypto is for criminals and weapon/drug dealers.And unfortunately the name of exchange sounds very familiar. A methamphetamine and cocaine gang operating across the U.S., Mexico, Europe and Australia used the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange Binance to launder tens of millions in drug proceeds, according to an ongoing investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Between $15 and $40 million in illicit proceeds may have been funneled through Binance, the DEA alleged.More details:https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/12/19/mexican-drug-gang-money-laundering-over-binance-crypto-exchange/?sh=2c9869754a59",

Given the conservative bias in some of the estimates for individual substances, a turnover of around $400 billion per annum is considered realistic.\" https://www.worldometers.info/drugs/",

My concern is, that the ordinary public like us may see delayed withdrawals and suspensions due to all these nonsense matters.

It would appear DEA would need binance more if they wanna solve cases like laundering after all they are the largest crypto that operates as of now.It's not BTC's fault not Binance, the launderers are just a bit getting techy and DEA needs to upgrade its knowledge about crypto.",

Of course this is only one side, on the other side we have tons of youtubers who were convincing people to invest in some sh*tcoins which would bring 'enormous profits'.All that now collapsed and we look at ruins and smoke. I hope soon sun shine again, but today everything confirms coming into crypto world is too dangerous for a typical John Smith.",

KYC is quite useless in tracing people, it'll always lead to the wrong person. I don't understand why it's needed if it can be manipulated. Though the FBI has enough tools to track the people involved, these drug cartels are not dumb people.

I would agree that it is unfortunate, however, it also shows everyone of one of the powerful use cases of the cryptospace. This is only similar to much of the world's greatest inventions.
