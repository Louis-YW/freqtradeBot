      "body": "Although the conflict of interests is obvious, I can't help but give my honest opinion:Hamich124D's comment is on point: translation services should be offered by native speakers; otherwise, you should warn about the need of hiring a proofreader, with the consequent price reduction. Â I'm fluent in Spanish, Basque and English, and have intermediate knowledge on French and German, but I wouldn't dare to translate into languages apart from Spanish and Basque (because I'm a native bilingual of both languages). Not even in English, because I'm well aware that I make mistakes that wouldn't be overlooked by native speakers even though I have provable Proficiency level.That said, such a multilinguality, although possible, is hard to believe; if I were to pay 5 cents per word, I would expect a native translator to do the job. So I get that you're trying to find your way here and I hope you good luck, but focus on what you do best if you want to build a reputation.",
