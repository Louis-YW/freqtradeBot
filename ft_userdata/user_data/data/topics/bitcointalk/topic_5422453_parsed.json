Anyone can say the same thing but only few could really put weigh on such statement. As he have mentioned, Bitcoin will but don't expect for an instant increase. On its application, those who could wait should hold because there might be months more before we see a clear sign of recovery. But at the end of the day, elon musk does not carry the fate of this industry, things might change so you choose what to do.",

Since you didn't even mention the link to the tweet and so many people will consider what you have been saying above was liar. I think that you shall also aware about this too. People didn't even know about what would be the exact time for the bullish trend to come. There's no ETA for when winter will be ended too. You shall not rely with anything that being said by influencer. that they have said about that was not actually true. they have their own agenda in what they have been saying,",

It would decrease first and then rebound when it reaches the support level of around the $14k range. I think it's best to be positive, but it doesn't seem so. It's hard to predict what will happen with the market, but make sure you can do what you can afford to lose.",

Maybe Elon Musk may have deleted his tweet, he can tweet from time to time and then delete it.I think there is still time for the market to recover. The collapse of the FTX market, the crisis created by Luna, these created many problems in the markets in terms of liquidity. The bear market is good because it takes a long time because this cycle is needed to clean up dysfunctional projects. Although Elon Musk didn't just say it as a manipulator, it doesn't change that he is a Manipulator.",

You should expect bitcoin's price to rise because there is going to be a halving in 2024, which historically has always pumped bitcoin to expressive new price ranges when it happened in previous years. Halving is an important mark in bitcoin's history, as the rewards per mined block are decreased by half, so bitcoin becomes even more scarce and valuable for the market, consequently increasing its price. Celebrities like Musk know about this fact, but they don't exactly explain bitcoin is going to gain more traction because of it, as they don't want common people to think by themselves. They want to remain as middlemen between the audience and knowledge.",
