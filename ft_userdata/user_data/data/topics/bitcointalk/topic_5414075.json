Yes Satoshi Nakamoto could be a group of programmers because of his thread he made mentioned of \"we\" and that is a plural subject pronoun. That not withstanding, people are free to make research on Satoshi Nakamoto even though they couldn't get the real identity of him, trial and error approach should be conducted on him. Till date people are making research on Adam and Eve and what kind of Apple did Eve ate. Therefore, research is endless. As for me I believed Satoshi Nakamoto is from America not British. One thing I discovered in the wisdom of the brilliant people is that if they want to do important thing they did in another land where the IP address of the location will be shown.",

Also there are PERSONAL reasons too-- like it or not-- which is the same reason why he's in hiding till date. Now if these personal reasons were known,his identity could escalate like wild fire and that would go against the will of his criterion.I don't even think THEYMOS knows him in person but ,that's another story. üôÇCheers,Sandraüë©‚Äçü¶±",

Unfortunately, the data you've provided doesn't really prove whether he is a British Citizen even if what you've provided is indeed correct. It can only mean that he or his team was in London at the time and would not mean that he's a British citizen.
