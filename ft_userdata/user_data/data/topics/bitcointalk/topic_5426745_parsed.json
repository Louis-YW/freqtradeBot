I mean I'm using a nano ledger device, there shouldnt be any risk in doing this, or? I do realize that it takes some time to unbound staked coins but I'm planing to hodl for at least a year or so, so there shouldnt be any risks, right?",

It is profitable in a manner that the more capital or money you stake, the more satisfying profit you'll get from those percentages you see. That's why you can already foresee how much you will likely earn from staking because of the APYs that are given for each of those coins. But, you have to remember that the market is volatile and if you're computing based on their $$$ value, it will eventually change.Quote from: Rufus29 on December 08, 2022, 01:17:44 PMI guess because you cant sell whenever you want?

Is there a way to generate a passive income for these if I keep them on my ledger?And why do you need it? Trading on the ledger is done through partners, and I wrote about cases where they got in big trouble because their assets were blocked. Also, learn about staking first. It is better to work directly with each project, and then you will have full control over your coins. I had to transfer the polcadot to another wallet because some of the functions in the ledger did not work when participating in auctions for parachains.",

I do realize that it takes some time to unbound staked coins but I'm planing to hodl for at least a year or so, so there shouldnt be any risks, right?The risk is there's no guarantee you will get profit via staking and if there's a problem or hacked about the network of those coins you staked, ledger live doesn't care with that. Although you're still own your private key, but the risk is from the project, not from the ledger side. So make sure you're understand there's possibility you will lose your tokens when the hacker can find the vulnerability from the network.Quote from: https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live-terms-of-use5.3.5 No guarantee of Rewards.
