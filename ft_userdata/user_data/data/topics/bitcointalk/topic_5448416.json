For real?Anyhow, since we're here, why don't you contact Craig Wright also, he claimed he owned that address, and since the first transfer to it was the funding one he was also the hacker, of course then he miraculously lost somehow everything related to that address but I'm pretty sure his lawyers will give you any information you want.  Quote from: shlomogold on April 11, 2023, 03:38:55 PMIs there an organized group of claimants for the stolen 1Feex bitcoins?And from who do you want to claim damages? MtGox? You might be a little late for that!",

Besides, you sound like you have some info or dirt on him, why don't you go through it legally, if you know who has the funds or who stole it why don't you go to the police or contact the trustee of the MtGox case? You make it sound like you're one step away from blackmailing him! Is that what you want?Quote from: shlomogold on April 11, 2023, 04:18:00 PMfrom whoMfrom the hackerThat hacker, and who might that be?Anyhow, since I was promised interesting things, better try this topic:MtGox withdrawal delays [Gathering]There are plenty of guys there that were involved in the Civil Rehabilitation Plan as victims, one might help you organize a community or whatever you plan on doing.",

They can try to get a judgment from a court-ordered arbitrator, or through arbitration by independent third-parties like JAMS or another arbitration forum called OSC Apex International Business Arbitration Center (IABAC).There has been no word from 1Feex yet about what happened and whether or not they managed to recover any of the funds.",
