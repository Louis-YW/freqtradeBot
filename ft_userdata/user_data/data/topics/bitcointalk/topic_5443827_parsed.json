So with all due respect, what has the presido done regarding all the people you claimed to have evade tax payers money? Or are you trying to say he or his cabinets don't know the people perpetrating such act? Because to be frankly speaking lets for ones try to say something how it is if really we want the betterment of our country my guy. Because no doubt, no country is perfect, and every country has their flaws, Â of which if 9ja must be good someday, the presido is the only person that can make that a reality by showing an exemplary life of not been corrupt. Because if he is not corrupt and all his law enforcement agencies are not corrupt and they are all well taken care of with sophisticated weapons, who born you to wan dey corrupt?And on that note, I still stand on my previous statement that this administration has done more harm than good for the people of 9ja. Because you as yourself abeg just mention one thing this administration has ever done that is good?.. As here are mine, 1. They promised a digital cashless policy for all 9ja, only for us to find out they never upgraded all bank servers to accommodate the massive online transactions that will be made, resulting to series of transaction wahala, failed & delay in transaction, network error and etc.2. And it was in this administration that students had to stay home good 7months ASUU strike because of less concern for education3. They promised a free and fair election, only for it to turn out to be the most rigged in the history of 9ja4. It was in this admin that dollar rose from #400/$1 to #730 same per $1 (which is that a good development? Abeg answer my dear)",

Who are the \"they\" that told you that?Let me tell you about habitat and the organisms living in it. For example, take the snail. During the rainy season, snails crawl around freely to feed on food, but when the dry season comes, they often burrow a small hole in the soil to hide and cover their shell with their slime. Humans are also designed to always learn how to readjust to arising challenges.All I see in this thread are complaints. I didn't see any suggestions to help the situation you talk about here. Nigeria may not be too developed like some first-world countries, but it is a sweet place. There are some freedoms you can enjoy in Nigeria that you will also complain so bitterly about in some countries, like taxation and electricity bills, water bills, gas bills, etc.In Nigeria, you really may not pay tax on some items you buy, but in some first-world countries, when you realize you are paying tax for every single penny you spend, you will appreciate your country. In terms of the vote, as a good citizen, you have done your part by casting your vote. The high table has pronounced who they think is the winner, and even the pronounced winner is yet to assume office, so why are you complaining already?",
