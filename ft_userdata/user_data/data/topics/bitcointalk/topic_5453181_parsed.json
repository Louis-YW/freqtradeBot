  "content": "Good day to all, I want to tell and maybe learn from you about the Nortonium project, to be honest, I donâ€™t follow P2E and meta movements in the crypt very often, but I often heard that good cream is taken from new projects. I spent a little time on their twitter and discord, the site is now closed for public viewing but they promised to open it by the 20th. Most likely, the project is far from being Tier 1, this can be seen, but does it have a chance to give at least some X's at the output? I just remember one game of Minesofdalarnia, they are somewhat similar, and for mint NFT dalarnia they paid $250 in the ETH network, and NFT cost $4000 at the exit of the project, maybe this project will do the same?Thanks for the replies and for your time",
