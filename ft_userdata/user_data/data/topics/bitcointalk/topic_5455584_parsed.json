      "body": "The volatility with price now can be traced with what is coming out from binance legal challenge and allegations with sec and restrictions from some countries. If that is what you call fundamental news maybe and that is going to create more panic until it settles down. However, it shouldn't affect the price of bitcoin for a longtime because bitcoin has a way of moving on after the news. News is a time to make quick profit and quick loss.",

After the market stayed at $25000 for a while the market came back around $27000 but once again the market is now around $26000. I am not able to understand how such volatility of the market is indicating the direction of the market.  Many think that the market is likely to go down from the current situation, but I have been observing such volatility in the market for quite some time. No matter how much the market goes up or down, after a while it will be seen that the market has returned to that state again.",

As long those news and fundamentals is really that connected to Crypto specially with Binance, then expect that there would really be some significant impact into its price but not all the time.We do know thatwhen it comes to traditional economic events or situations on which crypto space is really that independent but as the years passing by on which i had also observed that market is really that slowly becoming that too reactive when it comes to economical events which is something that we should really be needing to looking into. This is why its really that important that you should really know on making up switches in between TA+FA in regarding with your analysis because we've seen that there are really that moments where it do make out some reactions on sometime but there are also momentson which it doesnt really care at all.",

It is true that touching this level makes it weaker. However trading volumes are still high to give us an assurance that we will remain above $24.6k for the time being.Expectations indicate that we will not witness new peaks, as the price of 27.6k proved difficult to break, but we touched the bottom, which means that it will be tested several times, mostly 3 before we see the price either settling above 27 thousand dollars, or returning to levels closer to or below $24.6k",

I believe in Bitcoin fundamentals (technology, decentralization, Bitcoin cycles, controlled inflation) and I skip temporary news. I would be a liar if I tell you that I did not read news and was not affected by news in the past. I did read a lot of news and was panic a lot with fud. After some years, I knew that Bitcoin is able to grow because of its fundamentals which if I focus on, will help me to read less news and less affected by fud.Fake outs, wash outs, break outs are parts of market cycle and I believe that Bitcoin has nearly completed this bear market. A few more months, up to 1 year, bear market will end and a new big bull run will come.",

From its current state I don't see any such pressure on it, and even with such bad news about Binance and Coinbase and the actions that Sec took against those two whale exchanges, the price still wasn't affected that badly and the selling pressure wasn't the way people predicted. I think this time the price can only dump any further if Binance shuts its operations in US, and even that would be temporary not a permanent one.",

      "body": "And we do know that, the market is correlated with fundamental news, as before performing technical analysis, fundamental analysis is better to keep in mind to get the overall idea of the current situation we are facing and in future, we are going to face. Such as, what will happen if those exchanges halt their functionalities such as 100 pairs of BUSD and BNB etc. what if they stop trading in them permanently? well that will happen and people will not be able to convert their BUSD and BNB on those exchanges (mainly on Binance) but people will find another way. I only wonder here is, Binance is mainly for BSC network solutions like i know it also supports to many other networks too, but i saw the news that says, ETH networks tokens were the most included in an outflow from Binance. Well, this is just the one factor we should keep in mind in the upcoming weeks. As upcoming news will definitely affect the market but only that much as Coinbase affected it (haha).Another one is, today, an old account activated and made a huge transaction of  1432.92 BTC today which might affect the price more once combined with the impact of another centralized exchange's seizure when sued by SEC or CFTC.",

Bitcoin is volatile and the price is expected to pump and dump but no one knows to what extent the price will dump or pump to with the present issues surrounding crypto in the US.You are lucky that you didn't run out of loss because you chose to go into trading. Why don't you think of holding your bitcoin for a long term run,with this strategy,you will be assure of making profit whenever bitcoin have reached your target price of selling. Instead of gambling with your coins,since you don't have any trading strategy. It will save you from getting scared and looking at the price always.",
