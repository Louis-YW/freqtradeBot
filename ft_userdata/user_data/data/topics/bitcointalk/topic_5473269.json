I have been hearing bitcoin bear market and the bull market but I have not really heard of a bear and bull market for Altcoins. So I will like to know the bear and the bull market of the altcoins or are they following the market price of bitcoin? Bitcoin is a project on it own and has it own blockchain and network and likewise with Altcoins.Some of the Altcoins are good to invest but most of us are not aware of that if they are good because there is no bull time for them. And the way I see at them they are just going along with bitcoin. So some of the Altcoins are waiting for the next bitcoin bull market. So my humble question is there no bull market for Altcoins? If yes, there is, then when is the expectation and if no why?",

If yes, there is, then when is the expectation and if no why?Really an interesting topic to ponder upon. My thoughts about the bullrun for altcoins is basically focused on the dominance scale of Bitcoin and Altcoins. Although coinmarketcap gives Bitcoin dominance metrics and Ethereum dominance matrics alone, Ethereum is also an altcoin, so lets say its Bitcoin against altcoins, whenever Bitcoin dominance goes below 50% then I consider it a bulrun for the altcoins as the total coins apart from Bitcoin gives that metrics. Also understand that coinmarketcap doesn't account for the entire coins and tokens in the Blockchain space.",

Bull season could happen at any time; all we have to do is buckle in and prepare to reap the system's enormous advantages. Bear and bull markets are incredibly risky to invest in since they both work in conjunction and nothing will change; all we need to do is become buddies. Bagging altcoins accentuates the presence of whales in the market. If all goes according to plan, cryptocurrency may be worth 100 times our initial investment. Because the bull market has yet to be triggered, we have more time to alter and balance things in the actual sport world.",

And this got something to do with sentiment...when there is an extreme positivity rubbing on the King of Cryptos then there is a big chance that alts would also be getting some of the benefits. I am not sure though if there is a proven correlation with this assumption. So by 2024 we can expect that there would be a double bull run...one happening for Bitcoin and another one happening for many alts especially the leading and more popular ones.",

If yes, there is, then when is the expectation and if no why?Interesting question! Bitcoin and altcoins are like tide and boats. Bitcoin raises all boats, but sometimes they sail alone. Each altcoin has its own fundamentals and market dynamics. They may seem to follow Bitcoin, but many have their own \"seasons\"Â of bull markets driven by project milestones or external investment. Altcoin bull markets can be sparked by technology advances, increased popularity, or regulatory developments that favour altcoins over Bitcoin. They are evolving while waiting for Bitcoin to take off. The cryptocurrency market is broad and active, with many projects emerging slowly until they gain popularity. When and how cryptocurrency bull markets occur is more important than whether they occur. Expecting an altcoin bull market depends on market, project development, and investor behaviour. This needs careful research, market cycles, and sometimes timing luck.",

Of course there will still be a lot of buzz around and gaining people's attention, but what we expect more is a clearer signal of bitcoin, before and now the index BTC. D is a way to identify the flow of money from bitcoin to altcoin and vice versa.Most new and old people believe that investing in bitcoin is unlikely to be as profitable as holding altcoins, but that is the story of positions in investment finance, if you take risks easily, you will also easily lose. That's why most of the optimal strategies proposed by experienced people always keep the majority with bitcoin. When the market enters a bullish cycle, the trend of investing heavily in altcoins becomes popular.",

From your analysis it is understandable that bitcoin is the pacesetter while other cryptocurencies follows, so in this case altcoins follows bitcoin trends. So i think that bitcoin bull run will trigger the interests for altcoins, where investors Â will also want to cash in on other forms of crypto coins. So this can be s sort of bull run also for altcoins, I'm guessing that when it's bearish run for bitcoin, then it'll also affect altcoins negatively. It's just speculations for me, because like the OP I've not Â come across where we're expecting bull or bear run for for altcoins, unlike bitcoin that has its pattern. I believe that there are altcoins out there that can have their own bull and bear seasons, but since my interests are not in altcoin, I wouldn't know much about them. I really think that if there is a sort of regulation for altcoin development, and we don't have plenty of them, then we can understand and predict their seasons better. But crypto is decentralized, so it's easier to mix valuable coins with worthless coins together as altcoins, making it quite difficult for investors to have trust and know their trends.",

The historical trends of cryptocurrencies show that bull run usually follows the substantial surge in Bitcoin price.

But they didn't realize that bull run also happen to some other alts but we cannot trust them its because some of those tokens are just been manipulated by its owners so that they can play with the emotion of people holding it then deceive them with unexpected actions that's why its hard to spot those altcoin bull run.

However, that was not the case anymore because the cryptocurrency market is so unpredictable these days and is highly volatile.Last 2018, we thought that it would finally recover but it got even worse. From almost $20k, it fell down briefly below $2k before settling around $3kish and the market did not really recover much until the late-2020s when BTC broke above $20k for the first time and even got up to $30k. At the end of the day, it is all about anticipating the unexpected and we should be more prepared to any situation and acknowledging the results no matter what.",

So maybe we can safely say that bitcoin bull leads altcoins to their new prices and some die off after the price of bitcoin goes into correction mode. So the price of altcoins rally from the bull of bitcoin.",
