  "content": "Hi everyone,Just created this account to report Rollbit for banning my account and stealing my earnings because I WON TOO MUCH. They are accusing me of « market manipulation » on multi billion dollars assets LOL.I wouldn’t recommend anyone to use this website, as if you win you get banned and your earnings stolen without any resort.They won’t let me withdraw the rest of my earnings and even reset my game balance to 0 (had $2150+ excluding the withdrawals pending that they just refuse to process).I was even asked to complete KYC and after completing it they just sent me the following :https://ibb.co/8brvCPvhttps://ibb.co/QHdZcTMhttps://ibb.co/QM1V8Cyhttps://ibb.co/NjMskDtTried to get my earnings unsuccessfully, so I came here to post and get visibility, maybe people will avoid using this scam that takes your money if you win too muchAs can be seen on screenshots above « traders said i manipulated the market ». come on it’s a multi billion dollar crypto, you are just digusted from people winning.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3067300Amount Scammed: around $18150Payment Method: Earnings that can’t be withdrawanProof of Payment: https://ibb.co/NjMskDt",

      "body": "The Rollbit accusation is kinda vague, I also wonder how could a small player manipulate a billion dollar market.  I check the screenshot and the withdrawal doesn't even qualify to a 0.01% of the market.  I wonder why does Rollbit consider the winnings a manipulation?  It would be nice if Rollbit enlighten us about what they consider market manipulation so that many of us who are playing on Rollbit will be aware of it and if someone is doing it unintentionally can avoid doing such to suffer the same fate as the @OP's account.@OP if you feel wronged you can create a scam accusation on this board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0.  Just follow the format and provide proof that you are wronged.",

They have no proof other than me winning too much basically, which pissed them off. Even made me complete KYC just to tell me I have no rights on the earnings ? Pure BS imoI have posted as you told me, thank you.",

Let's hope they'll respond to your accusation soon.They might be unaware of this thread. I glanced upon this thread yesterday and intended to PM them and made them aware of this accusation, but their last activity --as per yesterday-- was back in November or so, and looking through their website, I can't find their TG. Discord seems too... bothersome for me.Anyway, I checked again and they were online earlier today, I send them a PM.",

The support agent didn't accuse OP of market manipulation, which would be a ridiculous accusation indeed since we are talking about a billion dollars assets. However, they accused him of \"exploiting a vulnerability in the way our trading product operayed\" (quoted from the screenshot posted above).",

It's a good thing that they are reviewing the case once again. I am guessing they are planning to ask you some questions and see your reactions live to determine whether or not you are lying or answering truthfully. I can't think why they would need to see you on video to determine whether or not you abused a vulnerability except for what I just said.If there was in fact a vulnerability and you knew about it and misused it, they have the right to confiscate your winnings. I am not sure they can take your deposits though. However, if you made $21k in an illegal way, I believe they have the right to confiscate part of those losses.
