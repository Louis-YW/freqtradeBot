As the price is down, we see less speculative movements with ordinals  runes etc...Also less people sending btc to exchanges.Fees will probably get higher again when we get closer to ath.Then people will start selling Jpegs for millions again, flooding the network with apes dicks etc..",

Taproot and segwit offer a comparative advantage to those that are interested to fill the Blockchain with data if you count the fees they pay on a per byte basis. So now that there's very little profit incentive in shit coins the fees also went down because due to the scarce space on blocks even with the comparative advantage these shit coins were super expensive to mint in terms of dollar value lost.",

In the past 24 hours, there were only 5 blocks with minimum fee rate of 10 sat/vbyte or more. At the time I am writing this post, you can put your transaction at less than 0.5 vMB from the tip of mempools with paying 6 sat/vbyte as transaction fee.",

Right now there is still a significant amount of this inscriptions still taking place but there volume as reduce drastically, look at the number of ordiscan explorer you you will see that the number of inscriptions in each block is not getting to a hundred again not like the past. It seems the people lured into this might have found the rock bottom, also the bearish period could be reason why this shit coin movement is not like before.",

Thankfully, the craze always ends, and it doesn't normally take a long time for it to end. Then we can enjoy wonderfully low fees, as we do right now. It's $0.5 for a high-priority transaction, which is acceptable even for fairly small transactions and very nice for large transactions. I am annoyed by things like Ordinals, but I'm also happy to see that there is no long-term trend of growing BTC transaction fees; it's always something temporary, and Bitcoin goes back to normal.",

Maybe the people buying and holding those NFT have come to realise that it's of no good value, or probably they are tired of spamming the Bitcoin network, or they can't keep up with the high fee again.The hype around BRC and RUNE has died down because they have made enough profit or as you said everything has a season, but I don't think they are tired of spamming the bitcoin network or just because they can't keep up with the fees high.The market is going through gloomy days and the general situation of all altcoin investors is mostly heavy losses. So people are no longer excited but once the market recovers, I believe new games will continue to be created. More projects similar to BRC and RUNE will be created soon and high fees will return, I think as long as developers still don't have a solution it will be difficult for fees to return to normal.",

It is more easily to convince people believe in Ordinals or Runes projects in bull market. It's more easily to steal money from investors and developers can use it to accumulate bitcoins for themselves.Latest months with Bitcoin correction from above $70k to below $60k or nearly $50k, are not good for BRC20 tokens.",

While more transactios we have on the mempool people pay more fees, and that way is the same uses that sends the fees price to the moon. Nos the demand is low, and fees are low too.",

So, 80% of the time I'm in accumulation and hodl mode, while about 20% of the time I spend.

A spike means the fees are high. If fees/transactions are as low as they are now, it can be concluded that network traffic is the opposite of dense and that is a normal condition on the Bitcoin network which makes using the Bitcoin network known to be great compared to using other networks.In this case, what I have conveyed is a condition that I know about.",

You'd see the network to be clogged again when more demand of runes and ordinals comes in, they were the reasons why we've got that much fees several months ago.
