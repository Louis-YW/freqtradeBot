This time it's more for the bears and not a time that favors buying.People are depressed after they lose, they have loses because they are not patient the market is full of the bears and dump. They can wait to the level that they will know that the price will not go further below or of gone further below, but buying at the level the bull market will be so significant for profit and later overide their losses.Some people just deal with shitcoins, which is another reason.I will advice you to invest in bitcoin or a good marketcap coins rather than shitcoins.",

Depression is a strong term to use. Feeling bad about losses is a less severe term. If you are really feeling depressed over losses then you need to stop trading, it will not do you any good. Probably you are doing a lot of wrong things making trading a mess but this only you can know.Although losses are common in trading, there are ways to deal with them. Risk management is important here, not investing more than what you can lose is the first step. Investing in bitcoin more than shitcoins is the second.A bear market takes its toll on the traders. If the bearish trend is the reason for this, you should take a break from the market.",

      "body": "In a volatile market like this one everything can happen at any time. Today you might see your investments rising 30%, but on the next day you might see everything falling apart and your investments losing 50% of their initial value.We, as human beings have a hard time adapting ourselves to uncertainties, so when we are in a situation where dealing with volatility and unpredictable fluctuations is inevitable, we tend to feel sad and depressed the more we absorb the dynamics of this environment. Somehow we are constantly trying to predict and decide what is going to happen in our future, what is going to happen next in our life. That is why we make plans, have goals and feel so accomplished when everything works in the way we planned. But when we fail with our personal goals, plans and aspirations, that depressive feeling hits us really hard.For this reason, you should always keep your mind on the reality. Don't have absurd goals and expectations about cryptocurrency, so you avoid disappointing yourself if something goes wrong. Besides that, put God above everything else in your life and keep in mind you aren't going to be helpless in any moments, since you have Him by your side. The fulfillment and peace you will feel by doing this is enough to not let any depression take control of you.",

Depression is more common to those who only invest to lose than to make profits. That happens when they always invest for quick profits, so mostly they end up investing in the wrong coins and lose their capital. Depression surely follows.

Nothing will run very well always, sometimes, there is something that doesn't match with our expectations.  Cryptocurrency investment brings so much risks and pressures knowing its highly volatile so if you cannot manage them well, depression may eventually occur. However, if you are ready for all the unexpected things to happen because this crypto market is certainly unpredictable, getting depressed is far to be possible. And always invest what you can afford to lose, that way you will never be hurt so badly even if you end up losing from them.",

You're losing something you're expecting to win, and with the involvement of money, you're expectations are naturally boosted, so the loss is naturally bigger than normal. It's not only in cryptocurrency really, anything that you do that you create expectations for would naturally bring depression to you when you fail to achieve that certain result that you want or expected. It's probably just quicker here in investing or in the crypto market specifically due to how volatile the market is, aka the scenarios where you expect to profit happen way more (and so as the situations where you lose money).",

If you are making profit from anything, you can not be depressed. In crypto, those that can be depressed are those that hold and see their coin decreasing in value, this can cause some people to panic and sell their coins. Some coins are shitcoins, their value decrease and decrease more and more. If you buy and you make profit, that should not lead to depression.",
