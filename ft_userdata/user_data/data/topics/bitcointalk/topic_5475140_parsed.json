Hope you get your first client real soon.Already managed few small amount and one for a campaign. I have shown that campaign as reference. But other small transactions not mentioned on the forum so I have not mentooned here. People not trusting me only after getting loan or i only trust them but a lot og people who traded with me trusts me and sends funds to me first. Also when people sends collateral they send first to me.",

Please be careful There has to be a beginning sometime. Learning from his mistakes may be expensive, but it is one of the best ways to gain experience. Given that he already deals with financial services, I believe he has a good basis for an escrow offer.Although I personally would never decide on such a business, there are too many parameters that are difficult to recognize in advance and can turn for the worse. Anyway, good luck with this shasan, I hope you'll be successful.",

I don't know him well, and have no opinion about his trustworthiness, but now that you have, how much would you vouch for OP to be able to safely escrow? Like $1m max? That would be a mistake, besides you can't really come up with that amount to say Ok lets try it as the first client!Op is a total newbie in this business, @OP, the best thing would be to spend $200 or whatever the rate is, to design a professional looking thread, with some order, nice graphical images, etc.Â  Include all the standard rules of escrow services market as well.ðŸ˜‰",

      "body": "Nice to see you in this field after the lending service. I also feel good to see provably I was probably the first person who used you as an escrow , It was a smooth deal.As the previous replies are saying be careful in this field. In lending, if you make some mistake then you will lose the fund that will be lent, but in this Escrow field if you make any mistake you will lose your Reputation which is 100x bigger than any amount of money.One more thing I want to suggest. If you do any escrow for a bounty campaign must make the deal crystal clear. Basically, the things that will do the distribution after ending the bounty. Bounty distribution may cost a huge amount of fees based on the network. So if the deal is you have to make the distribution must ask for the fees upfront (with the escrow fund). otherwise, it can create a big problem if the project team leaves after ending the campaign Btw best of luck!",

And be very careful about your escrow service.But the combination of the two services might be good for him since he has been in the lending service for some years now and with that he has the experience to deal and overcome the scammers and their technical know how. And whereby he hasn't get experience in the escrow service before this time, I will also advise him to focus on the leading service which he has more experience with, because scammers are subtle and we have heard and seen campaign managers escrow accounts were hacked all the funds were stolen. I believed even this year we have heard such bad news in the forum.But if shasan can also face the risk and determine to do the service then it is good because practice make perfect. Therefore we should not discourage him but to encourage him. We wish you all the best @shasan.",
