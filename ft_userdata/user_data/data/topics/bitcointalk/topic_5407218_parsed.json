  "content": "So Top Rank's Bob Arum failed to persuade George Kambosos to face another opponent before demanding a rematch with undisputed champion Devin Haney. George Kambosos officially exercised his rematch clause against undisputed champ Devin Haney. The planned date is on October 15 at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. It is the same venue as the very popular Australian Open (tennis).I think the first fight was very boring and Haney clearly outscored Kambosos. I think it will happen again. But maybe the difference is that Kambosos will let his hands go right after the opening bell. Despite the boring first fight, we better expect another sold-out crowd as this is once in a lifetime experience in Australia. People will still go for sure. It is probably the PPV buys that will take a hit. Unless they both can promote this fight well. Haney is a boring trash-talker though but a mad Kambosos isn't.",

But Haney's technical ability will be in full display again and I doubt that Kambosos can offset it with his brawling style.",

Maybe he thinks he learn from his mistakes and that he can't get the opportunity. But as we have speculated in the first fight. Kambosos will execute the rematch clause and this is what he did here. Haney again will be the favorite in this fight by a huge lead just like in the first fight. I'm not that excited though, as this might be the repeat of the first fight and the same result.",

However, if Kambosos is fitted against a brawler like Lopez or Linares he will look good and his chance of winning is high so i wonder why he did not heed to Top Rank's call to fight another boxer and not this rematch.",

      "body": "Oh so they did activated the rematch clause of the match? very interesting move by Kambosos and his team. We can all speculate as to what are the reasons, but with the way he perform in the first fight, he was truly outclass and the skills of Haney is very different to all the fighters he has face like Lopez. And like what most of you have said, the outcome will be the same, Haney by unanimous division and Kambosos will be another \"one hit wonder\", his best win in his career is against Lopez.",

But you have a point, maybe Kambosos will adjust and make things correct in this rematch.As far as the odds, crypto bookies got it right on the first time, putting Haney as favorite if I'm not mistaken. Both physical form could be equal, they train very hard, it's a matter of how they are going to executed everything in the ring and who has the IQ to adapt.",

On the first fight, it clearly shows how clueless Kambosos is on what Haney is trying to do, but if you are a trained professional fighter, you will study those moves which led to your loss and use it against your opponent in your next rematch. I do believe that George can pull of a decision win here, but he needs to make sure that he keeps his eye out on those deadly pokes that Haney lets out every so often.",

Kambosos' willingness to bet with Haney.The bottom line: as said by: Haney below.Quotesaid Haney. âPossibly, possibly not. We just gotta see what makes the most sense for me and my team. October, I will be fighting but we donât know who yet.âIf, this topic for a poll, of course I will vote.QuoteA.

Sometimes, slow fighters can overcome quick punchers. It just takes that one opening and you win the fight. I'm still not sure about Kambosos' ability to do just that, but I think he's a very capable fighter that can do these feats as long as he trained for it.Then again, as pointed out by YOSHIE above me, this particular match may not push through depending on Haney's decision.

He should learn how to counter Haney's strategy and should be more aggressive this time because, to be honest, Haney could easily get wild in the ring. Kambosos must find ways to know the weaknesses of Haney only if he wants to win this rematch. It will be too challenging for Kambosos to face Haney again.",
