  "content": "Cheap power outlets are causing problems. Confirmed this summer  High loads combined with the high temperatures caused some irreversible damages.The fire spread from the board where the outlets were assembled.Some machines burned.And some power wires as well.Here is a short video overview: https://imgur.com/Kte0KG2The good thing is - those were the old S9 models.Lesson learned - no more outlets.The new setup with S19 machines looks much better without them.When this farm was established, we marked BTC price on the newly laid concrete floor - it was around $8.6k, which is a reminder that there is always light at the end of the tunnel and we shall make it through the hard times again.",

Same applies to the power wires, they get heated a lot, but it's expensive to have thicker ones. Anyways, it's all part of the history now, lessons learned  Best advise to anyone mining is to keep fire extinguisher nearby. The one that was used during this accident is dry powder based, it works just fine, no need for the expensive stuff. After a cleanup with isopropyl alcohol miners are in the working condition again.",

It is a lesson learnt and a lesson to everyone to always seek professional assistance from people when it comes to anything that has to do with electricity or electrical wirings. If that had been what you did, this situation would have been avoided because they would have brought to your notice on time that those cheap outlets are not suitable and cannot handle the load and high temperatures from your equipment.",

      "body": "As a connection gets warm it will oxidize. Resistors are made out of metal oxides. As power continues to flow through the resistive material it only gets hotter and eventually compass or melts the receptacle. Heavy duty receptacles have greater holding force, more points of contact and higher temperature plastics/ceramics. A stronger holding force can reduce the amount of oxygen reaching the junction mitigating one factor. More points of contact distributes the flow over wider surface reducing the initial temperature increase. And the other factor just allows the receptacle to function much longer through the degradation. There is one Super cheap option that might just allow you to continue without upgrades, dielectric grease. The only purpose of dielectric grease is the cover surfaces and prevent oxygen interaction and oxide formation.J",

      "body": "It's common sense that If you can't afford proper PDUs simply cut the cable ends and use a wire-end on a busbar that can take the load, even if that goes against your local code -- it is a million times safer than using those power strips, if you check the wiring and connections inside them, you will notice that they can hardly run anything, mostly 1mm2 wires soldered in the cheapest possible way.Furthermore, it's not only about the wire size, I had some power strips that used fairly large wirings inside that could easily handle a couple of miners, but then socket martial was pretty bad, and the plug was a little lose, I have a general rule that if I can unplug something without worrying about the whole socket coming out, that thing will likely catch fire. So if you can easily plug and unplug the power cord -- there is probably something wrong, electricity does not like \"loose\", like most of the men electricity likes \"tight\".Anyway, I found a great source of PDUs in China, the manufacture for some US vendors under a different brand, I ordered a 3P 160A PDU from them which should be here soon, it has 24 ports, and each port should easily handle 4.4KW at 220v, that means it can easily handle 24 of most miners out there, I will be posting pictures and stuff when we set it up.",

On 99.999% of things it does not matter. High power, for long term without being plugged and unplugged which would scrape off the crud you stand the chance of adding resistance. As the person who explained it to me said, even though the chances are small it has been procedure in certain industries for years, and nobody would come up with something so silly if something bad had not happened.-Dave",

It will be loaded at ~86% though...They could probably do, but I don't use them on miners directly, I have 400a 3P contactors, each hold 5*80A 3P MCB, I just connect the Sonoff to the contactor so I can control the 5 MCBs with a single smart switch.Also since the direction of wind is pretty funny where the farm is, also temps changes a lot during the day, I use these smart switches to control the wall fans, so I connect the fan wires directly, but I don't think any set of fans I have go past 10A so the smart switches are not being stressed at all.While these are cheap, I don't think buying 1 for every individual miner makes economical sense, it would be better to just buy a smart PDU, a smart PDU that can power 24 S19s will be priced at below 1K at most, somewhere near double the price of the basic version, so we can say that all you to pay is 20$ more per miner if you wanted smart vs basic PDU, despite the fact that the smart switch is cheaper than 20$, the smart PDU beats it in terms of safety, installation and a few other things.Now if you have just 2 miners, then ya 500/2 = $250 more per miner, so I'd stick with the smart switch.",
