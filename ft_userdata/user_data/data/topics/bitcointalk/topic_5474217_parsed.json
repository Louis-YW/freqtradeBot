Avoid such physical trading.This is much more worse than even providing KYC self. I would say this actually defeats one of the main advantages of bitcoin which is privacy and anonymity. This coupled with latest trend of showcasing one’s personal wallet are a threat to one’s security.

Avoid such physical trading.I have not seen this option yet in my local P2P option, and even if it's available, I will not use it. I'm not a strong supporter of F2F trade. Some months ago, there was a thread with a question about whether using F2F or an exchange P2P trade was more preferable. For those who already don't have any accounts with any exchange and have not passed KYC before and are concerned about their data, most of them were advised to use an exchange platform that supports users in negotiating their means of exchange, and F2F was part of the best option recommended. In a safe society where violence is less, one can consider dealing in such, but in this cruiser society that we are into, I don't see such an option safe at all unless it's with someone you have dealt with before, and if you are the one sending crypto, it will be advisable to choose an open area where the trade can go on successfully, making sure no harm can come to you. One reason why most people consider it safer is that it's mostly done using cash payments, which can't be traced or tied to any one's identity, but then again, we don't know who is who and the motive of the person who is coming to buy from us.",

Avoid such physical trading.Binance is one of the largest if not biggest, so it's easy for them to used this as main target of victims but the more I read about this, the more I feel something has happened somewhere before all this. It's either Binance mistakenly leak people information or maybe someone from inside Binance actually leak this information to his crew to carry out this heist, nobody can really meet you in and bargain through P2P, the most they can get is perhaps a phone number which can only be for confirmation or easy access to call a trader to close their deal fastly, I don't think a number is enough to carry out this robberies.But the truth of this is that KYC has done more harm than good, never will you see headline of KYC in the media always about good result, is either an exchange was hacked and user information leaked or something that lead to stolen item and mostly it does happen in centralized exchanges. Some people will never accept the fact KYC is bad but then again, let's always give them benefit of doubts, they will learn and they will learn the hard way.",

I would not tell people to avoid face to face trades, what i'd tell them is to follow certain precautions: do not meet random people on social media and meet up with them for a face to face trade, you will definitely be robbed. Use a decentralized exchange like Bisq to set up face to face trades, (the funds would be locked in the 2 of 2 multisignature address before you meet your trading peer) and then you should meet in a public/busy place, you can also go along with a friend and don't give away anything personal to your trading partner.",

A media (could be a decentralized or centralized exchange) connects a random buyer to a seller. They do their basic checks, but this does not accommodate the intent of any of the parties.This creates an avenue where one can be jacked; $5 wrench attack, or tracked back to their home.Going along with a friend is a good idea and can help to some extent, but much better to go with a more assured alternative.- Jay -",

Problem is that people are not using common sense and are not careful enough when doing that, which sometimes end uo them getting robbed. Using that logic many things you do in real life shouldn't be done just because someone somwehere got robbed/attacked. I've done quite a few in person trades and I never had any issues whatsoever. Then again, I am not having such meetings in some dodgy alley and trying to sell large amount of bitcoin to a person that I enver met before and instead it was always done in a very public place (for example casino or a mall) so chances of something happening are slim.",

I am also advising people not to use it if they want a private and protected life for themselves.I have noticed Binance p2p traders are not very concerned about their privacy, some traders add their phone numbers in their p2p “terms of trade” or request the other party to share their phone number before initiating trade, they claim this is to enable a faster transaction. I don’t blame centralized exchanges for having this option, afterall it’s only one option out of many. But it does seem strange for Binance to have such an option because it means Binance will not be acting as an escrow in the transaction. Anyone who chooses to take this route does so at his own risk. I don’t see the advantage of having a f2f transaction especially if it is a large amount. No legitimate person would risk carrying that huge amount of cash around.",
