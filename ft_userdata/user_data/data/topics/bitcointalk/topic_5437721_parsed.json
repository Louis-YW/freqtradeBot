  "content": "Hey guys. On my Win10 Electrum wallet, when I click the green circle at the bottom left to bring up the balance. If I close that balance window, it makes a sound. A window closing sound, I guess.Any way to turn that off? Because I built a bot with AHK and Python to do some trades for me. The bot checks my wallet balance every minute or so. And so I keep hearing that sound all day long every minute.How so I turn off that window closing sound?",

      "body": "The balance should be displayed at the lower-left without needing to click the \"green circle\" (when all on-chain confirmed) balance distribution icon.Also, there shouldn't be any sound associated when closing that window.Does the sound similar to Window's \"Asterisk\" sound file? (Google for reference)Because if so, that'll play in Electrum if you mis-clicked anywhere in Electrum window but outside of that balance window instead of the 'x' icon or 'Close' button.(try to reproduce it manually)",
