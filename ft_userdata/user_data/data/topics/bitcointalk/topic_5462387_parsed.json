  "content": "Let's imagine that you have half a million US-Dollar/Euro/GBP and want to feel financially safe and build a better future. 1. Real estate - It's probably one of the safest investment option out there. Inflation rises, rent and apartment prices rise too, if inflation turns into deflation, your rent/apartment price still remains the same. With half a million, you can buy two or more good apartments in eastern Europe and live on your rent income.2. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile but rewarding. If you have a discipline and don't let your emotions take control over your decisions, then you can probably grow your capital by 200-500% a year. At least I think so, I think that's possible if one spends most of his time on exchanges and if necessary, spends some nights. So, crypto is very volatile and rewarding but another problem here is that you are dependent on exchanges, what will you do if they don't let you withdraw? Another problem is that you have to take care of your coins because once they are gone, they are gone forever.3. Business - It's like an income generated by Proof Of Work algorithm. Depends on the business and the person, one can achieve a huge financial success and influence or a total failure. But a big and successful business can outperform real estate and crypto investments. To my mind, proof of work is the only thing that can deal with absolutely any kind of financial crisis and disasters.Which one would you choose from these and why? P.S. Spam will not be tolerated, that's why I open self-moderated thread. You post spammy, meaningless post and I'll immediately remove it! Don't ever try to do that here!",

When we're into business we'll be much concentrated and we can grow ourselves. Here the work we do for some time period will keep our business going good for long term.Cryptocurrency is highly volatile, however I've enjoyed the goodness and the market crash. This lets me do the best and make some earning out of it than relying over it completely.Real estate is kind of business where we'll be able to make good profit in the short term. However the market depends upon the growth surrounding the property. This makes real estate an unpredictable market bearer and a riskier one.",

You just said half a million; I really don't know if you are referring to half a million dollars, my local currency, or in ERU. But not withstanding, if it's in my local currency, half a million naira cannot even buy you a good apartment; it cannot even start a very good standard business; and even half a million naira cannot pay a full shop rent for one year. In that case, I will just invest all the money in cryptocurrency and maybe only keep 10% for personal use. If the half a million is in dollars, then It can do at least almost all three things you have described. $300k can buy me a good two different apartments that I can put out for rent, then I can still buy Bitcoin with $100k, use $80k to start a cool furniture company or a Big grocery shopping centre, and lastly, I can just have the $20k as a reserve. Although there are still some cities in my country where you can get a luxury house for that $500k, I wouldn't go for such a place; I would just go for a middle class places, ow because it's going to allow me to spread the money across all the three investments, and I can still generate a huge profit in the future that might give me access to acquiring the big Luxury house.",

As much as possible then having 3 of these things would be always the sweet spot or simply talking about diversification on which of course it wouldnt really be so easy knowing that its not really that a cheap investment specially on real estate but if i do have that $500k then i would definitely be making us of it on buying 1 apartment neither on a 5-7 doors pad type then the rest would really be invested or would be make use of trading on crypto and at the same time i would really be considering on having or building a business which it would be most likely in farming like piggery farm.The amount mentioned here on our local or country would really be that sufficient enough for me to start or dealing up with these 3 or even having that change or extra fiat for me to save upand find for another venture on which you could really be sufficiently be able to live with these amounts and this is why you should really be wise on spending because reaching out or havingthe opportunity on having money doesnt really come often or never ever once in our lives. This is why we do strive on saving as much as possible for us to start up a business or whateverthings you are tending to do in speaking about investment or other source of income.",

I understand that it may not be that much of a big deal when the time comes, but as long as you believe in yourself and your business that would be always better. Real estate is not something I enjoy too much, I am not saying its a bad investment, depending on where you get it, it could always be a good investment. In my country, the price of houses skyrocketed like crazy, and rent did too, so maybe if people bought a house, they could have profited a lot, but during the same time bitcoin has risen x10+ so I think that's fine if you do not prefer it. This is why business is first, crypto is second and real estate is third for me.",

      "body": "Wouldn't real estate be better as a start? You can turn it into a business like a rental apartment for example if needed, which is like having a business and a real estate at the same time. Plus, it's a lot more solid and stable compared to the other two (if you choose a good plot anyway). Business is risky. But if stars aligned and you were able to somehow market your business, then it pretty much just builds up and snowballs from there. But again looking at it from the side of where you lose out, it's too much of an investment especially if you have a limited amount of funds you can use. Crypto is well... Crypto. It's highly volatile, and insane gains of 200% can bring you a lot, but you'd probably lose more at that point than you would've earned more. The good thing about crypto though is it has no starting requirement. A wallet, the know-hows of exchanges, and a bit of money can get you started in investing. So with that money, I'd go for Real estate > crypto > business.",

Buy it or build it and rent it out to other people and well this has the potential to make me have passive income for the future. If all goes well.For the second choice I want to choose business. But because lately business has become not easy and competition is getting tougher, so I will change my choice to adapt to the times and the current market. That is, I will choose to invest in crypto and of course bitcoin is included. Because I feel that both business and crypto have almost the same risks. what determines is whether we are ready to explore deeper insights or not before starting. Whether it's business or crypto, it would be better if we started by expanding our self-knowledge first.",

Â  You dont have to care about trends in the usage for that land and building type if ultimately you are the customer and can use it and pay for it. Â Â  When people propose to own more real estate then they require or have a use for in some way then it becomes speculative, like every market you are a player maybe leveraged with liabilities and costs to running that ownership.Â  Â You then need to operate a margin to your activities in order to pay those costs and are probably vulnerable to interest rate rises, or tax changes perhaps, zone limits or could be anything the risk is elevated and needs to be reduced to call it a good investment over time.Â  I believe that idea would apply to all three ideas for investment.",

With the way the economy works in Eastern Europe, that amount of money could get you two or maybe even three homes. When you own a piece of land, it's like having a real piece of the earth. You're excited about cryptocurrencies, but the 200â500% growth might not match up with the nights you spend on markets. Spending nights doesn't have anything to do with getting money. It's like watching the sun set and rise, but in terms of money. Your similarity to Proof of Work is both interesting and a bit vague. Business success may seem like proof of work, but a business isn't exactly a formula, and it still needs to be worked out. Using proof of work to deal with a financial problem is like putting a round peg in a square hole, but it does make some sense.Personally, I'd lean towards business or cryptocurrencies, or combine both of them",

The facts is that anything building needs maintenance for it to meet up with the current standard. I will invest 70% on bitcoin and I wouldn't trade but I will hodli for a long period of time so that I can make a huge profit from my bitcoin investment. Why I said this is because, when you buy bitcoin,the only thing that you need to do is to learn how to keep your coins safe in a self custodian wallet by using a hard wallet and that is all. It doesn't need maintenance or going here. Then I will use 20% to into farming,so that I can be using it to survive before my bitcoin investment get matured to the level that I want before selling.",

Cryptocurrency is indeed quite volatile and difficult to predict, but when it comes to crypto, I am more interested in investing in bitcoin as a financial hedge plan that we have. Business can be developed if someone has skills and a wide network because when building a small business, the return will be much smaller compared to being involved in real estate or investing in bitcoin.For me the three investment models that you mentioned have more potential to be carried out more primarily and simultaneously in points 1 or 2. Talk about accuracy that can be utilized easily without having to do some complications such as developing a business that requires special skills and takes more time to focus on developing it and I'm sure everyone will choose something different according to their interests and abilities.",

If I have the money, I wouldn't put it all in, and won't even risk in other token.Business is a good way to make money although you have to consider the capital and all throughout the life of your business, you have to keep track of how you make the money which isn't for me.
