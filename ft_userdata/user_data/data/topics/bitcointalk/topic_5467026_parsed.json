  "content": "I want to bring awareness to the case of @bbox, a lucky gambler who won 3.9 million $ on hypedrop.com, a case opening website.The guy won through case battles and was extremely lucky, the website itself reposted it here:https://twitter.com/HypeDrop/status/1672250657850499073To this date the withdraw is blocked due to KYC problems.bbox says he commited all KYC details, the casino demands informations regarding the origin of the deposited money (~100k)You can watch the whole story on @bboxIts quite concerning to see how unregulated casinos/ case opening sites try to withhold such an ammount due to imaginative \"KYC regulations.Imagine you win 3 million and you are not able to withdraw, it must be hell for your neves. I will update this case here as soon as the story goes on.",

How much of a joke is that?If KYC was only name address and maybe telephone number for tax purposes, I could get on board. Problem is they want a load more and it's kind of an invasion of my privacy.",

      "body": "I have seen this numerous times. It's why I haven't bothered playing in this online casinos at all lately. I would rather trade in a platform I know I have already passed KYC verification and can withdraw my winnings at any time.This casino let you register, deposit and even play without asking for KYC but when you attempt to withdraw. This is when they block your account and ask for KYC and not just simple KYC. They will try every way to retain your winnings. This is criminal!For example, see what some casino was asking from someone Street Selfie? Why all these crazy requirements in the name of KYC verification?",

      "body": "Would you also consider that in a number of cases KYC would be asked as a first step in attempt to dissuade the customer/client from either getting their deposits refunded or even withdrawing their winnings?The number of claims I read in my early days in the forum about casinos asking for KYC and then rejecting them by playing the IP address card or multi-account cheating card in order to put obstacles in the way of withholding legitimate winnings. It (KYC) probably could serve some useful purpose in some scenario but in the end it seems to be used more for nefarious purposes by casinos than the need for their security control procedure.Quote from: yahoo62278 on September 16, 2023, 10:43:49 PMKYC is such a joke honestly.

This is not about a few hundred or a thousand $, but a very significant amount that would raise red flags at any online casino or CEX. If the client has already done full KYC, I don't understand why it is a problem to show the origin of the money - unless it is money that is not from a legal source.Any casino that does not conduct such a check could very easily be accused of not implementing AML, and could lose its license.",

After demanding for KYC, they are demanding for source of money used to play the bet. What a joke. Then what is the point demanding for the KYC in the first place? It is obvious the casino has no money to pay or they are hiding something from the masses and their community. I will say this that if they do not have the money to pay in full, they should reach out in terms with the winner to be paid partly till they pay all in full. This is very reckless of a casino to have exhibited such cras ignorance and negligence of their duty.",

Reminds me of Roobet asking me for all kinds of personal and business-related information when they wanted me to join their affiliate program. We are talking about Roobet, that`s the guys in that fancy Curacao headquarters, right next to Stake, BC.Game, Rollbit & all the big buys.

I have also seen it with various exchanges (in testing). I am of the opinion that it is only an attempt to avoid obligations and delay access to funds/winnings.Just because of the insistence on KYC by illegal services, all other regular cases are considered jokes.",
