If you want my opinion, the VIP or tier system is supposed to be a plus or a feature intended to enhance the experience of people who have a huge volume or wager. It works better when the Tier system is part of the gambling experience and not the thing you are supposed to focus on all the time. Just gamble responsibly and enjoy the tiers you happen to reach naturally",

That 7 percent is still a long way to reach the next level which in his case is Platinum 3. I am playing Stake Originals which is Crash and I think it's a good way to increase your rank faster by putting the cashout number at 1.30. In my case, it was successful but do check the history of the results for this day too as there may be a lot more lower crash than the number I gave. Others are suggesting Plinko, but I tried it and I just lost all my funds. What @Volgastallion suggested is also medium-risk betting if you know your sports. I haven't seen a game that could really boost your VIP rank without losing anything, you just want to lessen the amount that you will sacrifice.",

Of course there is always a \"recover strategy\" but if you are having a really bad seed this can turn to shit real quick.Of course house edge is always a factor so basically if you wager 1k you will lose around 10$ for ever 1000$ wagered.That being said, if you have 93% to platinum 3 this means you still have to wager 35000$, which is actually doable. If you only do sports betting that's 12k in bets, but a risk of losing a lot. If you do the 1.01 wager strat you will have a calculated loss of around 300-400$. Considering the base reward for platinum 3 is 800$ plus recent gameplay bonus plus a 42 day reload I would say this calculated loss is acceptable and worth it.",

I remember sharing mine on another thread, and it helped others avoid unnecessary losses because it was costly to wager on most of the required games. Also, gamblers can still reach that amount even if they don't have a big gambling budget.",

I dont think it is hard to do, but my suggestion is not to bet higher than what you usually do. It will be also depending on how much you can afford to lose to wager this $35k. If you are patient enough, you can wager $35k with flat betting strategy and bet something like $0.1-$0.5 per bet (depending how much you want to spend) and play with higher winning percentage but not too low odds (maybe 1.2x-1.75x). I think $50-$100 is more than enough for you to reach reach Plat III to receive $800 bonus + recent bonus activity.
