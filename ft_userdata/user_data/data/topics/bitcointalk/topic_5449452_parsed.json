  "content": "I just recently posted news regarding the COINBASE CEO Armstrong who stated how he seeks opportunities elsewhere but not in the USA anymore. In an another interview Armstrong had strong urge of leaving the USA for better business opportunities. He clearly stated, it's not the regulations that is the problem and he actually thinks that it should be regulated just like other businesses for example, a software company or service provider etc. The problem in his perspective is, various regulatory bodies having turf war against who will regulate what and up to what extend. Besides this, USA does not have proper rulebook for the crypto regulations neither the situation is going to change for the years to come. This is keeping the exchangers hands under the rock and they are not able to develop the business at all. In previous article and in the current one, he again mentions how he sees UK as next crypto hub for better opportunities. What divides UK from USA in terms of regulations is, UK has only one regulatory body who works closely on commodities as well as securities of the market. This makes it way better to tie hands with them and have proper rulebook for the Crypto Business. On the other hand, Armstrong did try all the way up and met with SEC regulators almost 30 times. But all in vain. Interesting to read this news and what is more exciting is to see where this leads and whether USA will lose the importance of crypto soon if situation persisted like this forever. QuoteArmstrong said \"anything is on the table\" in terms of the crypto exchange's plans should greater regulatory clarity not emerge in the U.S.Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong indicated that the crypto exchange would consider moving away from the U.S. if the regulatory environment for the industry does not become clearer.\"Anything is on the table, including relocating or whatever is necessary\" he said after former U.K. Chancellor George Osbourne asked whether he could see Coinbase leaving the U.S. at Fintech Week in London.\"I think the U.S. has the potential to be an important market for crypto, but right now we are not seeing that regulatory clarity that we need,\" he said. \"I think in a number of years if we don't see that regulatory clarity emerge in the U.S. we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world.\"Armstrong's comments come weeks after rival exchange Bittrex said it planned to exit the U.S. by the end of April, citing \"the current U.S. regulatory and economic environment.\" Bittrex received a Wells Notice – a statement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Enforcement Division found evidence of legal violations – in March, general counsel David Maria told the Wall Street Journal. The SEC filed a lawsuit against the exchange on Monday.Armstrong compared the U.K. situation, where there is only one regulator – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – responsible for both commodities and securities, with the U.S., where there are separate bodies: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC.\"You don't have this unfortunate thing happening where the CFTC and the SEC are having a turf battle,\" he said. \"We actually have contradictory statements from the heads of the CFTC and the SEC coming out almost every few weeks. How's a business going to operate in that environment? We just want a clear rulebook.\"Coinbase received a Wells Notice from the SEC in March. Armstrong said Coinbase had met with the SEC \"30 times\" without getting feedback regarding the nature of its business before receiving the notice.He said there's a lack of distinction or nuance in how regulators view the different arms of the cryptocurrency industry. Exchanges like Coinbase should be regulated like financial services companies, whereas the decentralized areas of the industry should be handled very differently because there is no central authority to regulate.\"Things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi and even self-custodial wallets should be regulated like a software business or something like that,\" he said.Coinbase Beyond CryptoArmstrong also spoke of decentralized identity as one of the most compelling use cases for blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrency.“Decentralized identity is a way for people to kind of have their own, information ... because they actually own it,\" Armstrong said.“Decentralized social media is on the horizon. I think that's pretty important in terms of freedom of speech.”Earlier this year, Coinbase unveiled Base, an Ethereum layer 2 network upon which developers can build decentralized apps (dapps), sending a signal it wants to go beyond the trading of digital assets and into developing and expanding the broader uses of blockchain technology.Coinbase Could Move Away From U.S. if No Regulatory Clarity: CEO Brian Armstrong",

      "body": "I get what he is saying. 1/2 of the government says one thing and the other 1/2 says another.BUT, and this is a big BUT, being aggressive towards them does nothing. Coming out and making threats of 'leaving' will get both 1/2s to agree 'fuck that guy'No other way to put it. Not saying he should not have said what he said. But IMO there are nicer ways of saying it.I also know I have said it before, regulation is coming. You can fight it for a while, but once it hits a certain point. You have to adapt.Ever wonder why Gemini, which is just as US based [and also has plenty of faults / issues] and dealing with just as much government BS does not make the news as much. Perhaps they have more lawyers making sure more things are a bit more compliant. Not saying one is better then the other, but one might make for a smother & easier existence then the other.-Dave",

      "body": "News about COINBASE CEO Armstrong seeking new ventures is great! It's incredible how regulations can shake up businesses, especially in crypto. Can't help but think about the future of the USA and its crypto game.Armstrong looking elsewhere? Makes sense, folks. The USA's regulatory mess is like a game of musical chairs, and crypto's left without a seat. The UK, on the other hand, has it together, working with commodities and securities. It's a crypto paradise!Sad that Armstrong's talks with the SEC didn't work. Regulators need to cooperate with businesses for fair rules. Hopefully, the USA learns from the UK and builds a better crypto regulatory system",

      "body": "It was expected! The way the US government is creating a ruckus in the crypto market, many companies will follow the same exit route and move to probably Singapore which is by far the most crypto-friendly country for businesses. The same thing happened with India when the government decided to stop banking services for crypto business, Zebpay simply moved to Singapore and now providing services to 30+ countries and to millions of customers. It's India's loss and Singapore's gain! But it's really disheartening to see that a capitalist country like the US is doing nonsense in the crypto market. I wonder if the US is becoming a conservative country from the current capitalist mindset!",

They drew up a bill for his termination and perhaps next month he will be replaced.He did nothing to protect us from FTX or Celcius but now is going after good exchanges like kraken or Coinbase. Look how many years the ripple lawsuit has gone on for. And for what. Same with the BTC etf rejections. He needs to be replaced ASAP.",

      "body": "Agree Gensler needs to go.I don't understand what his deal is. When he came into the office it looked like we might have a crypto-friendly SEC chair, since he taught a blockchain course at MIT. But after taking the job it became clear at some point he became very anti-crypto.It's not even just that he doesn't like crypto, but he is purposefully refusing to allow the SEC to make rules for the crypto industry (and attacking crypto companies instead) in order to try to kill the industry in America. That's literally the opposite of what the SEC is supposed to do! He needs to be removed for negligence. SEC is supposed to make rules so that companies can comply, instead he is not making rules so that nobody can comply, and then suing them based on rules that don't exist in order to try to have the courts decide rules after the fact. It is straight up corrupt.The Coinbase CEO is absolutely right. The SEC under Gensler is operating in such a way that it is clear their only goal is to take down the industry, which of course is not what the SEC is supposed to be doing. If such a condition continues in the US then it totally makes sense for the industry to move offshore.The industry absolutely needs some regulations that don't get in the way of innovation and are specific to how crypto works (ie not trying to apply legacy finance rules to crypto when they wouldn't even make sense with crypto). And it is clear Gensler is not up to the task.",

I believe Coinbase's business hasn't changed significantly within those two years, so it's quite puzzling.Anyway, Brian Armstrong's statement appears to be a prelude to Coinbase launching its new derivatives exchange for the international market. The company recently acquired a license in Bermuda, and sources suggest it could launch as early as next week. This move seems promising to me. There has been a void in the derivatives market since FTX goes down. Given Coinbase's reputable brand and its history of top-notch operation and compliance, it could be a viable alternative to Binance, which currently dominates the international derivatives market. Even if Coinbase's platform fees are higher, I can see reasons why people might prefer it over Binance. I'm personally eager to give it a try.",

Basically, there is a certainty that any approval from SEC in the past years will hold up now since apparently if there is a new head, then the rules need to follow him. It's kinda wack if that's true, no business would risk dealing with them since it doesn't matter if they follow the law or not if they can get sued in the future due to breaking 'security laws' in the past.",

Meaning if there has to be an interpretation of the law and if power can change something easily then I think it will impact Coinbase or for other businesses and it's strange to me that a new head for the rules has to follow them. If you look at the growth of crypto, one of the countries as the largest bitcoin hub and full support for the technology, the United States should be friendlier with strict regulations and have fewer laws restricting the passage of crypto, exchanges and blockchain technology. Shouldn't it be?Overall I don't really understand the regulations in force in the United States, but actually to understand the law it should apply in accordance with the initial submission by Coinbase, so when the initial application for a license for example, it is certain that they provide legal certainty to Coinbase and even if there is a change it is not solely to be suppressed because of a change of power or a new head.",

Meaning the US is too big to be threatened by this single entity, the hypocrisy of the CEO is high, some of them have branches elsewhere, it can be done by COIN also, not threatening. The US rules are spelt, the SEC and CFTC might both have jurisdiction in regulating a single digital asset depending on their usage as digital asset in terms of derivative and commodity classes. He should stop comparing the US that has the best regulatory plan to another country.Nope. You have no idea what's happening inside the USA. They are going crazy about all the Crypto drama and not thinking straight about how it can hamper the American crypto side. Now, let us not forget that Crypto is small, but it is a huge part of an economically developed country like America. Just now I posted another article about Binance.US and Lender Voyager who broke the 1 billion dollar worth of deal just because of the SEC conflicts in the USA.If this kept happening to all the exchangers and crypto institutes in the USA then what would the government do? Will they see other countries rising up in favor of crypto and see their own crypto career ending just like that? Let's not be overconfident about one thing here, America might be big, but collectively other nations could surpass the economy of the US if crypto investors moved there and started settling the bases out there. Slowly crypto is bigger stuff, in the future it can go nuts.",
