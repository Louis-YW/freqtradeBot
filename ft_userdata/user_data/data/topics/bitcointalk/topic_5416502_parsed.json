With the fierce stand against plagiarism on the forum, one would think there would certainly have been a repercussion of some sort  when someone commits the heinous crime of taking credit for someone else work. Perhaps the mods are selective in who gets punished; I do not know. The post has been long deleted so I can safely assume that not all users on the forum gets the same treatment when found out for plagiarism I’m not advocating for this user to get banned. I’m just curious if a low ranking member also does the same, would the user be given a pass as well?Perhaps the pig in George Orwell’s Animal farm was right when he said; All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than the others.",

So what does that have to do with plagiarism, you are not reporting a profile, but some kind of content that has to do with that profile. Given that the posts in question have been deleted, the only thing someone can do now is to find new plagiarized posts (if they exist) and then make a report.I think he probably meant report one of the posts with a message to the mods to check the user's profile for other instances of plagiarism, although that's not the right way to go about it--or it could just be a misunderstanding due to language.  Either way, if the member in question hasn't been banned within maybe a month I'd probably report those posts again.  I don't think this is a case where \"leniency\" should come into play.Quote from: Tutte on October 09, 2022, 08:01:58 PM@iroh, don't waste your energy here, probably he has the big Boss in his corner. If you're referring to Theymos there, I seriously doubt it.  The only member who might have Theymos in his corner is Coolcryptovator, or Cryptovator, or whatever his name got changed to.  Twice.  Sorry, I'm not bitter about being refused a change of username.  Not at all, not one bit.",

I assume Mr. Right will not get banned because he already deleted those posts before moderators saw the report. So instead of reporting them on the Report Plagiarism thread, You can report to Moderators silently describing the reason. Of course, if you badly want to get him banned. Or maybe you can ask him to add source and follow the rules.Why do you assume that the user deleted his posts himself and not the moderators? Those reports are months old, so there was plenty of time for the moderators to react, which they probably did. Mr.right85's profile on bpip. org shows that 7 of his pots have been deleted by moderators. Second, if you read the OP's post more closely, you'll notice that he quoted reports from the Report plagiarism thread.Why do you assume those 7 posts deleted by moderators were plagiarized posts? Maybe those 7 posts were something else like low-value posts or spam which is deleted by moderators. As far as I know, Moderators delete Plagiarism posts with their actions (Temp or perm ban). Yeah, I saw that he quoted it from the report plagiarism thread. No matter how old the reports are. If Mr. right uses the telegram bot, he was notified right after the report and he deleted those plagiarized posts. Suppose 1 hour later moderators saw the report but they found those posts were deleted. So, it does not depend on how old the report is. Use your brain.",

Swiftness is what I understood happened.  He should be regarded as one of the luckiest users in the forum and there's totally No Need of resurrecting this matter now, is it targeted to troll the mods?Following your logic, it’s real smart to knowingly plagiarize and hurriedly delete the said posts when found out. That’s good to know.  Also, when a wise man commits a sin, it’s a “wise sin” and it’s a “dumb sin” when a supposedly dumb person does? Lol! I guess if it’s a wise sin, it’s alright. Plagiarism is what I understood happened there and that crap about differences when a dumb man and a wise man commits a sin is bullshit. The wise man should be wise and not dumb to commit the sin. You sound ignorant or flat out biased.",

Moderators do not consider Post Scraping links like Loyce.club or Ninjastic. This is not my statement. One of the Mods said that, but I cannot find the Post now. First time I hear about this and honestly doesn't make much sense to me.I'd say it makes a lot of sense: people shouldn't get banned if they corrected their own mistake.Quote from: Little Mouse on October 09, 2022, 04:25:02 PMThis makes sense why wouldn't mods trust such an archiving links. It is possible that TryNinja and/or LoyceV can manipulate the content in their website since they have access to their website, though we know any of them would never do that.You don't even have to trust me on it: I create checksums of all archived posts. See this post (and read a few posts before and after). Feel free to archive those checksums as often as you want, and feel free to check if I don't automatically alter any new posts.",
