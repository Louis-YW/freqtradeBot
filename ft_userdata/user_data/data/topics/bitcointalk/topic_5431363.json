Thereâ€™s no need to limit the holdings of each user since it will just suppress the freedom of holding Bitcoin. Those whale holders deserves to have that profit because they actually risk big on something they donâ€™t guarantee profit during there early investment.The real problem of Bitcoin mass adoption are the government and bankers that keeps slowing down Bitcoin growth through the laws that will regulate Bitcoin. Also the shit CEX that keeps doing shady trades to manipulate the Bitcoin price to pump and dump scheme.",

I don't see enough evidence if it, and thus I don't believe it. Distribution is definitely uneven, but that's the way with any kind of wealth in the world, so it's a global challenge. Limiting the amount per person would be dystopian, as it limits the freedom of people to buy however much they want and requires linking all wallets to personal IDs to ensureÂ  one person doesn't simply have several wallets to avoid the limit. I think that a way toward more equal distribution ofÂ  wealth, including Bitcoin, shouldn't be as restrictive.",

I know the sad experience of one country in which they decided to distribute material wealth in approximately the same way, and as a result, nothing good came of it.It seems to me that the market itself will resolve and adjust this imbalance over time. In this system, and so everyone can have bitcoin or part of it. Especially when the price has dropped so low. So you seem to be worrying too much. Moreover, nothing can be changed, thanks to decentralization, and there is no special body capable of redistributing bitcoin in any other way.",

He claimed that 3.7 million coins are lost, with the remaining coins being held on chains by early adopters.There are no Bitcoin experts and If you're going to give a report, you should include the source of that report.Firstly, there are no groups of early adopters who own the bulk of bitcoins, the distribution of holders is spread among a wide range of adopters from early to late.Also, the number of potentially lost bitcoins are unknown, everyone can only make conjectures to the amount.Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 25, 2022, 10:57:43 AMAvoiding a centralized authority controlling the system is one of the issues that Bitcoin seeks to overcome. If there is a large demand and widespread adoption, a supply shock would then occur.A supply shock is defined by many as \"an unexpected event that changes the supply of a product or commodity\". This cannot apply to Bitcoin as the amount of bitcoins in circulation and that would ever be in existence is public and cannot change.Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 25, 2022, 10:57:43 AMHowever, the issue is still present and may be more significant than the use of fiat money.

What do all of you think?â€¢ That's a terrible idea for a decentralized currency. Limiting the amount that people can hold is creating a problem of itself, and would need the entire system to change to achieve that. Why fix something that isn't broken?â€¢ I think we are already on the way to achieving wide spread adoption.",

Indeed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are profitable but it won't always be on upside. There will always be time for downfalls in this market which is not something to be endured by all people. Think of this; salaries are in form of cryprocurrencies. Those who are earning minimum wage would be at risk of having not enough money during bearish market because of losses. And if it would coexist with fiat(which is more likely to happen), businesses wpuld be on the same situation. This dimply points out that people are not ready yet to risk for this industry.",

The biggest barrier to the mass adoption of bitcoin is none other than the government, as long as the government regulates and propagates bitcoin in a positive way, the problems you raise will quickly be solved.

You want to punish those who believed in this economy more than you do or because they entered the market with more money than you or long before you... Bitcoin is freedom and allowing you to make your own decisions. If those decisions include buying millions of coins, then that's your right. If you don't want whales to own so many coins, don't sell them cheaply on the market whenever some bad news about bitcoin gets posted. Tell your friends and everyone you know. It's an open market, but no one can buy your coins if you don't want to sell them. Look at me right now not selling you my coins because I don't want to. Bitcoin doesn't have restrictions.",
