It still a good report if you report for a correct reason, although it could be a soft-bad report.Quote2. if the moderator moves the topic, whatever the reporter did (if not in accordance with the board) will mark as good?Yes.",

As the moderator must select the status manually, it's possible that the report is marked as bad. As far as I know, when a post is reported and the post is deleted, the report is automatically marked as good even if you have reported the post for something else.
