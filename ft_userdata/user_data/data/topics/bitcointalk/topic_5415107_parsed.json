You might compare him to Julian Assange, except that Assange was more of a journalist, and Snowden knew more of the real details.Either way, both of these guys were trying to warn the people of the ways that government was trying to harm them. Assange simply didn't have his cover set up well enough. Snowden had a good plan for ducking out when government came after him.These guys both show us what happens to people who are whistle blowers against government. Most whistle blowers aren't as popular as these two guys. But there are a lot of them.",

The folks that seem him as a traitor just take their privacy rights for granted. Seems like a lot of people don't remember the Vault 7 leaks a few years after Snowden's leaks. Arguably a bigger story, no one cared.",

The US is simply some words on paper. Then who does it? Some people who have taken an oath of office to do according to what the Constitution says during their time in government. But they don't obey their oath, and nobody takes them to task over it.If we the simple citizens called government officials out - accused the government man or woman - and took them to court over it, we could not only turn things around, but we could make some money at the same time... if we did it the right way.",

But seriously, now he is Russian citizen and he is eligible age for mobilization. I know what his lawyer said there is few examples from Russia who didn't even served in army got mobilized. But it would be unbeleavable if it would happen for Snowden.Yeah, he revealed lot of dirty things, but he is still traitor and USA will never forgive him.

And since no country would dare to take this step, Russia chose the appropriate timing to be in the form of a punitive step, such as the sanctions that America is increasing its imposition on it.Edward Snowden has long been protecting Russia and granting him citizenship is just another step in Putin's war strategy against those boycotting him with sanctions.",

      "body": "^^^ Edward Snowden's first contract was his Oath of Office, to uphold the Constitution of the USA. When he realized, through his position in national security, that many other people who had take the same Oath of Office as he did, were breaking their Oath, and causing destruction of America through that breaking, all he did was to tell us all about what they were doing. So, essentially Edward Snowden is near the top as far as being patriotic to the USA.If you read the Constitution, you will find that the US doesn't have any business running around the world and interfering in other countries. And if it is unclear in the Constitution, then the writings of both the Federalists and the Anti-federalists will clarify it. (These were the two main groups of people who set up the Constitution in the first place.) Both groups wanted to keep America out of foreign affairs.All that Snowden did was to do his duty and show us all how there were many people in Government breaking their Oath to uphold the Constitution, at least in the spirit of the Constitution. Regarding this, Russia was changed by US government people and US banking people who supplied the Bolshevik revolutionaries with what they needed to overthrow the Russian government of 1916. Putin knows this, or at least now that Snowden prompted him to look at Russian history.The US is against Russia for one major reason. The Bolshevik overthrow was intended to make a socialist one-world government way back then. But, along the way, Russia revolted against the criminals in the US government and banking system. That's the basic reason why the US is pushing Ukraine into a fight against Russia. Not because Russia is trying to forcefully take over the world. In fact, just the opposite.",

Snowden has more or less been loyal to Russia for a long time. Part of this is likely due to his own self-perservation (without said loyalty, he would likely face the death penalty). It is unfortunately likely that Russia has seen sensitive documents belonging to the US that have nothing to do with his whistleblowing activities. One can argue is this outweighs the benefits of him making public the abuses by the US intelligence agencies against its own citizens....",
