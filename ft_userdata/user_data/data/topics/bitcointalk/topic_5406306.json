  "content": "I saw Bitcoin Archive[1] tweeting about this earlier, so I googled and found this[1]. Not sure how credible this is since I couldn't find articles from trusted sites, but it should be real as the U.S is now included in their list of restrictions countries[3].I'm very surprised that I couldn't find anything (public) about this from CoinPayments either, especially when they're going to restrict their users from accessing their funds in a few days.Anyway, I just thought I'd share this in case, someone, in here is still using them.[1] https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1547628342932754441[2] https://twitter.com/kurtseifried/status/1547326847863558144 [3] https://www.coinpayments.net/help-restricted",

      "body": "I agree. With such short deadline, they should at least post in every social channels they have otherwise it limits the news from spreading.Although tedious, there's apparently a way to get your funds out in case you miss their given deadline. Let's just hope there will be no additional/hidden fee aside from the network fees.Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/coinpayments/comments/vxiszh/united_states_users_get_out_of_coin_payment_now/...If you do not withdraw your assets to another wallet by July 20, 2022 you will still own those assets but will not have access to your account. You will need to submit a Support ticket and we will send your assets, net of network fees, to a wallet that you designate after we confirm your identity. Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this matter.",

      "body": "For all of everyones complaining about BitPay / Coinbase Commerce / and the other places that do KYC and crawl up you ass deep enough to qualify as a colonoscopy at least they don't have the ability to do something like this. Not saying they can't kick you off their platform or do a dozen other bad things but, they at least have to follow some set of rules for getting you what is owed to you and give you a reasonable amount of time to take care of things if they do force you to leave.For the \"host it yourself\" and all the other people coming to say that. They provided a service for a fee, I'm sure the cost of the fee was probably less then some people thought it would cost them to do it themselves. And for good or bad, they also accepted a lot of coins, doing that yourself for a small shop would be a major task.-Dave",
