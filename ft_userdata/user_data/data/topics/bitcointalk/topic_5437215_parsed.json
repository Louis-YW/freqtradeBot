Will delete if requested.  This is the same type Casascius coin that was attempted to be sold on the TV show Pawn Stars season 20 episode 7. It is not the literal same exact coin, just a yellow slab 0.5 silver \"Error Holo\" round, 1 of 45. The seller was a forum member here, Eodguy149. He made a thread about it here. The one discussed in the episode was an MS68 and he asked for for $215,000. Eodguy149 sated he picked a starting price at 10X face. BTC at the time was around $45K, so 4.5BTC. Rick countered with BTC+silver spot face value and no deal was made. I'll let you read the thread and watch the video. A very cool item, can't wait to see how it goes here, maybe Rick will show up and make an offer with his forum account since he missed out in 2021. Geo",
