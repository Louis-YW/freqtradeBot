      "body": "Unless you were once importing the address by private key, it is impossible the seed phases did not return the correct address.Now it is expected that MetaMask only return 1 address if you recently reimport your secret recovery phrase/seed phrases into the application or extension. What you need to do is simply just re-add a new account, and then you will see the addresses you already had.For full reference, take a look at the MetaMask support page, it is explained in detail and addresses the reason why you did not automatically see all the accounts/wallets: https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271.",

      "body": "Never rely on seed words with MetaMask to retrieve all addresses that you issued on one of the copies installed on one of your devices. You are fortunate if you did not lose the copy installed on your old computer so that you can extract the secret keys for all addresses (no need for the seed) and add them manually to the new installed copy.What is happening with MetaMask indicates that the wallet is unable to produce different addresses from the same seed, and that the seed is issued to produce one main address, while the rest of the addresses are produced randomly according to the protection of the private key/address pair.I have not tried this before, so I wonder if the same thing happens with the MetaMask version on the phone.",

I don't know what to do but just read the same advise of adding them manually. The funds are there and also the other accounts, you just need to put it back little by little but I don't know if it's okay if not having the same account name but still, just try it and see what will happen and update us back here if it's positive or not.",

In addition, you can extract your private keys for each of your old addresses and then import them into a new MetaMask. I recommend that you save these private keys for each address and store them together with seed phrases.",
