  "content": "since there is already a raffle for the launch of a signature campaign, i would now like to introduce you to the following raffle, in which the winner can win 0.002BTCThe BTC-Signature End... (and this song gave me the inspiration for this name)here you should name the campaign that will end next. the word [END/ENDED] must be written explicitly in the ann title - words like HOLD or PAUSED do not apply.your task is to name the correct campaign as well as the week after which the campaign you named has announced its end.since the whole thing is a bit difficult to predict, every participant can change his 'old' prediction after exactly 2 months (by inserting the quote of his first vote) again.Rules:all known bounty managers are unfortunately excluded from this competition as wellall who have registered here in the forum before 01-august-2023 and have at least 10 merits are allowed to participate.if i catch someone who writes to a bm personally (maybe to find out if he will be the 1st one) he will get a negative trust from me and will be excluded from the competition.campaigns that have disclosed the length of the same in the campaign thread are excludedthe raffle will run until the end of a BTC signature campaign is published.the winner will be evaluated according to the following weighting: sigantur name, weekif several participants have named the correct campaign and the correct week, then the draw will decide in the form of a hash announcement of any BTC blockwhoever's week is closest to the correct week (no matter if before or after) wins the raffle.editing your own posts is prohibitedplease use the following form for your participation:Code:BTC Signature Campaign:[END/ENDED] Week:good luck to ya all!  ðŸ¥³",
