  "content": "It appears a new feature has recently been implemented in the forum. When someone creates a thread, they are the Ooriginal Poster, or \"OP\". Now whenever someone creates a post in a thread in which they are the OP, the letters \"OP\" will appear next to their forum handle. It appears there is a tooltip when you hover over the \"OP\" next to a person's name, which tells you that this person created the thread. This is a cool, useful feature. When following up on a thread you have previously read and/or posted in, this will allow you to quickly know which posts belong to the OP of that thread.",

I know you wouldn't have created this thread if you knew about the thread, I am only just suggesting that you can lock this thread to avoid repetition and spamming.",
