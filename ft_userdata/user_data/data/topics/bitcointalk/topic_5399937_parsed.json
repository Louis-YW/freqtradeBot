  "content": "Received small amount of btc from a gambling site.  Let say it was for 0.009 btc.  Btc showed up in latest operations in ledger live pretty quick.  Noticed it showed unconfirmed and thus 0 confirmations when you check transaction.  Then waited a bit until there was one or two confirmations.  Then i went to another gambling site and it show the btc address i have to send btc to.  Let say it was for 0.005 btc to make it simple.  When i then went to advanced fees on ledger live and put the fee of just 1 Sat... because i heard the fees on mempool are low now... shows just 1 sat is enough and is for low, medium and high priority, so i put that... but when i went to confirm it on the nano ledger s by pressing the buttons to confirm transaction, i got a message on ledger live that said something like the transaction may have failed and to check something?  Don't recall if it ask to your internet connection or your transaction history.  Has anyone ever gotten this message before?  Well the transaction didn't show up in ledger live and i waited for a bit and nothing showed up.Then i went back to the other gambling site that i want to deposit btc on and it would generated another btc address for me to send to.  This time i did the same thing except for the fees, i just clicked on the standard low fee of 3 Sats as oppose to changing the fees in advanced to 1 Sat on ledger live.  Waited a bit and the transaction went through. Does anyone know why i got the transaction may have failed message before?  Why did the transaction not go through?  Possible its my internet connection?  What about the low 1 Sat fee?  What about the gambling site btc address that was given to me the first time?",

      "body": "1 sat/vByte shouldn't be a problem unless Ledger connects to a node that doesn't accept transactions with those rates. Nodes can be configured to not accept anything below x sat/vByte because they don't have an unlimited capacity. But it doesn't make sense to do that especially if the mempools aren't too congested. But if they do get congested, transaction fees spike, and memory becomes a problem, those paying the lowest transaction fees (1 sat/vByte being the lowest) will be dropped from the mempools and won't be accepted until the situation clears up a bit.  It's hard to say what exactly happened because you don't know what you saw yourself.",

I don't use the Ledger Live crap software but as far as I remember there is usually some more details on an error when you see the red exclamation mark warning when something went wrong.How can we know here what is with your internet connection? It's up to you to check it in moments of trouble.Mempool status can easily be observed on https://mempool.space or https://bitcoinexplorer.org and usually a transaction fee rate of 1sat/vB should not be a show stopper (only with high mempool congestion it could be that nodes raise the minimum accepted rate above 1sat/vB, but this happens rarely as far as I've seen it).Quote from: jerry0 on May 24, 2022, 04:59:56 AMWhat about the gambling site btc address that was given to me the first time?Ask the gambling site, maybe the provided address \"expired\". The receiver is in charge to provide the target address to be used for a current transfer. Take what is given to you and don't worry about past addresses as that is not of your current concern.You seem to ask the same questions over and over again. Is this some kind of therapy or what?

But during the time the transaction failed and when he created a new one for 3 sat/vByte, it got confirmed, so he was able to send the second one? I don't know. I think Ledger Live won't allow you to select UTXOs as part of new transactions that haven't yet been confirmed on the blockchain. Another thing that is confusing is the part where the gambling site he was trying to deposit to showed him a different address compared to the one he initially saw. This is rather strange. I don't gamble that much, but I don't think your gambling address on your casino account is supposed to change that quickly or that you can have multiple ones in the first place.",

There is also this blog post by Ledger where they state that they no longer allow unconfirmed transactions to be used for new transactions by default. This particular setting can be changed, but honestly, I don't see Jerry changing any of the standard settings without asking multiple times how many other Ledger users in the world have also done it. QuoteWhile creating a Bitcoin transaction, Ledger Live will now no longer let unconfirmed transactions be used for new transactions by default. This will ensure that you won’t be facing any difficulties with the “Send Max” feature – even if any pending incoming transactions are cancelled. This setting can be changed if desired.That blog post is older than the source you linked to, so maybe the information is no longer correct.",

If you were sending to a payment processor in order to make a purchase of some goods or services, it would make sense that there is a timer that you have to respect and send the correct amount before the clock goes down to 0. If it does and you haven't send the requested amount, the rates change and you might be asked to send more. I have never seen such a system on a gambling site and I don't see the logic why it's there.  Quote from: jerry0 on May 28, 2022, 06:18:19 PMThere was also on that page to cancel transaction.  So because of what happened earlier with that error message, i cancelled the transaction on the gambling site page.  Then i went back to the deposit page on the gambling site and went to deposit btc again and it then generates me a new btc address to send to.  Makes sense? That also makes no sense. You can't cancel Bitcoin transactions in that way. If the transaction has been broadcasted (which obviously didn't happen in your case), you can't cancel it on the receivers end. It's not like a garage door you close so no one can enter. You can send Bitcoin to any valid address and the recipient can't prevent you from doing that. If I know one of your Bitcoin addresses, I could initiate new transactions to it 50 times a day if I wanted to. How are you planning to stop me from doing that? I am curious, can you tell me the name of that gambling site?  Quote from: jerry0 on May 28, 2022, 06:18:19 PMWas there something wrong with the btc address supplied by the gambling site the first time?

Never does it ask you how much btc you want to deposit.  That site you bet with usd and not btc.  This site also takes bank wire, neteller, skrill etc, does that make sense?  its not a crypto betting site where you only deposit and withdraw and bet with crypto.So say you want to deposit 500 dollars... it will then take a short bit to generate the exact amount of btc they want you to send to a particular btc address.  it would also display a timer that say you have xx minutes to complete the transaction.  So when i went to send x amount of btc to that btc address generated by them, i got that message on ledger live so transaction didn't go through.  So i went back to that gambling site page and just cancelled the transaction.  Because since it didn't go through, i went to deposit option again on that site and put the same amount of usd i wanted to deposit, then it take a short while and generated a new btc address for me to send to and the exact btc amount to send.  That btc amount to send was very close to the amount it ask me to send earlier... make sense since the btc price didn't change much during that time.  does that make sense?  i didn't cancel any transaction that i done because it didn't go through according to ledger live latest operations.  i just cancelled that deposit address the site gave me the first time because the transaction didn't go through the first time.  So i'm wondering what was the culprut because the second attempt to send btc to a new btc address worked.  So could it been an issue with the first btc address that was generated to me to deposit that has issues?  How would that be possible?  Was it because i went to advanced settings and made the sending fee only 1 sat fee?  Remember the second attempted transaction to a new btc generated address where i just i clicked low sat fee 3 Sats worked.",

I rather think of the cancel option on the gambling site to cancel the deposit operation which according to @jerry0 is also time limited. After you cancelled it, it's not surprising to me that you get a new deposit address when you request a new deposit operation. It's just their payment processor logic as it seems. Of course you can't cancel a Bitcoin transaction from the receiver's side. A receiver also has no control of who transfers coins to one of his publicly announced addresses. That's what @Pmalek points out.Quote from: jerry0 on May 29, 2022, 01:02:54 AMSo i'm wondering what was the culprut because the second attempt to send btc to a new btc address worked.  So could it been an issue with the first btc address that was generated to me to deposit that has issues?  How would that be possible?  Was it because i went to advanced settings and made the sending fee only 1 sat fee?  Remember the second attempted transaction to a new btc generated address where i just i clicked low sat fee 3 Sats worked.Ledger Live isn't the finest software out there and from your details it's not apparent what the issue was that caused an error and prevented the broadcast of your low fee transaction. If you know the time when you tried to send it, one could check the avarage mempool history, but I doubt that this could be any cause. In the past days or weeks the avarage mempool wasn't congested in such a way that nodes would start to raise minimum transfer fee above 1sat/vB.I doubt you and anyone here can make some reasonable post-mortem of your transfer issue unless you get a more specific error message which pinpoints the problem with more detail.",

I will check it again a bit later today just to see if something didn't change in the newer versions. I doubt it has.@jerry0From the way you explain it, that casino doesn't work with Bitcoin, as in you are not gambling and wagering Bitcoin. They tell you how much you need to deposit in crypto and then convert the coins into fiat using a payment processor(USD or whatever you selected in the settings). That's why you have a limited amount of time to make the deposit. Same thing would happen during withdrawals as well.",
