Thank you very much for recommending me to the work opportunity  Tbh I'm not a good illustrator and seems they have more works for illustration stuff but I would likely give a try since the deadline is April 1st. Beside that, the requirement to qualify is quite unique by asking the applicants to redesign some of their images. It's perfect for anyone who have skills but doesn't have a portfolio yet. Good luck guys!",

Good luck guys!Sure buddy, please go for it. I just want that this forum's members get a chance outside as well so that they can excel at other places and be able to make a new portfolio through this and also showcase their work through the same. After all, small things can make a huge difference.",
