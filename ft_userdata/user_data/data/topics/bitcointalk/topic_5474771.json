They might be doing it in a way that they have to gain some favour, which is providing a centralised service to their customers. I respect the idea of safekeeping their holdings and providing easy buy-and-sell services. Those seem like the old way, but still, it's a bold step forward in how globally recognised bitcoin is already, and more firms and government institutions will still continue to licence private service providers for it. What is just needed to expand bitcoin acceptance here is the right firm or personality approaching regulatory bodies with the right convincing information, and they will get their approval.",

The idea behind BTC is to give you self custody of your coins and for you to spend it without anyone's permission, when you store your funds in a bank, they have custody of it and you need their permission to spend, that defeats some of the important purpose of BTC.There are so many people who still store their coins in centralized exchanges because they think some of them are too big to fail, such people would not mind giving up custody of their coins to a bank, we must accept that there would be people who believe self custody is difficult and that their funds are safer when stored with a third party.",

The involvement of these institutions helps build the confidence of people to buy cryptocurrencies. But we shouldn't be thrilled by these moves by centralised platforms because they can also harm the market. Bitcoin was not created to be in the custody of any bank so his move is not a commendable one based on the goals of the coin which is to promote privacy and decentralization. I am also wondering if this crypto bank is secured by the Compensation Scheme of German Banks (EdB) in the case of bank failure. Will customer get back their deposited crypto assets if this bank collapse? If the answer is yes, then this service is better than exchanges that go down with customer's funds. But it is far better to keep your keys.",

Obviously, Bitcoin is the enemy here for almost every financial institute that is run by the government or even some private sectors. All they are doing is showcasing that they are also part of the crypto community. Though this is happening slowly it is happening with clear thoughts and plans in their minds. Banks can't run without their users. The clients must deposit the money so that banks can use the same for their other products and services and charge heavy interest rates on the same. For example, loans, different kinds, and that too with the collateral from the same user who deposits or saves money in the same bank. Now that crypto is out there peeps have a chance to escape that system. However, financial institutes are sensing that too. Now they will offer the same crypto ground with three control and thus users will start buying their crypto shit which is nothing but money but with a different face. Those institute wants nothing but their clients/users who will deposit money in their account no matter what is the format. Seems bigger games are coming.",

I don't think this is a good way for Bitcoin to become mainstream, considering how any centralized party can basically control your coins in one way or the other. People who want to use crypto should also realize and learn how to be independent. On the other hand, I guess it is inevitable that the majority of people will view Bitcoin or crypto as an asset and have no problem with third-party custody like what they've with stocks or shares. Fortunately, there is no law that forces people to use banks if they want to use Bitcoin. If that happens things will be so terrible for almost everyone.",

Usually, banks do not want to get involved with cryptocurrency users, and even they freeze crypto users' accounts in some countries. So, after hearing such news, people think yay, this is something good. The problem is, we don't know the main concept of Bitcoin and we are missing the system even after a decade.

Everything that helps to popularize Bitcoin and mass adoption, moves it away from a P2P use outside of banks and states. I agree with you here, because most people who have heard about Bitcoin still think that there are some elements of ponzi schemes and internet fraud, and in the event that it appears as something that banks trust, they might change their opinion. So, on the one hand, people might start to look at BTC as something positive, but on the other hand, if we take into account the custody service and the risks of the same, and the fact that everyone who invests in BTC in that way actually supports it only as an investment, and not as currency.When you mention hardware wallets, the recovery service that was designed by guys from France is based on the same idea, to help their mothers and grandmothers use cryptocurrencies more easily by sharing their seeds with everyone and everything because they will most likely lose them. In my opinion, all these ideas promoted by various \"crypto geniuses\" such as Ledger, CZ, or in the specific case banks, go in the direction of telling the average person that he is too stupid to be his own bank and that someone should still be trusted to keep confidential information for him.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on November 21, 2023, 05:30:53 AM~snip~People still consider banks as their most trusted place to store their money. Banks have been building this trust for a very long time, so people trust them for that reason - but most people also simply do not see an alternative to banks and actually have no choice but to trust them, even if they have a bad opinion of them. Banks are, of course, much simpler and, from a security point of view, more favorable for the average person, and of course they have insurance even when someone robs them, or when someone steals your bank card and spends everything from your account.",

I had a job and had to open a bank account to receive my salary. I resigned from my job a couple of years ago, and to be honest, I never kept any money in my account. I had to open another bank account because I wanted a dual currency credit or debit card to do international transactions when I visited outside of my country. I already experienced some bad things with my bank, but this topic is not about that. Insurance things never worked out in my country. It's true that even though I don't want to use the bank, I now have no other choices. I cannot get crypto debit cards due to the government restrictions in my country.

People have already asked crypto users not to store their Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in centralized exchanges, and now there is an updated version of it: banks. Could you please point out one positive side that banks provide but centralized exchanges do not provide? You pointed out the seed safety by giving your asset access to others.  Isn't it like you gave your Bitcoin to someone else and will ask him to send it to you whenever you want? Also, you are giving him fees to hold your Bitcoin. The Bitcoin is yours, but you do not control them. Still, you call it safety.",
