I have choosen my coins and tokens by the fact they have: Real world use case: When i came in i was told buy coins with actual real world use case. I tried to find those but so far i haven't found any real world adoption for anything other than permissionless transfer of wealth that's been done with bitcoin from the start. Maybe some smart contracts can be useful but they have not been adopted in any significant scale. There's potential in many of them, but most of them are now going to be adopted ever. And even their devs know this, yet they can't really say it as they want to sell their snake oil. I a still looking for even one that might be adopted.Good tokenomics: This i am still using as a reason to buy. Issuance rate needs to be sustainable, and distribution needs to be wide and fair. Marketcap needs to be low enough if we are not talking about the coins that already have the necessary net effect to attract developers and keep on growing more.Team: I find this most important, without good team that knows their stuff you are destined to fail. In ideal case i choose professionals that are transparent and know what they are doing. They have coders in lead, their own legal team, and regular amas. Needless to say that i want everyone doxxed. So far every coin or token with anon devs that i have bought have vanished.Right size marketcap: Most money i have made in this game is by finding suitable microcaps, like under $100k. If conditions are right, they can something like to 500k and above really fast, and i can take like 70% of my investment out potentially very fast. Rest of them stay for moonshot. But as a disclaimer i would like to say that while microcaps have have technically most room to grow, they also have highest changes of being rug pulls or slow rug pulls.Trusting a tip from a friend: For some weird reason my newb friends have found some gems. They don't even necessary understand what marketcap means or how to do research. They might have bought because they liked the name. I see no reason buying them but they are making a killng with them. These days i throw some money on what ever they say. That might not be smart but i might as well.Aping in to just tokens that has just been released: By doing this i don't have even the time to do decent research. I try to look everything as fast as i can and hope for the best. With this tactic i have found my best micro caps. I have also been bought into some instant rug pulls.",

One thing I'm also finding on a project is the what kind of project it is and what kind of product are they aiming to make. A good product is one factor that can make a project relevant to the market, as long as the product is inline with the trend, I'm pretty positive that the token value of that token will rise and project will have a massive growth. So far the biggest consideration I'm giving on a project is the project product as I want my next potential altcoin to be suited on future trends.",

And how could this new project could have an edge to fight the old dogs in terms of adoption?What do you think the future trends will be?",

But the risk will also be greater.if you are late for the party of course you will not chase it, you just have to wait if that's possible. Most memecoins nowadays will end up being a scam. After $PEPE's success, many new memecoins emerged from all Blockchain Platforms and in the end they disappeared one by one and deceived many people. Doing detailed research is very necessary, not just waiting to be registered with CEX. Fraudsters will not do that, if their bag is full they will run away without a trace.",

Right now if you look at the top 20 or even top 50, there are projects that have limited supply hence the price is too good right now.Don't like meme coins though, it's that when we here about them, majority of us are late already, but if you want to take risk, then buy it and then HODL till the next break out run that might not happen though.In any case, supply, the people behind, good tokenomics and use case are some of the factors that I look when choosing altcoins.",

As well as whether their products are in line with current trends or, in the next few years, will be breakthroughs in some way.

One of the first things I look at is market value. This value can tell us many things. It also shows that you have exceeded a certain confidence limit. In addition to these, it is also important which teams are working for the coin and the work they have done in the past. The main factor for me is the trust factor.This way I can add coins to my cart, but sometimes I like to take risks. There are times when I add the coin to my cart without any team researching it and even if the market value is very low. This is somewhat up to you.",
