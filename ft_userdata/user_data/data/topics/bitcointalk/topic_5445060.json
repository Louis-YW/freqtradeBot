The part where you said you guys are planning to accept Bitcoin payment in the supermarket: is it that you own a supermarket that you are running while you are still working for another company, or is it that you are working in that supermarket where you are teaching your junior colleague about Bitcoin? When creating a thread, don't be in a hurry to do so; always take your time to draft a good and comprehensive thread that can be well understood by your readers, even if the grammar is not well arranged but should be easy to comprehend. It's obvious to me that you just created this thread in such a hurry. And by the way, telling your co-workers that you invested your salary in Bitcoin without telling them the risks involved is discouraged. When you introduce Bitcoin to people, you should also tell them about the risks involved.",

It’s amusing to know that you love bitcoin so much, you were eager to introduce it to your junior workers without actually knowing what and how to teach them.I think it’s safe to assume that someone who needs advice on what and how to teach someone about bitcoin doesn’t know a lot or nothing at all about bitcoin so I think it’s really strange that someone who doesn’t know a lot about bitcoin would go on to use his income to invest in bitcoin. How then, as the manager of the supermarket do you intend to implement the use of bitcoin for your easy transactions?Some of the questions your junior workers asked seemed quite odd to me. Signing up on the forum isn’t rocket science and we all know there isn’t any criteria needed for someone to signup. What was odd is, why would they ask how someone can be financially independent or succeed through this forum? I’m honestly curious on why they would ask that so if you could make me understand, that would be lovely. Although, I hope you mentioned to them that you can’t be financially independent or succeed through this forum. I do wonder where they got the notion from. I also think you gave them the wrong notion about the forum. It is very easy to be here as you can literally just be here. All you have to do is to follow the unofficial rules like everybody else and you’re good to go. Not so hard right?I do hope your junior workers odd excitement to learn about bitcoin isn’t fake or short lived",

      "body": "Well, I'm trying to see this from bright sight where more new people come to join the crypto community. However, please note that means you have a responsible too to educate them. By this responsibility, you also need to improve your knowledge about cryptocurrency. Strengththen your fundamentals so you guide the new people right. In my opinion, here are some topics that can be shared with them : 1. Introduction to Bitcoin and blockchain technology: Explain what Bitcoin is and how it works, including the concept of blockchain technology.2. Wallets and exchanges: Teach them how to set up a Bitcoin wallet and how to buy and sell Bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange.3. Risk management: Explain the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies and how to manage those risks.4. Technical analysis: Teach them how to analyze cryptocurrency market trends and charts to make informed investment decisions.5. Security: Emphasize the importance of securing their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets by using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and other security measures.6. Community and resources: Introduce them to Bitcoin forums and other online resources where they can learn more and get involved in the cryptocurrency community.Note : please don't just throw them to the forum without giving them a proper understanding about how to mingle here. Good luck.",

Like @Dr.Bitcoin_Strange rightly pointed out you need to take time and arrange your post because we need to understand it before we can learn from it. Arranging your posts in paragraph can also be beneficial. Thank you for introducing Bitcoin to your fellow workers and I hope some of them will pick interest in this remarkable currency. But ensure you don't force them to join the Bitcoin space by your sweet words because they also need to know that the sector also has risks.",

You are the manager of the supermarket and it is like you are the one who told your Boss to accept bitcoin as a means of alternative payment method. If not why is it that other staffs didn't know that the supermarket wants to adopt bitcoin.There are no criteria of joining this forum,so I will advice that you give them the link for them to register,so that they can start learning on their own and don't need to depend on you.

The OP admits he’s a newbie that needs advice on what and how to go about teaching his colleagues about bitcoin, but goes ahead to invest his salary earned in bitcoin. Also, I’m still curious on why his colleagues would think anyone could be financially independent through this forum and how to go about registering. Perhaps along the lines, the discussions must have strayed from teaching about bitcoin to how to attain wealth and financial independence through forums on the web.",

I'm very happy to see that people are adopting Bitcoin as a payment system in their work place. Back to Op, if you really want to teach them about Bitcoin then this forum is the most reliable source of information for their learning. Other than this forum, you may should encourage them to read the white paper of Bitcoin that's freely available at Bitcoin.org, other than these sources you should also tell them to check sites like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko if they want to see charts of Bitcoin and other details about it.The above mentioned sources are most reliable and they are beginner friendly, you should also tell them to learn about Blockchain and Bitcoin as much as possible from these sources before investing their money into it. I hope these resources should be enough for them to learn the basics of Blockchain and Bitcoin.",
