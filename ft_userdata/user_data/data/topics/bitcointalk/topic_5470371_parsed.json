Can you trust a person, either a friend, family or a relative, with 100% complete trust? Let me answer myself first? NO I can't. I can't trust anybody fully 100% anymore because I have seen some though cases.However, almost all of us here have a fiat bank account and some of us have what we call a personal identification number, which refers to an ATM pin that we use for withdrawal or sending funds out, so the question is a bit simple: WHO DO YOU TRUST WITH YOUR BANK ATM PIN? if you have a person that you fully trust with your ATM pin, can you also trust that same person with your seed phrase?",

However, the easiest way we can find out whether our friend can be trusted or not is by lending him a certain amount of money, if he can return the money according to the agreement or provide clarification/logical reasons as to why he is unable to pay off his debt, then Maybe we can trust that person. However, if the person continues to make unclear speculations and continues to avoid us when they collect their debt, it can be concluded that we cannot trust that person.And once again, giving trust is not an easy matter. However, as social creatures we need each other, we cannot do everything just by relying on ourselves, especially in the world of work which requires good teamwork so that a goal can be achieved. And to be able to form good teamwork, that is by trusting each other.",

If I was told that one of my family members or friends of mine did something bad, I would know if he or she can do it or not. We see ourselves, talk together, live together to know one another. But with how life is, you can not give anyone 100% trust, even your dad and mum can not have the 100% trust when you do not even give yourself 100% trust. Anyone that give himself 100% trust is only lying to himself.

Even if I will bet my life on it, nothing bullshit will happen to my private belongings because of that said person I have mentioned.

You can easily change your bank pin, so you may just easily trust someone with it, but you cannot change your seed phrase, so if you give someone, the person will have access to your wallet until that wallet is abandoned. It is not wise to give someone your bank pin, it is more unwise to share your seed phrase with someone friend or even family because trust can always be easily broken, and you cannot guarantee that someone asides you will not betray you.

I do always have that separate savings. I cant really entrust all of the money that i do have because we know that life doesnt have guarantees. Im not assuming for some divorce or breaking up the family since i dont really like for it to happen but since life is nothing certain then you cant really be able to make yourself that too confident that everything would last forever or simply having that no trust but not completely.Speaking about ATM pin and entrusting your PK on your crypto wallet then its not the same. I would rather be entrusting my ATM pin but not my PK in my wallet. This is where my hidden or secret savings been kept in form of crypto or Bitcoin which my wife isnt aware about it and this is why it would really be just that fine that you should really be that keeping it as a secret but on time of emergencies or in need then you do have that back up funds too which is good.",

Well, I did wrote seed phrase somewhere and have told my youngest brother about it just in case of sudden death or unexpected events. Otherwise, I will also not trust anyone. And in fact we should not, a recent scam occur with one a friend, who is scammed by his friend, and the scam was around 85 lac ($30623.96), well, if the amount would not be gone, then he could buy 1+ BTC easily at the current rate. The thing is, he trusted his friend with his bank and allowed him to use it and he withdrew all the funds and flew away to Malaysia, the thing is he was his friend for the last 15 years. I learnt a lot from this, but still scared of the world out there, we can not predict what is going on the other's head, even though, you are so close to them.",

One of them is those people who, even if they don't know 100%, immediately give their full trust to more than their family, relatives, and close friends.These are the people who fall victim to Ponzi schemes, large sums of thousands of dollars that they entrust because of the greed that existed and entered their thoughts, so they gave full trust because of the thought that they would make money immediately or their capital would grow in a short time.Now, I can easily give trust when I know if I love the person and if it is important to me.

I can't trust anybody fully 100% anymore because I have seen some though cases. Trusting someone is based on the individual. There are people who trust so easily that no matter the kind of experience that they have had in the past, they don't allow that to affect how they place people; they still give everyone the benefit of doubt and allow them to prove that they are not worthy of being trusted before they can be distrusted by those people. Me personally, if I'm to talk about trusting someone, I have a limit to who I trust based on what kind of thing I'm putting my trust in them for. When it comes to people who can get work done for me, I have people who I trust in that aspect, and when it comes to anything relating to money, I also have people who can handle that and will not fail me, as I have tested my close friends and relatives and put everyone in their place. Trusting someone is easy, although people are likely to change in no time, but giving them that little trust but still being cautious at the same time won't do much of a great harm that can't be repaired.",
