So we have majority of population at one single place. With increasing population the non renewable resources are disappearing at fast pace. While population is increasing with exponential rate there are counties where birth rate is still very low  like South Korea 0.9 child per women. https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/total-fertility-rateThere is need to control world population since more people means we need more resources, while the resources available on earth are not unlimited.",

But what is the actual solution for natural resources than saying we need less people here?",

People are given birth in Africa without even knowing the exact number of children one person will have; some people in Africa will not stop giving birth unless their respective women are unable to deliver again, which is extremely dangerous. The main issue is that some of them are unable to provide basic needs for these children, which is why the children end up begging on the street for food and other necessities.",

I am not a fan of birth control because most countries that enforced this policy are regretting it. Currently, some nations are depending on others for workers or laborers. The truth is that the earth has enough resources to take care of even a 16million people but these resources are controlled by a few powerful individuals. The case of Africa is a very pathetic one. Africa has abundant resources which means they also need people to tap these resources. But the problem of Africa is not a high population but a bad and corrupt government. If Africa can educate and empower its population, it would become developed. Some people argue that Africans give birth to children they can fend for. But the truth is that if Africans get the assistance citizens of developed nations get from their government basic needs and education wouldn't be a problem for their children. African have always been populated and self-sufficient. But the current set of leaders she has now are specialists in looting and stashing funds in Western banks.",

However those predictions, since Maltus spoke a about the positive checks in population, have usually failed. The resources required to sustain population are subject like everything else to technological advances, and that could include for example the de-salinization of water or better crop growing techniques.",

It's same thing in most of developped countries like Japan, whole Europe and North America, Australia. Birth rate there is between 1-1.5. Such numbers means that population there is getting older there and eventually declining.",

A world that already has enough resources to sustain us all. They should focus on making these natural resources available to citizens rather than on controlling the birth rate, which, in my opinion, is impossible. You can't stop people from marrying and having children; the purpose of marriage is to procreate, and you just want to stop that. Even if the world's population doubles, we'll all survive if our leaders do the right things. What can be expected in a country where the leaders embezzle large sums of money and the majority of the population lives below the poverty line? A country where all of its citizens can receive free education but are still denied their fundamental right to all amenities due to corruption. If the government is unable to assist in providing all of this, it is best individuals limit their births rate to what they can provide and not government enforcing it on any individual. However, the fact is that the larger a country's population, the more manpower it can obtain if used properly.",

Why? Earth has plenty of resources. World population will stabilize itself eventually as resources allow naturally so there isn't a need to step in. China tried the one-child policy already and it was rather dystopian for the government to dictate how many children people could have. \"Population control\" is a concept pushed by elites who view people below them as malignant tumors to Earth. Also pushed by radical environmentalist who believe every human is a pollutant to the environment.",

One factor that helps to decrease population is war,the ongoing war is decreasing the world population because different countries are involved in the war.We were all born into the world to meet our parents managing and controlling these natural resources and there is still more which we can still leave for our grand children. God created the world and made all the natural resources that we are benefiting from. God knows that the resources on earth is enough to take care of more than 30 billion people in  uncountable years,so why are we panicking. He has put us on the best planet which the garden of Eden is on,this garden of Eden means abundant natural resources but this time we must go in search for them.It is only God that can end this world and it is only when the world comes to an end that there will be no more natural resources because God made us in his own image and likeness, therefore it is God responsibility to take care of us through these natural resources because we don't even know how these resources came about.",

So far there are two medical things that researchers have found out that show that such a pill can be on the way in the near future:1. That life is shortened when the DNA becomes shorter through cell division;2. That telomeres become inactive, which allows the DNA in chromosome strands to unravel, causing the chromosome to become unable to divide, thereby causing its death.Right now you can get a product called TA-65, which comes from the astragulus plant, that activates the telomerase enzyme, which activates telomeres, which stops aging... if taken in enough quantity. However, the price is about $600 for a 3-month supply. It's high because of a monopoly on the particular formula, and because no other product comes close in doing the job.So, think about when the population doubles to 16 billion because nobody dies.",

In order for proper education to be provided, a set number of students to be educated and the period of the education must be known. However, the birth rate in some parts of Africa is too high. The annoying part is that the people who give birth uncontrollably are people with insufficient resources to care for the children they burn.",

Okay i see your point but i think having babies all involves a procedure that is well organized and arrange between the both gender because a woman cant just get pregnant and give birth to a baby without a man first implantating the seeds and getting the woman pregnant.So babies are produced by both man and woman",
