  "content": "I have been running a mining pool at home for a while now (MiningCore - LOVE it), and it's used only for home mining (only in-house mining) and I'm interested in trying another pool software.  We mine for fun and we chose in-house for learning, etc.    If money were no object - what would be the very best pool to install and run?  I would need a fully supported pool so it stays updated as new releases come out.  Regardless of all the reasons why NOT to run a pool at home, what is available to purchase?  It seems that finding commercially-available pool software is very elusive and difficult to find.  Current coins we mine for are BTC, BCH, ZEC, DOGE.   Any suggestions?",
