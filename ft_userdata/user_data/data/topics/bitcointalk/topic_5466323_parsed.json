People wey rush connect their wallets na dem suffer dis loss and so far di hacker don drain about $691k worth of digital assets from dis affected wallets. Di tweet has been taken down and e be like say X team don recover di account.Nothing dey free for freetown, make we dey always exercise caution and know di way we dey click links.Make we no authorize third party apps access to wallet wia we get plenty funds or wallet wia we dey use save funds. Di attack dey really convincing because people think say na Vitalik share di link, so if you be di type wey like free things, make you get one empty wallet for airdrops or freebies and after you don confirm say di collection dey legit, you fit move am to a particular destination wallet.",

Keep an eye out for danger and don't believe everything you see on the internet.Hardware 2FASince X doesn't offer support for hardware 2FA yet, I suggest  using the good old authenticator apps like Authy but the \"Allow multi device\" option needs to be turned off so even if hackers get access to the sim sms via sim swap, they still won't be able to access the Authenticator. This ia just am interim solution anyway plus the SMS option for 2FA should be turned off across all sites.",

What I think about this is that he gave his Twitter account officially to someone to manage it for him. Maybe I am correct or not, this is no more new on YouTube and social media. On social media, it is most common on Twitter and people are still falling for it.Quote from: nelson4lov on September 10, 2023, 10:48:28 PMSince X doesn't offer support for hardware 2FA yetTwitter supports hardware authenticator. You will see it under authentication app (not if you click on it, but under it), it is what is referred to as 'security key'. If you have 2FA app on another device, it is secure enough, especially if the device is offline.",

Already Vitalik no be dat kind man to dey post airdrop, the guy no dey do dat kind thing Na just greediness they curse all this things because we get similar cases in the past wey giveaway were been announced on celebrities accounts and people's fall for am wey dem scam many people. This one no different so why people come dey believe all this things.
