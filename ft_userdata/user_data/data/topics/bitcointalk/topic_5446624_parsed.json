Failure!!When we fail,we grow and mature as human beings,we reach deeper meanings and understands ourselves more.I've heard people saying failing hurts and causes emotional guilt,and also inflicts regrets on victims.Failure as much as it hurts,is an important part  of life.In fact,failure is necessary because it's life's great teacher as it molds and shapes our lives.The most successful people in life have failed the most times,like a baby learning to walk,they had to fall down and stand up again.Some persons see failing to be bad or an abomination,but it's only a realistic factor that we should embrace.I'm not saying we should Turn failing to a lifestyle,but failure through it's life's altering lessons makes us better persons.It paves way for new ideas,self discovery,It helps us to be more resilient;the more we fail,the more resilient we become.It makes us to recognize opportunity that were hidden and Opens us up for new possibilities or opportunities that life has to offer,and its through failure that we can learn the greatest lessons that life could teach us.",

From that experience we are learning and moving forward and closer to succeed . Just don't stop and stay progressive and always stay on goals according to your plan. That is why failure is important for you to change and grow.",

And, it's not just about learning from our own failures, but also from the failures of others. The most successful people in life have failed numerous times, and it's through those failures that they were able to learn and improve.Some people might view failure as a bad thing, but I believe that we should embrace it as a realistic factor of life. And, I'm not saying that we should go out and fail intentionally, but when we do fail, we should use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.",

      "body": "Failure is truly very important for many reasons. One way to look at it is by thinking that if you don’t attempt to learn something new because of the fear of failing. Then you hold yourself back from learning and growing from the experience. The key to success also requires the process of failing along the way. If you fail you learn that we can pick yourself up to be better and approach the situation with a strategy. If you expect to be handed down everything to you then you won’t learn the lesson of hard work, dedication, persistence, and value in life. Failure allows us to regroup, and rethink how to better execute a plan for a successful outcome. Having persistence after many times failing is also another key element of success. Because will others have either quit or stop trying, you are only one step closer to success.",

It teaches us the lessons that we gain from our mistakes and acquires wisdom from our experiences. Failure keeps us humble and it always reminds us that there is someone better than us and there's always room for improvement and errors. It also builds our mentality and thinks outside the box to come up with new solutions because we fail at a certain thing. Many successful people fail a lot in their early stages of life but came out in the world with their goals reached. It only means that those failures taught them lessons and lead them to success.",

I agree that failure can help us grow and mature as individuals. Personally, when we fail, it forces us to reevaluate our approach and think creatively about how we can improve next time. In many ways, failure can be seen as a necessary part of the journey to success.I also agree that some of the most successful people in life have failed numerous times before achieving their goals. Also takes persistence and resilience to keep pushing forward despite setbacks. I have one quote \"Failure can also help us to recognize new opportunities and possibilities that we may have overlooked before\"",
