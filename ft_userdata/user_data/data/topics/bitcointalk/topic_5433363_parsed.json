  "content": "Have you played a table soccer game before? And what was your experience so far while playing it?Those of you from my country may not really have a good idea about table soccer, although it is not that a common game that you may found anywhere.My first experience with table soccer was a thing of joy and somehow looking so strange to me because that was the first time I set my eyes on it. It was during my Industrial Training with TotalEnergies formally known as Total E&P at the Total village in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State Nigeria, in 2017 where I served about 1 year and 6 months as an intern. I encountered this game and from then I have picked interest to start playing it. Surprisingly since my stayed over here I haven't seen anyone talk about this game. Hence, I don't know if they have already raised a topic like this. Also, is there any possibility a casino would list the game in their site and if they already listed, could anyone refer me to such site. The image above shows expression about how it looks.The thread is open for discussion.",

It is a fun game and you actually need to have some skills to beat your opponent unless he is a complete moron. However, I never got addicted to that game. It is fun but not addictive at all.I was interested in Ping/pong a lot more. No need to mention, pingpong is a way harder game. It is more fun too and I was definitely addicted to it.",

I didn't even see this suppose to be a soccer game.    Much like an arcade to me. Does anyone gamble among friends with this game? I saw my college schoolmate fight over a game, never took it seriously but they end up not being friends anymore after the fight. I don't see this going to be anything like a casino game.

I feel it is a difficult game to play because one have to be able to control these players using the hands. I feel it would take much practice to master this game. I still prefer the field football games because this table version looks like table tennis. But seeing many person play the game with excitement and even gambling with this game. I wonder how they are able to adapt to this skills in this game. A little dedication can make the game enjoyable.",

It will never be in an online gambling space because literally, the bets are only against those who are playing it physically.It's not like they can create a bot that will go against you or a pair against the system. Waiting for another player online to be your teammate will be crucial as it may take some time.",

The reason why no one is discussing about this is because there isn't really much of an interest in this at all, but there are huge tournaments all over the world regarding foosball. IIRC, Nitrogensports.eu offered some lines for the World Foosball Championship or whatever it's called back then. The lines and the odds are pretty funky because the favorites are just the same people every year and the outcome of the tournament is very predictable. Like pool, I think game providers can create this game for PvP gambling. But of course, the viability of creating such a game should still be considered and whether or not there is huge interest on it.",

I just imagine how those sticks rods are being controlled by one person very fast with players and aiming towards a goal without getting tired easily. I wish to have an experience of it in the coming years. Where I stay people don’t greatly value entertainment sports like this, but recent developments have brought indoor sports Center where one can easily have a good leisure time with friends and family, looking forward to try it soon. Hope it will be as nice to play as I see people in movies have great time playing it with smiles of their faces. I don’t know if such game is even considered in worldwide Olympic indoor games, if it is, then it’ll have great use and adoption by people all around the world like other indoor sport games.",
