  "content": "Yes guys, oftentimes you hear people say connecting to someone else's electrum server will leak your public key information.As I am running electrs as an electrum server implementation, I am asking you guys how public key leaks?I mean, nothing is stored on my server(at least I didn't manage to find it).Or, let me put it this way:Is there a way that I can find out the public key information from whom is connecting to my electrum server?Or, perhaps it is electrs as one of the electrum implementations that I am using doesn't keep records or logs, whereas other implementations like EPS, or ElectrumX does keep logs?",

It does not send that information anywhere but you as the server operator can still see it.I *think* electrs does the same. But I never looked. -Dave",

It's all open source software... It's not like a node operator is going to tell you they modified the sourcecode of their node software to log everything.So, even if you know electrumx (or electrs, or....) and you have actually read the complete sourcecode and you're satisfied a default \"electrumx\" node cannot log anything you don't accept, you should still realise somebody could run a modified version of \"electrumx\".On top of this, electrs needs a reverse proxy if you want to add tls, this is one more level where log files can be created.Now, the fact does remain that private key(s) or seeds are not sent to the electrum node, so a node operator can harm your privacy, but he cannot steal your actual funds (unless there's an undiscovered bug).",

My understanding, however, is that Electrum will connect to around 8-10 servers in order to download block headers from them all (in order to avoid a single server returning incorrect or malicious data), but only one of these servers will be used to query the addresses within the wallet and to relay transactions. All 10 servers will be able to see your IP address, but the one main server will also be able to see everything you are querying.Tor can actually make things more risky. Some of the guides for using Tor with Electrum set it up in such a way that you are only connecting to a single server in order to maximize privacy. This obviously means you are downloading the block headers and all your wallet information from only a single source, which increases the risks of being fed incorrect or malicious information.",

You would have to keep a local log but it would make some analysis a bit more difficult. That or as others have said, run your own. As many of us have pointed out many times you can easily do it for under $100 in hardware.

You would have to keep a local log but it would make some analysis a bit more difficult. Not very.The protocol that Electrum uses isn't designed to enhance privacy but quite the opposite instead. It doesn't use any methods to try to obfuscate your data whatsoever. It is totally possible for the server to jump from one to another with each address but that is ridiculously inefficient and gets more inefficient as the number of addresses increases. It does nothing against topological leaks given the limited number of servers and the possibility that a malicious agent runs multiple servers. An example of a wallet that does this would be Wasabi but it is done with a combination of BIP 158 but Electrum just sends the Scripthash straight up.",

You would have to keep a local log but it would make some analysis a bit more difficult. It would also require to change the way requests are made. As seen in the log, the SPV wallet requests a whole bunch of addresses at once. In my case (Sparrow), it sent one request per wallet, each of which included all the addresses the software already knows are funded + an additional 5 or something like that. So even if each request went to a different server, the addresses in each wallet would have been linked; just no link between wallets.It's very implementation-specific, of course. But I don't suspect other wallets to create a new request for every single address. It would incur too much overhead.Quote from: DaveF on August 04, 2022, 01:27:00 PMThat or as others have said, run your own. As many of us have pointed out many times you can easily do it for under $100 in hardware. And with all the pre-packaged / pre-configured setups out there it is not that difficult for a novice to do.YES YES YES! [Guide] How to run a Bitcoin Core full node for under 50 bucks!",

I assume most people would trust themselves to not send themselves malicious data. Quote from: ranochigo on August 04, 2022, 08:47:35 PMIt does nothing against topological leaks given the limited number of servers and the possibility that a malicious agent runs multiple servers.Exactly this. It is trivial to run an Electrum server. An average home computer running a full node could run multiple servers simultaneously, meaning a large blockchain analysis firm could easily run the majority of public servers if they wanted (and indeed, this could very well already be the case). Even if you only ran a single server, then simply over time you could collect enough data to link addresses from most wallets simply by matching the IP of all the requests your server does receive.And given how trivial it is to run an Electrum server, no reason not to just spin up your own one.",

It is more secure, more private and even easier to set up.You basically just want to create such an entry in /etc/tor/torrc.Code:HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/electrs_hidden_service/HiddenServiceVersion 3HiddenServicePort 50001 127.0.0.1:50001ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowedThen after restarting Tor, you can retrieve the onion v3 URL and type it into all of your SPV wallets.Code:sudo systemctl enable tor.servicesudo service tor restartsudo cat /var/lib/tor/electrs_hidden_service/hostname",
