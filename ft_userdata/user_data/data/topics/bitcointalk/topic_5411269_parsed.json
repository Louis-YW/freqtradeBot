  "content": "Tether states that it will only freeze private wallet addresses if expressly requested by any confirmed law enforcement agent or agency. To far, no agents or agencies have contacted Tether to make such a request, despite the fact that Tether has been in communication with relevant entities.“Even if Tether recognizes suspicious activities on such an address, completing a freeze without the verified instruction of law enforcement and other government agencies might interfere with ongoing and sophisticated law enforcement investigations,” says Tether.For more information, visit https://mycryptoparadise.com/despite-us-treasury-sanction-tether-says-it-will-not-freeze-tornado-cash-addresses/.",
