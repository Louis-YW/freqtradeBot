Are you mining in your home or host them on hosting mining farm?But at current prices of bitcoin, the models before A10 Series should have been shut down, right?Canaan Official Online Store: shop.canaan.io",

What's the model of your first Avalon miner? I haven't had the chance to operate one yet, due to home mining limitations.Would really appreciate something with the efficiency of your 12th gen miners, but in a smaller 'package'.For instance, instead of $3,333 for 96TH and 3420W, something for $1600, pushing 48TH at 1710W would be a lot more accessible.Or maybe even $800, 24TH/s, 850W. This would directly compete with Apollo BTC in terms of price, but manage roughly 8x higher hashrate at just 3x the power cost.I do think that there's a market for sub-2kW and especially sub-1kW miners. Easier to cool at reasonable temperatures, less issues with existing power system and lower costs when mining at a loss.",

To be honest, A8 and A9 Series has good reputation for steady performance on a large scale. But we can't guarantee the used miner has the same performance as the brand new directly from our factory. If you bought the new one, you can get the afterservice from us in 360 days.Hope you may choose Avalonminer in future.",
