In addition to this, following are also needed1) Support for multiple crypto coins :  The payment gateway should give the flexibility to buyers to pay in number of cryptos. Different people have their own preferences and it increases conversion rate for sellers.2) Instant release of payments : The payment gateway should allow instant release of payments for the sellers. This will ensure that they get the funds on time and can increase the money to manage inventory or spend more on marketing.",

Prime security - Security is the most primary thing people should consider as to choose a payment gateway.It's a common belief that most of these platforms have got the best of their security for their system. If there's a way to know their security provider then that's better if they disclose it but most likely, they won't.And they're of great security until they're breached. We saw big companies and not just limited to payment gateways but anything related to crypto, many have been attacked and hacked.So, talking about security, yeah there could be those companies that are having a prime and tight security but always think of it that they're secured until the unexpected happens.",

BTCPay server is quite popular even though it only supports BTC, which means many businesses are fine with their features at the moment. They also support plug-ins that help with fiat integration, plus they are open source that allows businesses to customize the application depending on their needs. Don't sacrifice security and reliability with extra altcoins to play with.If you are running a popular platform and considering adding crypto payment with good control, it can be an option to just run BTCPay server without paying extra fees. Another good thing is that you can simply add another payment processor to process your altcoin payment if that is really necessary, without giving up any control over your BTC payment processor.",
