  "content": "Astronomia Solar is its name, and it is the first of it's kind, it was engineered by the expert watchmakers - Jocob & Co.This luxury watch sells for $400,000 per piece and there are only 25 pieces of them that will ever be available, it was made to be just as scarce as Bitcoin is.Quote from: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-designed-watch-sells-for-400000/Being a limited-edition timepiece, the Astronomia symbolizes the early beginnings of Bitcoin and how it evolved from being a theory to becoming a pivotal building block of today’s financial system.Such concept also adds to its overall appeal to investors and traders who have the wherewithal to shell out a stupid amount of dough to satisfy their needs.Noticeably, the 444 components and two rotating prongs of the Astronomia are eye-catching. The first platform consists of the microchip main plate which resembles that of the brain of Satoshi Nakamoto and the other is composed of its arms as well as other intricate moving parts.The watch is able to complete a rotation for 10 minutes which is in fact the time you need to clock in when waiting for changes in Bitcoin price. The clock dial looks the same with the motherboard fan found in ASICs that mine BTC.The hands of this black Astronomia Bitcoin watch is made of 18K rose gold.So guys, what do you think?, if you have the money, will you splash $400,000 to acquire this timepiece, or are you letting it pass?, let's discuss. Find out more about this amazing timepiece from quoted link above.",

It's a much better piece than any of those weird-looking jpegs....I mean NFTs hehe.$400K looks like an average price for Astronomia Solar watches if you look at their other creations https://www.chrono24.com/jacobco/astronomia--mod2717.htm",

      "body": "Soon we can see these on the Bitcoin museum. This is completely good for the richest. Yesterday only read about a sports personality who wears a watch of worth $225k during a photoshoot. It was into discussion whether he owns it, because in many occasions it's been seen in his hands. Even our mobile Phone shows the time, beyond that what's the need of such an expensive time watching. Maybe personalities like the one I read might buy it.",

I haven't worn a watch in many years, and buying it to leave it in a drawer, I don't see it. If it is as an \"investment\" it seems to me that there are many more interesting options than that. Surely it will have buyers, and more being limited option but that type of buyers moves in levels of wealth that we have virtually no one on the forum.",

How so? Though I'm not saying that this watch will stay consistently at this price range, there's only 25 of the exact watch, and if replicas would decrease the value of the original watch, then Rolex's, AP's, JLC's, Patek's, etc would be cheap now — but they aren't, because the markets highly value the original ones.",

There are more expensive wristwatches that people have spent more on. Take for instance;-Drake’s Richard Mille RM 69 that reportedly cost $750,000.-Christiano Ronaldo’s Franck Muller Round cost $1.5 million.-Eric Clapton’s Patek Philippe 2499 cost $3.5 million.-Jay-Z’s Hublot Big Bang cost $5 Million. etcsource",

I don't suppose all those items mentioned in the Youtube video are just mare ordinary items without worth   QuoteThe black DLC titanium Astronomia Solar Bitcoin is interspersed with details linked to the Bitcoin universe. A Bitcoin currency logo. A flying tourbillon. A yellow sapphire sun, a diamond moon and a golden Earth. A rocket to reach the stars. So I believe those that will be investing in this piece are definitely going to be doing that because they know it can bring in profits in later years.",

What the whales hope is perhaps at least under scrutiny to have a code to access the wallet to Bitcoin. Much more sophisticated technology. Instead of collecting gold in the form of Bitcoin, it does not mean they own Bitcoin. for collectors, this may be a coveted item, but for whales and investors, it is clear that what is being hunted is genuine Bitcoin that has fluctuating value and can produce. Isn't that quite reasonable? at an hourly price of $400,000, investors thought they could own a large amount of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin's current price of $400,000, we certainly have +20 Bitcoins. It's no surprise that neither whales nor Bitcoin investors is interested.",

Although some may be surprised that a watch can cost so much, people who are extremely rich can afford much more expensive things, because even that amount does not mean much to someone, just as $40 or $400 does not mean much to me or you.Bitcoin watches are nothing new, there have been many such watches over the years, as we can see in the next thread -> Bitcoin Watches",

The features and design of the watch are very similar to that of Bitcoin, making it a treasurable collection. But, I am not too passionate about expensive accessories or designer outfits. But my friends always remind me that it is because I can't afford them now. But wearing a $400,000 wristwatch means that you must have all the security to guide you from robbers. This is because if people know that you are wearing a watch that the price can turn someone into a millionaire in my locality, they would want to get it by all means.https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-designed-watch-sells-for-400000/",

It's not even a watch if I saw someone wore Astronomia Solar, but much more like a luxury stuff without any utility.Honestly if someone bought this watch, they're actually buy gold, not Bitcoin. If they're creating the watch with Bitcoin private key inside like physical Bitcoin, I think it would be a great idea.",

At the current price, 1bitcoin = 20k $, 400,000 $ is equivalent to 20 bitcoins, but if you only have 50 bitcoins and spend 1/2 of the money to buy a watch, it is not suitable, too wasteful. I think anyone with a few hundred bitcoins or more can afford this limited edition watch.After all, this is just a watch made of gold and made in limited numbers which is why it is so expensive. Owning this watch only confirms a person has money, or likes to collect, but cannot confirm who owns it is btcoiners and cannot provide the same value as owning bitcoin.",
