  "content": "The lies about \"If invested $1000 during IPO for MSFT you would have made $1.6m\"We had been promised we can all achieved common prosperity, an utopia society, investors just have to invest as little as $1000, and everybody each of you can achieve retirement and freedom. Everybody win, a win and win ponzi, nobody could loss, not a zero sum. YES, an ultimate life goal of making all guy rich and nobody get left behind and get poorer, an utopian life!Let’s make some most ideal outcome, assume we achieve the bestest ever outcome, we have US 200m population in 1986, say 10% population is 20m capable adult invested each $1000 into msft, each of them to be worth $1.6m after some 40 years... let’s do some simple maths.In 1986, Microsoft launch the IPO.$1000 times 20,000,000 investor, capital would be sum up to $20 billions...In 2023, everybody win, we all achieved common prosperity, everybody retired in this utopia society because the president said so, thus you do not ask why!$1.6m times 20,000,000 investor, $32,000,000,000,000! $32 trillions! When I look at the market cap of the Microsoft today it’s just worth some $3.2 trillions. Which is 90% shortfalls!I can’t imagine how are Microsoft going to pay each investor $1.6m, if each of them invested during IPO, which would sum up to $32 trillions to make everybody achieve utopia life. It’s bizarre calculation. Obviously the ideal utopia society is never possible from be very beginning, it’s never possible to get the $1.6m from just $1000 no matter what they promised, it has to be some of the most lucky person in the world to be entitled the one who get into the IPO.Apparently this game have to be rigged to make the payroll look possible, with a lot of creative calculations, not all guy could be invested on the IPO price, some investors have to loss to make up for the gainer, apparently 90% would be the loser to make up the 10% gainers which seem very fair. Because $3.2 trillions compare to $32 trillions idealistic outcome. Idk what to say about the 401k pension fund, it sound like a utopian wishful thinking at best.But I don’t care about all the buzz, instead just toss all the capital into property, obviously it look to me there is so few property investors that could possibly loss money, I’m confident to say 90% property investors still in profit while 10% are losers (included wars torn property in Ukraine). It is unthinkable, maths is absolute, zero sum, obviously we got what we pay for, we pay for ponzi we get ponzi result.",

I mean sure you wouldn't have made enough to retire maybe, but you could have invested on IPO or whatever the lowest it was, and then sold it at the highest it has ever been, and retire with that money probably. But the problem is that we do not have enough shares to go around the whole world, which means that it could be something else, I can do it with Microsoft, you could do it with apple, the other could do it with google, some did it with bitcoin and so forth. Which is why it could work, just not for a single company but as a general idea.",

I had yet to read an article that suggest otherwise. Tbh every article on the internet wouldn’t hestitated when it come to advocating turning $1000 into $1m in some of the hottest trades. The most overused narratives such as $1000 in blue chip IPO is too common. I couldn’t yet understand the trick behind diversified into some other investment. Obviously, the aforementioned curiosity is also a good reason I would likely loss more money trying into the new venture to learn yet another losing endeavour.",

Part of the reason is maybe because when the bubble dust it took over a decade for Microsoft to break its ATH.But it was pretty much the equivalent of buying Bitcoin early. Just like buying Tesla when it went public. One thing you need to keep in mind is that most would of sold with a 100% or 300% gain. Many never held it this long since IPO.

That includes price appreciation and dividends.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/how-much-a-1000-dollar-investment-in-microsoft-at-its-ipo-is-worth-now.htmlI think their claim revolves around DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) of microsoft stock from IPO over the course of many years.Where profits earned from microsoft dividends would be reinvested to buy more MSFT stock, over the course of decades.",

Adjusting for the stock splits, you'd actually have 13,536 shares today with a cost basis of $0.0729 per share.Given Microsoft now trades at $238.73 per share, that translates to a return of 327,401%.In dollar terms, that $1,000 investment in 1986 would be worth a whopping $3.23 million today.And you can add on top of this also the dividends.Really, you could have been just researching a little before posting...",

Now, from this many of them will still retain and believe in the project to gain more money. They will do it eventually if company does it properly. This cycle will keep repeating itself and peeps will actually come and go along the way. Thus, the output that is mentioned by OP is inaccurate. There are always buyer and sellers on the market.
