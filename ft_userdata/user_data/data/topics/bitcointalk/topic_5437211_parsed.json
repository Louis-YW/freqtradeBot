      "body": "Taproot is the “newest” version, but some exchanges/services may not support it, AFAIK. While nowadays everyone seems to support Native Segwit, the second “best”.If you can don’t mind using a second wallet when not supported, go with Taproot and Native Segwit as backup. Otherwise go with Native Segwit.All options go through the Bitcoin native network, so if the exchange sees the address as valid, you won’t have issues. Just choose “Bitcoin”.",

But you are free to use other three.Legacy will cost you high fees to pay where Native Segwit, Segwit will reduce your fees up to 60% if I am not wrong. So use one of it. I guess the Native Segwit has the lowest fees to pay for a transaction.When you are using an address to deposit, make sure it's either starting with 1xxxx, bc1xxxx or 3xxxx. All are bitcoin address format except Taproot.",

Only transaction fee varies per network and Native Segwit address is currently the best because it was widely supported. I have this kind of confusion when I first create on my ledger. I mistakenly use the segwit with native segwit. I really don’t know what’s the difference but I preferred the bc1 wallet address for a segwit wallet address because that’s same format with exchange to avoid conflict.",

If you have a legacy address or a native segwit address, both options can send to each other. In simple terms, the only difference is the address format.You can send from bc1… to 1… or to 3…, just like you can send from 1… to bc1… or 3…ETH is ERC20 only. If you send a token from the BSC network or MATIC network, you won’t see the coins as they are in a different blockchain.",

Choose native segwit in Ledger, and choose BTC(SegWit) when withdrawing from Binance. These are the same thing.Quote from: TryNinja on January 29, 2023, 01:59:25 PMThere is no wrong network.When talking about Binance, unfortunately there is. When you try and withdraw bitcoin from Binance, you are told to select a network, and are given 5 options. Only two of those options are actually on the bitcoin network - the \"bitcoin\" and the \"segwit\" options. You are also given the option to \"withdraw\" your bitcoin on Ethereum or two different BNB chains. Obviously in these cases you aren't withdrawing bitcoin at all, but withdrawing some pegged or wrapped centralized shitcoin token owned and controlled 100% by Binance. And obviously Binance makes the fee for withdrawing bitcoin ridiculously high, while the fee for withdrawing on one of their centralized scamchains is 100 times smaller (although why not zero since it is completely centralized?), in order to trick newbies in to leaving their bitcoin on Binance and getting some worthless token instead.You can see this here if you scroll down to BTC: https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFee",

And unfortunately many newbies do this because they just see the lower fee, and don't understand that what they are withdrawing is not bitcoin at all, because Binance deliberately obfuscates this information.Quote from: cryptosize on January 29, 2023, 06:11:55 PMIt's still 50k sats for SegWit, 20k sats for legacy addressesLmao. Make it make sense.  So although a segwit output is on average 3 vbytes smaller than a legacy one, apparently they need to charge an extra 30,000 sats because reasons. They are quite literally just stealing from their users. Why on Earth does anyone use this piece of shit exchange?",
