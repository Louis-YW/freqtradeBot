  "content": "\"Jian Wen, 42, was involved in converting Bitcoin into assets like luxury houses.A former takeaway worker found with Bitcoin worth more than £2bn was jailed for six years and eight months for a crime linked to money laundering on Friday. Jian Wen, 42, from Hendon, in north London, was involved in converting the currency into assets including multi-million-pound houses and jewellery.At Southwark Crown court in March, she was convicted of entering into or becoming concerned in a money laundering arrangement.The Metropolitan Police said at the time of the conviction the seizure was the largest of its kind in the UK.\"When I came across this news on a bbc.com website I couldn't believed it but was moved to share over here to know her involvement as when she started making investment to have worth almost €2b worth in bitcoin, most times it's hard to believe story like this.The floor is open for discussion (if this already discussed then remind me to Lock this topic).",

How did she start? Did she just hold for a really long time? And a lot of other questions. Anyway it’s a shame to have finally all that amount of money just to go to jail.",

I really don't know whether this woman laundered money or did she just buy luxury homes and jewelry worth millions of pounds sterling?There is nothing in the news that indicates that she robbed an exchange or another service or committed fraud. There are no details about the source of her money. Perhaps her crime is only that she converted this large amount of Bitcoin into the equivalent of about 2 billion pounds sterling, which is a very large sum that would attract the attention of the police.",

So basically she's a front for the operation and they've chosen UK as the place to clean their money through this means, is that correct? 61k bitcoin is just a really huge number, I do feel like there's more to this than just a syndicate and I think that there's a Chinese government involvement here because there's no way that they're letting this 2 billions pounds worth of bitcoin get laundered unnoticed, I think that it's the Chinese government that's got this operation when you try and dig through it.Quote from: Sebas.tian on May 31, 2024, 04:32:46 AMI think, she has some assets she sold some years ago that gave her some huge amount of capital to invest in Bitcoin, that made her to achieved the €2b  worth of Bitcoin.

Money laundering is happening since a long time and fiat is the main instrument for such illegal acts. There are countries like Switzerland, Cyprus or Cayman Islands whose economy is built on laundered money. No one talks about them!

Money laundering is almost the opposite of tax evasion: criminals with illegal money want to pay taxes, so they can spend their money. Having 2 billion pounds in stolen money doesn't do you any good if you can't spend it, which means you need to make it look as if you're the legal owner of that criminal money. That's why they launder money, and that includes paying taxes. Even if half of it would go to taxes, having 1 billion that you can spend is still a lot better than having 2 billion which you can't spend.",

In fact, from observation, most of these offshore accounts and business owners are the perfect way to clean up their dirty money.  The car wash business is also a good example, as there is no price control of how much can be the maximum amount one can wash a single car, so you can increase the amount to any undoubtable number and make it official. Big club houses are also perfect businesses that money launderers use; all that's needed is a registered business good accountant to cover up all the mess, and everything will be put in place unless there is a loophole that can also drag back attention to the place.",
