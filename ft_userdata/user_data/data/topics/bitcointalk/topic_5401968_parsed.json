What conclusion would you like to reach? personal data in terms of anonymity? Fiat is distinctly different in context, updates, and controls. It should be without the need to ask anything, the answer for members on the forum is as much as possible while keeping personal data from being exposed and scattered. As for fiat engagement with the community, it's fine, you don't need to hook it up because the bitcoin system isn't centralized by the institutions that collect the data.",

If your merchant requires you to give him personal info to make a purchase with cash and you're obtuse enough to give it to him, it doesn't worsen cash's anonymity.

Bitcoin and another measures mentioned above help decreasing your exposition, but don't prevent you from  being tracked, unless you don't have any IDs and live hidden in the jungle, eating and drinking from the nature.If you manage a household, you have bills in your name, so you are already being monitored. If you have a job, you aren't anonymous anymore and probably it will be a must to have a decent communication tool, being indispensable to have a whatsapp or telegram account. If you access youtube (I believe nobody with internet access live without youtube) you are being tracked.The problem is the government is never satisfied with the level of accessibility they have over citizens' lives. They always want more and more, being totally abusive and tyrant at some point. It's regards these levels of privacy and pseudo-anonymity people should worry in maintaining in my opinion.",

This is useful in terms of criminal security. But would you like to have more anonymity in your life, so that information is not collected, where you eat, live, etc.?Now listen carefully, we might be a bunch of people who are advocating for privacy and less regulation, but we're not stupid folks. We know - it's common knowledge - that you need to have a certain degree of controls inside the system to stop it from being abused by criminals (governments unfortunately have not considered scammers yet). Such controls include KYC, declaring where you got your coins from if you are transferring coins in 5 & 6 figures, even a certain degree of analysis to prevent (once again) criminals from abusing the system by tracking their funds.But any surveillence technology that's applied broadly, upon everyone, does not achieve any results. There is simply too much data being collected for all of the personnel to analyze. In some cases we are talking billions of records. The result of which naturally is that some of the actual criminals manage to get away through the huge morass of data that needs to be parsed. (Somebody needs to tell that [again] to the NSA.)So the solution is a sort of compromise - surveillence of targeted (small enough to process) populations of people where there's a high concentration of criminals abusing the system. Concentration getting low in some places? Then keep the criminals in your database and erase the rest of the population from your monitors. Another locality is gettng high rates of crime? Track them accordingly. It's not that hard to understand.It will also silence the people who keep saying that BTC is only a \"criminal's technology\".",

In some scenarios, it's worth mentioning that VPN + Tor may give additional benefits[1]. Though, I generally agree that if someone is not having a strong enough reason to use it with a VPN, they shouldn't combine it. Even if you trying to hide from your ISP from using Tor or circumvent Tor censorship, I think using a bridge will give more benefits.[1] https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN",
