Any serious buyers or brokers with serious clients, I look forward to your response and DMs for these amazing opportunities with small chains!No it is not. You're here trying to scam people and I am 100% sure of that. Every single person who has been in the P2P and OTC market for a while knows that the crypto holder MUST prove they have the funds and you are NOT doing the ONLY thing that is a MUST.Why would I prove the funds of my client here? You're not a serious buyer. Why would I expose my clients' funds in this forum, totally unsolicited? What part about PRIVACY being a main utility of OTC peer-to-peer trading do you not understand?A serious buyer can engage me and start the process listed in offers above - as some already have. In the process - if you even bothered to read any of them - you see that wallets are exchanged and control of coin are proven IN THE PROCESS. Your whinging and fingerpointing without knowing how the process works reflects on you, not me. No broker in their right mind would give you their client's info just because you think everything's a fraud from your vast experience in messageboard grinding. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm disengaging from your narrative so I can focus on real, experienced buyers.Hey, I gonna try to help you come back to reality..1. You don't have any clients.2. Yes he is not a serious buyer he disturb everyone on this section of this forum.3. Your not a broker.4. You don't have any clients.5. Neither of you have anything worth flashing.6. You don't have any clients.7. You did the baddest scam attempt in the book yet. a to good to be true deal. Only that deserves a \"🤣\" so here you go 🤣.8. Now you are excused. Pai Pai!9. You don't have any clients.Did it work?  Yep, it worked: Way to earn that Ignore badge, buddy. Go live in your \"reality\" in the void without me. #FOH I swear, all these broke clowns in here. My bad for trying something different with people who *should* actually know better. I have created more successful business in my life then you probably can count to and also some unsuccessful of course but if you never try and just sitting home and complain like you and think your smarter then  the rest of the world, you will always stay as a loser. People like you basing their entire life on lies so the lies became the truth xD. You swear nothing and you have nothing yes I know. crawl under your stone now and eat noddles for the rest of this month to. If it is something I really dislike so is it lazy cunts that blame everyone else for their shitty life and think they have the right to steal other's people belongings. The hunt never stops!🛑🚫 No cash No crypto 🚫🛑EDIT: alterra57 If you bother me again I will send you a bill.",

Those are just some off the top of my head. But there are plenty of legitimate reasons for miners and owners of bitcoin in bulk to work outside traditional exchanges. Alright, that's not enough.

Unlike your broke - and now ignored - self, I HAVE closed deals in my life, including multiple 100,000+ BTC deals. But go off, king - right into the void because I can't hear you anymore, and I don't speak Loser. Again, thanks for reminding me of the utter mistake it was thinking there would be more than messageboard grinding, sidelined mouth-breathers in this forum capable and competent enough to complete any bitcoin deal of substance. Leaving this up as a cautionary tale to others to not waste their time thinking they can find a real deal here.",

Leaving this up as a cautionary tale to others to not waste their time thinking they can find a real deal here.Find me an idiot with 50-200-500m USDT in his wallet, I confirm he is doing MC business cross border, he doesn't need BTC. Why do these \"sellers\" want to sell but don't accept FIAT and reputable escrow? Do you have two last brain cells to help you think rationally or not? I can't believe it's 2024 and dumb brokers still believe this crap…. I see these offers from multiple sources, all stupid brokers copy paste into telegram/linkedin/whatsapp groups and hope to find a buyer for $5 billion LMAO, you have no idea if the seller exists, you are just repeating what the \"mandate\"/seller rep says to you...The OTC coins are gone, but your sellers sell with a 10% discount lolhttps://i.imgur.com/0ANojZa.pngHere is the monthly volume for the ten BTC ETFs - THEY ALL buy with FIAT, you idiot!https://imgur.com/TmJJBk8https://cryptodaily.co.uk/news-in-crypto/bitcoinist:bitcoin-spot-etfs-hits-150-billion-trading-volumeStart using your last few brain cells instead of talking bossy.",
