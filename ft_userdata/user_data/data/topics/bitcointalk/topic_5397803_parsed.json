On each Earth, there are a trillion people. Each person has a trillion computers. Each computer generates a trillion keys a second. All these computers have been creating a trillion keys per second since the birth of the universe 13.7 billion years ago. 10^12 * 10^12 * 10^12 * 10^12 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 13.7 * 10^9 = 4.3*10^65. This means thay they would have so far generated approximately 0.0000000004% of all private keys.If you are worried about someone using such a site to stumble across your private key, then you should be absolutely terrified of dying from a meteor strike, shark attack, or lightning strike, all of which are exponentially more likely to happen. You should also be terrified about someone guessing your credit card number and stealing all your fiat, since for every possible credit card number there is somewhere in the region of 10 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion possible private keys.",

Whenever someone gets their coins stolen, it's because of malware, phishing, and some dumb mistakes like using brainwallets. The idea that you can guess a private key comes from people who don't know math and who think that if something is possible to happen, than it can realistically happen or already happened.",

If I can generate a random key, what's there to stop the generator from generating an existing private key and then I'll have access to somebody else's wallet. There was even a guy who was doing it, generating new keys in hope that one of them would happen to be full and posting the results here on the forum. You can find the thread if you spend a while.As far as I remember he spent a lot of time doing it and never even got a few bucks out of it. I think he got some spent addresses but all of them were empty already. If it was that easy some of those people would've got a hit on Satoshi's coins already. Imagine getting a Binance wallet or something. Sorry, but your chances of winning a lottery are higher.",

It's easier to keep one thing than two and more because the more you have, the more space and attention you need to keep.The chance of someone stealing your keys that way is as low as the chance of you owning a magic power.In statistics, we can say that the probability of the sun turning into human is zero, i.e. P(x) = 0. We can certainly say that it will never happen but in reality, the P(x) = 0 doesn't mean that it's fundamentally impossible to happen. Sometimes you should really forget all this stuff.",

I guess it's easier to understand it if you compare it to something else.The probability of a human to walk through a wall is also virtually impossible, but not impossible based on quantum tunnelling:Quote from: https://twitter.com/i/events/972881765642551297the probability of a human of tunnelling is e^-10^35.Would you try walking through walls? of course not.
