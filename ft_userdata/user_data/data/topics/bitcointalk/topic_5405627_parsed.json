  "content": "Update:Quote from: dragonvslinux on October 27, 2022, 02:39:12 PMAfter four months of consolidation near the lows, the Weekly RSI has finally managed to break back above 37.5, level previous identified as critical back in 2018 and 2020 in order to confirm a trend reversal.As price today retests $22.5K, $500 short of the 200WMA, the Weekly RSI is now attempting to leave oversold conditions, for the first time since 2018:While there is still the weekend to go before the Weekly close, and still plenty of time for price to get rejected at current levels (especially the 200WMA at $22,563) this would be the third time the RSI has left oversold on the Weekly, signalling the lows for bear markets in 2015 and 2018. Notably price is also testing the the 50 Month MA at $21.9K, after closing it's first ever month below this moving average.There has additionally been a break-out of the symmetrical triangle that formed in recent weeks with reasonable volume and a target of around $26K. In the short and long-term, there remains a big volume gap between $22.5K and $29K, so original theories of a quick relief rally back to previous support looks likely. Clearing the 200WMA and $23K could see some serious volatility to the upside in the near future.",

Although at present it looks like price is at the resistance level of a W-pattern break-out, or Adam & Eve depending on pattern preference. The fact that the short-term is suggesting continuation of bullish momentum, and the long-term is signalling bearish exhaustion (RSI leaving oversold), is the type of bullish confluence within both time frames that we haven't seen for a long-time. For me price still needs to break $23K for confirmation, for longer-term it'll be a Weekly close above the 200WMA.",

Same as fundamentals reflecting immediate short-term price or the macro economic environment directing long-term price. While the correlation between the bearish economic overall bearish sentiment is dragging Bitcoin's price down, you can't rely on this 100% of the time. At some point the correlation will break, like we've seen time and time again.Quote from: adaseb on July 12, 2022, 04:26:56 AMIf we keep getting high inflation every month then we will keep dipping and there is no technicals on CPI. Not true, there is no 100% guarantee that Bitcoin \"will keep dipping\". This is common mistake that speculators make, such as yourself in this case, that certain price movements \"will happen\", instead of \"most likely\" to happen. I personally find it ironic that speculators will claim TA is not 100%, but then use another form of analysis will provide 100% certainty that price will go up or down.Quote from: adaseb on July 12, 2022, 04:26:56 AMIt’s based on factors that traders can’t control. Hence why it’s called speculation because nobody knows what will happen. If it was easy such as using some RSI then everybody would be millionaires.The RSI on the Weekly is merely mimicking the overall bearish sentiment, that of price strength struggling to leave oversold conditions, highlighting considerable weakness. This is exactly what you'd expect to see if there was considerable bearish sentiment in the market. Likewise recent short-term analysis has been aligned with the overall bearish macro economic environment, that of anticipating price failing to break out higher and instead falling lower.As a trader, its not about controlling price, it's about analysing what the most likely direction is going to be. As you said, TA, as well as other forms of analysis, are all forms of speculation at the end of the day.As for current price in the short-term, it appears to be forming a bear flag, completely negating any bullish sentiment from the break-out of symmetrical triangle, that ultimately failed:After breaking $20K we naturally came back down to the $19K support levels where there is some volume support. More relevantly, if this is a bear flag and price breaks local support, the target would be around $12.5K if it plays out, very much the bearish target many have had their eyes on for sometime now. Price will need to reclaim $20K levels relatively quickly to avoid falling considerably lower.Furthermore, after failing to leave oversold conditions on the Weekly, as well as getting rejected from the 200WMA, price has since fallen -6% indicating some follow through after rejection, as opposed to consolidation at higher levels. There is really nothing bullish I can see right now without $19K levels holding as support and $20K being reclaimed, despite how oversold price already is.",

Price has so far been holding $19K and and already tested $20K levels (volume point of control) prior to getting short-term rejection:The upwards trending support has now been tested 3 times, while the upwards sloping resistance only twice so far in-between support tests. While the likelihood would be rejection from $23K levels (where the 200WMA is priced) based on the bear flag that's currently forming, a re-test of resistance to further confirm such a bear flag is looking increasingly likely as price consolidates relatively sideways.Quote from: dragonvslinux on July 12, 2022, 09:32:04 PMQuote from: adaseb on July 12, 2022, 04:26:56 AMIf we keep getting high inflation every month then we will keep dipping and there is no technicals on CPI.

To some degree it depends on when it happens, how long it takes to get there, macro-economic factors, any fundamentals that may be relevant.If you look at recent bottoms:In March 2020 price capitulated -50% within a week (largely based on liquidations) and there was more of a V-shaped recovery only taking 6 weeksIn January 2015 at the final end of capitulation with a similar -50% drop, price recovered half of the drop the same week before trading sideways for approximately 10 monthsIn November 2018 with a -50% drop taking mainly two weeks, there was more of a rounding bottom that took a few monthsWhat do all of these bottoms have in common? Not a lot in reality, they were each unique in their own way and considerably different. The only correlation is that a -80+% correlation twice previously led to at least a years worth of consolidation, even if price can retrace most of the bear market during that period (like in 2019). It's possible that if price drops to $12K it could be back at $24K within a few weeks, likewise it could trade between $12K and $24K for up to a year. There could be a rounding bottom for a few months before price returns to $45K, or something completely different (probably this option imo).So when the only correlation is that each bottom has been different in it's structure as well as time, then it's probably best to expect something different this time around. I also wouldn't put too much faith into a bear flag target, the odds of it reaching this target isn't that high (around 60-70% maybe). It does line-up with volume support and around a -82% correction overall, but generally speaking breaking down from a bear flag is more relevant as a bearish continuation pattern, and therefore expecting a considerable lower low, as opposed to any accurate target that comes from it.",

Therefore closing today (end of week) >30 could certainly see some follow through as has been the case in previous bear market bottoms of 2015 and 2018. Based on past price action, the RSI is unlikely to return to oversold conditions once it has left this territory.Getting rejected from leaving oversold conditions for a second consecutive week would otherwise be considered bearish and would likely lead to a continuation of downward price action, showing that patient sellers are taking advantage of selling any dead cat bounces so as to avoid selling into long-term oversold conditions. To put it simply: without leaving oversold conditions, price is unable to recover, only consolidate at best.",

But even this isn't that reliable.As for Bitcoin's Monthly RSI, it has never been bearish, only neutral at worst like at the moment (41.66 lowest reading). It's not that Bitcoin is different, it's that it has never been in a long-term downtrend. In this context, long-term as in Monthly moving averages trending downwards and price below them. It could obviously happen, but without the RSI turning bearish, there's nothing to suggest that right now.Generally speaking this is what makes the Monthly RSI for Bitcoin relatively useless while instead the Weekly RSI is much more reliable.",
