Don't let your emotions get the best of you.You didn't state how your emotions led to your loss of opportunity or disappointment but you are very correct, it is not ideal to let your emotions becloud your decision in business. The motivation to invest or engage in any business dealing should be verified facts and not mere assumptions or emotions. You are very correct, bitcoin (I am not sure of others) is the future of legal tender, and denying this fact is living in self-denial. QuoteCrypto is the sure way to build a successful business or company and like I said it's the new world order. And with that said, this has been what my experiences with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been like so far.You seem to be overexaggerating the impact of bitcoin on businesses. It's true that bitcoin can help businesses to have access to cheap and reliable financial transactions. It also helps businesses to overcome some impediments that are associated with conventional banks. But assuming that it is the sure way of building a successful business is going too far. There are other main or basic skills or resources that every business needs to survive and make a profit. Bitcoin might not be impactful if you dint have the basic skills to run a business.  QuoteMy experience:There's a high level of security.

And there's also a high level of transaction freedom.Please feel free to share your experiences with Bitcoin and other Crypto currencyBitcoin has always proved to be a hedge against inflation but in recent times it has been affected by inflation and some other economic indices. Therefore it would also be slightly out of place to assume that it is not affected by some economic factors. Bitcoin is accepted in most countries of the world and it can be easily converted to fiat. It has also proved to be a good investment especially if you are HODLING. This is because it has proved over the years that after the bearish market, the bullish era would always come.Note: It would be appropriate if you focus on discussing bitcoin in this section. You can always talk about other cryptocurrencies in the altcoin section of the forum.",

A person can build a crypto-related business of many kinds, and it's also possible to implement some usage of cryptos for a business that isn't centered around cryptos. However, it can lead to losses, it can fail, just like other businesses. Also, if there's a good business idea but there doesn't seem to be a place for cryptos there, maybe it's okay and there shouldn't be.",

It's always a win-win situation whether you're buying or selling if you know what you're doing. And there's also a high level of transaction freedom.BTC is deflationary, and it is secure because of the high hash rate, consensus mechanism, decentralization etc. But with self-custody it is only as safe as you make it, if you are not up for the responsibilty of self-custody, it is better to stay with paper money, it is even worse for bitcoiners who don't practice self-custody, that is bitcoiners who use custodial wallets and services; they bear more risks that the average user of fiat centralized services.You are alluding to crypto and not BTC, so you better be careful trading shitcoins in centralized exchanges, it may be convenient until it is not. BTC is a 'community network' so we could talk about 'equality' and 'fairness' you mentioned, but again you generalized it as crypto, maybe you should know that many crypto's are centralized and controlled by a small group, like ETH that just moved to POS that allows for centralization and the possibility of powerful staking pools and censoring of transactions, in BTC POW it is impossible for a miner to control 51% of the hash rate.It can only be a win-win for a crypto user if they use the right coin (BTC) and have the knowledge they need about it.",

Bitcoin has its ups and downs, and lately I've been lucky enough to witness the ups and the favourable aspect of bitcoin, all to the point of letting my biased judgement get the best of me and I'm sorry about that mistake.And speaking of letting my emotions get the best me? I allowed the fear of missing out on great deals and profits when there's a high rise in the market overcome me and also the uncertainty and doubt that constantly plays in my head that what if Bitcoin crashes after a huge investment. These were the feelings and emotions that had the upper hand in my early days. Thanks.",

Recently, Binance chain experienced it. With regards to inflation, many altcoins are actually inflationary. If you refer to inflation in the outside world, if cryptocurrencies are not rising in value while the prices of goods and services are all rising, then it is affected by inflation.
