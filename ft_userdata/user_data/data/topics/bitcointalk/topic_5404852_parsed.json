Why don't they simply print up a bunch more, and give it to us Americans so that we can afford gas, etc.?... since they are basing their printing on the taxes we pay anyway. The war might not be over as fast as you think. Why not? Because the banks are trying to take the populace down by being selective about where the money they print goes.",

But it isn't really a war. It's only a fight.ANALYSIS: America won’t be able to keep its troops armed for more than a few weeks during warQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-01-america-wont-keep-troops-armed-long-during-war.html#The United States is unlikely to survive more than a few weeks of heavy warfare against another industrialized power.In a recent episode of “Health Ranger Report,” Mike Adams pointed out that the U.S. isn’t even able to properly arm its ally Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. (Related: Biden announces MASSIVE military expansion in Europe in response to string of Russian victories in Ukraine.)Adams further noted that the war in Ukraine, while the biggest war Europe has seen in nearly a century, is really just a small-scale operation. “It was a special military operation from the beginning. I wouldn’t even call it a war … not yet, anyway,” said Adams. “Maybe it’s going that direction, but the question is, can the United States even sustain a war?”To support his arguments, Adams cited an article by retired Lt. Col. Alex Vershinin published on the website of the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank focusing on issues of defense and international security.In the article, titled “The Return of Industrial Warfare,” Vershinin argued that the scale of combat in Ukraine shows that the West, and America in particular, needs the kind of industrial capacity it had during World War II to still be called the “arsenal of democracy.”“The effort to arm, feed and supply these armies is a monumental task,” wrote Vershinin.Vershinin pointed out that the winner in a prolonged war between two or more powers of relatively equal strength is the side with the stronger industrial base. This means a country needs to have the manufacturing capacity to produce enough weapons, ammunition and heavier military hardware, or otherwise have manufacturing industries that can be used in the war effort.Brighteon.TV“Unfortunately, the West no longer seems to have either,” wrote Vershinin.America doesn’t produce enough weapons or ammo to wage warIn an analysis of American weapons production, Vershinin noted that America would run out of ammo for its artillery guns within 10 days to two weeks, or maybe three weeks if stockpiles were rationed, if the country were to enter a war in which it would use relatively the same number of artillery rounds used by Russia in Ukraine....",

Russia recently overtook Saudi Arabia to become China's largest oil supplier. With ample supply and below-market prices, China and India will not ignore Russian oil. Russia still earns high profits from oil and gas, which the US and EU do not consider.Undeniably, US and EU sanctions have not worked. What if the Russians stopped supplying gas to the EU, things are slowly getting worse.",

The only possible way to resolve the conflict is involving a third party which will be capable of calling the both countries into a peace meeting. Although, we all pray the war ends as soon as possible, because is really affecting the citizens. Many have dead, and it high time they agreed to peace. Otherwise, more citizens will lose their lives, and more properties will be destroyed.",

I believe this world is there something that can be resolved with the combination of all the countries that we enter the into it as you said they need a third party to come in before the matter can be resolved. Russian country is a country that is being organised for the White and they have all the supplement the equipment it takes to destroy a nation so if third party refused to come in and there's no support from any other country to both countries Russia will crush Ukraine and it is not what you are praying for me we are praying for the unity",

Also, they are pushing to make the monkey for disease as a virus-like we had with the Covid-19 two years ago. The biggest problem we will gonna have is if we still have this war going on and the lockdown when they gonna implement some foolish rules again. That would be the worse disaster we will ever have because jobs are not available again and the price of essential needs will gonna rise multiple times than in the pandemic era.",

And war start it doesn't look for just peace before it will settle down.

Why not try the German einkorn?The idea is not bad, but it is impossible if Russia exports its wheat even if Ukraine does not do so, even then, not all countries together can easily solve the wheat crisis because Ukraine is the fifth largest exporter of wheat. If for any reason the export of wheat from Ukraine stops, the world, which is already facing inflation and poverty, will increase even more Because many countries meet full or more than half of their needs by importing Ukrainian wheat,This includes many developing and poor countries.So if that happens, as you said, all the countries that were buying wheat from Ukraine when they buy it from another country So rising prices will cause a storm of inflation in all these countries, which is not good news for the general public. However, if the wheat crisis arises, I think the United States will once again benefit greatly.",
