      "body": "My humble opinion- so first consider where you sell. You will get more on ebay or even the new stacks and bauer auctions. Coins on forum tend to sell cheaper. Also you will get much more if you wait till btc on the upswing again. Brings out more buyers. If you sold now id say break them up and sell individually as sad as that is. So on ebay the 1 btc sold at auction for around 4500 in early summer. But a current coin has been stuck at 5000 for awhile now. The other 3 coins sell for between 2000-3000 each. Now that being said stacks sold that funded 0.1 last Nov for 33k. So really it just comes down to exposure to right buyers. If you wait these will be worth much more in the future. But heres my best guess what youll get if you soldEbay as a group- 6-8Ebay individual- 10-12Forum- 3-4 but sell quick",
