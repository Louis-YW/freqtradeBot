I still think anything above 1 coin makes a psychological impact -- a bit less once you take price into account.It has had a waning influence though, I'd say. Just looking at the peaks/throughs in between each cycle. I'm keen to understand how these fees situation looks post-bullrun when ordinals surely run out of steam. I'd predict a positive backlash from peeps returning on-chain.",

Well I know the mining industry but on a smaller scale than a 100,000 unit farm pulling 300,000 kwatts.Or 300 megawatts.my share of the btc network is 6/450,000the 300 megawatt player has 6,000/450,000 share of the market.If the 300 megawatt player could down clock all his s19 xps to 120 th vs 141 th  spending way less power.Hitting less blocks but raising fees thus earning more profit.It would be fair to my investors and stockholders.It looks doable , but not  this ½ ing  maybe 2028 or 2032.",

The current design is like forcing me to convert Btc to fiat say like $1000(one transaction )vs spending 100$ btc x 10 times(10 transactions) the smaller you go the more ridiculous the fees are but just here as an example only If anyone has reading materials on the 10 vs 1 transaction fees and how to not have to convert back to fiat but not lose so much in fees pls tell me.As to fees offsetting halving impact, my question would be back to the miner community when they are calcing out  Btc rev is this extra value included in your cost per Btc mined.

I do hold some inference that Btc bottoms are linked somewhat to the cost to mine coin. the floor number is supported by mining ⛏️ the ceiling is supported by speculation.when i look at the fee levels for 2023 they have been over 0.5 btc a lot maybe half the time.My 300k watt mine can downclock from 6ph to 4ph in minutes.Saves a ton of power and keeps my heat issues in control.big farms can do the same.foundry the largest pool makes 48 blocks in a day.the diff jump is 14 days.so they look at the mempool on first day of the jump. see it is kind of crowded.they down clock from 48 blocks to 40 blocks saves power and right now lose 6.25 size blocks add fees say .70 the lose is 8 x 7 = 56 coins.and the power saved is maybe 20 coins losing 36 coinsbut fees shift to 1.75 coins makes blocks 8 coins not 7.  adds 40 coins to their haul about 4 coins now.but after the ½ ing  the number look way better for this type of attack.lose 8 four coin block loss is 32 coinsgain 20 coins in power. net loss of 12 coinsbut make 40 blocks with an extra 1 btc in rewards means 40-12 = 28 coin gain.do not do it a lot first and second day of a 14 day jump. than go back to normal28  + 28 = 56 coin gain every two weeks.this is just a 33% company.it is a fee attack via difficulty manipulation and it makes money.Not at all like a 51% attack which loses money.",
