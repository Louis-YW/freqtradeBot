I'm not surprised with this at all. I could remember a church in my area then doing a program called Asale Yahoo(vigil for Yahoo). At this virgil, the pastor will order them to come with their laptops for prayers. Can we call this a real church. These are reason why many churches in Nigeria never changes Nigerians from their bad doings.",

You know lots of people loves such gathering where miracles are happening according to them, some people believes in miracle centers instead of going on their kneels praying to God and rely on him and waiting patiently for he's time, rather they prefer quick miracles and healing disregarding the sources and the prices to pay later on.",

Waiting they cause all these things na because of belief and too much knowledge, e get how pesin go Sabi something reach en go come dey question almost everything wey him en self been believe before but Thank God say them write am bold say na ogbamje church so that any pesin wey you see they go there, know say na ogbamje unlike those ones wey they no go write am but if you check¬† the church well, you go see fetish things wey dey happen inside there. Choosing what to worship is not illegal, everybody has the right to choose what to belief what not to belief however we should be careful with the people that is/are going to this church.And as cityhunter34 take talk am too, na so e be. E get people wey go hear say that Ogbamje church dey make people get money and them dey see vision, say if person go the church them go tell you everything concerning waiting make soso pesin no dey do well and most of all these are fake and they are strategy to lure people in and take advantage of them because of their ignorant. Money na waiting dey kill most people this days when dey don hear say if you go this church money go flow, you go see how desperate people go dey rush regardless.",
