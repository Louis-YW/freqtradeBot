Thank you.Edit: correction: stalk -> stake",

Don't be shocked if the token does not like it, though. Â -edit-I see you edited your post, but you still made a mistake. It should be \"stake\" not \"stak\".",

To be a validator in the proof of stake chain, you must use the \"base\" coin that the cryptocurrency has.Staking Ethereum requires its own coin, ETH. So does with BSC. USDC, USDT, DAI, etc are categorized as a token on some particular network(ETH/BSC). So, the token can't be included to participate in the network node/consensus requirements. You can learn more about the basic information at https://ethereum.org/en/eth/.",

But, they've just made it look like you really are staking but the mere fact is that it's like a savings account that earns you interest. And for Abra, staking USDC will earn you 7% APY and the same goes for other stablecoins except for Tether. For Tether, they're giving 10% APY. You can check the whole details of it on their website and think of it if you're convinced about their \"staking\" earn feature.",

So can you say any blockchain, that allows also to stake any token?To simplify your answer. Let's go back in time, when Ethereum was still POW. Ethereum was the blockchain network and ETH was the native coin of the network. In the same network there were thousands of ERC20 tokens built on it but all those coins and network depended on the native coin Ether for deployment of smart contracts, transaction fees etc.The only coin that could be mined was ETH and the mining rewards we also in ETH not USDT, USDC, BAT or any other token. The same applies to the current POS Algorithm. On the Ethereum network, you only stake ETH.",

I have been moderating a community of a new memecoin where we don't offer any staking. But many scammers do it in order to steal people's money and they successfully did because people are greedy and not well informed too or they don't like to search before doing things",
