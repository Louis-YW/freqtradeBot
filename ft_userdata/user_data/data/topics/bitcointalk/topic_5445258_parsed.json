Some of you already know me from our two previous beta test campaigns here on BitcoinTalk üòÉ I am humbled yet excited to say \"We did it!\". So many people have contributed their feedback to this release v.1.1.0! Now, that our escrow and marketplace platform is publicly available, I'm happy to help onboard new users. We have chat support for marketplace to get you started. If you have any questions you can contact me directly, or ask our community. Also, we can provide you with test funds (or you can always use faucets) for contract and gas fees. For Ethereum Goerli network you will need gETH and for Binance Testnet - tBNB and one stablecoin of choice (USDC, USDT, BUSD). Let me know if you are facing any problems with faucets and need the test funds. I'd be happy to send it to you.",

Even now in the crypto winter, the deployment price would be about 40$ per contract. If we had the gas prices of the last crypto summer, the price of the deployment could easily be as high as 200$ per contract. That's why I advise using Gnosis blockchain because of the fees and credibility. Thank you Woodie! Thank you for being our beta tester.

Yes, we are thinking about launching a signature campaign here on bitcoin talk. We are just waiting for our first round of presale to finish to allocate more funds for marketing. A few reputable users from the forum have already reached us with offers for their signature space. I believe it's our best shot for successful growth. Thank you!Also, for users who participated in our beta campaigns, here is our changelog https://docs.zen.land/extra/changelog. Some bugs and features have already been implemented, and some are still on our long to-do list. But you can find your usernames and links to post on bitcointalk. If you believe I forgot to mention you along with the bug/feature request we added, please let me know. I would love to add you to our changelog.",
