  "content": "One year ago, I introduced the Rings network on the Cryptography mailinglist (https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2022-October/037958.html),and now I'm here to show what we have done in the past year.First, let me reintroduce my project.The Rings network (https://github.com/RingsNetwork/rings-node) is a fullydecentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. I emphasize the word \"fully\"because Rings nodes can run on arbitrary devices, especially in webbrowsers. The code is written in Rust and can be compiled into WebAssembly.The transport layer is also browser-friendly, based on the WebRTC protocol,enabling direct connections between browsers (we have a demo illustratinghow the handshake works: https://rings.rs/rings-wasm-p2p/).Secondly, let me highlight what we have achieved this year.1.) Strong Rings DHT: The Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is based on theChord algorithm, and we have incorporated the work of Pamela Zave (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06461.pdf) to enhance its robustness.2.) WASM and FFI Client: We now not only support WASM exports but alsooffer support for Foreign Function Interface (FFI). This means thatdevelopers can easily use our network in any environment or with anylanguage, be it in a browser or native, with languages like Python orHaskell.3.) dWeb / TcpProxy: A year ago, we had a simple HTTP proxy implementationbased on one-time string input/output. Now, we support TcpProxy, which isbased on DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and can establish a TCP tunnelbetween any two nodes.4.) Services Store / Lookup: While our primary focus is not on storage, theRings Network has implemented basic storage functionality primarily forservice discovery and registration. For example, a service providing anIPFS forward gateway can be registered as sha1(\"IPFS_GATEWAY\").5.) Session and Abstract Account: Rings' design principle is to keepprograms from interacting with private keys directly. So, we achieveauthorization and abstract account by having users sign a delegatedkeypair. We now support users to authenticate using various elliptic curveencryption algorithms, including secp256k1, secp256r1, ed25519, and theirvariants.6.) Browser Extension: We now have a browser extension that essentiallyworks. You can find it at https://github.com/RingsNetwork/rings_ext_v2. Itlaunches a node in the background and injects a \"Rings\" object into thewindow object in the browser, allowing the node to stay online continuously.Third, I will introduce what is the next move of the Rings network.In the upcoming development process, we have three plans:1.Â  Â  Â Continuously improve the availability and user-friendliness ofnodes, including providing better TCPProxy tools, dweb tools. They shouldbe well-documented.2.Â  Â  Â Optimize the browser extension; the current interface is not veryappealing, and its functionality is not very intuitive. We also plan toprovide more demos based on the extension.3.Â  Â  Â Implement the DRanking protocol. The DRanking protocol is a newsampling protocol designed by us. It's inspired by the ranking protocol ofeDonkey but work in decentralized way. If you're interested, you can take alook at our draft paper:https://github.com/RingsNetwork/whitepaper/blob/master/pos.pdfThe Rings Network is a project that I am deeply passionate about andcommitted to for the long term. It still has a long journey ahead. Wecurrently have only two or three full-time developers. If anyone has anyideas about the future of the Rings Network, please feel free to sharethem. If you wish to become a contributor to the Rings Network, you arealso welcome to join us.Our repo is available at:https://github.com/RingsNetwork/rings-nodeAnd white paper:https://github.com/RingsNetwork/whitepaper/blob/master/rings.pdf",
