We pumped up liquidity tax to 10% on buy/sells and that is it. Each time someone buys or sells SAFEMOON 2.0 10% of that will go to our liquidity making it more and more stable after each buy and sell. ​Every buy/sell will make our floor stronger than it ever was, with the right volume we will be unstoppable! We have also included a 2% max tx limit and a 2% max wallet to really make this unbreakable (something SafeMoon never had) and this will make us even more trustworthy than ever! ​Join us on our journey !0xf0e2b59ef566567d4e3115a81f02b473a1077947https://www.thesafemoontwo.com/https://t.me/SafemoonTWO",
