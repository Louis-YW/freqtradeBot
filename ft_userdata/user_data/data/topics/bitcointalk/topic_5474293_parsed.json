I think those that assume they are coming late into bitcoin essentially needs to read this and contrast it to the next generation that will be adopting bitcoin what would be said of them if the people adopting today are complaining of arriving late.It's only an issue of time that cryptocurrency will surpasses real estate that's at that top of the chart with 10.7%. I am one of those bitcoin/crypto maximalist who undoubtedly believe that there's a bright future for bitcoin and it's users, keep hodling.",

Even we ourselves can feel it in our own country. In my country, the majority of young people are investing in cryptocurrency, even first and second year students spend time investing in cryptocurrency. Life is getting harder and the need to make money is getting bigger and cryptocurrencies are attracting great attention when it comes to generating big profits. Therefore, it is obvious that young people invest in cryptocurrency.",

I wonder if the other countries will consider having a legal framework around Bitcoin. It will not only help the government to get more taxes but also open new ways for job creation. The benefits are multifold. The issue with not having a legal framework is that the scammers become active in this space and misguide people in the name of cryptocurrency investment.",

As for the dominance of Real Estate investment, it has always been the choice of the elderly because it is to support retirement.Cryptocurrencies have widely discussed investment option, because their decentralized nature, and relative ease of access compared to traditional investment. The lack of stringent paperwork and regulatory requirements associated with cryptocurrency investments has also played a role, while real estate investment needs extensive documentation, legal processes, and background checks. Cryptocurrencies can be purchased and traded with minimal formalities. This has made them appealing to investors seeking a less complex and time-consuming investment experience.But cryptocurrencies still have inherent risks and uncertainties. Their volatile nature, susceptibility to scams and hacks, and lack of intrinsic value compared to traditional assets like real estate demand careful consideration before investing. Investors should conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved, and only invest funds they can afford to lose. I dont think it's a good choice of the elderly to support retirement.",

Unlike other investment, one don't need to go through any bureaucratic process to invest. I assume that the population will even be greater because many crypto investors would like to remain anonymous which might make them avoid the survey. In my country, I assume that 1 out of every 4 youth is involved in cryptocurrency because they are tech-savvy.",

Then the market will come down and you will see the same level of down trend likewise the uptrend happening now.",
