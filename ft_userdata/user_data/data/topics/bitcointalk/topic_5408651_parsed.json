EG if you are buying at the ATH you're at high risk and buying at a premium. so try not to go FOMO buying at the topbuy low sell high. and take the many oppertunities of the temporary price swings of ups and downs above the value line",

It is still possible that the price of bitcoin may fall below $17500, or probably not. But you are not wrong at all because what that matters that good analysts will consider is the halving period, even if bitcoin may still fall further, the price it is now can still be considered to be the bottom because if a significant bull run start, we can expect the price of bitcoin to reach over $100k and that is going to be after 2024 halving.",

It's just a normal price correction, after the ATH of last year; nothing too serious.Also, all those factors you mentioned are not fundamental problems related to Bitcoin or the cryptocurrency market, they are external market trends which can indirectly affect other global markets.Note that the market is not determined by the extremes of ups and downs, but rather the period of stability in-between, and that amount that Bitcoin stables at over the years have been consistently increasing.After the 2017 ATH, the market settled at below $8k for most of the time, now we have an apparent bottom of >$22k which is a significant increase. Those are my biggest takeaways from this cycle.",

And we don't need to know then. Perhaps, being in a bearing situation isn't new and we all are aware of this. And we are also aware of many factors affecting the market, a short pump can't be called an indication of the change of trend, it eventually drops again. But as we can see the market is getting better, we just hope it stays above $20k until the end of this quarter and then moves slowly close to $30k. It is hard to find the significant reason for this pump but at least we have this. And I don't bother to check the chart every day.",

People care about their investment and returns the same way they care about the price of fuel and can even make protests to kick against fuel increases. But the fact should be, people should view Bitcoin with the right perspective and positive mindset having in mind that Bitcoin is a speculative asset and a lot of factors contribute to its price movement and that is why Bitcoin is referred to as one of the most volatile assets on the exchange market.",

Any asset that falls 70% from its high without any fundamental problems, is undervalued.Â  What if you held stock of a company and there was nothing going on with that company and knew the only reason the stock is going down is because the US is trying to pump the dollar and the global economy in trouble, would that make you sell at a loss or consider the stock undervalued. I see it in black and white. A stock is having problems because of fundamental reasons like a threat of bankruptcy, or the company is doing something shady - I sell. It's not having any problems but losing value because fiat money is gaining or people are selling because they don't know what's going on, if they'll be able to pay their bills next year - I don't sell.",

But we will never know when the price will bottom out and we will only know once the price starts rising sharply and continues to increase to form the next high or ATH. We just need to concentrate on collecting bitcoin and fiat and if the price gap continues, meaning the price is still up and down, it can give us an opportunity to buy low and sell high.",

It's hard to tell what you are describing because most people refer to stocks when talking about \"the market\". Funnily enough stocks are still going very strong even though there are all these recession warnings around, which is the opposite of bitcoin that took a huge slump recently but is slowly regaining ground. You have to consider that crypto is extremely high risk, so the moment things start dipping, everyone is in a stampede for the week exit and it takes a long time to regain trust. You also have to consider that it's getting a lot more expensive to borrow so people don't have cheap money available now to \"invest\"",
