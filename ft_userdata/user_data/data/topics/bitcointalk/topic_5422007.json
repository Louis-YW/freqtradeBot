  "content": "Bitcoin has many features that make it the greatest money ever created, but sometimes it’s difficult for non-technical people to understand how to use these features. There are very smart people working on Bitcoin, and I think sometimes they assume coding terms they use everyday should be easy for everyone to understand.What features do you find difficult to use? Maybe we can help each other understand, or find serious user experience (UX) problems that can be solved.For example, Bitcoin has a timelock feature that can create a transaction that is impossible to spend until a certain date or block height is reached. You can do this using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, but it seems most people don’t know how to use this feature or where to even begin. Some people seemed worried about self-custody and storing their private key or seed phrase securely. Hardware wallets make this easier by requiring a pin or password to access your Bitcoin.",

Feel free to reach out maybe we have goals that align. I just take a look to your thread, and what you are looking for could be done with a bash script. I would use the -blocknotify option on bitcoin-cli to verify if the address get new coins each block, and in the moment it get the coins then some math to split the income and send them to the different address. If you still interested in that task feel free to send me a personal message and we could negotiate the script price.",

I don’t really understand mining myself. From what I can see, it’s very expensive to set up and continuously run, so that’s beyond anything I can attempt to do.Quote from: GreatArkansas on November 18, 2022, 01:05:01 AMAnd addition the addresses or private keys with Bitcoin, which I always keep to see here on the Bitcoin forum from some users, some words like \"derived\", \"keys\", etc. And recently, I just discovered that there are different types of Bitcoin transactions, like P2PKH, P2SH, and OP_RETURN.These are all new to me, and even though I am into coding, this is very difficult to understand for me.Correction added at bottomIt can get very confusing. I don’t think I can explain OP_RETURN any better than a Google search, but maybe I can help with addresses and private keys. Private keys are what allow you to spend bitcoin. It is randomly generated with an encryption algorithm called SHA256. Basically, it’s a long string that is so long and random, there are enough private keys available for everyone millions of times over. Your public key is \"derived\" from your private key from an elliptic curve. Imagine a curve on a coordinate plane. That curve is created by your private key, and the points on that curve make up your public key. That public key is then compressed to create your public address (which is what you share with others to get paid). P2PKH is a type of address called a \"legacy address\" because it’s oldest Bitcoin address. It’s larger (more bits) than the newer address types (P2WPKH or Bech32) so miner fees cost more but it’s accepted by everyone on the Bitcoin network.P2WPKH or Bech32 is the newer address type that includes SegWit. Basically, it’s a special address that is lower bits, so the block size doesn’t fill up as quickly.P2SH is a \"scripting\" address. It allows you to add things like nLocktime. In other words, it’s a lets you code what conditions you want to pass before the transaction become valid.That’s probably the best way I can explain it in layman terms.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 22, 2022, 12:07:17 PMQuote from: BTCapsule on November 18, 2022, 02:00:06 AMPrivate keys are what allow you to spend bitcoin. It is randomly generated with an encryption algorithm called SHA256. Basically, it’s a long string that is so long and random, there are enough private keys available for everyone millions of times over. There are few major error,1. Private key usually is generated with secure random number generator. Some people refer it as CSPRNG/CRNG.2. SHA-256 is hashing algorithm, not encryption algorithm.Quote from: BTCapsule on November 18, 2022, 02:00:06 AMP2PKH is a type of address called a \"legacy address\" because it’s oldest Bitcoin address. It’s larger (more bits) than the newer address types (P2WPKH or Bech32) so miner fees cost more but it’s accepted by everyone on the Bitcoin network.FYI, the oldest address type is P2PK (Pay to Public Key).",
