Earlier you did not have TOR active in the background that's why after doing everything else correctly, it was still showing Red indicator because it was not receiving connection from TOR.When the indicator is Green while your TOR is active and TOR have Electrum in it's app list, I think it still use the connection from TOR. But since the Proxy is not enabled, the Electrum thinks it's your regular connection.On mobile device, TOR means you need Orbot.All these are my understanding of how the system works.",

May be there will be some information about it on Electrum domination. I am not much interested to spend time there.",

If you have bought a dedicated Socks5 proxy you can enable authentication with a username and password it generated a user and password that can be used on Electrum.You can just leave it empty since you already made it work through TOR.",
