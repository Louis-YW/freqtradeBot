This can take a long time that's why using money you don't need is important, to see a new all time high again with bitcoin you may have to keep holding till 2025, are you ready for this? There are reasons why people trust Bitcoin that's why I will like to advice you to start doing your own research, you need to understand why Bitcoin is valuable and also how to protect your fund, for beginners I recommend Electrum wallet or a hardware wallet, and do not share your seed or private key with anyone, it is meant to care for like how you treat your ATM card pin code. Do not share with anyone.You can read more about bitcoin here ASAP https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp",

Bitcoin have a good track records since it creation over a decade ago, and that can be seen and studied from bitcoin chat movements since 2010 when the coin gain tractions. so to this point i can clearly say, Bitcoin have a great potential for the future but then you will also have to make clear what bitcoins future potential you looking out for.  Because we tend to have individuals expectations to some people there will love to see bitcoin reaching some certain hight in the future in areas such as.1: Bitcoin price in the future.2: the rate of bitcoin adoption globally.3: ease of accessibility for newbies and beginners. 4: Bitcoin utility increase via decentralized payment systems All this are the common bitcoin individual expectations, and all this are build on individual understanding of bitcoin and what it stand for and how long it will take for Bitcoin to realize this potential and the time frame we are ready to wait for that to happen.Quote from: Rx009 on January 25, 2023, 06:00:49 AMand I want to know why people experience losses investing in bitcoin.You don't lose when you invest in bitcoin, you only lose when you exchange your bitcoin to dollars below your entry dollar value.So ultimately no one loses in Bitcoin when you hold your bitcoins, its value remains the same if not calculated based on DCA but in bits, so you only lose your investment when you exchange bitcoin below your bought price as an investor.My advice to you as a newbie 1: Build a good knowledge of bitcoin and how its DCA price movement has acted over the years so that your knowledge will aid you during any crisis in Bitcoin price which will range from different factors that cant be controlled by individuals, factors like the inflation rate in the economy and other events that could cause a short term price behaviour in whatever direction.2: don't see bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme, it doesn't happen that way and those that see Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme always end up in disappointed when bitcoin do not reach its imaginary price.3: bitcoin shouldn't be taken as a short-term investment, you are ready to invest in bitcoin, then you must be willing to wait for as long as possible that is why bitcoin is for holders and not for weak hands as an asset.",

I highly recommend you to read this website [ https://bitcoin.org/en/ ] everything you will ask was there, from knowing bitcoin itself --to a bitcoin wallet for storing your bitcoin and how you will buy bitcoin in the safest way.There are no losses as long as you hold your bitcoin and never sell at a low price, for example --you have bought bitcoin at the price of $22k and if you have to sell, it should be above that price.",

Why can I experience loss investing in bitcoin?In fact, if we look back, we can see the ups and downs of BTC price. Well, this is from my perspective:1. They experience a loss, when they decide to buy when the price goes up, and sell it when it goes down because panic sell.2. they are trapped by fomo and do not understand/have no knowledge of technical analysis.3. Not decided to hold when going down. Meanwhile, the average Hodl never loses. For example, if he bought when BTC price was $18K a few months ago, and kept it even though BTC price dropped to $15K, today he already in profit.4. Become a victim of a scamThese are some of the most common causes of loss. of course there are many things that make bitcoin investors loss. Which I did not mention here.",

But always try to buy it from a dip.Btw if you don't have much knowledge about crypto or a coin where you want to invest, I will suggest you learn first about these projects.

So that it's not like other people experiencing losses like you tell me. You should find out as much information as possible before investing.Things to remember when investing are:1. The definition of investment is to save some money in the present with the hope of getting a profit in the future2. Investment must use leftover money (not operating money)3. Don't put your eggs in one basket, don't put your eggs in one bag, because if one breaks, all of them will break. Create portfolios in various places.",

The price of Bitcoin can increase by 10% to 50% per day, but the risk of decreasing its value is also unlimited.
