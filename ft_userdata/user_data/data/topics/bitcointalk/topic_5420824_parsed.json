I don't know why anyone would tweet like this and spread panic. The panic is already on its peak with FTX, Blockfi stopping withdrawal, we don't want binance doing the same and killing not only people fund's but also damaging crypto adoption.",

The panic is already on its peak with FTX, Blockfi stopping withdrawal, we don't want binance doing the same and killing not only people fund's but also damaging crypto adoption. I don't think that people took what happened with FTX seriously enough and plenty are still having money on centralized exchanges, thinking that theirs is safe.",

And I've already got tired of the current crypto winter tbh.(I will add that I would not be surprised to see this news about crypto.com though)",

Are you being ironic or something?  I don't think that Binance going bankrupt would be \"the end of crypto\". The BTC price might drop even below 10K, if Binance stops withdrawals, but I'm sure that the crypto markets will slowly recover from this. Stopping all withdrawals doesn't necessarily mean going bankrupt. It's simply a move intended to lower the panic on the crypto markets(even though it creates more fears and uncertainty).The crypto traders must calm down and don't sell. Panic selling is the most stupid move right now.",

Moreover Binance before doing any sort of things will definitely give a notification to it’s users. To be honest many are affected through the FTX issue, but believe me FTX and Binance are completely different. Just keep hope and don’t panic.",

I don't think Binance will let this happen and will make sure things are still under their control. Let's hope this doesn't happen on Binance.",

So people will going crazy for sure if it will happen especially without any further notice to the public, it will be a big problem.",

Because Binance also has an official website, and CZ is active on twitter with all the information he provides. I think we need to avoid information that doesn't mention something accurately so as not to cause panic for today's crypto users.",

      "body": "I believe Binance just posted proof of having over seventy billion dollars worth of coins in their reserve. It would take a whole lot of withdrawals before they’d be anywhere near a position to stop them. The big concern to have with Binance is that their BNB token is not a ton different than Luna or FTT. If you see BNB suddenly start taking a dive, then I’d advise you get everything off Binance. So long as their token holds value, they won’t have any problems, just like FTT and Luna.",

I see this information may not be true considering the information is not from the official source.CZ did not make a single statement regarding the suspension of the temporary withdrawal on his official twitter account.",

I don't have much left in my binance account as I only use it for trading and then get out my funds after. So for me, I am not in panic mode about this. For now, check the announcements first before depositing funds. Binance has their insurance in place, so no matter what, I believe your funds are safe in case of worst scenarios.",
