Now considering someone who is a gambling addict, is there any possibility of him/her becoming better if they are relocated to another environment or society where people around are not involved in gambling?If a certain gambling addict would be moved out on a place which he had been surrounded by people who arent into gambling then it would really be just common sense that he would really be finding a local physical casino which he would definitely be seeing those co-gamblers who would really be playing because it is really just having two possible ways on dealing or playing gambling whether on physical or online ones.If we do talk about online gambling then it wont really be an issue no matter where you do make yourself placed and as an addict then you wont really be caring into your surroundings most of the timeor simply been ignored because the main priority you do have is to play no matter whose around or no matter on where you are which it wont really be that an issue after all.",

Having a self-control will still matter here because by this, you can be more effective and might be able to stop that gambling addiction to happen. Changing environment will only give you a positive lifestyle, and its really your choice.",

Remember he can even still be able to access the gambling site he is using in his former environment even if he has changed his environment. So all he needs to gamble can be with him in just one room, so nothing changed.",

Bring this someone to an isolated fishing village with nothing and in a week he will become a fisherman. Its going to change his activity within a day and although he may miss gambling, he might not find someone who'd play with him. The last thing he may just be doing is watch TV to replace the entertainment he was used to.This is reflects to who his companions are just as the phrase \"tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are\". Your friends are part of your environment.",

They rely on fast earning by doing gambling to get a fast luxury life.According to many experiences in the Psychology field, patients with behavioral addiction fr gambling can fight their illness by doing alternative productive activities and the rest of the time doing sports and other hobbies. It's the illusion of becoming rich fast which guide them to addiction.",

If the gambling addict decided to divert his attention away from gambling activities and do other time-consuming hobbies.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 04, 2022, 09:33:15 PMCan someone still develop the habit of gambling and become an addict even though no one around gambles?Yes, being hooked on gambling can happen to anyone.  Regardless of the environment as long as he has access to a gambling platform and decided to put huge time and attention into this kind of activity.",

Seeing them drink influences him to drink as well.  A person has to fight the urge whether he is addicted to gambling or alcohol, he has to first be influenced by the environment.A crowd full of addicts, its a party and the judging eyes will not even work for them.",

The gambling addict is due to the habit factor, freedom in his life so that he does't  discipline himself. Getting better depends on himself, whether he will continue gambler addict or not, even if he is placed by the family to a healthy environment.Well now, the world is getting advanced with new technology he can develop himself as a gambling addict through the internet and digital money, unless he doesn't have both it might be difficult.",

Do you think that these gamblers are totally out of their mind because they are addicted? Why there's a need for them to be relocated and force them to change if they know what they are doing. Didn't you realize that professional gamblers are all addicted to gambling?To answer directly your question, gambling is everywhere. Even if they will be put in an environment or society where people are not involved in gambling, these gamblers can still find a way to gamble. Everyone has an access to the internet, buddy. Imagine even those in a place where gambling is illegal, for sure there are not many gamblers around there, but these people can still find a way to gamble.If the goal is to stop these people, put them on a gambling recovery program and focus to change their mindset to do other activities.",

It takes courage to let someone change or maybe a hard lesson that they won't forget but it's up to them in the end.",
