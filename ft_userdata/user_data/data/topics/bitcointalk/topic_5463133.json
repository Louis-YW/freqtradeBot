  "content": "Update: The withdrawal was released Update: Winnings were credited back. Withdrawal is pending. What happened::  Crashino.com corrected down $80 from my winnings. The Crashino saga started again! I have been there for two years, and I am not regular there. But I still play there because of their good promotions. They offer generous bonuses each Friday. With their delayed payment habit, I started gambling again in the last two months. A few days ago, I won $110 From my deposit bonus free spins, and they triggered KYC because of that. They send me an email asking for the documents, which I send within an hour. Then I noticed they canceled my withdrawal, and my funds were on my Crashino balance. I decided to play again, and I got another good win. Then I requested another withdrawal while I was still waiting for KYC verification. Their support said it may take up to 24 hours. I contacted their support again, and they said no documents were uploaded to my account. FYI, there is no option in Crashino to upload your documents. They requested to send the documents to payments@crashino.com, which I did a few days ago.I contacted efialtis through Btcgosu.com, and he  also contacted them. After a few hours, I received a $150 withdrawal. My withdrawal was $230.19; they paid $150 and deducted the $80 without explaining. I contacted the support agent to know what could be the reason. FYI, I was triggered KYC, which seems I passed. Their response is;“Thank you for waiting. Please be informed that according to our Terms and Conditions section 12.10 The maximum withdraw-able amount from the winnings generated from ANY no deposit bonus (cash, free spins, free money bonus with wagering, loyalty points etc) is 100$ or equivalent currency. If the wins are generated from ANY bonus that is tied to a deposit (reload bonus, deposit free spins, etc), the withdraw-able amount is 250$.”I cannot stop laughing, to be honest.First of all, I deposited $50 and $110 winnings from that deposit bonus free spins.2nd Of all, The rest $110 dollar was from my bonus game playing;https://replay.pragmaticplay.net/rsShIrCS8XIf all the winnings were from free spins, it still does not exceed the $250 limit, while my latest $110 winning was from “Buy free spins”.Then their support asked me to wait, and they later said they would inform me via email. It's been three days, and I contacted them six times in the last three days. I am stuck in a loophole now. Contact live support >> Explain everything >> They check and copy and paste the same response like please wait. We are investigating the case>> Contact live support again.

Just consider the $80 that was withheld as them, the casino owners, taking back their bonus that was given to you. And even in the said casino profile you dropped here, the account handler has not been active since April 18, 2023, so I also doubt they will come and respond to this accusation.You can try sending them a personal PM; maybe an email notification might draw their attention back to this forum.",

Do you even know what are you talking about? Are you sure that I have scammed someone? The only thing I did is disrespected the forum rules by evading the ban. My account was unbanned later and I am not evading the ban anymore. I got several tags because of the mistakes I did in the past. Several other accounts are evading the ban and the only difference between them and me is they were not exposed yet. However, I am the one who is misunderstood by the forum community. People learn from their mistakes. I have learned things but I was not given a 2nd chance by the community even though the forum's officials decided to give me a 2nd chance. Breaking forum rules seems like the end of the world here. Anyway, this is not the topic. Do you know what it's called when someone comments on a matter that he is not aware of? It' signature spammer.",

But according to their T&C gamblers can withdraw $250 earned from bonus, free spins but wondering why your balance has been deducted. Only the gambling site's team can explain this properly, but their representative on this forum has been offline for a long time. Now you need to keep in touch with their support team, update here what they conclude.Quote12.10. The maximum withdraw-able amount from the winnings generated from ANY no deposit bonus (cash, free spins, free money bonus with wagering, loyalty points etc) is 100$ or equivalent currency.

All the red tags he got are for ban evading not for scamming. Besides, even if he was a scammer, this does not give the casino the right to scam him and steal his rightfully earned money.OP, unfortunately there isn't much you can do right now except keeping in touch with customer support and wait since their official representative on this forum seems to be inactive.",

      "body": "Long story short. I deposited $50 and received 100 Free spins as a deposit bonus. I won $110 from that free spins. My total balance was $161. I requested a withdrawal and they cancel it asking for KYC. I did KYC and played again with this $161. I used \"Buy free spins\" in Kraken's sky bounty game and won another $112 from this game. After this session, my balance was $230.19, and requested to withdraw them all. Crashino.com send $150 to my wallet and $80 was deducted from my balance. The support agent said The maximum withdraw-able amount from the winnings generated from ANY no deposit bonus (cash, free spins, free money bonus with wagering, loyalty points etc) is 100$ or equivalent currency. If the wins are generated from ANY bonus that is tied to a deposit (reload bonus, deposit free spins, etc), the withdraw-able amount is 250$.”Well, even if they consider all the winnings were from free spins, still it does not exceed the $250 limit. The problem is; I am stuck in a loophole. Every time I contact them, I have to explain why it was a mistake and they say they forwarded it to the team and they never come back. It's not rocket science to check if a user made a deposit or not. The only thing they need to check is if it was tied with a deposit bonus or not. At first, they needed a KYC, and now they have nothing to ask for. I provided the KYC because the amount is kinda good.",
