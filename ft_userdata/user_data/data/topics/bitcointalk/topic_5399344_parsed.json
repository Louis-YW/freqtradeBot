Just be patient, there can be more dip or the price may increase little and later more dip result, but a time is coming the market will be full more of the bulls and ATH will be achieved.Stable coins are still stable except the algorithmic ones like UST, do not buy algorithmic stables coins, they are not stable.",

Did you check the market aggregator websites? Most of them are, the ones we should be concerned about as intermediary use like USDT and USDC.QuoteThe market is still in a bearish zone, but when things return to normal, and we'll see the bulls? Such questions have no answers, just like questions on existential BS. It is better to avoid such questions because when the bull market arrives you will sulk that you cannot buy at such high prices and neither do you have bitcoin to sell at high prices. Bear market is the time to buy the asset, not to predict when bull market will come in.To be successful at trading, you should be waiting for the bear markets to start so you can voraciously buy. If you are not one of those, you need to rethink your game.",

Not only cryptocurrencies, but commodities, stocks and forex as well.This may be reasonable due to sentiment from the FED's policy regarding interest rates, then the pandemic and the possibility of war that is still hot in Europe (Ukraine and Russia).I'm sure this will change in the future because there will be a lot of improvisation in the future to improve the economic situation, so the possibility of recovery and bullish potential is still there in the future.The best strategy is to make regular purchases and hold.",

UST is different from USDT, it has a backup with bitcoin, meaning that UST coins are very easily damaged when bitcoin is in a bear market and experiences a sharp decline. But the real purpose of stable coins is to hold assets during a bear market, this is exactly the opposite of what UST has.",

I'd expect another 6-12 months bearish markets and then some time sideways market. In the long run it will also depend on new innovations and how strict the regulation will be in the most important countries. After that we might see another bull market, but who knows if old ATHs will be reached. Many coins and tokens won't reach their old ATHs is my guess",

If you don't want to miss out on the next train better stash some alts to your portfolio including Btc. Trust me you'll never regret it, just choose reliable alts or the top 10 or 20 alts in the market. USD pegged coins could also have tiny fluctuations just like the currencies in forex.",
