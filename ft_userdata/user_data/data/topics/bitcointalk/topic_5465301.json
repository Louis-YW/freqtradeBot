  "content": "NT Rugs Since 1941 A rug is a type of moveable floor covering, typically made from woven material. Rug-makers can make these coverings from various materials using a range of different methods. There are natural fiber rugs, like wool, silk, or jute rugs, and synthetic fiber rugs, like polyester and stain-resistant olefin rugs. Some rugs feature a combination of natural and synthetic fibers, like blending silk with viscose to increase durability. The material of a rug can affect price, durability, design, and feeling.
