My final and current account balance is 1181 euros.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407378.0A month ago, they limited my account, so I requested a 500 euros withdrawal, which has not happened until now. I sent them 30.11. the necessary documents for KYC verification that they requested from me. Since then, the withdraw is still pending. They don't respond to emails at all, and on live chat I always get the same answer that I should wait. I haven't bypass any their rules and I'm not even in profit on my account.I hope that at least here I will get some normal answer from them.Deposit: https://postimg.cc/TppVxpCQhttps://postimg.cc/sG1h3N91Withdraw:https://postimg.cc/Q9dBqyzSChatlog:https://postimg.cc/Rqq662KZhttps://postimg.cc/hJpvh0Gmhttps://postimg.cc/0zvyf4Mmhttps://postimg.cc/mcXZT2dNhttps://postimg.cc/ftVzynp4",

When they are active again in the forum they will understand what is really going on. Yas.bet's profile will remain tagged until OP's problem is resolved. Visiting the profile of Yas bet representative in this forum, I saw that he is offline for some time. So Op's complaint will remain open until they come back online.",

This is a first one for meThe documents you sent are very sensitive and can easily be sold on the darkweb. The support is very terrible. I am not sure why you choose this new casino yet there are so many old trustworthy ones.I am leaving them a negative tag as well.",
