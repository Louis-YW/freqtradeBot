The opendime contains the private key that no one knows until you punch the tiny hole on the device to sweep the funds. The QR code on the TI slab is the public address that is associated with the opendime This was not a public release. This was something that was offered to me by Liquid and I was very grateful I was given the chance to purchase. There are only 2 of these made and I believe the other one is colored yellow instead of purple. This is probably the only TI slab with this design you'll see out in the wild.",

I am honestly surprised this hasn't sold yet. I totally get it when it comes to the open-dime separation, comes down to personal preference. That's why I didn't load it, scared I would lose the opendime or it would end up getting bit-rot 15-20 years from now and wouldn't be able to move the funds.",

If you're not interested just move on, but someone needs to call out childish gatekeeping \"real fan of this or that\" type stuff because that can spread.
