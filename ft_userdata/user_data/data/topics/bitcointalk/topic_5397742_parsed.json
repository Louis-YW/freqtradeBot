Drop the type of GPUs you currently own.",

It's not base on the coin but rather on the DeFi that offering the coin farming since they dictate the standards on APY structure of the token they are listing?

Shorter claim period means more has fee it consume especially if you are on Ethereum network so I don't see the sense on looking for shortr time frame.",
