There is more chances of price falling down, before the next push. For now the chances of reaching $4k is low. There is big expectation of price bump during the time of merge. Same time some have stated that the merge will lead to drop in price before rallying. This looks like the chance is narrow for $4000 in 2022.",

While this seems hard to achieve right now, it could very well happen in the long term. Ethereum is in a very enviable position right now, and they are currently the leader in smart contracts, dapps, and other platforms built on top of blockchains. So there are a lot of reasons for optimism about it. But we cannot predict the future. No one can. So do not take this as a guarantee of anything.",

      "body": "I highly doubt if Ethereum would reach that price at our current market condition but if it's bull run and Bitcoin is pumping I might consider your takes but this is crypto currency market. No one knows what future holds and besides I think it's best to just accumulate more ETH or BTC this time since the price is quite cheap unlike when it's on a bull run.I think once the ATH is done it won't happen twice, so thinking that ETH would touch the $4k again is quite impossible if we are in a bearish market. We need more time again before the bull run happens and I think it's an accumulation period so gather up more ETH and BTC or any crypto currency you like to invest when it's currently cheap.",

If inflation has peaked, fed rates will ease or reduce, unemployment numbers will go up slightly then there is a possibility that ETH might hit ATH in 2023. Along with Bitcoin and stock markets.However bond yields are starting to go up again and looks like stock market got a bounce and might head lower. Inflation most likely topped however since oil is down. However nobody knows exactly if the bottom was hit or not.",

And yes as well that while bitcoin is struggling altcoins is making progress especially ethereum reasons there's an altcoins season.  And tbh ever since before i never seen some altcoins that makes hypes despite of the bear market aside of those new projects because they are very common and always makes hypes at the first run so it's not surprising..",

Usually, after the ATH, it won't be there quickly unless we go again with a bull run and the possibility of hit reaching to $4k is after the next bull run. And that's likely to occur on the next halving around 2024. It could be earlier than that or after the bitcoin halving.Why bitcoin plays a part? Everyone knows that bitcoin is the one that starts the market's situation for bull run and the bear market. That's why if you're looking for it to happen by this year, I don't want to give you to have that expectation.",

While this seems hard to achieve right now, it could very well happen in the long term.Indeed. Achieving $4k isn't impossible in the long run, probably to achieve in the next bullrun. But to reach it this year, seems almost impossible, we have nothing to trigger it increasing 170%. We are in the bearish period, each crypto coin is in the period of decreasing its values drastically. ETH is also experiencing a big decrease in value, so it is actually in the opposite situation hoping for a 170% increase. In addition, we are in Q3 of 2022, not enough time to expect a significant move from $1,6k to $4k. Moreover, no big news about something to boost the hype of ETH.",
