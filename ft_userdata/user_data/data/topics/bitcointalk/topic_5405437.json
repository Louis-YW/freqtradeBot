  "content": "Good evening guys! I have about 2.990mbtc in Electrum Wallet and I need money to buy something but I don't know how to transfer and also I am the only person using BTC in my village so the thing is disturbing me very badly. I don't know what to do again. Even the vendors around the city area as I made some contacts don't Know mbtc. So I am at the confused stage of the whole issue. And this is my first to that I want sell MBTC. Nobody that I have explained mbtc that knows the value on BTC. So what should I do to cash out the money from the Electrum Wallet to fiat currency? Or can I convert it to Fiat currency within the Electrum Wallet? And also I am not really familiar with or fluently uses Electrum Wallet. But that is not the real issue, the main issue here is how I can transfer the money to another Wallet of any kind without any issue.",

Or can I convert it to Fiat currency within the Electrum Wallet?The quickest way to cash out your money to Fiat would be by using an exchange. And no, you aren't able to convert your mBTC holdings to fiat within the Electrum Wallet because the software is just that - a wallet. This means that it basically holds whatever amount of BTC that you wish which, in this case, is around ~ $60 / 59 € (Euros is almost at the same rate as USD, who would have thought?).If you're looking for an exchange and aren't bothered with KYC procedures (where you'll have to send to the exchange your ID details and such) then I guess you could use Kraken[1] (stay away from Coinbase as much as you can). When you get an account in the exchange, you'll get an address from where you'll be able to send your current amount of BTC to it. You'll then be able to trade that amount for fiat by selling it in the market. Do note that this will have some fees[3] involved and considering the amount is small you may end up losing quite a bit with these couple of actions.Your second option would be to pay for a service/good that you are interested in by using BTC. You talk about local sellers, but the beauty of BTC is that you can use it universally. Here's[3] a website that you can check that accepts BTC as a payment option - ranging from VPS,VPN's, Gift Cards, Virtual Phone numbers ...If I were you I would seriously consider the second option considering the effort and fees involved in the first one.[1]https://www.kraken.com/[2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5253616.0[3]https://kycnot.me/services",

I don't know what to do again. Even the vendors around the city area as I made some contacts don't Know mbtc.mBTC is a subunit of BTC. If it disturbs you, you can change from using it.Indeed, Electrum uses mBTC by default, but you can go to:Tools->Preferences and in the \"General\" tab select as Base Unit BTC instead of mBTC.Quote from: Agbe on July 06, 2022, 09:12:01 PMAnd also I am not really familiar with or fluently uses Electrum Wallet.

I am very happy for your help. I have finally converted it to BTC. Now it will be very easy for me to sell it but to see a buyer is an another issue but is like I will use the decentralized option to sell it off. I really appreciate your help and others for the help render to me for this thread. I was really confused of what to do but now I am getting better. I have learned new thing a again.

Is saying convert 1 gram to kilogram or anything like that wrong? Bitcoin is bitcoin, but if it is denomination, you can convert from higher denomination of a particular thing to a lower denomination and vice versa.Although, Electrum will do that automatically, so saying he has converted it to BTC should have not been used. I have changed it to or selected BTC would have been more appropriate.Never mind this, I am not serious about this , but just the way I see it.",
