What do you think?Hope you are OK, my friend. Bitcoin price has been rising. We have had close to 100% increase in price this year. It will continue to rise until +30,000, then it will drop below 25,000 and start to rise again until it hit new highs.The price will increase shortly for the sake of this post to prove to you it's rising. Let's cross 30,000,is that okay?",

Of course it's normal for it's price to go up and down due to it's volatility but we could say it's still rising unlike to it's current price before reaching the half of this month. Maybe in the next few months we could see some improvement to it's price. But if there's any issues about BTC i think the transactions fees that take too long due to many users which is still common that could affect people's decision to hodl their BTC.",

You can't draw a conclusion on that, remember bitcoin has gone down the dip to $15,000 before things begin to surge fine till we arrived $29,000 and finally now on $27,000, who knows what may be the aftermath to this occurrences happening about ordinals and high transaction fee, bitcoin may rise or fall more but we can't be accurate with this prediction as to when it may occur, not even now that we are getting closer the the next halvig which will unleashed another bullrun that we all expects, it's better to always remain being speculative in studying the trends on the moves with bitcoin price than concluding yet because anything ca happen anytime soon.",

If the market price can rise from $19k to $30k this year 2023 before the price decreased to $27k few hours ago, show that the price of BTC is rising which there is a hope that the price will increase higher to reach $40k before it will return back to bear again. If you have not purchase BTC, I will advice you to visit the market since the price has reduced to $27k because many researchers has predicted massive pumping of BTC this year which people has started experiencing it from the beginning of this year.",

Currently Bitcoin price falls, but it will not continue and  some changes will happen in upcoming days. Most of the recent researches indicates that the price of Bitcoin will increase by end of the May 2023. So don't loose your hope that Bitcoin is not rising. Surely it will rise but it will need some time.",

We need to recognize that the lowest that it has hit earlier this year was $16k.And then last end of the year was $15k. While we see it plummet from $29k down to $26k, it's still a better price from those that it has been right?",

What do you think?Well, you may be right, and you know what? it's the beauty of BTC that anyone (not you) tries to predict the BTC price and BTC has the potential to shock you (sorry them). (i hope you got my point). So the point is, no wonder, much bad news came this year plus the fees increment due to BRC-20 tokens (ordinals), pressure from USA banks, and SEC's charges, Despite all of this news, BTC still rising, and it will go for another ATH in 2024 but you are mainly concerned about this year.So, maybe, we could face some bad news and some good news about market and the market will provide us entries to get benefit from the halving. If your main concerns are to get 2x to 5x in this year from BTC then it's not possible but if you want to make money in small portions like by doing swing or day trading then these 6 months will provide great opportunities. Plus, you should provide proof or at least a source to verify your statements.",

What do you think?Bitcoin is up 30% from its lows, so tell me again how t is not rising. I feel like you are watching the charts, but have them set to 5m and see only the last couple weeks. Let me ask you 2 questions:1. What are you looking at when comparing commodities and bitcoin? Gold had its lows in November, pretty much like bitcoin, then rose in January, but went through a correction in February and kept rising in March-May. It's the same exact situation as bitcoin! Gold is now higher than it was in February and so is bitcoin. Don't expect it to go hand in hand all the time. Bitcoin can correct 5% while gold corrects 2% but it's still in an uptrend. Both of them are.2. Are you worried by bitcoin correcting 10%? If you are then you've invested too much. I hold a decent amount of BTC and I'm not scared at all.",

But not now,  now Bitcoin price will increase some times and some times its price will decrease. But when bitcoin price will stable avabe $30k and it will stay some days then we called it as a bull run. Although we have to prepared for big down. Because it can be happen any time.",

Remember, we are expecting a halving next year in 2024, and while I am not sure how the price rose prior to the last halving, I am confident that the Bitcoin price will soon begin to rise once the issue of mempool congestion and high transaction fees is resolved. Quote Out of  100% of international market chats bitcoin is beneath the range price counts of crude oil, gas, gold and diamond, that's means bitcoin is far from rising soon. Crude oil and gas are closely monitored by governments and high-profile individuals because they are natural resources whose value will always rise because people cannot survive without them, whereas Bitcoin is a digital currency that some governments have yet to accept due to its decentralized system, but it is still on the rise as people around the world adopt Bitcoin.QuoteWhat do you think?We must be patient and trust the Bitcoin process because it provides us with financial freedom.The Bitcoin market will soon rise.",

Out of  100% of international market chats bitcoin is beneath the range price counts of crude oil, gas, gold and diamond, that's means bitcoin is far from rising soon. What do you think?The answer is that we are in the bear market, simply as that. Look at last year, the lowest low is $15,500. And if I'm not mistaken, we have double that up this year when we peak at $31k last month.So to say that it is not rising is very wrong. Maybe the idea of you that bitcoin is going parabolic is also not right in the beginning. There are not assets that can do that, not even BTC.And we are not yet in the bitcoin block halving, that catalyst of the bull run, it will happen next year. So it's better for you to wait or accumulate bitcoin.",

Do you know what you're saying OP??We are only at the 5th month of the year, and we know that anytime soon, Bitcoin can go up even more. If you will say that the reason why it will not rise this year is the Ordinals, or BRC-20 hype, it might affected it's price negatively, but I believe that when the hype is over, Bitcoin will start to rise up again soon. It already reached the $30,000 price a few months ago, and it will happen again.I will ask you OP. When do you think will Bitcoin rise then if it will not be this year? Another one is, for you what is the definition of \"rise\" because I believe that it happened already since we've seen Bitcoin up 64% already year-to-date. I think that the reason why you created a thread like this is because you are one of the investors who are panicking on what's happening on Bitcoin right now.",
