  "content": "Bitcoin continues to make impressive gains as we enter the second quarter of 2023, surging more than 80% from the beginning of the year until now. This increase in value has sparked new optimism about cryptocurrency, resulting in a doubling of the number of Bitcoin millionaires. As of April 16th, over 50,000 new Bitcoin millionaires have emerged, with a total of 80,659 millionaire addresses recorded.According to data provided by BitInfoCharts.com, 74,550 different addresses currently hold a balance of Bitcoin worth more than $1 million. Additionally, 5,708 addresses hold BTC worth more than $10 million.Using the Wayback Machine web archive, on January 5th, 2023, there were about 24,279 addresses owning Bitcoin equivalent to at least $1 million, while 3,805 addresses owned BTC worth more than $10 million.The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, which has reached an all-time high of $31,000, is likely the reason for the appearance of many new Bitcoin millionaires. Despite the banking crisis that occurred in March and negative news surrounding Binance, people are still turning to Bitcoin as their top investment choice.As investors look for ways to diversify their portfolio, Bitcoin continues to be a top option for many, offering a sense of stability and potential for significant returns. This increase in the number of Bitcoin millionaires highlights the growing interest and confidence in cryptocurrency as a viable investment option.Source: https://azcoinnews.com/the-number-of-bitcoin-millionaires-doubles-in-2023.html",

Bitcoin price will still dump below 30k,which makes it not ATH. There must be an halving event before ATH,this makes me think that the author of this article doesn't understand bitcoin movement and cyclic,that it is historical. It is true that the new bitcoin millionare will double that of last year because bitcoin faced the bearish market due to the crash of exchanges like Luno and FTX a big exchange last year,this had a bad effect on bitcoin price. Social medias and government went on to spread the FUD on bitcoin, which added a negative impact on the adoption of bitcoin and its price. This year bitcoin price started the pump,SVB e.t.c crashed and USD depreciated due to some economy challenges which was caused by inflation. All these put together made many investors withdraw their funds from the banks and invested it on bitcoin, since bitcoin is use as a store of value. Bitcoin adoption is a continuous exercise that is ongoing and will not come to an end,only if bitcoin fails.",

The point still stands!",

      "body": "This is based purely on the addresses, from what I see, and it's hard to think what to make of it. If it's purely based on the price, then there were more 'millionaires' when the price was around $50k, $60k, right? In that case, there's no trend to be observed here. But more importantly, it's hard to estimate how many of these addresses belong to individuals and various of them are known to belong to businesses (like crypto exchanges), so they don't reflect the number of millionaires (as individuals having at least $1 million). Also, if it's based purely on the price change, then it means that the distribution of coins isn't really changing, but if it is (and more addresses are crossing a certain threshold in Bitcoin), then it's of more significance.",

Because it is not necessary for a human being to become a Bitcoin millionaire using the mining method only. They can also buy 1 million BTC with their fiat, plus the mining reward is very big enough to make anyone a millionaire.  If your concerns are about, Innovation of BTC towards advanced science then I must say so far BTC has had no impact on advanced sciences indirectly but if I say directly, then it has a great impact on advanced sciences because it came up with its own blockchain technology which has a mechanism of decentralization and this blockchain is mainly used in advance sciences to provide tamper-free and decentralized protocols such as the following companies has been using it.GolemOcean ProtocolThese are just few from the huge list.",

We have been faced with a complicated situation after the pandemic, people have difficulty getting out of financial problems and economic stability is really disrupted because there is no stability of normal income per capita. Then a question arises from me, how is it possible that people are taking huge investment opportunities in bitcoin, while the economy is really taking a hit with some of the chaos going on, they were very difficult to make ends meet and many businesses went bankruptIncreasing the number of addresses holding more than $1 million does not give any guarantee that they are new millionaires in bitcoin and I am more sure they are old investors using lots of new storage addresses and there is a reason why they are trying to create lots of new wallets.",

This increase in the number of bitcoin millionaires will not stop here, we will see a surge of it in the future because the ROI is crazy.

Many people for sure made profit given that it only took 3 months from $15k to reach $30k. But the samme reason could be a warning. There is a huge and long over bought on Bitcoin's chart which could be a sign that a correction may take place to give way for altcoin season which is believed to start this year as well. Bitcoin's market price is expected to again break its ATH next year if not this year, due to the anticipated bitcoin halving. Things won't go smoothly so expect for things to not be consistent on its way, in terms of its market value. You may take profit and wait for the correction but ofcourse you could also just hold through ups and downs; depends on your preference.",

It is affected by global economic and political events and these events are unpredictable. So I have decided to accept the movement of the market the way it works out because it can not be perfectly observed.",
