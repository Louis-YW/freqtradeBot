  "content": "It is important for those who are new at trading or have been with trading for some time. While taking a small trade or doing technical analysis, there are some other things besides Bitcoin's chart which can help us to accurately catch the movement of Bitcoin. With the help of this things the next movement of Bitcoin can be predicted a lot. The subjects are;-1. USDT DominanceYou can say that it has the opposite relationship with Bitcoin. If you see USDT Dominance bullish, then the market will go down. Or you can say that the price of Bitcoin will decrease. For this reason, draw the support and resistance on the USDT Dominance chart in the Longer Time frame. Be careful when it's on the support or in the resistance. Do not take trades at support and resistance until USDT Dominance gives clear movement.2. BITCOIN Dominance.See it before taking entry in Alts.BTC Dominance Bullish means people are moving there money from alts to BTC. BTC Dominance Bullish means Alts will go down and BTC dominance bearish means Alts will pump. Sometimes it is seen that the price of Bitcoin increases but all other coins remain almost the same. By watching BITCOIN Dominance You will find it.3. US Dollar Index (DXY)This is very important. Dxy also has the opposite relationship with Bitcoin. DXY bullish means the market will go down. Bearish means the price will go up.4. US StocksWe all say that Alts follow BTC. But who does BTC follow?- Bitcoin follows US Stocks, S & P 500, and Nasdaq.Bitcoin, US Stocks and Nasdaq are like friends. Bitcoin goes in the same direction where the friends go.  S & P 500, Nasdaq Bullish means BTC bullish, bearish means BTC bearish.I tried to explain as simply as possible. Let me know if you have any questions.You can see these charts if you search in Trading View.USDT Dominance= USDT.D BTC Dominance= BTC.DUS Dollar Currency Index= DXY S & P 500= SPXNasdaq= NDX",

No. It means that last days market was going down. It does not indicate the future as it may be a reversal point or close to it or not even close. Same here:Quote from: Sabbir Hossen on September 25, 2022, 08:13:27 AM2. BITCOIN Dominance.See it before taking entry in Alts.BTC Dominance Bullish means people are moving there money from alts to BTC. BTC Dominance Bullish means Alts will go down and BTC dominance bearish means Alts will pump. Again. It means that alts were dumping/pumping last days not the fact that it will continue to do that in the future. It may be a reversal point or close to it or not even close.Quote from: Sabbir Hossen on September 25, 2022, 08:13:27 AMThis is very important. Dxy also has the opposite relationship with Bitcoin. DXY bullish means the market will go down. Bearish means the price will go up.DXY bullish means the bitcoin most likely were going down last days. Not that it will continue to go down in the future.",

      "body": "Could be true to some extent however there is also one simple fact about bitcoin and Altcoins that everyone keeps forgetting. Most of the alts are traded against BTC pair. This means as soon as bitcoin price is changed market corrects the volume for the particular pair of btc/alt and thus we see them pumping and dumping together and we see similar graphs for them on the trading platform. In simple terms, if btc is worth X dollars at given point then alts also need to be worth X,btc at the same time. I mean it’s volatile market and bitcoin could be 60k or it could be 20k and alts also need to correct them accordingly.",

      "body": "In this period, you should connect all markets (stock, real estate, crypto ...) to globally and locally policies as well as regulations.FED decisions to escalate or de-escalate interest rate will affect all markets. However, we all know how bad the hyper inflation globally has been since the last two years. Market makers simply take advantage of their super power and use FED decisions as free gifts to spread fuds around all markets.Soon you will see the market moves oppositely to what it usually reacted previously with similar announcement from FED. That is how forced liquidations will be triggered and how market will move upwards strongly from bottom.",
