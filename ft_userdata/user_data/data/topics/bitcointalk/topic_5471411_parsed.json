Seems not a bad idea, but the deleting of posts is probably unnecessary as scrapers will simply make it easier to access them. If OP creates a throwaway email and password which he can’t remember, he should also create a thread on the reputation board with the idea that he wouldn’t be using the account again and possible many members will tag it, just in case someone else gets access to it they won’t be able to use it for any transaction on the forum again because of the tag should the Mods fail to delete it. This will be similar to how people that do not wish to take loan on the Forum have done. This prevents a scammer using it in future.",

Also, in rare cases an ID can be skipped (eg. if a database transaction gets rolled back).In April 2022, the number of deleted profiles (deleted or skipped IDs really) was 16.117, meaning the number of cases has not increased in a year and a half.Further back, in November 2018, I made the figure to be roughly the same (16K), so there really are no account deletions taking place nowadays.See also this post.",

Ninjastic is an independent scrapper just like Loycev.club, what they basically do is they take information and data here from Bitcointalk, moderators don't operate them and they officially have nothing to do with the forum post but God forbid, if the forum is lost or hacked today, they can still serve as a backup to get things back quickly because they contain almost every line of post that are posted here on this forum since their launch. But who knows if the global moderator also has its independent scrapper?I think OP made a mistake with his username and is looking for a way to change it and that's why he is looking for a way to delete it and create another one, there is nothing logical for a user who has fewer than 5 posts to delete his account unless if the user fears about his email which he can just change or just forget about the account.",
