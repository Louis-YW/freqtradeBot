Now the time has come when Silvergate has finally decided to shut down its business.Is it going too quickly? The answer is no actually. The whole process of shutting down the Silkveragte would need around 2 years of projected time. The reason behind this is very simple, it was the biggest lender around the market and thus they have loans that are under recovery. Due to its collapse, the lender has to regain control of all their paid-out money along with the interests. This is the process that will take another 2 years of the timeline to shut it completely.

I personally did not expect Silvergate to have this much of a negative effect on the price of Bitcoin, but here we are...",

Looking at how the market fares these days, I don't think a domino effect is imminent considering that this news is already a few days old too, and bitcoin as well as other blue chip cryptocurrencies out there are performing a little better than compared to last year, granted valuation declined these past few days by more or less 7%. In any case, the death of Silvergate is something that the cryptocurrency industry will take years to recuperate, and the fact that the other crypto lender also fell down last year just goes to show how impernanent the industry is in its current form. Newer and better renditions are badly needed to combat issues that we are currently facing.",

I do not know why, but since they are central entities, at least they should have a plan to diversify their investments or ensure liquidity, not how to collect more money and expand quickly.",

As quite often in history we've seen that the ripple effects of one company can effect many unrelated and unexpected companies in a type of contagion. Let's hope it's nothing like the 2008 financial crisis which gradually got worse as new financial scandals were discovered when the first bank started to fail. Hopefully the US government and other governments are able to draw a line underneath this bank, although unfortunately it'll probably be taxpayers who end up bailing out endless greed and reckless behavior by a few individuals. From the small parts I've read, they've actually got enough assets to cover the company, they're just not liquid enough (US treasuries) to cash out big sums as quickly as customers wanted to redeem them.",
