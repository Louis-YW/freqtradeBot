And is there any better option from P2P trading?It's safe to use but there's no guarantee that the other party won't charge back after you release the bitcoins (if you're the one selling) So if you're going this route, and instead of trading with one person for big amounts, do smaller amounts with multiple individuals. You should also check the (recent) feedback of the person you're dealing with.Which payment methods you're going to use though? If you're already willing to submit your documents to use Binance's P2P platform, why not just use a reputable CEX and buy directly from it? The rates might be a bit higher, but at least you're eliminating the risk.",

Your coins or tokens can be seized as they are centralized.It is safe.Do not release coins unless you have seen the money sent to your account, not through text message but through checking your account balance. I do not know about other transfer methods, they would be similar to bank transfers. Use a reputable buyer or seller. Do not be lured by people that unnecessarily hike their rate, you may think it will favour you, but it would be done in a way it will not.Quote from: Jawhead999 on August 05, 2022, 07:55:28 AMPersonally if I would do P2P trading, I'd choose to use either Bisq or localcryptos.That is true, but I see bisq to be the most decentralized.",

Not even on the forum except for a few users that have been verified by there trust ratings to be good to do business.Doing P2P exchange on binance is actually safe as, the exchange serves as a third party, an escrow between both buyer and seller and you only get to approve on coin release when you've been credited and have confirmed the amount on your account. On no account should you approve before confirmation.",

And is there any better option from P2P trading?P2P is currently one of the best way to buy and sell cryptocurrency and fiat currency. Yes I also have question about the user privacy. Moreover, considering other aspects, I think it is safe. When you will do the p2p trade if follow the step then I don't think you don't have to face the problem.  Before take trading please view the info and feedback. And I also says that avoid those accounts who have done few trade for large amount.",

And is there any better option from P2P trading?P2P Trades are best when you don’t like to do KYC on popular exchanges.If you are verified in Binance, then why don’t you directly sell there?Moreover I have done P2P deals at Paxful and localbitcoins only, so can’t tell you exactly about the P2P trader of Binance.Normally it’s advised that when doing P2P deals always go with the user with high trust, and don’t try reversible payment methods.Rest everything will be fine.",

And is there any better option from P2P trading?It's safe as long as you do p2p on those people with yellow check marks which means they are verified. Always remember that do not release the funds as long as you do not confirm that you have verified it. There are people that send screenshots that looks like they already send you the money but are really fake. I've done it many times using different mode of payment but didn't experienced any issues so far.",

And is there any better option from P2P trading?Other than checking the person account reviews in P2P if it has a good feedback, yes it is safe. P2P is the fastest way to withdraw your money, and you can ask the price you want if you're selling your coins. But if you're withdrawing your Bitcoin for example, then converting to an altcoin then send it to your local exchanger of cryptocurrency to fiat is much better for lower fee.",

And is there any better option from P2P trading?A peer-to-peer trade is also called P2P trading. It is a type of cryptocurrency trading that involves direct payments between users. A safe and fair trading environment is ensured by Binance P2P's escrow service. I have been using Binance p2p trading for over a year and have been quite happy with it. If you follow their instructions, then it doesn't matter whether you are a buyer or a seller.",

Otherwise you will never be able to trade on p2p You need to verify the KYC system to trade. Mobile SMS verification and ID card verification are required After various verifications you are given permission to trade on P2P.And from here you can never do corruption, if you do corruption you will be banned from P2P platform.So surely we can safely say it is a very safe platform.",

P2P trading is actually risky and prone to scammers and you need to be careful with the person that you have been trading. But as we can see, many people are using this platform meaning, it was a trusted exchange and all the transactions are safe unless you are about to visit the wrong site or clone site. As I've tried several time doing this and using the same platform, I could say it was safe.",

There's a bunch of stuff you need afaik, KYC being the first, before being able to transact so I think that gives enough for Binance to stand as the middle man. You should also be able to report suspicious transactions directly to Binance in case you get hit, they are a centralized exchange and can freeze an account if they deem it necessary. Just keep a record of every transaction and conversations you've made to be safe in case they want more info.",

But I'm not into it so instead, I'm into the spot trading just to be safe on my own conviction that I don't have to wait for some confirmation like this. Nevertheless, P2P in Binance is safe, and the platform itself is safe also, when you trade, always check the history of the person you're going to trade with.
