Before this one, we see punt.com that looks quite similar as stake and now we have bet999 which looks similar as betfury. Lets give this new site more time to prove how good they are, of course I do not recommend forum users to deposit and play in this new site but it is better to wait until there is someone or some people who are willing to test this new site.",
