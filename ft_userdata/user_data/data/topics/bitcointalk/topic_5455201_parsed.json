There is no significant information about who is behind the whole thing, contact addresses do not exist. Random address and map posted on the site.Terms and Conditions, the only page that has some text, is completely plagiarized.I'm leaving it here for reference, I'm not sure if it deserves a ban, given that plagiarism is outside the forum.",
