Firstly a couple years ago, and going back to around 2010, interest rates were rock bottom - around 2% for a long time. Which means your 6% mortgage figure is entirely worthless. Secondly, a house is not just an asset like gold that you buy and sit on hoping to flip for a profit. It is a home, it is a place of safety and rest, protection from the elements and a necessity of everyone. If you're not paying off your own mortgage to LIVE somewhere which is an essential fact of life, then you are renting and indirectly paying off someone elses mortgage. If you rented a property instead you have nothing to show at the end of it all. Property has gone up 10%+ some of those years, but the market fluctuates, there are some bigger winners than others but property absolutely is a solid investment - it doesn't need to be a gold mine.",

      "body": "A good reconstruction of the housing market but what you fail to include in this is the interference of banks and their fucking interest rates. Few years ago as what some people have pointed out already, interest rates were at the floor and so buying houses are so much more appealing, affordable, and feasible. Years forward we see the market crashing, inflation playing its part, and several other shenanigans that made it even harder to buy a house, which makes buying real estate/selling real estate a practically-viable passive income setting.If you still can’t believe this and are willing to really die on the hill of “real estate not profitable”, then perhaps I could introduce you to the world of renting out your property.",
