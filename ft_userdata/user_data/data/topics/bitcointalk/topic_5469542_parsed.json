  "content": "Since you cant delete your account here, and deleting posts manually one by one is a pain, i made a python script to automatically delete all posts that can be deleted, and to edit those which can only be edited (changes subject and message to \"x\")I couldnt find any terms of service for this website, so not sure if this is even allowed.RequirementsPythonChrome (you can edit the script yourself to change browser if you want)Selenium installed in pythonCode:pip install seleniumHow to useAfter installing selenium, simply run the python script, it will ask you how many pages of posts your account has (Profile -> Show Posts -> Highest page number available)just enter the number you see in your profile and then hit enter. It will then open up a chrome browser with the login page for bitcointalk open, you will have 60 seconds to log in and when the 60 seconds are up, the script will start deleting and editing posts from your profile.Note: When logging in, you should set number of minutes to be logged in to a higher number if you have many postsWARNINGThis should be obvious, but running this script will try to delete as many of your posts as it can, so dont run it if you dont want that..Code: https://github.com/SwayStar123/del_btctalk_postsCode:import reimport timefrom selenium import webdriverfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import Byfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWaitfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECfrom selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutExceptiondef extract_ids_from_url(post_url):    #

Yes there are no specific T&C which prevents you from writing the script also it depends on the user who's going to run the script. I just want to emphasize that it should come with some sort of clear warning before actually executing the script. For example  Please note all your \"xxxx\" number of posts will be permanently deleted/edited. Are you sure to execute the script type \"Yes\".:>_Quote from: hugeblack on October 08, 2023, 11:35:52 AMIs this even possible?
