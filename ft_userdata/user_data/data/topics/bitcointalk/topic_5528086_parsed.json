Is there something else you should be investing in, and that is where Larry will be putting BlackRock money? Or is he simply advising what is best for people?BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Forecasts $700K Bitcoin Price Amid Inflation Worrieshttps://www.activistpost.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-forecasts-700k-bitcoin-price-amid-inflation-worries/His projection, sparked by a discussion with a sovereign wealth fund, highlights the increasing momentum of institutional adoption and its potential to reshape market dynamics.Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently speculated that Bitcoin could potentially reach valuations as high as $700,000 per BTC. This projection arises against the backdrop of intensifying concerns about currency debasement and global economic instability, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems. Fink's remark was not an outright endorsement but rather a reflection on a recent meeting he had with a sovereign wealth fund. The fund sought advice from Larry Fink on whether to allocate 2% or 5% of its investment portfolio to Bitcoin. According to Fink, if institutional adoption continues to grow and similar allocation strategies are embraced broadly, market dynamics could drive Bitcoin to such remarkable heights.Fink made this striking statement during a recent interview, explaining that Bitcoin's potential for exponential growth is closely tied to fears of economic downturns and fiat currency devaluation. Fink described Bitcoin as an \"international instrument\" capable of mitigating localized economic fears.A Message to the MarketWith BlackRock managing $11.5 trillion in assets, Larry Fink's words carry significant weight, sending a clear message to retail and institutional investors alike. His endorsement transcends personal opinion, serving as a market signal about Bitcoin's potential trajectory. Long heralded as \"digital gold,\" Bitcoin is seen as a store of value that can protect wealth from inflation and governmental fiscal mismanagement. Fink's recognition of this narrative could further accelerate its adoption among traditional investors.A Timely ForecastLarry Fink's prediction comes as global economies grapple with soaring inflation, escalating national debts, and geopolitical tensions that threaten currency stability. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins and decentralized structure, presents an alternative asset class that is immune to the inflationary pressures inherent in fiat currencies. In this climate, its value proposition becomes increasingly compelling....",

Blackrock also bought $600 million worth of Bitcoin recently, probably on behalf of their customers. It was BlackRock and some other big guys that forced Gary Gensler to eat his words and accept Bitcoin Spot ETFs, so I think that BlackRock has very big plans with Bitcoin and they'll try their best to create a positive expectation for Bitcoin's growth. The CEO wants to get more benefits by motivating people to buy Bitcoin and I think many people will trust him because he is the CEO of one of the richest companies in the world, their job is to make money, and they know what they are doing.",

And I actually had to read through the entire write up to see if Larry was going to mention any particular time that Bitcoin is going to hit $700K, but I couldn't find anything like that, which proves to me that he's fully confident in what he is saying, and he's one of the few that truly understands how Bitcoin works.Quote from: BADecker on January 29, 2025, 10:10:50 AMThe real question is, is he just talking because it is going down, and he wants to get more benefit off people buying Bitcoin first.

He’s the CEO of BlackRock, the same company that launched a Bitcoin ETF, so they stand to benefit from Bitcoin’s rise through increased asset management opportunities. More investors mean more money flowing in, which means more fees for them, that’s literally how they make their money.So yeah, while he might truly be bullish on Bitcoin, the bigger picture is that his business benefits more when people are eager to invest.",

Bitcoin's overall trend suggests that it will still pump but pinpointing what price mark it will get to exactly isn't that easy. Buying pressure is basically what constitutes the pump of price of an asset and similarly selling off by  some investors after reaching a particular pump price is what causes retracement. If the overall buy pressure isn't strong enough then that retracement may very well escalate to a downtrend.What's the point of all this? Black rock is a big firm and as a result they have enough liquidity to kick off a strong pump before the news of it causes FOMO that also improves the pump. This is basically why most of their speculations turn out true.",

Yes, and so are the dozens of anti-Bitcoin during the 2018 bear market like Jaime Dimon. So it's obvious what is the narrative of Larry Fink here, they are business entities, one of the biggest if not the biggest multinational investment company.And for those who might not be aware, it's really very good to hear that Bitcoin is going up to this kind of price. But it's not that easy though, it will have to go to another bull and bear cycle and we all know that it happens every 4 years. So there is time as well in the equation here and it's not like this year, the price will go on a parabolic rise to $700k. He is just saying this so that their client invest more resulting to a huge profit on them.",
