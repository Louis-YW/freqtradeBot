  "content": "QuoteMigration is not an evil in itself and it is a part of life as people would naturally want to move to a different country despite having the best environment or economic conditions. However, it becomes worrisome when the numbers are increasing daily and depleting the talents within certain sectors of the economy. In recent times, the Nigerian health sector has been greatly impacted by the number of health workers leaving for the western world which makes you wonder at the current strength of the health sector of Nigeria. In January 2022, the Nursing and Midwifery Council of the United Kingdom reported that in 2021, a total of 3,782 Nigeria-trained nurses were granted licenses to operate in England and Scotland. Also, not less than 5,407 Nigerian doctors currently work with the British National Health Service. In addition, the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria reported that between 2020 & 2021, Nigeria has lost over 100 consultants. These statistics are greatly alarming and leaves one to wonder what exactly is the state and strength of our health sector.Within the pool of Nigerian professionals, emigration has led to the loss of various worthy talents. In 2019, the data released by the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) showed that 12,595 Nigerians relocated to Canada within that year. The IRCC data trend shows that the number of Nigerians relocating to Canada from 2015 to 2019 has consistently been on the increase, from 4,000 to 12,595 Nigerians respectively. Although emigration is not a recent trend of the millennium, it has gained much more momentum among young Nigerians. Between the 1950s and 1970s, we had the affluent citizens travel to the western countries for education, vacation and work opportunities, however, we had more indigenes returning home. The return could be attributed to the favourable economic conditions and availability of jobs and opportunities for young people. The reverse has become the case in the last two decades, where young Nigerians who even leave the country for educational purposes have no intention of returning.Source: https://fitc-ng.com/the-japa-syndrome-and-its-effect-on-talents-in-nigeria/My country people how una see this japa matter? The rate wey nigerians dey japa these days dey on the rise. According to an article wey I come across, last year records the highest numbers of nigerians wey leave the shores of this country in search of greener pastures. Even countries wey no dey attractive boys no mind dem just want japa. If our best brains dey follow this trend, where does that leaves us? How best do we address this japa syndrome?",

You go finish school no work, even those wey dey school dem no sure when dem go graduate because of constant strike by lecturers and finally when them come out no job. Security nko? That one na zero... No body dey save and people wey suppose protect you na them go dey oppress you. Price of things for market just dey rise anyhow... All these just dey make people come dey move. Like this ehhh, if I see way me too go japa. The major cause of this japa syndrome na bad leadership. In my own opinion, If we fit get good leaders wey go come up with good policies, provide quality education, create jobs, provide security so that foreign investors go come invest in Nigeria e go reduce de high rate people dey japa.",

That goes for the image so its not like, everyone is just running away to other nations.Again, I would say it's not abnormal for citizens from under developed and developing nations to seek green pastures over seas or in some developed nation. Its normal for people to want to do that and even take vacations.In a nation like Nigeria where most things are far from perfect, I wouldn't expect anything less of the citizens that can afford to spoil themselves or those who see a feature outside of the country.What I would say is, they shouldn't forget to develop home.
