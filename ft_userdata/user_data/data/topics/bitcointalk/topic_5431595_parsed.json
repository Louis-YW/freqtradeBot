I did not went through anyone courses, all that I did was that I used the trading guide or articles that were provided buy the exchanges that I was using at the time. HitBTC is not recommended because of too high fee and many freezing of accounts that people complained about, but I used some of their trading guide until I moved to Binance. You can use Binance trading guides for everything and just use like $11 to learn it. I will advice you to forget about anything like demo account, use like $11 to learn.",

Definitely you comprehend well and obtain vital informations of trading because it's manual.",

But I've seen some groups that offer this type of lesson and are managed by one really actual trader. I understand that they can earn from all of their trades but they're just saying that they're doing it for the people to have knowledge in trading and they just want to give back to the community but it's paid. In our local, there are a lot of it but I don't recommend it, try this TA lessons from binance academy.(https://academy.binance.com/en/articles?page=1&tags=technical-analysis)",

The best way to get your feet wet and feel comfortable with swing/day trading, if you haven't before, is to actually try making a few tiny trades.At the end of the day, what matters the most is your execution based on your learnings not only from course materials but also from your own loses/wins.",

      "body": "This will take you time and energy, you should also be ready to read from many authors to gain the needed knowledge. And since it's about the day and swing trading strategies the OP is seeking, my advice for you is that you should not search based on cryptocurrency alone for you to have wider resources to tap from. The best is to search through many means possible as traditional trading would have more explanations on this than the new cryptocurrency articles. Once you know one, you know all, and it would be your responsibility to study the behaviour of different markets to act accordingly.Emphatically, you should avoid much social media nonsense on this. I know many people would furnish you with some online mentors, you should be wise, many have tried them but gained almost nothing. My advice for you is to continue reading online by yourself or find a dedicated teacher on this that might engage you alone per the time of training. Read articles that are written by trusted names or sites, especially the ones that work with brokers and exchanges. I learned online through this means, and I am making regular money for some years now.",

It will be nice if you use free sources available to learn, like the YouTube, a lot of information that will help you is in the YouTube. Secondly the Binance Academy already provided to you is another good source you can use and have rest of mind learning and it will only require just data subscription.",

When I tried to hire a mentor for my forex trading, the people, I met were all ex-traders who aspired a living out of trading but failed by losing all the capital. It means you may get some traders with good experience on trading but there could be very lesser chances for them to be still into trading.",

Nowadays there are tons of institutions and people offering 1 on 1 coaching for trades and decision-making in a real-world trading scenario, though that doesn't come cheap and there isn't any guarantee that you'll learn all of the things you wanted to learn in such a short span of time. If I were you, I'd do copy trading first, then if the trade is successful try to read about the decision second - though of course, you don't have to do this every time, just some trades you're quite unsure of but a lot of the traders picked it anyway. You get to learn things more by doing and not reading, so start small and don't get your emotions in the way and you'll be fine.",

Trade with 1$-5$ and slowly you will know everything by yourself, and learn to observe carefully before taking any major actions, if you learn this skill you will be on top soon.

Most times the experience we need or asking for is to be persistence in the little we have learnt or know. No knowledge is waste, build on what you know because most of what you are asking for is the same with what you already know. Put yourself into more demo trading and build yourself in strategy, then you can trade live with very little money to build proper emotion and real live trade experience.",

Well there is no problem with that and that is why services like this are created. They are still helpful for someone who is lost and don't know where to start.A good mentor can teach us a lot of things, not only the basic ones but there are advanced lessons too that we haven't came across yet. The only thing that a mentor can't give to us is experience. To be able to obtain it. One must engage in the actual trade and apply what he learned. They can also start with a demo trade (as you suggested) before proceeding on the real thing.",

Because this is very expensive and if you are short on funds this could make it even harder to begin your trading journey, in my opinion if you want to shorten the time needed to get used to trading or investing then you have no other option but to dedicate all the time you can to reading books about the topic, and then only once you have done this for a few months then you could make use of a tutor and get the most out of the experience.",
