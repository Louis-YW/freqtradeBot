But the guy who will make a 6900 bucks worth bet will think twice before doing it.",

Due to this randomness, some of the people who gamble with fiat care less about privacy or how fair the gambling platform they play on is, but knowledge about cryptocurrency is required before you can gamble with crypto because you need to know where you can buy bitcoins, and how to move crypto from wallet to gambling platform, and then from gambling platform back to wallet if there is a win.Things like privacy and safety have always been regular concerns for people that invest in cryptocurrency, so that awareness is extended to gambling with it.",

The thing with crypto casinos is that they have some unique features, one is accepting bets that are sometimes much larger than the limits on traditional ones. The other is that many crypto casinos display bets publicly (without showing who made it) so that makes it very easy to see what kind of bets are made and how large. Of course with crypto casinos making it easy for anyone to make large bets, and for anyone to track this activity we've seen some ridiculous bets take place. However, I'd say that this is by far more common in regular gambling. If you look at the gambling statistics of Nigeria for example, regardless of the fact that they are a country where poverty is rampant, there's huge value being risked on bets. This means that many people there gamble even with what they can't afford to lose. I think this is just not as common with regulars that gamble in crypto.",

First of all, imagine when you use your hard earned money to buy some Bitcoin (about 2 BTC) and you used 1 BTC to gamble then you lose the bet, and lastly the 1 BTC you used to gamble today turns 3 BTC (if Bitcoin price skyrocket) in future, it will hort more than just losing some money.Crypto gamblers are taking higher risk than the fiat currency gamblers but there are more fiat currency gamblers than the crypto gamblers.",

Have you experienced something similar? I don't see any difference between crypto gambling and regular gambling because the rewards, whether in cryptocurrency or regular money, are typically valued the same. It's essentially the same kind of gambling happening in both cases. Many online casinos offer different deposit options for you to choose from. Regarding privacy, as you mentioned, I don't believe there's much. Most casinos ask users to go through a KYC verification, so it doesn't really matter what currency you use to deposit. your privacy is still affected by the KYC process they have in place.",

The difference between crypto and fiat casinos is the same, especially since regulators are still trying to supervise crypto casinos. Regulators thought that crypto casinos, with their anonymity, were becoming a place to conduct illegal activities so regulators felt they needed to start monitoring them.The difference may be seen in the bet amount where when someone uses 1 satoshi to bet on dice or HiLo, they are using a very small amount of money when compared to fiat casinos where there is a certain minimum amount that the gambler must use. But I didn't think about the difference between crypto casinos and fiat casinos. I also don't gamble at fiat casinos and only know crypto casinos.But we can agree that crypto gamblers will be more aware of the dangers of scamming than fiat gamblers. That's because many crypto casinos scam and deceive people. But crypto casinos and fiat casinos can both lead people to gambling addiction if they cannot control themselves.",

I mean, that's part of having knowledge if you need to walk out or keep on playing to add more to the profits before withdrawal so that you can maximize what you will spend in one transaction fee. 7k in satoshis for Bitcoin withdrawals. That's over $2 if I am not mistaken or as it is valued at the time of this posting. Who will withdraw 10k satoshis and pay 7k satoshis? I don't think there will be one crypto gambler who will do that.
