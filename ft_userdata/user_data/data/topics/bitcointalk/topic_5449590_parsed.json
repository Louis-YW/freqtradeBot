What role do you think girlfriend should play in your life?I believe that a relationship is a teamwork, where two people help each other grow, try to achieve their own goals, common goals, and help the other achieve their goals. Usually, it takes 50-50 effort, rather than one doing all the hard work so that the other can be pampered.",

      "body": "I guess the main role of a girlfriend in a relationship would be there to support you boost your morale and other things.Encourage you to be better and do better, you should find a girl that would motivates you or help you grow, not just those who keeps on demanding.In a relationship it is always a give and take if there is nothing that your partner could give you then what's the purpose of your relationship?When I mention give and take it doesn't really necessarily means about material or money sometimes it would also be about the effort,comfort and also the peace of mind or assurance that your partner could offer you.",

      "body": "Well it is important to find girlfriend that really cares about you and how you are feeling at all times. The main reason to be with a girlfriend is to make certain certain we want to spend the rest of our life with this person. Her role must be making us feel like a man. For her to give us confidence and make us feel powerful if we are feeling down. We want to be with a girlfriend and only be with her for rest of our life. Not just to date her for a small period of time.",

It hurts them so deeply that it leaves a permanent scar on their heart. Many can't recover and haven't been married even after they're old.",

      "body": "To my experience, usually girlfriends nowadays are for clout chasing they are having relationship just for fun which I don't find interesting. Before you have a girlfriend you need to have a mutual understanding first. In our first year there's a lot of challenges we faced and we've almost breakup despite that I found her really supporting me thru my problems like her consulting me, and asking if I'm okay. Which I did the same so I think that way we've overcome those challenges so I concluded that girlfriends just existing and supporting you to anything is one of their role.But from your post OP, which tackles more about financial. It still depends to your girlfriend, we people have different types of hobbies and characteristics. If you say you are more into business while her into her work like painting and coding. For sure she'll give opinions but she doesn't have literally a wide knowledge about business still of course she'll support you.",

      "body": "I totally get what you're saying. Relationships should definitely be a two-way street. I think a girlfriend should play a supportive and equal role in a guy's life. It's not just about the material stuff, right? So, like, it's important that she's emotionally there for him too.I think a lot of guys need someone who can listen to their thoughts and ideas, and maybe even challenge them intellectually. A girlfriend should also be a source of encouragement and love, helping her partner grow personally and professionally.",
