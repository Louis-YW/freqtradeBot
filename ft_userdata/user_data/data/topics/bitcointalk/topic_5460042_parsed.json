That's really what he told me he did, although I don't care much about the only thing I know that he got my money back. Now I think he is dedicated to something like that, I have his contact, but I will never contact him again because I have already learned my lesson. And this is my horrible story.",

But let me just look at what happened to you.It's like telling that you've been scammed, your ex-BF came to rescue you and traced the hacker with the name and all of her stuff/data.And then asked to send you back the money. Hmmm, sounds a legit story and thieves won't do such acts like that IMO.",
