  "content": "I am trying to calculate the cooling capacity needed to keep a mining farm running, with the following in mind.- No intake/exhaust fans, the farm must be sealed and noise kept pretty low.- No immersion cooling.- No water cooling.- Electricity is dirt cheap.I understand there are better alternatives to cooling down a mining farm (I do that myself) but for this farm, there are no options, so now I am not exactly sure about the setup.First, let's run some math.50*M30s or a total of 175KW which is 597,000 BTUs per Hour. This means a total of 597,000 AC BTU should keep the farm at an \"ok\" temp, at least on paper.We have access to 60,000 BTU split AC which means if we place 10 of them, we get a total of  600,000 BTU and the miners should (in theory) run cool, the average ambient temp is 29C / 83F, go to 95 in some days, and down to 20C /68F on some other seasons.I am pretty sure the math above is correct, but what could go wrong with such a setup?Also, do you think we can get away with less cooling BTUs during the cold seasons? So ACs blow in the direction of the miner's intake, cools the miner down, air comes out hot on the other side of the room, and eventually rises to find it's way back to the AC intake to come out cold again, it's obvious that the exhaust space of the miner will always be a lot hotter, contrary to how data centers are designed where they suck the hot air and send it back to the cooling units, but that kind of set up will not be easy/cheap to implement. Open to all thoughts, especially from those who ran some miners on ACs only.",

Not funny!Second is the airflow, just as Phil said, it's not going to really work perfectly as it does on paper, you're going to have a hot spot that is going to be way hotter than the entire room opposite the AC units near the ceiling where heat will be essentially trapped in this setup, so I would have two ducts on each side going straight to the back with an end fan and press the hot air with a cold flow for extra airflow and circulation. So unless the building really heats itself during the day to above what you said due to direct sun, no shade, or materials, it should not be a problem. But, to be honest not really a thing I would want to be in charge of it.Oh yeah, I'm curious about the end result, unless, of course, it's doxing somebody.",

      "body": "Quote from: mikeywith on July 02, 2023, 10:43:46 PMWhat I am counting on here is the ambient temp, see according to my understanding of these BTU ratings, it's the amount of heat that can be removed per hour, which means if we were to picture a scenario as follows:A miner using 3kw would generate 10,236 BTU per hour, so if we use a 10,236 BTU those BTUs coming from the miner will be kicked outside and the room temp will be identical to the outside temp.Based on that (assuming it's correct) if the outside temp in the above example was 15c, then I would need less cooling, simply put, I don't need the mining room to be at 15c, I am okay with 30c, which means probably using half the 10,236 cooling BTU will be enough to keep the room at 30c while the outside temp is 15c.Hmm, I'm a bit curious about this one since checking the manual on our farm (not mining, true farm oink oink) HVAC the rating in BTU stands on the amount of heat it can move from the inside to the outside. So a perfect 1 000 BTU unit will be able to move out 1 000 BTU at 10C or 40C, but in your case if you produce 10,236 units of energy those have to be removed be it 10C or 40C outside, you need the exact same amount of heat to be taken out, what will change if the outside is 10C instead of 30C is the efficiency and consumption of the unit, again, this is if we talk about a sealed room that won't lose that much heat through the walls.I might be mistaken on this but using only half of it will end up with the room temperature going up and up till it reaches the miner's exhaust levels since you have more energy being produced inside the room than you have taken out of it!QuoteI spoke to a guy who ran 3*S9s in a 4m*4m*3m room using only 12,000 BTU AC, so 14k BTU of heat vs 12k BTU of cooling and he said the miners were running pretty cool during all seasons of where he had them (10c winter to 40c summer)14k BTU in 48mc2 versus 600 in 180mc2 the ratio is all over the place.And the most important thing is that if the outside is colder even by a few degrees the room will lose heat, so if this guy had a wall in the shade with 5 degrees below and you're exposed on all sides it will be even worse.My take would be to start with half of it and see how it works out, you wouldn't be wasting money on equipment you won't be able to sue such as the miners or you won't overspend on air units and installments you won't be needed.Oh, and reading about the sound, just went outside, 32C right now, our office units are Fujitsu whatsoever, and my phone screams 69DB next to one of the outside units, (we have them in the parking space, cause...well, management!) so you might want to check one of those live before buying it if the sound is a concern.",

If it's a cooler day or as the ambient temperature drops at night the miners clock up a bit. But, during the heat of the day they slow down to keep the temperature manageable. Whatsminers have environment/room temp sensor, located far from the hash board, on the upper part of the control board, and gives pretty accurate readings, those temps could be easily viewed with an API request, and then a command to reduce the power limit for the miner can be sent, shouldn't take much to have something like in place, I think AwesomeMiner already has a function to check the environment temp.So it's either going to be an hour to two of coding my own script or reaching out to Patrick/AwesomeMiner to see if they have that in place, they usually implement most of the suggestions I give them (given that they make sense). so ya, long story short, that shouldn't be an issue.Quote from: stompix on July 03, 2023, 12:15:24 PMHmm, I'm a bit curious about this one since checking the manual on our farm (not mining, true farm oink oink) HVAC the rating in BTU stands on the amount of heat it can move from the inside to the outside.

How hot do you think that one lonely hot ac will bring the room temperature to? 10c above ambient temp? the room now is 30c, 20c? the room now is 40c.Now replace that AC with a miner that does the same BTUs, which brings us back to my initial statement, if the ambient temp is 20c and you are okay with temps going to as high as 40c inside, you probably don't have to match the exact BTUs of the miners. I could be wrong, but would like to know, how?",

This means a total of 597,000 AC BTU should keep the farm at an \"ok\" temp, at least on paper.We have access to 60,000 BTU split AC which means if we place 10 of them, we get a total of  600,000 BTU and the miners should (in theory) run cool, the average ambient temp is 29C / 83F, go to 95 in some days, and down to 20C /68F on some other seasons.I am pretty sure the math above is correct, but what could go wrong with such a setup?Based on your story, the math calculation you made is correct. And in my opinion, there should be enough cooling capacity to maintain the mining farm in terms of temperature. Perhaps all that is needed is to adjust the ambient temperature or maybe the settings on the AC unit, which of course depends on the weather conditions.",

It's a pain in the ass-protected pdf file, but I'm pretty sure even your model has the same kind of manual. Again, look at the pipe length, this rating above is for 5m linear, and once you count elevation it's a mess.Quote from: mikeywith on July 03, 2023, 09:37:28 PMIf that's true (which I believe it is), what happens when you bring in another AC of the same size that is set on heating mode, so now you have 2 hot vs 1 cold? you end up with 1 hot AC since the cold ac will cancel one hot ac, correct?How hot do you think that one lonely hot ac will bring the room temperature to? 10c above ambient temp? the room now is 30c, 20c? the room now is 40c.I could be wrong, but would like to know, how? It will bring the room temperature slowly up till it reaches the exhaust temperature at which point they will probably shut down themselves.Let's look at it from the thermodynamics point of view as heat is just energy:At one point you have one extra unit of produced heat in a unit of time, if this process goes continuously in a closed environment, after 1000 units of time it's 1000 extra units of heat. In a million units of time one million units of heat! This will not stop at any point if we don't assume the equipment will melt itself because you're still feeding more heat in that room every second than you extract, 10C, 40C, 100C, 300C it's like blowing into a balloon, the heat has nowhere to go.Of course, this is in a perfectly sealed environment, so there is heat escaping the room through the floor and the walls, but if we talk about 30KW extra there is no way you will reach an equilibrium before you melt everything!Especially since you also want to soundproof this room which will add to insulation and make less heat able to escape through the walls.",

      "body": "Well the what's miners can down clock a lot.with freq set to -10% and power set to 3000-3050I went from 3350 watts on most units down to 2536-2910So say 2700 on average meaning a savings of 650 x 6  = 3900 wattsWith 50 units that is 32500 watts saved. That's 110500 btu.With my 6 pieces we did 552 th vs 652 th a drop of 15.3% hash16200 watts vs 20100 watts a 19.4% power dropSo if you play with lower freq you can easy peasy save 100k BTU with 50 units.Going back to doing 10 ac it should cool at best 600k BTU drop that to 540k BTUBut the down clock drops you from 597K BTU to 497K BTUSo a cooling power of 540k and a heating power of 497K which is a 10% safety factor.After playing with my small hot room since 2018 I know that 10% safety factor may be good most days.Also you can simply shut mining units off.As you see below in the screen shot  you would turn 192.168.1.232 off as it pulls the most power and runs the hottest",

      "body": "Years upon years ago when I had our farm (2014) and we were using about 140-150A @ 208v I had a calculation that took all of that formula and then even converted it to how many TONs of a/c I would need. I will say as a few others have posted outdoor units can/will be loud. Fast forward to today at my personal home.I have a ~50ft x 60ft x 20ft (roughly 3000 sq ft) shop/garage that was built around 4 years ago. It has vapor barriers under with the concrete, every bit of insulation that can be done (minus bay doors, which I may do soon but they are automatic rollups so always been hesitant), 2x 5 TON A/C units that are mounted from the ceiling to cool it down. I live southeast of Houston so I am closer to the Gulf of Mexico which means humidity is something I always have to fight. One thing as a user or two posted is depending on time of day where the sun is hitting the building there will be hot spots in different places and that can take a wicked hit to things. Another thing though is humidity, and this is where I've had friends that own HVAC companies say can be a large issue, and this did come up with my mothers companies small data center (we are a reseller for IBM/DELL/Pure Storage/etc. etc. so we have a large amount of equipment to demo) that you still have to battle humidity. Last summer I did not take that into account in my personal shop, I was just using the AC's to help pull humidity out. I was mining Etherium in Minerdude/Octominer chassis with 3090s and I started to notice the heatsinks/fans/etc showing signs of dew on them and oxidizing things. I was in no way overpowering my AC's considering the heat produced from that was no issue for the amount of BTU's available from the AC. After Eth mining was done I was getting annoyed because leaving cardboard, etc became a problem. I ended up recently adding 20,000 CFM in fans (just 2x wall mounted 10,000 CFM fans to cycle the air) and it has helped a lot when the AC is running where as before even with everything sealed humidity was still not manageable. Though in the evening when things cool down and the AC isn't taking as much load. I am having to add a large de-humidifier (shows up Thursday) to hopefully be the final peace of the puzzle.Maybe someone else can chime in on there being a problem with humidity because lets say you in theory could keep close to ambient, there is still large risk of failure to equipment at that point from humid air taking its tole on equipment fast.",
