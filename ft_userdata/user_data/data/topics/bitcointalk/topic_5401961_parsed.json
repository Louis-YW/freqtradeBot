  "content": "Hi Guys!I guess it's an appropriate section to post this. If not, please suggest to me where I can move this.I was thinking of a unique way to secure the Seed phrase, and I found one. I don't know if anyone has tried this already.It's called Magic Mug in my country. I don't know what is the name of this on other countries. But, People usually print on mugs to gift their partner. So, I thought, why not try it? I know it's not 100% secure. It can be broken. So, Don't use it only to secure your Seed. It's interesting, Fun, and can be necessary sometimes. One of the best methods is to secure your Seed using washers: You can check this thread by fillippone Securing Your Seed Phrase with WashersHow does it work?: I guess everyone know does it works. Still, I want to describe it shortly. The Mug color is Black when it's Cool or at Normal Temperature. When pouring Hot water into the Mug, Mug's color will change, as shown in the photo below. Before Pouring Hot Water:      After Pouring Hot WaterPros:Cheap (Under $15)UncommonCons:Can be brokenHave to becarefull when printWarning: Order at least two Mugs from different shops to print your Seed phrase, and never order online. If you can Order more than two Mugs, It will be better. Use it as a secondary seed phrase backup.",

I asked to print two Mugs. You may print more than four mugs. If you make them from four different shops, I don't think anyone can guess you are doing something stupid to secure your Seed . If a single mug contains 3-6 random words, It's not enough to guess it's your seed phrase.",

As for 4+ mugs, with that amount of wasted space the mugs would need, is it even worth it anymore? Taking note that more mugs = the more mugs you need to not break.Idunno, at that point I'd rather just do something else.",

Any innovative way to make backups is always welcome, although we can always talk about how reliable and safe it is in some way. I personally would not use mugs for my seed for the reasons already mentioned, but I believe that some information can be obscured by using invisible ink which is then only visible if UV light is used, or depending on the ink if a heat source is used or certain chemical.",
