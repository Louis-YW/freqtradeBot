  "content": "Sounds completely unrealistic? Yes, it does!Is it actually real? Yes, it is!Can even be applied at country level? Definitely!Sri Lanka planning to send 1,00,000 toque macaque monkeys to ChinaQuoteCash-strapped Sri Lanka is considering exporting up to 100,000 endangered monkeys to China, the agriculture minister said Wednesday, raising concerns among conservationists.The toque macaque is endemic to Sri Lanka and common on the island but is classed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Sri Lanka bans almost all live animal exports and the proposed sale comes as it faces its worst-ever economic crisis. No financial details were made available.\"They want the monkeys for over 1,000 zoos they have across China,\" Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told AFP.\"I have appointed a committee to study the request and see how we can do this.\"Of course, there are a few questions about it and darker aspects of this:- I don't know how a species that numbers over 1 million can be considered endangered, but let's leave it like that- even if they have 1000 zoos that means 100 monkeys of the same species for each zoo and that is just not real- what they are going to do for real with them, and most hint at labs testing, which stops being funny  - how much of the debt will be really erased for this?But nevertheless, Sri Lanka is in so much debt that it needs either cash or a way to pay out its debts to China so, probably for the first time in human history monkeys will be used en masse to pay for a portion of that debt, giving a whole new meaning to the term \"monkey business\".At $4000 per monkey (google sources) that would make about $400 000 000 (in theory, not including costs), around 5% of the 7 billion they have in debt with China. So, do you feel like you could show up at your bank and hand them two or three monkeys to cover your mortgage?",

I don't have monkeys, maybe they can accept some local birds around my compound. Sometimes when people celebrate that the Chinese Yuen will replace the dollar as the global exchange currency, I just feel they don't know Beijing. Chinese give loans with very harsh conditions and they are heartless when they want to collect back their loans. Defaulting on Chinese loans can have severe consequences such as loss of the territorial integrity of defaulting nations. China is a higher version of the lender in Williams Shakespeare's play Merchant of Vernice called Shylock.My country's just denied that they have defaulted on the payment of a loan from China after a local newspaper reported it. I don't think we have any animal that has a population of 10,000. Maybe China might consider accepting humans because we are overpopulated",

Sri Lanka may consider monkeys to be endangered animals, because they raid communities searching for food, act as pests that destroy crops, and even attack humans. If China has agreed to take up the offer of accepting the monkey as repayment for Sri Lanka's loan, then let them get even more monkeys and other animals that China would also want to take.",

One thing is to  export raw materials and minerals but a completely different thing is to send that huge quantity of animals to a foreign country, where they will be likely experiment on or ever cooked (I doubt zoos will take that many monkeys and the Sri Lanka won't even care about their well being after they get paid).Do those monkeys have any blame of the poor economical choices of the former leaders of a country?  Pathetic.

A country like Sri Lanka will take any offer given to them, especially on something that's mostly common in their locality. Quote from: MainIbem on April 20, 2023, 10:40:35 AMBut my question is, when China were loaning out such amount of money to Sri Lanka why didn't they asked for collateral before releasing such huge amount of money to them? Seems they had no option to accept whatever Sri Lanka offer to pay back to them.Every loan has a requirement to be met; some loans just require a mutual agreement between two countries; no collateral is required sometimes. Before China gave out such an amount to Sri Lanka, they had a mutual agreement or something of interest from Sri Lanka. If they don't see anything reasonable or something they can achieve from them, they won't even think of giving out that loan. Something about their target might fail them, and then they will have to go for anything available in order not to be completely on the losing side.",

The scheme is extremely simple - somehow (from corruption to simple deceit), China \"invests\" in some projects in the victim country. But he invests very cleverly.1. It's a loan2. All project documentation is developed by Chinese specialists. Including calculation of economic indicators, including ROI.3. Implementation - Chinese companies and a significant part of the materials4. The project is launched into work, but oh, it turns out that it cannot enter the ROI. Nothing bothers you yet?And the ending is \"beautiful\": the project goes bankrupt. The victim country is in debt to China. The object itself is sold to China for a small percentage of its real value.Now understand? And China has done a lot of such projects around the world, especially in its immediate regions.",

We know that Sri Lanka is almost bankrupt, their economy is very chaotic at the moment and they are also in huge debt with China. The question is whether the monkey seller can pay off the debt, I doubt there is any guarantee for them to cover their debt with this pattern. There should be an assessment of whether China is trying to encourage Sri Lanka to sell its increasingly endangered species for a specific purpose? If indeed it is for the purposes of further testing and after that what is the condition of the animal, for whatever reason it can be ascertained that protected animals cannot be traded freely and even though efforts have been made to revise the law regarding this matter.
