Choose \"Create a new wallet\" and click \"Next.\"2. Select \"standard wallet option\" and click \"Next\".3. Choose \"I already have a seed\".Then try entering your seed words now it should work, and if still now try contacting devs and report this bug. Quote from: digaran on September 20, 2023, 12:49:37 AMand also another Q, if I encrypt my laptop wallet with password, all the keys generated by the seed would be inaccessible from any other device even if I have the seed?But if I don't set a pass, anyone having my seed could access my keys from anywhere right?Wallet encryption has nothing to do with the seeds, it just encrypts the wallet file so if someone tries to copy the wallet file from Electrum and use it on another device then it won't be recognized.You can import the wallet via seeds or the address via private keys to any other wallet and device no matter if you encrypt the seeds while you generating them.Quote from: Zaguru12 on September 20, 2023, 02:35:58 AMSince you’re posting on electrum board then I assume it is about electrum.

      "body": "Okay, the latest version of Electrum of Android becomes a bit confusing. Please update your Electrum wallet first and then follow these steps>> At first, select yes or No as it asks if you use a local proxy service such as Tor to reach the internet. Tap on next and then select auto-connect, write a wallet name (no matter what name you want to write), tap next, and again continue with the standard wallet. Make sure you do not select Import Bitcoin Address or private keys as it will create a watch-only wallet. Tap next and choose I already have a seed. Write your seeds here and tap next again and then it will ask your password if your wallet is already encrypted. I wrote all the steps because I made a mistake before. I chose Import Bitcoin address or private keys instead of choosing a standard wallet. 2nd Answer is: If your wallet is encrypted, it will ask for your password if you import it into another device.  This is a wrong statement. Electrum asks for a password for a specific device only. Edit: Findingnemo was fast enough to post it already. I wrote from my phone so it takes me a long to write these things. Please avoid spelling mistakes.",

      "body": "Since you’re posting on electrum board then I assume it is about electrum. If the desktop wallet you are using is electrum then you can only import that seed phrase into a mobile wallet that actually supports electrum seed which is either BlueWallet or the electrum wallet itself on Android. But if the wallet are not the same then electrum seeds can not be imported into them (because they are basically Bip39 wallets). Quote from: digaran on September 20, 2023, 12:49:37 AM another Q, if I encrypt my laptop wallet with password, all the keys generated by the seed would be inaccessible from any other device even if I have the seed?But if I don't set a pass, anyone having my seed could access my keys from anywhere right?No they will certainly be accessible because the password is just for that wallet on that device and once someone gets access to that seed they can import into an electrum wallet on another device without the password.What you need is a passphrase on the seed and not just a wallet password. With a passphrase on the seed, only the seed cannot be imported into another wallet until hacker also knows the passphrase Note: security wise it is not advisable to import your seeds from your desktop wallet into your mobile wallet rather if you want to view your wallet from your phone you can simply use the watch only wallet  by importing the master public key from your desktop wallet into your mobile wallet",

In other words it is meant to be used in case for example you forgot your encryption password or lost the wallet file and wanted to recover your funds.So with or without using a password to encrypt the wallet file you can always recover the same keys using that seed phrase.P.S. You may be confusing the password used for wallet encryption with the \"password\" used as the 13th word in mnemonic algorithms. In the second case, despite the name \"password\" it does not encrypt anything, it is acting like an extension to derive a different master key from the same seed. In this case you do need the password to recover the funds and having the seed phrase alone is not enough.",

Both mobile version and desktop version should generate the same addresses. Where did you generate your seed phrase?If your seed phrase has not been generated by electrum, it's probably BIP39 and you must check \"BIP39\" when recovering your wallet on electrum. Take note that passphrase is different from password. If you have extended your seed phrase with a passphrase, you need that whenever you want to recover your wallet from seed phrase. As mentioned by pooya87, passphrase is also known as 13th word. If you have encrypted your wallet with a password, it only encrypts your wallet file locally and you don't need that when recovering your wallet from seed phrase. Quote from: digaran on September 20, 2023, 06:50:14 AMI guess the problem is with the wallet because I didn't install it from google store, I downloaded from electrum.orgYou did the right thing. It's always recommended to download electrum from its official website.

You should use an air-gapped device. Quote from: digaran on September 20, 2023, 06:50:14 AMI think every wallet/key generator is rigged with a master key and that they can derive all the funded keys with that master key when they see a tx in block chain.No.Electrum (which is one of the safest wallets) is open-source and its code has been reviewed by many people.You can be sure that electrum generates the seed phrase randomly and you are the only one who has access to the seed phrase (This is assuming you are not using a fake version of electrum and your device is not compromised.)",

Both mobile version and desktop version should generate the same addresses. I just now uninstalled and reinstalled the mobile wallet on my Android phone. Followed all the steps and entered the seed word unfortunately, I did face the same issue. When I rechecked my seed phrases I found that I had entered one wrong. Corrected it and the Next link got activated.OP is entering the wrong seed phrase, that is the reason the Next link is not getting activated. I won't blame OP for entering the seed phrases wrong as the UI of the current mobile version 4.4.6 is not that good. The wallet allows users to enter the seed words using its built-in keyboard. The keyboard is very small and sometimes user may enter the wrong alphabet without realizing it.",

That's how seed phrases generated by electrum work. There's a version number that has been encoded in electrum seed phrases and makes any seed phrase generates only one type of addresses.Unlike an electrum's seed phrase, a BIP39 seed phrase can generate different type of addresses.",

Shouldn't all the possible seed word combinations work?Whether the seed phrase has been generated by electrum or it's BIP39, not all combinations of words give you valid seed phrase. BIP39 seed phrase:Any BIP39 seed phrase represents a 132 bits number in which the last 4 bits are checksum. In other words, the last 4 bits are a function of the first 128 bits. Therefore, if you enter 12 random words from BIP39 wordlist, there's a 15/16 chance that the combination of words doesn't pass the BIP39 checksum.Electrum's seed phrase:Any electrum's seed phrase is valid only if the the hash of it starts with 01, 100 or 101. If the hash starts with 01, the seed phrase will generate legacy addresses and if the hash starts with 100, the seed phrase will generate segwit addresses. If the hash starts with 101, the seed phrase generates a 2FA wallet. Quote from: digaran on September 20, 2023, 09:26:08 PMIf there is some sort of format to be followed, wouldn't that compromise security?No. A seed phrase generated by electrum provides 132 bits of entropy and a BIP39 seed phrase provides 128 bits of entropy. They give us enough randomness and security.",
