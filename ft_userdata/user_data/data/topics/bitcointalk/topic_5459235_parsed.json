  "content": "QuoteAgain The US economy continues to show negative numbers, which could affect world finances. What role does bitcoin play here?          First, I want to emphasize what an economic recession is or entails. Occasionally, recessions can be caused by factors beyond anyone's control, such as problems in other nations or changes in the global economy. Sometimes they are the result of bad decisions made by organizations or governments. Whatever the cause, the end result is always the same: the economy shrinks and everyone suffers as a result. A global economic downturn could have great effects on other nations and people around the world. Given the size and strength of the US economy.QuoteThe alarm of a possible global recession continues to sound, while the leaders and regulators of the United States deny the seriousness of the crisis. However, new data on the behavior of the economy of this country suggest a difficult outlook. In this context, Bitcoin has an opportunity to test its use cases.According to information from the Federal Reserve, money market funds are having aggressive growth. But why did this worry economists? Well, money market funds are highly liquid investment products, just like cash and government bonds. Investors usually use them when they want to invest their capital with minimal financial risk, especially in contexts of great economic instability.Figure 1: Money market funds serve as a liquidity buffer in crisis situations.Fountain: https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1675678718659006464/photo/1.          The graph above shows that the use of money market funds has increased exponentially during the periods immediately preceding economic crises or recessions. Analysts have noted that this pattern tends to repeat itself during difficult times, such as the 2008 economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Figure 2: Dates of the private debt peak (green dotted line), the oil peak (red dotted line), and the Lehman bankruptcy (black dotted line).Fountain:https://www.rankia.com/blog/game-over/3144683-petroleo-causa-crisis-2008.Figure 3: Economic recession in times of the coronavirus pandemic.Fountain: https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-55802814.          From any point of view, a global recession is worrisome and, above all, alarming to see how the US authorities minimize the severity of the crisis. While it is 100% understandable that people's perspectives on the economy differ, but you have to know how to recognize the data that paints a challenging picture. The importance of approaching things from a balanced angle should not be ignored. The bitcoin cryptocurrency is highly speculative and volatile. Although some investors have experienced sizeable gains, there have also been instances of sizeable losses.          In my opinion, honestly these global recession alerts, I feel like Bitcoin has a chance to show its great potential. Bitcoin has the ability as an option to wait and be taken into account for these uncertain times, the risks are known but its rewards are also perfectly known, I can only say that we hope that this does not happen to majors, despite the fact that it may be the BTC a way out of this problem we have to take into account that many people are not involved or soaked in information in this world of cryptoactives, the crucial and main thing in this type of case is to thoroughly investigate Bitcoin, understand how it works and determine if it is fits our financial objectives and risk tolerance. I would like to know what you think about this topic, I read them...Fountain:https://www.criptonoticias.com/mercados/nuevas-alertas-recesion-puede-hacer-bitcoin-contexto/",

      "body": "This has been talked about countless of times here in the forum. As I always say, bitcoin can be used as a means to safekeep the value of assets while the world around us is melting. It retains value pretty well compared to other asset classes out there that are susceptible to crises such as this one. Though one thing to keep in mind is that there is no guarantee in bitcoin or any other crypto for that matter. While in the past, it is relatively safe to leave your money in bitcoin and expect that it will still have the same valuation, or sometimes even greater, we can't tell for certain if that will be the case in the next coming years.",

      "body": "Fantastic post OP. Before I say my of opinion, let's concrete the facts, so that my theory isn't confused with what I believe to be a more likely view of the future:- There is no doubt doubts that during a recession that is fueled by inflation, Bitcoin's value will grow exponentially.- Bitcoin should be able to serve as a viable store of value if liquidity is not interfered with by as powerful or more powerful entities.- Everyone should have some Bitcoin at this point, as a serious global recession is undoubtedly looming (and has been for years).Now for my theory...This unprecedented show of support to \"Test Bitcoin's Use-cases\" sounds way too good to be true. In what world would we think institutions like the fed or conglomorates like Black Rock would support Bitcoin as avidly as they are now? For the fed especially, it is destroying their own system IF Bitcoin proves its use case.Which leads me to ask, and think, is this a ploy to publicly manipulate Bitcoin to disprove its use case, rek as many people are possible and entrap them into fiat money? At least until manipulation is simply no longer possible due to the resources which it would require to sustain.It's an unlikely theory...though a possible theory nonetheless. Let's just hope that Bitcoin is as we think, being an inflation and fiat system failure hedge.",

Which for me, it's not a valid comparison.They can be right with thinking that global recession and high inflations of fiat currencies which can not be stopped by central banks, will help Bitcoin to gain its price and move up higher and higher. The inaccuracy is they think it will shoot out instantly after a few weeks or several months. It is unrealistic to think so if they see how long does it take for the Covid-19 to cause negative effects on global economy.Like it is impossible in 2009 to think Bitcoin will be traded after next 6 months because of global economic problems circa those past years. It takes 14 years for Bitcoin to be traded at today price and it needs years, not months.Generally, there is no safe heaven for everyone. A heaven for me can be a hell for another person because this market is zero-sum game.",

Because in my opinion, gold is a safe haven because we can sell it whenever we need money, and we hardly lose value. It is not entirely true to say that bitcoin is not a safe haven, but given what bitcoin has achieved so far, it is not yet a safe haven. Bitcoin remains a highly volatile speculative asset with an uncertain future. But over time, as it becomes widely recognized and accepted, bitcoin will become a hedge against inflation as well as a safe haven.",

While its true that Bitcoin's value fell during the financial crisis, a lot of so-called \"stable\" assets suffered, too. What counts most is development and growth after a catastrophe has occurred. Bitcoin's resilience suggests it may be used to weather economic storms.Remember that Bitcoin is a technological breakthrough as well as a financial asset. The promise of blockchain technology is what gives it true value, not its current market price.

The volatility of Bitcoin is in both direction i.e. in up and down both directions. Even the currency rates these days are not stable as inflation is high all around the world.
