With 5 cent power you are making a profit but it’s so little that you will just stop mining due to the poor performance.I assumed that the difficulty with ETC would drop more but it doesn’t. Have no idea why people are mining at these crazy low profitability coins.",

It depends on how many mining rigs you have, the electricity cost in your country and how you can take care of your mining rigs. As long as you're know what you're doing and become consistent, you wouldn't loss in the current situation except the bear market goes drop.",

You could still mine if you needed the heat, and I would probably recommend mining “Etchash” on nicehash in order to earn some Bitcoin with your GPUs. Whattomine.com is a good site to give you an idea what to expect from your miners, but you’re probably better off purchasing crypto instead of mining unless you need the heat.",

Even if we suppose that he had the capability of being entirely self-sufficient with zero energy costs, the monthly earnings were still not enough to justify such an investment. I don't think it's currently worth putting money towards building a miner. Perhaps if you have zero or extremely low electricity costs and are willing to hold onto any earnings for the bull market, then you can possibly make a decent profit. Otherwise, it's not worth the trouble.I'm certainly not the most qualified person to answer your question. I used to mine with a relatively low-powered PC with two GPUs in 2017-2018. A lot has changed since then.",
