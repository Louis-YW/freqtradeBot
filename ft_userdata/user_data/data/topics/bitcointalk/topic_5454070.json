The bitcoin network is not a dependent of stock market but whenever there's bullrun like this, other stock market tends to increases as well but not a must, while other cryptocurrencies also increases as well during this period and at the same time, it's such a period that needs total attention and carefulness because the bitcoin use to be very high in volatility which means within a couple of times anything can change that it goes dip or high.Quote from: MarissaLopez on May 26, 2023, 08:56:00 AMWhich drive me back to this question that \"WHY IS BITCOIN ALWAYS IN A STATE OF BULL RUN\"BTC1.

Quote from: Dunamisx on May 26, 2023, 09:12:39 AMBullrun is believed to be the peak period of bitcoin price whereby it rises steadily and this is caused by the halving event that occurs every four yearsBitcoin was at $16000 for few months last year in fourth quarter, but the price rose from $16000 to $31000. That was bull run too. There has been massive bull run after halving too which have always been massive enough to lead to all-time-high, but bull run can occur at anytime after bear market.",

This kind of reduction happens every 4 years; the last halving was around 2020, which brought down the block reward to 6 BTC+ per block (don't know the accurate figure), so next year 2024 is the expected next halving. This kind of event is usually among things that trigger a bull run.",

Halving plus hype is one contributing occurrence why we see such huge effect in bitcoin. Also don't look only at the bright side since there are scenarios what we called bear market season it happens after those big pumps already happen and we need to be careful since a heavy price slide down will happen so we shouldn't get fomo and  make sure we are in profit whenever such bear market season will occur.",

Where did you find such a claim? It is true that Bitcoin has been on the rise since it was created but there are times when it falls down as well. The other question that comes to mind is about what makes people invest in Bitcoin and why does it keep going up?The answer is simple: Bitcoin has a lot of potential and it is not just a currency, but also a store of value. It has been around for more than 13 years now and there are many people who use it in their day-to-day lives. There are also many new investors who are taking advantage of its growing popularity and investing in it because they believe that this trend will continue.",

Take a look at bitcoin's chart and tell me if you see that bitcoin is always in a bull run.Probably @OP standard price of Bitcoin is its orginal price which is less than a dollar, and looking at the price history and from his point of Bitcoin pricing, then it is really an abnormal increase for Bitcoin selling above $26k which should not be the case since Bitcoin has already its ups and downs and the initial price point to consider Bitcoin being bullish or not is continuously changing.",

What you see as a bull run might not look like one to others. A little increase in the price is already a bull run since it’s not depreciating against the existing price of the market at that moment the price change takes place. But what many people see as bull run ultimately, is a state where there’s a very high surge in price that could almost double the existing price at the moment the price change takes effect.Quote from: MarissaLopez on May 26, 2023, 09:33:19 AMTalking about halving events that occur every four years just as you said,what is it all about the events?can I be clarified with that.!This is the time the reward for miners is being halved and it takes place after every four years. In anticipation for this event or when it takes place it usually cause a bull run in the market where bitcoin always surpass its current all time high and gets to a new ATH. From past history, it has been believed to be so and by next year 2024, next halving is expected to take place again.",

The price of bitcoin goes up when the demand is high and goes down when people are influenced by FUD to sell off their coins on a large scale. Recently there has been some slight relationship between bitcoin price and stocks. Bitcoin has been a strong hedge against inflation but recently there has been a correlation between the stock exchanges and the price movement of the coin. Bitcoin experienced a lot of challenges that brought its price down last year. But this year has been favorable because the coin has remained stable to a large extent. But next year will be better because of the halving and the price will go up.",

I know if we take a historic view of it from its inception till date we will be forced to agree that it's always in a bull run. Now, the current bull run or any at that is often driven by FOMO and expectations of favourable news on Bitcoin.
