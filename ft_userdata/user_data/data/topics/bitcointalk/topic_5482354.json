Whatever the OP have thought, this post must have relaxed him.I guess, when Binance made this tweet, there must be a fud ongoing about lower liquidity in Binance exchange and to prove the liquidity they have, they must have given these addresses. Binance has made a good reputations so far, and I sometimes wonder, how it falls into the authorities hands. (I do know the reason but showing the expression only).",

      "body": "I am also still amazed by the transactions that occur on the blockchain even though at this time (2018) the price of Bitcoin is the best with ATH in its time, A fact that binance holds quite a lot of bitcoin and I think this is what makes binance's influence on crypto prices quite strong including bitcoin. The advantage is that binance still maintains good management so there is no negative effect on bitcoin even with some of the problems that have befallen binance in the past or even now, the trust of traders is also quite a lot of storing on binance for day trading. And P2p traders are also quite crowded there. Binance deserves to have that much bitcoin because its vision and efforts are strong if one day there is a decline in binance pana liquidity in my opinion it will easily rise because binance has a way so that people also want to store liquid voluntarily of course with high rewards.=============================That much bitcoin is quite a lot for all time, because I personally only see or transaction at most around decimal BTC0.01 , maybe if I see coinbase or similar cex I will feel that bitcoin is so easy to hold especially since ancient times.",

You should not be surprised about such transactions because there are a few more addresses that may have too many transaction volumes. If you see a similar volume of transactions with other addresses, you have to understand that the address belongs to any kind of service like exchanges or other services. Most services like Binance, Kucoin, and Coinbase have massive volumes of transactions every day. Now, if they operate a single address for a long time, it's not hard for them to perform a million transactions. When it comes to balance holding by exchanges, Only Binance holds more than 800K Bitcoin. But, most of them do not perform transactions anymore.",

Billions worth of bitcoin in one transaction isn't what I like to call a normal transaction, maybe if it's in small amounts and coming from different addresses then it's definitely normal but this one ain't it. They're probably moving it to a different wallet, only way that we can confirm things here is if we ask Binance directly what they're doing, they'll probably answer it in X if there's enough people asking the same questions.",

It may worth mentioning that the balance reported by binance in their proof of reserves includes pegged tokens and if they are excluded, they hold around 563K BTC. You seem right indeed. I haven't checked their reserve lately. But when I created this thread Should we care about the Proof of Reserves of the Exchanges? Back in June 2023, at that time, I counted that they had almost 600K BTC in their holdings. I could be wrong though. I do not remember the exact amount. But I assume it was more than 600K BTC and All of them were On-Chain BTC. I did not count the wrapped BTC on other chains. So, I thought their reserve must have grown by 200K by now. But, it seems the reserve has decreased. Probably they have done some OTC deal with companies like Blackrock and others which ETF was approved lately.",
