In this kind of bounty scam, the project team happens to always fail to fulfill part of their promise, as their tokens are usually worth less than what was initially awarded for the campaign. These types of scams are similar to taking advantage of hunters.But these popular airdrops and NFts now are far more than that, as most of them give out tokens or NFts that they claim are useful and will want you to use your real wallet in claiming or marketing them, which puts you as the wallet owner at a greater risk of losing either the money you will spend for the contract approval or any form of fee they may ask for, and you can also likely lose everything that you have in that wallet used to connect to that Dapp, as the major purpose of most of those airdrop developers is to hack victims wallets and make away with their valuables. which makes it really different from bounty scams.",

Also never link your wallet to any scam platforms so that you will not give them a access to your account and better avoid it. If you are still skeptical because you believe its true then create a dummy wallet then try it so that you would know if they give or they are just scamming people trying to participate their fake program.",
