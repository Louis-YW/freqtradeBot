I'm talking about coins which you can use as a cold storage wallet like a Casascius, Lealana, 1HODLCLUB, Denarium, or Satori. Not those which are only souvenirs (no ability to load BTC on them). To my knowledge, there's one called the \"Delos/Veritas\" Bitcoin which is a slightly bigger than a US dime. But maybe there's something smaller than that? I'd love to see a \"physical\" Bitcoin that's the size of a US dime (very small). That would make it the coolest crypto collectible in the world.Any suggestions?",

I have those, but unfortunately, they're not coins that you can load them with BTC. It would be great to have a \"cold storage coin\" that would be as small as the coins pictured. I think it's possible given the fact that QR codes can be printed on any size (if I'm correct). The real problem would be getting a tamper-evident hologram/sticker that would be so small to fit on the back of the coin. I haven't seen holos the size of a US dime, so I guess we're out of luck. Quote from: FFrankie on November 03, 2022, 08:05:28 PMNobody mentioned the 1 gram rounds yet or are we not counting those?Thanks for your suggestion. But I'm looking more into physical crypto coins that can be loaded with crypto (in this case, Bitcoin). These 1 gram rounds only count as bullion, instead of a \"cold storage wallet\". That said, it seems that the 2022 Lealana Silver coin is the smallest loadable Bitcoin so far.",

I have a few 1/4 oz silver pieces, 10 1/10 oz gold and a few gold/silver bars too. Real 999, not that fake plated stuff. I believe I made a 1 of 1 in bismuth. The gold 1/10 oz is probably the smallest. it was 15-17 mm I dont remember. The design was horrible...as I was learning how to engrave in metal. I would destroy the dies after several strikes because I never hardened them. It was all trial and error. I like them rough looking and treasure like. All made in the 2014-2016 time frame. Bitcoin was cheap at the time so I didn't care. The silver 1/10 oz were around $25 each. It was more about promotion of physical silver crypto wallets and exploring outdoors. I hid various rare silver bars and wallets around the world when I would go on vacation. Arkansas diamond mines, Blue springs Missouri, Cabo San Lucus Mexico mountains, El Yunque Puerto Rico. ect. in hopes people would find them in a 1000 years and be like WTF.   Like a hidden pirate treasure.I didn't know anything about holograms at the time, so I just ordered some generic ones on ebay that would fit my blank planchets.

By the way, I'm curious to know more about the \"Bismuth coin\". Do you have any pictures of it? I had a lot of fun making rounds and learning. I actually made over 100 of the Iowa Spark 1/10 oz rounds for resale, but I only made 3 that were for holding crypto keys. They were for personal use. I was mostly just selling silver rounds during coin shows. I focused on fractionals. Here is a picture of the smallest piece I made for personal use. Its a 1/10 oz gold 16.33mm Iowa Gold Spark. I think only 8 were minted in 2014.I used bismuth as an easy way to test dies. The metal is easily re-melted after you strike it and can be examined, re-melted and struck again fairly quickly. Its melting point is low and similar to lead. I didn't have to spend a lot of extra money on gas/mapp, I could use a candle to melt small amounts of bismuth. The 1/1 crypto piece was made using the liberty image die and the back was a blank die. The edges were rough and split open. You could see bismuth crystals on the edge. It was different for sure. I don't know where it is right now, but most likely packed away in a box full of dies as I don't think It was ever funded.",
