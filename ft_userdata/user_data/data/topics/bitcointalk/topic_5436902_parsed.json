Always check the domain name closely before giving any credentials.I’m using coinmarketcap as price chart alone since it’s just a price aggregator. I don’t understand why people needs to deposit in there just to get an additional feature that doesn’t make any improvement on trading. The job offered is surely a scam because they are asking a deposit from your cousin despite he is the one who will give the service.I try to search the “coincapmarket” in the google and it doesn’t show in the result. The popularity of coinmarketcap erase the track of these kind of phishing website.",

Always check the domain name closely before giving any credentials.I have a similar experience to all the others who checked that domain but the basic is always been never to send any funds to a site just to verify your withdrawal address that request should not exist, because in the first place, there is a way to verify the address for withdrawal like sign the address or if it's the fee they can just deduct in from their deal.This practice of asking to send funds to verify an address was first introduced in scam mining sites where you are asked to send funds to verify your address and for the fee as well, it's still being used but on another form.It's good that you advise your friend not to send funds, no legit platform will do that.",

Whatever the name and whatever the plan of action of the scammers is, there is still one thing you shouldn't ever do that will keep you out of trouble. The moment somebody asks for money to send you more money, block that person!Everyone should remember, you don't need to send fees to get BTC, you don't need to pay taxes before you get your coins from a website, and you don't need accounts on websites to receive coins from a stranger!Quote from: Pandorak on January 26, 2023, 04:37:28 PMCoincapmarket.com has never existed (in the form of a platform), i don't think there is anything we need to worry about this, there are no reported phishing platforms or indications of phishing platforms. Bruh, you got a phishing email the moment you set foot on this forum and you still claim that there can't be any phishing websites for one of the most used crypto related website around?

Check  DdmrDdmr reply!He does not realize that crypto platforms are the most targeted for fraud to duplicate websites with different domains, many victims from beginners do not know about phishing, so they follow the steps given by the fraud to give permission to access wallets or other things that are vulnerable to hacking of their wallets. If he doesn't know how many crypto phishing sites there are then he should explore a lot of information in the forums and especially on the Scam Accusations thread boards.",

If your friend keeps this rule in his mind, he will never be scammed. I believe you already told your friend about that.",
