  "content": "Today is the digital era! The millennium of computer technology. One of the hottest topics in this field is the new technology of crypto currencies.Since the day in which Satoshi invented the first crypto currency, the Bitcoin, several thousands of crypto currencies have been created. In 2013 Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer made the first joke coin (meme coin) the Doge, making fun only, but today the coin has a market capacity over 30 billion US dollars! According to the great victory of Doge, many meme coins have been developed over the net, such as Shiba Inu that is another successful meme token project.But no meme coin ever exists to engage with a social-political real world's problem, all of them are just jokes!In December of 2021, Tatashi Toushe founded the first meme token project that focuses on the problem of elderly governors around the world. She defined a crypto currency project and started a campaign (#BanElderlyLeaders) to ban elderly politicians to run for the political office. She named the token \"Old Fart\" after the US President Joe Biden farting at the COP26 climate talks in November 2021 to recall and bold the elderly leaders' problem as a joke. She also created a new type of white paper, the \"Fart Paper\"! Just like the dog type meme coins Woof Papers! Â Read the White Paper and more here: https://cryptu.io",
