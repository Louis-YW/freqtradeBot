  "content": "Hello, everyone. I have a new PC and I like having my Bitcoin in an Electrum wallet on the screen. I have Windows 11.I have not been doing much with my Bitcoin in the past year, besides checking the Electrum wallet to see it is still there!So I am a bit out of touch with things, as I am not really a technical person at all (I only bought some Bitcoin ten years ago as it interested me as an Economics student).Is there a relatively simple step-by-step guide out there that I can follow? Obviously I know all about only downloading the software from the official site and verifying it via Kleopatra, but it is so long since I did it, that I am worried I will leave out something vital which might compromise me in the future...Can anyone recommend a good online video or guide on here that I can follow to avoid mistakes? As I say, I want to have a new Electrum wallet on my new PC (and to do it so that no one accessing my old PC could get to my coins that way). Thanks in advance!",

Or you can get steel sheets for it which are resistant to water and fire. Protect your private keys just as your seed phrase. Only what you should give to people is your bitcoin address.

The coins are not in the wallet, they're \"on the network\".So if you restore 100 wallets from the same seed, all will have access to the coins. That's why, if you plan to sell the old computer/HDD, even if at first you restore your wallet on the new device, it should be safer if you send your coins to a newly created wallet on new device (but not at the fees we have nowadays).And if the amount of coins is significant and you are not a technical person, it may be safer to buy a hardware wallet and send your coins to that. Wallets with big money, on computers accessing the internet, especially Windows computers, are not a great idea nowadays.",
