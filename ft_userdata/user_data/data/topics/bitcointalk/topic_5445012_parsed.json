Anyway, we don't know for sure how many crypto-based platforms are affected by the developments in SVD. Still, this eventual acquisition can be working good for all parties as things can get normal again and assets owned by the depositors can be made whole. As of now, the expected contagion just like what happened in 2008 was averted though there remains the question of the main problems and weaknesses at hand.",

      "body": "Now that some time has passed since the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank, I think we can safely say that thankfully, Bitcoin has been nothing but stable and at a pretty high point since the news broke, so even if crypto businesses suffered because of the bankruptcy, the price of Bitcoin wasn't affected and the same is true for several top altcoins. The uncertainty can remain or even spread in the traditional markets (stocks), but the crypto market seems to be okay. Maybe Bitcoin will fall later, maybe it will grow more, but I don't think it will be attributable to the SVB situation, unless it triggers bigger economic events.",

It’s not a direct bailout but surely the government rescue SVB funds.https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/economy/svb-bailout-questions.htmlThat's definitely surprising but in the long run, we need to think about how crypto projects are going to survive if they are going to be same-old fiat seekers. SVB case was something different, and it had crypto projects as well as many IT projects working outside the crypto space and in the real world. I think that had a large impact on the case and that could be one of the reasons for not ceasing all the operations of SVB. Imagine if this would have been a case like FTX then, SVB would have gotten the bailout like this.

Right on the point, considering how they act when it's a crypto project itself. The fiat and crypto relationship can break only if they consider crypto projects in terms of bitcoin value and not fiat. However, the world revolves around money or fiat as they know it for ages now. So it's a big question mark how to define the value of bitcoin or how to measure it? Unless and until we don't get that drift, we can never be successful in breaking that traditional chain.",
