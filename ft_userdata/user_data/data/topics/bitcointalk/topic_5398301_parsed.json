Those bonds were honored basically because a real company with real regulations existed. Also in the 1990's the biggest seller of guns in the USA was K-mart.Honestly the biggest pos = USDT ,USDC ,BNB, XRP, BUSDthey are 3,4,5,6,7 and add to 74+52+47+20+18= 211billBTC+ETH add to 553+236=789 billso pow is winning 789 to 211if eth switchesit turns to553 to 447 pow to pos. top 7 coinsI see a fundamental alterationÂ  if this happens and I think it means a crash for eth maybe the greatest crash ever.",

If it generates heat between 80-90 degrees in a room you can germinate seeds fast and effectively.

It seems IEO and ICO projects die faster than mineable coins, the only PoW coins that failed are bad from the beginning (shitcoins) what do you say.Proof of Work is obviously superior.Â  Not just from a security standpoint, but also from a distribution standpoint.Â  It's also easier to see if there's real life support behind the coin, or just some rich people who spent some money and now want to get free coins forever from new entrants.Â  That being said, there are times when Bitcoin level security isn't necessary and a smaller carbon footprint would be appreciated.Â  Also, once coins have had their initial distribution, PoW does lose one of it's talking points (fair distribution).Â  So I can see why there is a market for PoS chains, but they're obviously not as good as PoW, which is why they have other advantages like a smaller carbon footprint.",
