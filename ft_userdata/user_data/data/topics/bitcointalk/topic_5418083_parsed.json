This is a massive step and shows somebody at PCGS is taking these seriously. Yes, the holos were both partially attached... came as a surprise when I opened the box.In thought this seems to remove them from the liability of someone later claiming it was supposed to be loaded...But I guess you could peel a coin and not redeem it, but then the private key would be exposed",

It would be crazy to peel a holo but not actually redeem the value. The private key is just an artifact of the collectible at that point.",
