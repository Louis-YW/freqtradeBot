This pandemic has given us the thoughts of how things can change quickly if we are not prepared for the worst.It all started as a hobby while being on locked down into a dream and little by little will become a real thing as plan being executed.",

But in many other corrupted countries, farmers live a miserable life. If you are looking for investment, fossil fuel is still a better choice if you can store it in proper condition. But yes, trees and plants can provide recurring returns over a long period of time. Also if you can do the right packaging, you can build a brand out of it.",

Who have growing seasons year round, without having to contend with winter frost. I have fruit trees that produce fruit without me giving them fertilizer or compost. Sun, rain and whatever minerals and worm castings are naturally found in the environment appear to be enough for them. Its more difficult for those in cities. But even they might drive to the outskirts and find a woodland area no one is using to stash their plants. Guerilla gardening has been a thing for a long time as far as I know. It could also be good for city planners to include more space for communal gardens and areas to help reduce concrete heat island effect. Plants clean the air and reduce smog and pollutants. Having more of them in a city can only improve things.",

If your house doesn't have a large yard, you need to buy land and it's expensive. It's just a cost for land alone and you need to buy seeds, moss, etc etc to take care your plants.

If one cannot afford to spend time everyday taking care of plants, one could simply choose to plant trees, fruit-bearing trees in particular. Not only do trees help the environment, they also provide food or even extra income.What I noticed, though, is that young people nowadays are not anymore interested in small agricultural activities like planting and taking care of vegetables, root crops, and trees.",

Sad to say, not more people have actually think of it as a form of investment, while there are wide hectares of unused lands that could be use to plant crops that would potentially sell on the local market and even internationally. The main reason why, is the lack of knowledge. There were farmers who knew how to grow them but they don't have the financial capacity to do so. I personally knew the \"Falcata\" tree which gives good 8-10 years of return with low maintenance costs and effort. This is most common in our region.",

Just to fight their boredom, they spent their time growing small plants and there are some who sells the plants they grew, and there are some who are selling it on live stream. These plants can be displayed at the front of the house etc. It's good to see people at that time and even today spending time growing and selling their small plants.

Which could make it a decent place to invest wealth in planning for future inflation.The only downside that I'm seeing in planting fruit-bearing trees is that it will take years before they will bear fruits, but once they will bear fruits, it will be continuous. Space can also be a problem as well for those who doesn't have enough space to plant trees with. This is also the reason why I want to buy an open-farm in the future.

But for people who live on cities well I doubt they can start to do this especially they are dealing with cements backyard and also small spaces on their houses. But really this is truly good idea to be made since you are not only helping yourself with this also you help other to have food on their plates and might you can contribute to the economy to if you make this as a business.",
