Honestly speaking what I see are just graphs and numbers and I have no idea how they know a given coin comes from scam, ransomware etc, but maybe they know what they do.More info: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2022/",

The more people learn about crypto and how they can use it to launder money, the higher the chart goes. Higher crypto usage guarantees a higher money laundering usage.I believe this will continue to increase as the market cap of cryptocurrency continues to increase. The more money coming into cryptocurrency, the more illegal activities will be here, especially this money laundering.But I believe that's why the government started to become serious about this issue and they started to impose some laws regarding about this, and some cryptocurrency projects are affected like their being decentralized, because of this, which is really disappointing.",

Wachovia laundered $390 billion for drug cartels. Danske bank laundered $230 billion in Estonia.

It is that these two things do not fit with what the article states.Bit of both. You can see from the second chart, which ETF has shared above, that only around 10% of illicit funds are passed to a mixer. The majority of illicit funds go directly to a centralized exchange or to a DeFi exchange, the vast majority of which are also centralized and track everything their users do. So it is hardly surprising these criminals are easily caught. We also know there are plenty of not very good mixers (or even outright scams themselves) out there which can have their outputs and inputs correlated, and we also know that people often mess up and inadvertently recombine mixed coins with unmixed coins, rendering the whole mixing process useless.",

Although i wonder how much/little those funds managed to be detected by those CEX.CEX is part of the laundering (maybe unknowingly, maybe not). If a bank sees a deposit coming from a CEX, they won't be as suspicious as seeing the same deposit coming from DEX or via cash. I think the other destinations like gambling, mining, DeFi still later end up in CEX or DEX.",

When a hacker steals from an exchange the coins are mixed again and again and divided into multiple wallets that eventually get accessed from a third world country and even when the wallet gets traced they won't know who took the money out. A hacker pays money mules to get cash out of ATMs or sells mixed coins on decentralized exchanges. Sometimes coins are exchanges into gift cards and other things and then sold on the black market mixed with legit gift cards paid with fiat money. Laundering works if you do it right. It's not the best way to legitimize billions of dollars but for smaller numbers it can work.",

Take a look at the top graph on the other Chainalysis report I just linked to above: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2023-crypto-crime-report-introduction/. Of their \"illicit\" transactions for 2020, the largest share (44%) is due to \"sanctions\". The US sanctions Russian businesses, and so now all their transactions show up as \"illicit\", according to this US based company.",

So even when adjusted for volumes, fiat is over 10x \"dirtier\" than bitcoin.Transaction volume is way higher than global GDP. Visa reported $10.4T in transaction volume and $13T in transaction + cash volume in 2020. Global GDP was $85.5T in 2020. And Visa is just one of the networks - there's also Mastercard, Swift, direct bank transfers, Chinese payment systems and so on. Even if you think logically, if a product costs $1,000 there will be a much higher transaction volume tied to this product - buying materials, paying salaries to workers, selling it multiple times until it reaches the final customers and so on. And then there are transactions that are not tied to GDP directly, like investing, p2p transfers, shadow economy.",

I would imagine that what is considered laundering by governments and firms like chainanalysis, would not fit into the criminal definition of laundering - i.e, gaining from something illegal like scamming, hacking, drugs, etc and then trying to obfuscate the source of those funds. It's very possible that this statistic also includes transactions of people who are just trying to maintain their privacy without actually doing anything that would be considered criminal anywhere. To answer your question directly, fiat scam runs all the way to the top corporations whose products you probably use every day. \"Scams\" or anything that deceives and/or harms people to any scale, would be unparalleled when you compare cryptocurrency users and banks. Just take a look into HSBC's criminal history (and present), let alone any other bank. They are involved in more actual money laundering (let alone drug and other kinds of trafficking) than any statistic they could create and combine for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.",
