Check the section below and create a new thread that includes your service- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0That's a good recommendation although I don't think that OP will ever get a job there, he's a newbie and the people posting in the Service board is too picky and fuzzy to hire him unless OP's got an astronomical resume, OP can still try though, maybe someone will give OP a chance. To OP, make sure that when someone hires you, you need to make sure that you get paid especially if the person that hired you isn't a prominent member in the forum, wouldn't want you wasting your work then getting paid nothing.",

Why not volunteer your time and effort to these good causes? You're not after Bitcoin anyway because you're planning to convert it to USD and even donate it. If you want to raise funds, I think these charities have also fundraising events. You might want to take a look at their schedules.",

You're basically helping them to scam people. Even if legit, $20 is way too much for tasks that can be done with bots. I've seen similar tasks being paid for $5/100 reviews on other websites. If you want to find a job with low requirements for this charity thing, try to apply for a rater position or something similar. If you want to make money here, you need some time and effort so that you can at least rank up to a decent rank. Don't know if your goal has a time limit or not, but if you want to, you can try to contribute here and look for opportunities in the future.Edit: I just saw your other thread. Just a suggestion,  if you want to promote that donation organization you can also put their link on your profile info.",

So first, explain how Bitcoin works and what is really your goal, and be transparent.There are a lot of ways to earn Bitcoin by doing these some advertising or promotional work, some are called \"offer walls\" where your reward could be in the form of Bitcoin.",

Do you think by mentioning charity people will start patronizing your service without considering your qualifications? Do not put burden on yourself to make charity donation when you are still struggling to make ends meet.

Participating in bounty especially article writing can earn you that but only if your article is accepted by the manager. The issue is that some project will refuse to pay at the end of the campaign while some will not pay up to the agreed bounty pool and thereby leaving the hunters with a penny rewards.
