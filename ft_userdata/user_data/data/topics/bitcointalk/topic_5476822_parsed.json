      "body": "Here comes another shitcoin marketer who is being carried away by his or her shitcoin valueless valued sales. I really do not think anybody here would want to associate with shitcoin now as scammers are now the figure head of shitcoin projects.Investing in shitcoin has never been in my own side because I lost alot to shitcoin which I was deceived into buying without to really doing my research as a newbie then. Many many shitcoin project sank my funds d yielded no results as I learnt my lesson never to think of putting a dime in the name of investing in shitcoin.OP, I think you should look for something else to present here because nobody would listen or give you attention here merely looking at your thread. Possibly working on a new thing to market here would make much sense than coming to tell about shitcoin.",

If promoting shitcoins is what he does for living I don't have any problem with that but the word \"shitcoin\" sounds irrational to many people here. I think he should have use a more meaningful title or something that sounds cool not just \"Shitcoin Marketing\". You need to brand your business and make it looks professional not using annoying words. Good luck dude ðŸ˜Ž",

Good luck dude ðŸ˜ŽThe name or word shitcoin sucks here mate and I think op should have been able to come up with a well meaningful name for itÂ  as you have said rather than that name that would have been better.As for the fact that op does this for a living is nothing of concern to me because it is normal that one does something for a living in other to survive.In business the way and manner of presenting you brand matters. This is where I think op should really look into.",

Well, it's a good thing you're honest enough to call it what it is. Developers do not accept that their coins are shitcoin so when you put this kind of ad out, Hiring you prove a point that the coin is truly a shitcoin.Â  I just hope more people knew and understood that a good number of these shitcoin will continue to remain what they are; shit. I see a lot of marketing done by shitcoins on social media and I just feel sorry for the people that fall for it.",

Within the degens communities, shitcoins are all projects that are launched on DEXs pretty much...If you do not understand the \"ShitCoin\" space, you should not post comments like that.And yes, I target people who are in the shitcoin space, not you obviously, that's why you find this strange.There were multiple non-intelligent statements in this thread, but I would like to focus on 1 specific for now.I find it hilarious that one guy \"called me out\" for my registration date on this platform - LMAO.So, if I am not registered on this platform, I am not allowed to have a business running? - LMAO.Also, my marketing techniques can be applied to any project. Any project can get on trending on crypto websites, etc...Still, I appreciate honest and kind replies on this thread so much!If anyone wants to see my work or learn more, can contact me on Telegram - @DekiDev",
