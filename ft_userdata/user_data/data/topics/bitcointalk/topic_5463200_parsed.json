If you fake a transaction Id if you scan it with a block explorer it won’t show up that’s one way to check it’s really legit or not.And if you’re a newbie and they want to try the “I used a low transaction fee bullshit” then scan the id on https://mempool.space to see if that transaction exist and it’s just waiting for it to be confirmed, if it doesn’t appear there don’t proceed with your deals and even if it does, wait until you some confirmations on that transaction.",

If someone come up with his own fake txid, it is not then valid. You can easily know the txids that are valid or not valid on bitcoin blockchain explorers.",

Transactions and blocks are validated by the nodes and miners can't include an invalid transaction in the blockchain. If you have received a bitcoin transaction, it's displayed on bitcoin block explorers and that's confirmed, there's nothing to worry about. It may worth mentioning that you should never accept an unconfirmed transaction. It's always possible that the same input is spent in another transaction and the unconfirmed transaction is invalidated once the other transaction is confirmed. If you are receiving a big amount, it's recommended to wait for 2-3 confirmations.",

      "body": "Anyone who thinks faking a transaction ID in the blockchain can go undetected has a gross misunderstanding of how decentralized ledgers work! The blockchain is a public, immutable ledger where all transactions are recorded. So, if someone claims they've sent funds and provides a transaction ID, the first thing to do is to verify that transaction on the blockchain itself. If its not there, they're blatantly lying!Moreover, each transaction ID is unique, representing a specific transaction. To think one can fake this and go unnoticed is laughable. Your concerns about scams are valid; however, the architecture of blockchain makes it incredibly challenging, if not impossible, for someone to fake a transaction ID and not get caught. Always, and I mean ALWAYS, cross-check on the blockchain before crediting anyone.",

      "body": "OP if I am not mistaken, from your point of view I believe you are talking about bitcoin transaction and to the best of my knowledge, Bitcoin transaction ID can not faked in any ways. Once a transaction is initiated, it is sent to a pool for confirmation and upon successful confirmation, it reflects i.e been credited to your wallet account. So no one can think of faking a transaction ID. If you feel someone faked a transaction ID, you have the blockchain explorer to confirm or see for yourselfIf the transaction is real or not. What you just have to do is copy the transaction hash and paste on the search bar and search for yourself. Believe me you, if it is a fake it definitely would not show any transaction but if real, would open the ledger for you to see for yourself.So therefore, it is easy to detect a fake transaction ID by just copying the hash to pasting on the explorer for your on view.",

      "body": "That’s an interesting question. I did some research and found out that it is possible to create a fake transaction ID, but it would be very hard to do so without being detected by the network. A transaction ID is a unique identifier for each transaction that is generated by hashing the transaction data. If someone tries to change the transaction data, the hash would change and the transaction would be invalid. The only way to create a fake transaction ID is to create a fake transaction and include it in a block, but that would require a lot of computing power and luck to fool the network. Most nodes would reject the fake block and the fake transaction ID would not be accepted by anyone.There are some ways to detect a fake transaction ID, such as checking the validity of the transaction data, verifying the block that contains the transaction, or using a third-party service that tracks transactions on the network. However, these methods are not foolproof and may not work in all cases. The best way to avoid being scammed by a fake transaction ID is to use a trusted platform or service that has a good reputation and security measures.",

Anyways, note that you can cancel a transaction with replacing that with a new one paying higher fee only if the original transaction has been flagged as RBF. Since almost all nodes are still using opt-in RBF and they have not enabled full RBF, if your transaction has not flagged as RBF, you can't replace it with a new one even if pay a very much high fee for the replacing transaction. Of course, I am not saying you should accept an unconfirmed transaction, if it has not been flagged as RBF. There is no guarantee that an unconfirmed transaction will be finally confirmed.",

There’s a risk of double spend using RBF but you will notice it immediately since everything is recorded on the blockchain.The only time you can become a victim on this kind of scheme is when you didn’t verify transactions on blockchain because the transaction should be available in the blockchain if there’s already a TXID unless you are using a custodial service.",

Once the transaction is confirmed, however, you can take its data and hash it twice to see if its hash corresponds to a provided one. It is important to bear in mind that any data located outside of the scope of the blockchain cannot be considered valid until it gets recorded and receives at least several confirmations. A malicious actor can provide you with a transaction hash along with transaction data and then change some parts of the transaction, making the previous hash invalid.",

Because in blockchain one can fake the TX but not the ID because each transaction have different ID and if the person sends you a ID then that transaction is publicly viewable and you can see the status and details like how much amount that TX have.That's the beauty of BTC blockchain that, if one try to fake things out that TX can not be confirmed and validated by Validators instead that will be marked. Or if not marked then at least one could confirm by seeing the details by searching the transaction ID on Explorer.",

Is there a post as regards this if available share linkBitcoin transactions can be flagged as RBF (replace by fee). With flagging a transaction as RBF, as long as the transaction is unconfirmed, you will be able to replace it with a new one including at least one same input and paying higher fee.If the original transaction hasn't been flagged as RBF, almost all nodes will reject any transaction having the same input as the non-RBF transaction that they have in their mempool, even if the replacing transaction pays a much higher fee. For more details on the requirements that the replacing transaction should meet, you can read BIP125. If a node has enabled \"Full RBF\", they will accept to replace transactions with a new one paying higher fee even if the original transaction hasn't been flagged as RBF. Currently, most of the nodes are using the \"opt in RBF\" policy and they haven't still enabled \"full RBF\". It's expected that more and more nodes will enable \"full RBF\" in the future.",
