You will still break some asics, so I would count on 70-80 days. Do you have free electricity?If not, then it's a bad idea.Of course, you can set up each ASIC in solo mining and catch your luck.",

Incase things went wrong on the process of mining. Then I don't understand you. If you don’t have free electricity, then you don’t need old BITMAIN ANTMINER S9 asics.Does your electricity have a cost?The payback of asics by 90% or more depends on the cost of electricity.",
