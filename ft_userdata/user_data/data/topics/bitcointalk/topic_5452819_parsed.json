The news article says the country is looking at regulating cryptocurrency, this has been the case of most third world nations. The ban the use of cryptocurrency and then its citizens grow increasingly in it usage, they come up with CBDC idea and again starts to regulate the whole thing. One thing I see that could have impacted this adoption is the fact that 62% of the nations population are aged between 15-64 and this is the age group that are mostly internet users. Could the nations local currency (Bangladeshi Taka) which is weak against the top international currencies like dollar, pounds and Euro be the reason for the increase. With cryptocurrency most especially bitcoin it is easier to transact with cross boarder countries.",

I don't doubts same thing might happen to bangladesh or to any other country's that tends to ban or restricts cryptocurrency activities within them. Sincerely speaking this is encouraging showing how the max adoption is gradually taking over.",

The fact of that government cannot shut bitcoin down even though they try by placing a ban or it,bitcoin adoption we still keep on increasing in that country that it is illegal. Isn't this ridiculous ?Bangladesh government has taken to bold step to accept cryptocurrency and this should be an example to those countries who have placed ban on crypto to learn from them because it is the government of the country that is missing out,because its citizens will be using cryptocurrency behind them. I see that with time those government that placed a ban on crypto will remove the ban when they realize the benefits of cryptocurrency to individual and the government.",

Back in 2014, when Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh was founded and Sazeeb was named the President, with some other members, people discussed Bitcoin a lot. Back then, Bangladesh Bank declared using crypto as illegal, and still, they are in the same boat though they are not taking any steps either against cryptocurrency users. There was some update in 2017 and recently but that did change anything from the first statement.QuoteThe governments in the Indian subcontinent do not have any clue about crypto. Same here in Bangladesh too. Govt and media are promoting Bitcoin as an illegal currency, the currency of the dark web, gambling, etc. But don't have any idea what Bitcoin is in reality.Quote from: Zaguru12 on May 15, 2023, 03:27:52 PMCould the nations local currency (Bangladeshi Taka) which is weak against the top international currencies like dollar, pounds and Euro be the reason for the increase. With cryptocurrency most especially bitcoin it is easier to transact with cross boarder countries. I would say yes, that's one of the reasons of course because people are more concerned about the inflation happening these days. Everything is getting expensive each day and I doubt govt can control it. That's why people are looking for alternatives. As investing in Gold isn't that easy because of investment size, storing etc, people are more interested in cryptocurrency investment.Quote from: pawanjain on May 15, 2023, 04:42:17 PMWhile India has been into crypto and declared 30% flat tax on it many individuals have stopped using crypto yet the number of people using it remains significant.I hope the tax rate decreases which will further boost the use of crypto in India.That was a stupid decision, to be honest. I don't see why govt is discouraging cryptocurrency investment and encouraging illegal cryptocurrency investment to avoid taxes. I'm sure many people are secretly doing this.",

The adoption should increase over time and since a lot of Bangladeshi people leave in foreign countries, it won't be a huge amount of challenge to convert them into fiat.",

Bitcoin never force any country and individuals to adopt it but they on their own adopt it because whenever one see the potential and the value of the asset. Those countries which ban bitcoin directly or indirectly are the ones using bitcoin even the more by the their citizens. So is there any way to ban or stop the citizens that are interested to use the asset (bitcoin) again. Let the world just approved bitcoin as legal tender asset for all. So that those countries that interested to switch bitcoin can do it without wasting time. One thing in the bitcoin adoption is not only the approval of the asset for everyone to use but the government policies that will also favour the people who are using the asset. Because there are some government that will see the value of bitcoin for individual and start to do their wicked act of creating obnoxious laws and policies to suffer the citizens that using the asset. I wish Bangladeshi government to create a bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies friendly environment for the citizens.",

From the looks of it I'd say the Bangladeshi government simmered down on their crusade against bitcoin, otherwise such a high number as 4 million confirmed active users wouldn't show up like that. I'm not saying they completely accepted bitcoin, coz no news of this thing ever going out has been released yet, but at the very least this means that whatever efforts they have made in the past either didn not work anymore, or they have stopped for some reason in favor of more upfront issues that the country is facing. Whatever that could be, this is a great gateway to better introduce bitcoin in the country. A chance to take a step with the right foot you know what I'm saying? Anyhow, nothing new about this, Bangladesh government still hates crypto, citizens finding out ways to get around this ban, yada yada.",

Keeping or saving the local currency is a poor financial decision because it will lose value in a few years. The people of Bangladesh see bitcoin as a true hedge against inflation that's why they are using and investing in bitcoin. Commercial Banks in Bangladesh are not healthy and cannot be trusted. Most of them are suffering from the effect of financial irregularities and bad debt. People prefer to be their own bank because these banks are not trustworthy and Bitcoin and others are the best and easiest options.https://www.worlddata.info/asia/bangladesh/inflation-rates.php",

The government will make Bitcoin illegal and want to punish everyone who is using it, but this is the time that people always want to start using that currency more. This is because most times they believe that there is something special about that thing that the government said they should not use or that might also be a greater threat in one way or another to the government. Let me use my country (Nigeria) as an example. Since the crypto ban, all I can read and see in the news is the rapid increase in the use of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies by Nigerian citizens.The citizens of Bangladesh know what they want, and they know what's best for them even if the government says it's illegal. All they need is an internet connection, and they will engage in whatever crypto transaction they want to do. The dedication of citizens and their continued resistance bring more pressure on them for more pressing laws, but in cases like this, when the government sees how people are using the currency and they can't control or victimize those using it, the best thing they can do is embrace it with a little form of regulation that will protect its citizens from being exploited by foreign crypto projects and exchanges that might have an interest in operating in Bangladesh. It's just a matter of time before the country makes a move to legalize Bitcoin, just as you have stated that a few bank workers are already in discussion about it.",
