  "content": "Piracetam is one of the first Nootropils. It has to be prescribed in the US by a doctor. Most doctors have barely heard o it, and won't generally prescribe it, because the FDA is against it. People can get it shipped to themselves from Europe or China, where it is used regularly... usually with a prescription.Piracetam makes you smarter, especially when used in conjunction with Choline. Piracetam is similar to the amino acid, Pyroglutamate. Because Pyroglutamate is an amino, people in the US can get it over-the-counter in nutrition stores. Its actions are similar to Piracetam.Anything?",
