The second is Euro and I do not think Euro can take the place of United States dollars with what are going in the world.I would also agree with you, because aside the Euros the other currency that many think will overthrown the dollars is maybe the Chinese Yen. But even with the current crises facing dollars it still has the liquidity. And countries wouldn’t want to hold or reserve another central currency like the yen in exchange for dollars because the economic and worries that they fear with dollars is there with the yen too.My observation is people will actually look to more decentralized currency, and a currency that can actually hedge against inflation so that there won’t be much of worry during economic downturn. So it could be the Gold because it is a great store of value and its limited supply is another advantage. Over few years now central banks are actually holding more Gold. I only see it as an alternative for the main time and it can not be a central currency already or reserve",

The USA. can lose its first powerful position and leading role so when the nation loses its leading position, its fiat currency will lose its value in the world economics too.Gold is no longer be considered as a world standard and gold standard is only a past story. I see big challenge from China for the USA. from science, economics to politics but the USA. has better social and political systems which give me a faith that they will be a better nation than China. China will still be a big competitor for the USA.I think the US. dollar will not lose its leading position too soon.You said \"many powerful and influential countries are now dumping the USD\", where is the source?",

But can this be possible? See how gold is, for decades or centuries, dollar still dominate the foreign reserves. Another thing is that you will see gold excluded and be separated because it is a commodity, categorizing only fiat. With how the government are doing, they are not ready to adopt bitcoin like gold yet, but this may chance overtime. As to what I think, the dollar will stay there for decades if not centuries",

Hopefully no such World War in future but the US dollar will lose that standard position if something very big happens over the world.",

Yes there may be significant downfall on their side, but knowing them? I doubt it. Id imagine that they could do anything that could boost their currency's value. This may be a long path but they will eventually bounce back everytime. You think China or Russia could surpass them? Maybe at somepoint but we also can see how competitive the USD it is.",

The numbers of country still reserving USD as their country's reserved currency is more than those that are dumping it. The United States is still the most powerful country in the world so they'll still stay at the top of all foreign exchange. If any country's currency wants to overtake them, they have to takeover world power from the united state.For another currency to overtake USD, it has to be the most traded currency and many countries aren't comfortable trading other currency apart from USD as they believe in the US economy more than other countries economy that are been said to be the next reserved currency.",

I know that fiat will stay as the strongest there is nothing wrong with that but that doesn't mean that it has to be the only one.I believe that just like how we moved away from paying with cash and started paying with credit cards and such, and now moving towards NFC a lot as well, that means NFC could be used for crypto as well, and that means we could pay people with crypto very easily thanks to innovative technologies. I am not saying it will be simple, but it will certainly be not that hard as well. This is why it's important to keep believing in bitcoin, we may do well or we may not do that well at all, we just need to keep focusing on it.",

Well, those that they're stepping on have an impact to them economically and that's why they're trying to touch other nation's welfare and politics too.",

Countries are only trying to hedge by diversifying central reserves, but the US dollar will inevitably have a high rate of hedging, even China has reserves of more than a trillion dollars. alternatives to the US dollar will not be suitable to be a global reserve currency, as the Chinese yuan focuses on making its currency undervalued, and therefore countries will not use it as a reserve, and the rest of the currencies have a market capacity of less than half a trillion dollars.",
