  "content": "It happens when I'm searching bitcoin/crypto related keywords yet there's no ads showing in the google search using different browsers and starting to wonder why. So I research and found this link from google[1].It mentioned that it requires the advertisers docs and certificates from the country's central banks or authorized body for having the certificate of having a crypto business in one country. And I said why this wasn't a think before? It will probably lessen the scams from google services' ads (google search and youtube) especially newbies who are trying to make a research and unfortunately clicked the ads where scam or fake websites worst malware and then experienced the dark side of crypto because of scammers/hackers.[1] https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/12055790?hl=enI don't know if there is an existing discussion about this, kindly linked the thread here so I can lock the topic.",

They have changed the policy several times but never changed their certification standards against suspicious advertisements and I personally don't see any form of their contribution to combating fake websites.",

      "body": "Perhaps because this update targets people in certain countries, and maybe it is not related to cryptocurrencies, but rather the laws of those countries, which forced Google to comply with them, these laws are not applied to many countries and are constantly updated.QuoteBeginning July 7th, 2022, advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Wallets targeting France, Germany, South Korea and the Philippines may advertise those products and services when they meet the following requirements and are certified by GoogleSource --> https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/12055790?hl=enIt is a good step, as most of crypto advertisers by Google are scammers, but I hope it is a serious policy from them and not because some laws forced them.",

      "body": "It is mainly to adapt their business to a new European law that is taking place as the months go by. Some businesses need to obtain a license from the financial markets authority in order to offer their service in the targeted country. It also allows them to advertise in these countries. That's why Google is also adapting its rules so that businesses can use google ads.A concrete example with binance. Since it got a license in France, its services can be advertised. Advertising is not the main goal of this new law, it's just a point among others.That's at least the reason for the European area. I don't know about others countries but it's surely mainly too to their recent changes in the local regulations (i.e. South Korea, UAB,...)This change in google ads was planned in May, not a big change, it's rather a clarification. of this and some crypto stuff still can't use the advertising platform. Â trading signals, affiliation, ICO, activities related to the purchase, holding or exchange, and so on...Quote from: mk4 on July 20, 2022, 11:41:20 AMGoogle has always been kinda strict as with crypto-related ads, right?Not always, but for some years, yeah.",

      "body": "I had tried to use Google for crypto ads and succeeded as well. You should target keywords that aren't restricted by Google. Or the better option is to place the banner targeting a direct website like Coingecko. So your banner will be visible only there. But sadly I got the impression but never got many clicks. I don't know the reason exactly but at least I succeed to place a banner. But you must need to comply with their banners rules.",

IMO they're doing it to avoid attention from government.You might be correct, but fortunately, i didnt see any news related to scams in google ads lately, some news discussing incidents months ago or even already a year ago.Also, the action is indeed good for their business to avoid government in any way and mostly to the people or the newbies that keep using google search and youtube.Quote from: BitMaxz on July 20, 2022, 11:37:42 PMAnother thing that I noticed is that other countries don't have this policy how about the other countries?

Ive noticed namecheap the domain host has a ton of crypto related filters that wont let you register the domain without providing similar ownership and confirming your identity to help combat fraud. I thought this was pretty cool and definitely heading in the right direction.",
