  "content": "Ok, a whole lot has changed since last post, and now it's somewhat urgent.  This is for Apex at https://apexpl.io/, and due to recent developments without question in my mind it's about to take off.The Apex software has been complete and I've been developing with it for over two years now.  Natrually, there's been loads of bug fixes and enhancements, which is why I'm so confident in it -- it's time tested.  The only lacking was the documentation, which is now 100% including training program.I recently put out some feelers for a business partner as although I'm an excellent back-end developer, I'm a horrible marketer with nearly zero contacts.  Someone up there must be looking out for me, because someone showed up in my inbox who is far better than I could have ever hoped for, and for whatever reason absolutely loves me and is very excited to work on these projects,  Due to her personal privacy and her position of employment, I can't disclose who she is, but she's absolutely perfect for marketing and to obtain quality contacts.Few new developments that just happened today:- She found someone prominent in tech who generally does promotion for $10k, but will do us for $5k.- Shortly, an article featuring Apex will be published on Bloomberg.- She will be consulting with a few potential investors she knows tomorrow, and although I'll need to close the deal, consiering her position I'm sure at least one will come through.Tonight I'll also have a simple referral package done for Apex, and two two of us will do outreach by contracting various YOutubers, blog ownesr, et al.  Ask them to do a review video / article about Apex, and they can place a personalized link within it (https://apexpl.io/USERNAME/) and everyone who signs up under them they get 7.5% of commission for all purchases made from sponsored accounts.On top of Apex, loads of crypto operations are about to come online.  Here's all the documentation I've written:APex Pitch Deck:  https://apexpl.io/APex_Pitch_Deck.pdfApex Business Plan:  https://apexpl.io/Apex_Business_Plan.pdfCrypto / AI Plan:  https://apexpl.io/Crypto_and_AI_Business_Plan.pdfPersonal Resume:  https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdfThis investment will give a massive and much needed steroids shot to the marketing of Apex, plus will spearhead the deployment of the various crypto / AI based operations mentioned in the above document.  At the time of writing, aside from design, the following crypto related operations are ready to go:- Web Wallet (bitcoin and monero, etherum is no problem for later)- Coin Mixer- P2P exchange ala LocalbitcoinsI'm blind, but do have an excellent designer based in Reno ready to go, although he will require full payment.  He already fixed https://apexpl.io/ site free of charge, and in exchange, he gets first right of refusal on all future projects that come through my pipeline.  He does excellent work though, and id great to work with.I also need to incorporate Apex, which this investment will go towards.  If you wanted a percentage of the shares, that can be discussed, but heads up, I'd want more than 0.7 BTC to put you on as a director although open to the possibility.Didn't expect to find this new business partner, nor did I expect her to be so excited and ambitious, and would love to keep this momentum going.  The last thing I feel like doing is contracting myself out again, and instead would prefer to concentrate on building Apex and all those crypto and AI operations while providing you with a solid ROI.  I'm tired of selling my time for money so I can build other people's businesses for them.In exchange, if I have you full paid paid within two weeks I'll offer 20% interest.  If it's within four weeks, 25% interest.  Anything longer will be 30% interests.  I'll pay you 15% profit on a bi-weekly basis until you are fully paid back.If interested, please reach out to me via e-mail at matt@apexpl.io.  Would be happy to share my WhatsApp number with you for a phone consultation.",

And don't tell me about signing a contract...Yeah, I know, that's why I also put \"investment\" in the title.  It's also why I included so much information and supporting documentation.  One of the first things I intend to do upon being funded is incorporate in Delaware.  If desired, upon company formation I would be happy to ensure anyone who helps gets some equity.  Caveat with that though is, if equity is transferred then there is no repayment as the equity is the repayment.  Or there can still be repayment but a legal document would need to be drafted that states upon repayment the equity is automatically transferred back to me.  That's the best I can offer.If anyone wants to discuss, feel free to drop me an e-mail at matt@apexpl.io and I'd be happy to provide you with my WhatsApp number.  Been at this for years though, it's olid, and will work.  Last hurdle.",

You won't find users in the forum giving strangers $20k because they want it for their business. Did you ask a bank for loan?Quote from: EnvrinGroup on September 30, 2023, 09:30:58 AMYeah, I know, that's why I also put \"investment\" in the title.  It's also why I included so much information and supporting documentation.",
