Do you cash out and savor your victory, or do you continue playing in hopes of even bigger winnings?It will not be too hard for me to call it a stop, use the money that was won from gambling, and start something useful. It won't be hard for me because I am not a gambling addict and I don't gamble more often. If, by chance, I happen to win a big amount in one of my try-luck periods, I will move the money out and still continue my normal life of gambling.Â Nothing will change, the wager amount won't also change, and I won't start to gamble more often as that might result in losing everything. I know it's easier to say than to keep, but that's just part of me, and I can keep that decision.",

Would you cash out immediately to enjoy your winnings, or would you keep playing in the hopes of an even more substantial prize? If you hit a big win? Its no brainer that you need to cashout when that already happen to you since if you keep playing with huge accumulated prize you won then provably you have a high chance that money you earned will lose again. We have this bad luck came after that huge win so don't be greedy and settle up already since you already do a good job there. Take out your money out of those casino then secure it on safe place then come back on next day so maybe you can reset your session.To many can stop gambling but for people who newly experience this situation I really think that they got caught up with the incident and think about that they can even win more if they continue to gamble. But same story with other and they lose all they earn then regret their decision on why they continue, so to avoid this to happen to us then listen to those advices that saying cashout since this is really the best option that we can choose here.",

Do you cash out and savor your victory, or do you continue playing in hopes of even bigger winnings?I always have certain limits when I win. For example, if it is above $100 it means I can immediately leave and withdraw from the casino. On the other hand, if it is still under $100 it means I am free to play even if I lose completely. Because by having a win limit, I no longer worry about continuing to play or going out to enjoy the win.Maybe my method will not be the same as other people who will indeed be diverse in dealing with such dilemmas. You can also apply the same thing with winning limits according to your wishes. So you have your own principles when playing at the casino. Whether it's a game based on luck or skill, I will follow the rules I created myself. But of course this doesn't always go well because my mood is not supportive. I once reached $200 but kept playing until it came to a tragic end.",

It depends on how big that victory is.In slot machines I rarely have seen someone playing the same game after that game just gave him the max win that the slot had to offer so in most cases they stop and cash out a big part of the money and keep only a small amount like 25-30% of that big win to keep playing again in their loved games.Trying to play for an even more substantial prize is a risky business and which in most cases end very badly usually by the bettor increasing the bet and losing all the money so the safest thing to do is to cash out 70-75% and the rest to play for even more.",

If there are plans to return to playing, I will look for another casino considering that I am not the type of active gambler who always thinks about gambling. For me, gambling games are just for entertainment and testing luck.",

So for me irrespective of the amount we won on gamble we should at least cash out some of the amount to our savings and keep some of the money on the gambling platform to be using a bit by bit on gambling because there are forces behind gambling that if you decide to leave all the money on the gambling platform you could be tempted to use all the money back for gambling so in other to be on a safer side cash out will be the best.",

Maybe it's because- we wanted to win more, and then there is this element called greediness.For example just like in my last out thing playing online, I just deposited minimum amount and then I turned it to like x10 already is just small amount of time. It just so happen that I'm lucky in picking up numbers and I'm in a roll. So I'm thinking that I should stop already an then quit while I have winnings. But part of me wanted to continue to gamble and look for more profits and continue because I'm lucky that day. Fortunately, I just decided to quit early and not gamble the money that I won because I'm thinking that I can still go and continue to play the next day if I wanted to.",

With me, they are the same in at least two points.The first point, you must afford to lose capital for gambling, trading or investing. All are risky, just big or small but before you start, you must afford to lose your money.The second point, you must cash out and get your initial capital after you win big. As I shared my thinking, not only initial capital but also use part of profit to enjoy your life. With initial capital and part of profit for use, you can use the rest money from a big win for anything without fear.",

But if you ask from a regular gamblerâs point of view, once the luck is active at the moment, then try to seize it as you might still be lucky in your next bets. But remember, always bet on your extra money, which means save the profits youâve won and then bet on your extra money that you are okay to lose. At least, you know youâll make bigger amount if the luck is still there, and if ever you lose, that certain amount will never affect your finances anymore.However, if you are in a bad financial situation and you really need that big amount so badly, then thereâs no reason anymore to continue betting. Gambling outcome is mostly unpredictable, you might win at first but eventually you will lose the next bet. So to free yourself from losses anymore, then never be tempted to bet again.

To survive in the gambling industry and keep going and smile to the bank while others are crying, Whenever you win a game cash it out and only leave the capital and don't leave any part of the funds you won, I bet you that there 99% chance you will give back the whole money to the platform with time, so far you leave the funds in there",
