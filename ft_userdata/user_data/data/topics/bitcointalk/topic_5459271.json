You can buy from  Bitcointalk marketplace, make sure you’re trading with someone who has a good trust rating and is reputable. Also you can use decentralized exchanges to buy bitcoins, you will not be required to do kyc at any point.  Bisq is one of the most recommended decentralized exchange, you can try using them. I searched for threads that may be helpful to you; List of P2P/no-KYC exchangesHelp: A list of LocalBitcoin alternatives (P2P marketplaces)",

And if you traded with someone with decent feedback you didn’t have to worry about getting any issues.It’s crazy why they decided to implement KYC and then later shut it down. These days people are pretty much forced to use an exchange which is KYC or Bitcoin ATM which has crazy fees.",

However in hodlhodl, it seems KYC is mandatory they mention there are two type of accounts. They also not accept all countries. I think the best way is choose the highest score exchange in this site, you can also read the reviews too https://kycnot.me/Quote from: https://accounts.hodlhodl.com/pages/terms_of_serviceyou are not a citizen or tax resident of the United States of America (except if You are using Lend at Hodl Hodl), North Korea, Iraq, Syria, and/or Sudan;Currently, there are two types of accounts - regular account and verified account.“Regular” type of account means that a User who owns this account has only performed standard registration within the Hodlex Ltd authentication system.\"Verified\" type of account means that a User who owns this account has performed the standard registration within the Hodlex Ltd authentication system, and has also entered into an additional agreement with Hodlex Ltd, and has provided all requested identification documents and information and his identity has been verified.",

Because from the start Bitcoin was sold P2P and you can find it on Google or my suggestion is you can go directly to the marketplace section of this forum and open your own thread. My advice, if you want to sell your BTC, it's better to use an escrow from a member who has a good reputation, besides your transactions running safely, of course your risk of losing your BTC is much less.",

I don't know if that's what you are looking for, but any platform that you can send your BTC's and receive fiat should be called an exchange, some of them are not so big or popular and operate only in your local region, but they may be risky.If you don't want to trade through an exchange, you have to look for people around you that may be willing to trade BTC's with you in person. Bisq is a decentralized exchange and they can also connect you to traders for face to face trade, it is a safer option to use Bisq's software to arrange in-person trades.",

What you are referring to P2P on Binance and Kucoin are not P2P. With P2P (peer-to-peer), there is no intermediary. Binance and Kucoin or the centralized exchange are intermediaries.Second, the OP is asking for direct P2P. Or probably he is going to prefer decentralized exchanges too.",
