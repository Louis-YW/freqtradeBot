I no dey put mouth for friend wey dey show friend shege because the person see the life of that person before he make friends with am.For example I get friend and anytime he dey fight with people he love to dey use cutlass or knife fight just imagine I fight with that kind of friend na die be that na.

First the good consequence of being unreserved or open aids ones ability to socialize, foster good relationships with people and even grow a community of like minds. For the bad consequence of being unreserved, there may be people that have unhealthy intentions towards you and then would want to take advantage of your friendliness and interactive nature to put you in a state of worst regrets per say. At the same time, you may tend to say a whole lot of things that'll render you vulnerable to backstabbers and evil hearted people that disguise as good to you.    There's no compulsion to staying reserved, interact, be jovial but be mindful of speech, do not let out things and don't loose guard in communication. Talking excessively can be avoided. Sometimes it's very much good to listen than to speak. To much of details about you should be avoided unless you will be prune to attacks. Know the kind of people you share your personal life with, the world is a cold world. And everyone is only out for themselves.",

And on that note, there are 3 things I have noticed you should never share with anybody , no matter the relationship, and they include; 1. How much you have in your bank account: Because you never can tell, some people could arrange with thieves to come robb you off your money.2. Your next move or plan: Because most people are good at discourage people from executing a plan, but they never suggest a tangible solution to help you grow either financially or academically.",
