      "body": "Is this legit?  If so, can we have a source for the information?I will keep sustaining my own opinion from yesterday.  This seems like a strategic attack targeting decentralization and what Blockchain is supposed to be.  Way too much FUD on a global scale at the same time.  If we have 'Administration' for Blockchains, then the entire reason Blockchain exists vanishes immediately.I take this as a personal attack, one against my own freedoms.  To me.  We either have free chains or we continue to be chained up under our own Government's rules.  Bitcoin is here to offer freedom, not further control.  And whatever they decide, even with an 'Administrative' department, US does not rule the world's actions yet and they can not enforce control over something that requires voting on a global scale.  They seem to forget that Bitcoin is community driven, not Government driven.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "soo many definitions of \"public\" meaning different things.. gotta love it when forum posters dont define them all or show source to ascertain which ones they mean.but lets take a stab at it.. public blockchains are usually ones designed for the public to access as oppose to private blockchains that are invite only (members club style).so the whole \"privacy thing\" stops at the gates of who is involved and how they are included and who is overseeing things. a lil joke in the middle of my waffle. you can have a private member club at a sports venue.. but when you get in the communal shower after playing sports.  your \"private member\" is seen publicly.. so privacy is also not so straight forward right.. anyway back to the pointhowever most governments are not concerned about open&decentralised blockchains like bitcoin. but instead the ICO's that want to be publicly listed on institutional markets. must manage their ICO responsibly by being regulated and accountable and auditable and liable",

This, in another word means the Supreme Court is trying to weaken centralization of power of the agencies and spreading it to states which is some sort of decentralization.By the way, the article on the site you posted has nothing at all to do with what your headline is trying to potrary, it instead potrarying the opposite.",

What does \"private blockchain\" means anyway? It's the first time I've seen someone differentiating \"blockchains\" to public and private. If it isn't accessible by everyone, it's not borderless and, therefore, not censorship resistant; hereby not blockchain.",
