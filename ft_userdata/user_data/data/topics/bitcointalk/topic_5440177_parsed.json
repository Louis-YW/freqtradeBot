Some of these threads as a reference on this question,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5342920https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436154In conclusion, having been involved in various bounties (as a participant) does not mean that you have sufficient capabilities to become a manager. You must have a special skill that is really needed.Quote from: Realkingh on February 17, 2023, 12:06:36 PMPlease you people guide me is this is even possible? if yes then how can i start it?Just knock a few of the managers on this list, but I honestly doubt they need more assistants in their jobs.",

Please you people guide me is this is even possible? if yes then how can i start it?It's possible but do you think that you can compete with those that have already reputation in bounties management? You can try if you want to and no one can stop you in doing so.There are just so many factors that you have to consider for you to be able chosen by those projects that may just choose a bounty manager that has more experience than you.",

Try to offer your proposal to any projects that might be interested to run a bounty campaign. If you wanna be a bounty management team and then try to do what i have said before. It requires a marketing proposal to make sure you can get a client but since you are new and im not sure you can get a new client easily.   You may mostly being rejected by the developers as you didn't have experience or portfolios in managing the bounty campaign. you need to try it even harder.",

Please you people guide me is this is even possible? if yes then how can i start it?Thats gonna be tough for you but who knows. Everyone must start at the bottom. You could improve your marketing strategy to get clients. Chances are those who are long time bounty managers will have an edge here since they are already got experience and the clients probably are looking for those who have and got experience already. Maybe there are some who will but be careful as well cause it might be scammers.",

      "body": "I used to work for one in the past. If I remember correctly they were running a bounty for anyone who spots a cheater on one of their campaigns. I found some and then propose to work for them to check other works/do other tasks. Have a good run with them for months until they stop doing bounty management when the bear market hit. I'd say your best bet if you don't have any connections with bounty managers or bounty team is to find an opportunity like that. Building your reputation on this forum might also help when you apply since most team/managers would likely ignore you if you're just a newbie with a terrible reputation/post history. While I don't know the ins and outs of every management team, I'm pretty sure most of them don't want to hire someone who doesn't even make good posts/contribute to the forum in any way unless they know you beforehand, hence why connections are also important. You can try to build some networks anyway, as long as it is ethical and actually helpful. In fact, I know one or two members who manage to run their own campaign management just because a popular manager recommend them to one of their clients who can't afford a higher pay rate.By building a connection, I don't mean spamming their dms, begging them to hire you, sending a large number of merits when they make a post about payment updates, or other unethical practices. I doubt they'll appreciate it if you do that in the first place. You can build a tool to make their bounty check easier, spot AI texts faster, or even work in a closely related business space such as designing signatures.",

      "body": "Hey Realking, it's important to remember that managing bounties can be a little different than simply participating in them. From what I understand while participating in the bounty, the first thing of course is to build trust in this forum.Second, you must have a community or members who support bounties, for example a Telegram group for job discussions, complaints, payments or other questions.The last thing is about risk, you have to prepare more funds to back up your work because you are like paying a team, a payment fee if at any time the project owner refuses to give a fee. And there are many other unexpected things.",

Please you people guide me is this is even possible? if yes then how can i start it? I mean you have been here since 2years now, but you have only been participating in bounty campaigns as a participant and posting social media reports and nothing more. How exactly do you plan to earn some merits to move on to the next rank keeping the goal of being a bounty manager aside? For that you would need some reputation on this forum at least, obviously being labelled \"bounty spammer\" is not one of that.Have you participant in any constructive discussions on this forum or even any discussion threads at all? Please consider taking part in the forum more and not use it as a place to dump your twitter reports only.Once you start gaining some traction think about offering your services as an apprentice manager.",
