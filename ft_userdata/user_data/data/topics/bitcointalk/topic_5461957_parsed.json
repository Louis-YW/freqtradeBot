If you have not staked your wallet address in the forum, please do so here",

Without them, you can't prove ownership of the funds in your wallet  and you won't have control over them. There are other use case of the private keys, that is for example. If you lose your device you can use the private keys to restore your wallet on a new device and regain access to your funds. Similarly, if you switch to a different wallet provider you'll need the private keys to import your wallet and use the new service. You just have to remember that your funds are not stored in the wallet itself but are recorded on the Blockchain. The wallet only displays the amount of funds associated with that address.",

With more entropy security is improved but the sentence length increases. We refer to the initial entropy length as ENT. The allowed size of ENT is 128-256 bits.Even the 24 words seed phrases with 256 bits of entropy have 128 bits of security just like the 12 words seed phrases.",

Because one with private keys coyld easily get access to your wallet account for example, i have a scenario for you. When we make metamask wallet as extension on chrome or any browser. We then asked for password to log in but if we have forgot the password we are asked for private keys to login to wallet (to recover the wallet) if you don't have the private key then you have to uninstall the wallet and then during creation you have to select the import option and then put the seed phrase or you will see another option of recover from private keys. So, i hope you know might understand the importance of private keys. Quote from: Cruxleo on August 03, 2023, 01:28:43 PMSecondly, what other times would a wallet owner need to personally use the private keys aside from its primary automated role of authorize transactions?I have already answered this query in the last answer but instead of recovering accounts private keys are used to authorize each activity on your wallet like making swap, transaction etc. But that depends on the wallet you are using as not every wallet will ask for Private keys as another wallet might be asking.",

      "body": "Just as Upgrade00 pointed out. The security is actually on the number bits of entropy produced and the best is that which is between 128 bits and 256bits. A words less than 12 will certainly generate a lower entropy which will weaken the strength of guessing them. The 12 words I think (based on what I read on the forum here) produces the same number of bits as a private key (128) which in terms of security doesn’t matters how many bits of entropy is generated, since the level of the private key security is 128 bits. That is why most wallet stick to the 12 words.

As above post explained that the private key is derived from the seed phrase. It is actually true that the private key is derived from the seed phrase which means that you can use your seed phrase to extract the private key of any wallet address if the wallet provider you are using have different wallet address like receiving address, change address and more if ever you want to extract a private key (let's call it that way) because honestly, I tried it myself.Anyways, custodial wallets are different since when you create a wallet in there then you won't get to know the private key or seed phrase.",
