If you had left him the money, he would most likely not have returned it to you and you would then be the ackward one with him at family gatherings.In my language we say that whoever lends money to a friend, loses the money and the friend, which is true although with exceptions, not 100% of the time. You can apply this to family members as well. There are times when it is worthwhile to lend a relative or friend money, because they are reliable, because they have encountered an exceptional unforeseen circumstance and the like, but in most cases this is not the case.",

That type of not acknowledging you during that reunion was a sign that he's a toxic person.You've worked hard for that money and it's not a small amount to be lending him away. I know that people needs some help in times of need but who's there to help you when you're in need?You don't have to validate others feeling but what you need to validate is your feelings and your needs.",

      "body": "Money and family ties? Happens a lot, to most of us. Problem here is people using ties as an advantage for privileges such as being able to lend in an instant and for extending the period that the borrowed amount should be paid. This is also evident with social relations or friendships in particular. On my end, if the amount is huge and I know for myself that the person won't be able to return the money I will just give him a percentage of the amount he is needing, without requiring him to pay. Perhaps an individual is lending $1k, I'd give him 50 bucks with initiative just to free myself from guilt and to be safe from regrets. If I would allow his request inspite of being aware of negative tendencies, I'd be having problem afterwards.",

However, have you personally known this family member to be untrusted from your previous financial dealings with him or you just relied and concluded from what was said about him by others? This question is out of the misjudgement we have on others especially when we have not had that kind of personal bizarre encounter with them. Well in this kind of situation what people who fear about refund but desire to help do is, to give part of the loan money that you can afford to lose as gift not to be returned and by that you inform the receiver you don't have all of the money but that you can help with this little. Believe it there is need to keep family going rather than severing it totally by our action or inaction.",

Maybe if at that time you gave a loan and he couldn't pay it in a timely manner, that would be a new problem again, maybe when we met, he would feel even more awkward than now.Because I also have experience with this. Very traumatized by this debt problem. I have a close friend, at that time the economy was not stable, his wife was pregnant, then she wanted to give birth. He begs for help, the reason is to buy baby milk, who can bear to see it, while I can help. That was several times until the debt was around $1500. So when I was having a hard time, there was no money, I needed money. When I bill it, it's hard to ask for forgiveness, until it's like someone begging. Even though I had given him more than 8 months to prepare the funds, it didn't even need to be paid off.It's really sad, the promise at the beginning will be paid on time, when I bill it turns out there isn't any. I finally had to ask someone else for a loan.",

Likewise, if you lend money to him and don't pay, you will have an awkward situation, I have experienced that too, but the situation is that you are the one who feels annoyed, especially if the money that is loaned is money that we use to operate our business, position you will be more difficult if that happens.",

Anyway, I hope he is doing fine now and best wishes to him.It's just you're good moral that is making you feel sorry for not giving your cousin the loan that he asked from you. Well, you should not worry about him or the relationship you have with him, if he has betrayed you once then you should not lend him any more money in the future. If he still has not talked with you then no doubt when he will need the money he will definitely come to you again but as you mentioned he is not trustworthy, so I must say the money should not go waste like I know lending him money will be of great use to him but it will be of no use to you. I can assume this, from the scenario that you mentioned above. Some cousins are very close and live around you or near to you like maybe not in the same city but not that far and you met with them from time to time and you gave and take some items, like food, money or lend any home appliance for a short period of time and then you took them back. Those cousins are trustworthy and in your scenario, this cousin met you after a long time on a family occasion. (this convinced me to assume that he is not a cousin who lives near you or you have less relationship with him. well talking about myself, I also have a cousin that I met the first time, well he was near to my other cousin ( to whom I was really close) but that cousin (whom I met the first time) scammed me with money by giving me the fake opportunity of job and took some money from me that after some time I came to know, does not require by that company. The bonus was, I was neither called for a job interview. When I share this scene with my close cousin then he asked him why did you do that. well, now they both do not talk with each other neither am i. No doubt money is not that important but it's not money that relates you with your relative it's trust and devotion to each other with no lies or fakeness. well once I saw these immoralities in my cousin (to whom I met the first time) I never talked or interacted with him after that because i know what is the nature of him and he will again thug me,",

There are some extreme examples and emergencies, where if you have a strong relationship, that goes equally both ways - then it can make sense to give someone money to help them out, if you have it to spare. However the keyword there is give. Lending money to friends and family is only going to lead to lots of problems in the longer run. If they need money then give it to them on the basis that you expect to lose it all and only what you can reasonably afford, that way when they do pay it back it works out best for everyone. Nobody that asks, essentially begs, for money and is angry when you refuse is worth being around anyway - your cousin did you a favor by showing how little they value you.",

It can be difficult to make decisions regarding lending money, especially when it involves family. It's important to prioritize your financial well-being and to only lend money to those who you trust and believe will be responsible with the funds. It's unfortunate that your cousin may be holding a grudge against you for not lending him the money, but it's important to stay true to your values and not be swayed by guilt or pressure. Ultimately, you made the best decision for yourself and your financial future.",
