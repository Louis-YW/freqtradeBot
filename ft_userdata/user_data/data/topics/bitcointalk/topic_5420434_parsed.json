  "content": "Hello miners,I am thinking about purchasing an Antminer S19J Pro (104 TH/s - 3068W). Are there any important points that are essential to know before buying this model that would speak against a purchase? For example, known issues, serious errors, incompatibilities with certain other components or pools ... ? What firmware is the latest and what software is recommended, what Step-By-Step instructions are worth to read for someone never owned an Antminer?Glad to receive helpful answers.",

Anyway, check this link \"First time/Small miner reference for getting started.\"About s19j I don't know if this unit is problematic but take note of flashing it because there are two types of control board on this unit.",

What exactly you mean by \"take note of flashing\", do you mean I should upgrade the firmware at the 1st step? Can you provide a link with more details on this? Thank you.",

      "body": "There are two types of s19j pro that bitmain released I heard many complaints about flashing this unit with the wrong firmware.The two types that I mean are the BB board and the zynq 7007 board.Sample this issue s19j PRO won't fully boot after firmware update.\"So make sure to check the control board to use the correct firmware before you flash it.And don't flash the unit if the miner is working fine; only flash the unit if the unit has some software issue.",

Anyone else, something worth to know about this model ?I have a few of the 110th S19Pro's 4 x of the S19A models have been running well over 6 months or so but I did have a single control board fail.Out of 5 other S19J Pro's 110th models I have had 2 issues with the control board not seeing the 3rd hashboard in the chain. 1 of which even has a charred control board straight from Bitmain... So my short term assessment is you need a bit of luck with the S19J Pro models whereas the S19A Pro's seem to be a bit more solid... Or maybe its just crappy luck",
