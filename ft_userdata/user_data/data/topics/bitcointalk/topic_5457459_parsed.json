I have also felt uneasy many times because of my name coming out in public places while browsing the forum. And now it will not happen again by using this script.But one new request to you guys, In this script, only the above name and avatar can be hidden, but when entering the profile summary, it shows the user name, so another request to you guys is to create a script that hides the name in the profile summary as well.Thanks.quoting for fast view:Quote from: TryNinja on April 06, 2019, 09:05:11 PMCode:// ==UserScript==// @name     Hide BitcoinTalk Username and Avatar// @include   https://bitcointalk.org/*// @version  1// @grant    none// ==/UserScript==try {    document.getElementById(\"smfheader\").style.visibility = \"hidden\";    document.getElementById(\"hellomember\").style.visibility = \"hidden\";    document.getElementsByClassName(\"avatar\")[0].style.visibility = \"hidden\";} catch { }",

Personally, I sometimes take a number of days. Maybe that's why it wasn't considered. Maybe some coding geek can modify the script, but IMO, I don't think it's necessary/big deal.",

And that is what these scripts do .It only solves the privacy risk for those of you who use the forum in public places such as public transportation; I don't think hiding your forum username serves any security purpose; the script is just for fun. I was hoping the script would be able to hide one's identity from an old thread but it does not work that way. I've learned not to browse the forum outside of my work space and I don't even access it on my phone anymore, so I don't think I'd need such a script.",

At least with this choice, I reduce risk but it is not perfect and the script request makes sense.Personally, I am not fan of user script as I don't know what they code  . I can not verify script by myself and I choose a safe approach, don't use it to avoid putting my laptop at infection risk.  Even you hide your username but if you bring your laptop around and shows that you are using Bitcointalk at public eyes, it is already a bad practice.",

Most people are actually wary of exposing their username when in public because it actually breaches their privacy. In a real sense imagine me having to be caught up in same place with you and without you having a knowledge that I am member of Bitcointalk forum you open your account and your username shows up, then I have actually known the person behind that account.

There may be a time you necessarily need to use the forum but you are in the public place. It will make sense if you can continue to use the forum while hiding your data than not to use at all. The former means you have freedom to do whatever  you want because you can maneuver your ways while the later means you are constrained.I remember LoyceV saying that he uses Loyce mobile while on transit or so, that also shows that you  can have the need to use the forum in the public place.",
