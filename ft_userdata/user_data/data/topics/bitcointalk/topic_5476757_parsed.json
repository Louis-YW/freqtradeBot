Other miners may tell you not to mine this coin and it may be a scam, but they themselves will mine it. The hashrate is growing and miners are hoping for a repeat with karlsencoin(KLS), when the first miners made a good profit. From a regular rtx 3060 video card, when sold for 10 cents, the profit was more than $10 per day. There wasn’t even that much on Ethereum.",
