I don't think it's a good idea to create new stable coin that is based on 1kwh electricity. If you want to use crypto as a payment in a charging station for your tesla then why not use existing crypto either it's a stable coin like usdt, usdc or use Ethereum, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",

If they really wanted to continue with their goal then they should find a way to make the market accept it and it's uses too. I would also ask where I can use the stable coin and what can I do with it to earn profit. I wonder where it's price will be based since the stable coin will be pegged with 1kwh after all.

Instead of having distinct local pricing structures, electricity would likely be pushed towards a single worldwide price or a small range of prices (like other commodities such as oil and gold). However, it is nonetheless likely that the production costs of electricity will continue to vary by country and by region based on local factors such as local demand, the price of labor, local infrastructure, natural resources, and even the local weather. Therefore, location-based opportunities for arbitrage using E-Stablecoin may continue to exist.QuoteSecond is, won't this project inflate the price of electricity? Economically I am baffled about its effect on electricity production, electricity costs, and electricity consumption. Here you go:The minting of new E-Stablecoin tokens requires the consumption of electricity. Will electricity markets be able to stably bear the new demands placed on them (as electricity is consumed to mint new E-Stablecoin tokens as stores of value)? Ostensibly, yes. Each year approximately three trillion dollars’ worth of electricity is consumed globally . In order to mint one trillion dollars’ worth of E-Stablecoin tokens over the course of twelve years (comparable to Bitcoin), this action would only increase global electricity demand by an average of 2.8%. For comparison, the electricity consumption worldwide from 2010 to 2018 increased by roughly 2.8% per year . Moreover, studies have suggested that long-term electricity supply elasticities are in the range of 0.98-2.7  . This range suggests that electricity markets should be able to compensate their supply to account for the slight increase in demand associated with E-Stablecoin token minting, without drastically altering prices.",

The user mines the stablecoin using electricity then transfers it to someone else who can spend the stablecoin to pay for electricity? Does that mean that the electricity utility provider needs to be in on the scheme? Which chain will this be on?
