  "content": "This exploit appears to be being used against Ethereum users and I speculate that other blockchains that were forked from Ethereum like Binance smartchain, Avalanche, Fantom and Tron might also have this problem.The article also mentions that wallets between 2014 and 2022, however, was Ethereum not created until 2015?A sophisticated wallet drainer has stolen more than $10M worth of assets since December 2022 across 11 different blockchains.The exploit appears to target experienced users who created their wallets between 2014 and 2022, according to MyCrypto founder and CEO Taylor Monahan.The attack vector remains undetermined, however. MetaMask, the leading wallet provider, said that its security team is working in tandem with other wallet providers to figure out the source of the exploit.The attacker swapped users’ tokens for ETH, routing the trades through MetaMask Swap, Uniswap, or 0x.They usually don’t drain NFTs, staked assets, and other low-cap tokens. However, in some cases, the leftover assets were stolen later.Users with smaller amounts on Ethereum-compatible chains would have their assets bridged and moved out once the attacker had gathered enough ETH to pay for gas fees. The assets would then get converted into Bitcoin using services like FixedFloat, SideShift and SimpleSwap.Within a week after the conversion, the assets would be run through a Bitcoin privacy mixer such as Coinomize, Wasabi, or CryptoMixer.Monahan concluded by saying that the exploit is not specific to Metamask and that all wallets, including hardware wallets, are affected by this unknown yet active exploit.Read in full https://thedefiant.io/unknown-wallet-exploit-10m",

It should be: https://thedefiant.io/unknown-wallet-exploit-10mAlthough the amount might be small compared to its many coins' marketcap, this kind of attack vector is truly concerning if it still goes undetected. Fortunately, someone is aware something off is happening.Anyway, the one who investigate the issue claimed that those who were affected is his friend and OGs, which he also claimed were \"reasonably secure.\" I don't think a widespread hack attempt or phenomenon can see easily concluded by mere subjective claims of user digital securities practices. There are many variables that go into the tables when a user lost his funds. Besides, if it happens widely, the amount should be enormous. So, I'm sure to seek the root cause, more and more information is required to get to know the exploit better.",

But compared to other hacks here in the crypto space, that seems small compared to others.And ethereum was described during the time of 2013 and being launched formally after 2 years which is 2015, so there is Ethereum during these times. Ethereum is still undervalued at this time based on my knowledge.",

Cause if they target eth wallet users then there must be a way on how they can do that with ease and how does users like us prevent this. Is this worst than phishing site? Cause Im sure everyone got aware of it now and must be careful in handling malicious sites. If this is new then I wanna know how.",

If coins in hardware wallets can be stolen, might this exploit be something that can give the hacker the ability to bruteforce the seed phrases? An exploit like this that has stolen only $10 million must have been done only through bruteforcing means because it is taking much time. Unless the hacker is smart and does want to be very public on what he discovered hehe.@o48o. Thank you, I have changed it already.",

There are some platforms that experience this kind of attack, Pancakeswap is the one that I remember since it prominent platform. In short, the hacker attacks the hosting provider to change some particular site's actual server into the one they control.Quote from: FUCKBSVFUCK on May 10, 2023, 09:35:50 AM~Indeed it seems there is no recent news about this issue. As I have said, a lot of variables go into place, so to conclude the evidence of the exploit is tricky. One thing I believe for sure is that this issue is not coin-related or even EVM chains related. It must be a user-related problem.",
