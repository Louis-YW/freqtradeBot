Are you the sender or the receiver? How much is the fee used for your transaction?If you are the sender and you are in a hurry, you can bump the fee.If you are the receiver and you in a hurry, you can do CPFP.",

The Sparrow help forum from their Telegram thread asked me to go to sparrownodevalidator.com so that my server receptor can be updated.  This sounds odd. Does anyone have any experience with sparrow's node validator and updating their server like this? The sparrow help forum? Does such a thing exist? There are many scams on Telegram, there are many online scams too. Keep in mind that you shouldn't click on any random google search result you see when you type something.Do not download anything from unofficial site and unofficial telegram channel, always verify every source that you check. Do not download any fake Sparrow wallet or you'll end up like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/168g5q8/sparrow_wallet_upgrade_and_sats_are_gone/What server receptors should be updated? I don't understand.Official Sparrow Developer: Craig RawOfficial Sparrow Wallet website: sparrowwallet.comOfficial Sparrow Github page: https://github.com/sparrowwallet/You can visit mempool.space to check bitcoin transaction fees.You can use RBF (Replace by Fee) option to increase fee and get transaction confirmed soon.You can use CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) if you can't use RBF but since you use Sparrow, you'll be able to use RBF, so, this function might not be interesting for you.",

      "body": "With Sparrow wallet, you can use Replace by FeeHow do I increase the fee on a broadcasted transaction?[url]QuoteA transaction’s fee can be increased either by replacing it (RBF), or creating a child transaction (CPFP).To perform Replace by Fee (RBF), the transaction must:Be in the mempool (not yet confirmed)Have all inputs enabled for RBF (this is the default for transactions sent by Sparrow)Have all inputs from your walletIf all the above is true, then Sparrow will add a hover icon next to the transaction on the Transactions screen which looks like a hand with a cross above it. You can also right click to ‘Increase Fee’, which takes you to the Send screen with the transaction loaded, from where you can increase the fee (Sparrow may add another UTXO if there is insufficient change).You can also use CPFP by spending the outputs of the transaction at a higher fee rate.Replace by fee is helpful and you should always check that your broadcast transaction is RBF opt-in. It it is not opted in, you will not be able to use RBF to bump transaction fee later and you will have the only choice left, Child-Pay-For-Parents that are more expensive and harder to use for newbies.",
