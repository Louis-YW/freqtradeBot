And at that time BTC was originated and the first exchange, the concept of Blockchain was represented on the Bitcoin dot org website and on this forum. Well, this forum didn't look like back in time as it looks now. Plus you can find many messages from the founder of BTC here on Bitcointalk. Let me mention his/her profile here.Satoshi. When I found out that this platform has played an important role in the adoption of BTC then I was totally stunned because I was using this platform and did not realize that Satoshi was also a member of this platform.So I hope you have gotten the answer of who made BTC, and why it was made. And also where it was developed.",

Since its a decentralized project, the who and where questions arent important aspect to know. The question why, though was apparently said that the creator (Satoshi) wanted to build and spread this amazing bitcoins to use for peer to peer transactions without interactions of third party people. Well still works today, but improved or affected by a lots of third party either for the better or worse outcome.",

The how? the who? the why? and the where?Many details are kept secret, but the one left out that everyone knows the reason is the \"why\" it was created.You said \"his name\" @Op, no one knows the identity and gender of \"the who\". Nobody is also sure if it was one person or many people using one name.",

But recent days people are still supporting the centralized platform even its opposite with the use of bitcoin itself. You can check here content of GazetaBitcoin how does the people treat recently the bitcoin. 12 years later and people still don't know to use Bitcoin nor what it's good for. Another thing take it easy with the knowledge given to you right now its overwhelming but sooner or later you will understand from the basics.",

It is only the buyer and the seller that is involved when trading and to also give you the access to be your own bank i.e only you can have access to your bitcoin and no one else can know if you have a bitcoin or not. To wrap it up privacy is all what it boils down to,privacy in your transactions. Next time you should use the google to make research so that you can learn on your own. You should read the articles provided by forum member that posted above before my post for more knowledge.",

Funny how you asked a question that you can easily get an answer using Google but I believe you have received so many links and response concerning the question that you asked so ensure you read through them so you don't ask same question again especially the once that has been asked by other newbies. I believe you have gotten the answer so focus now on learning more if having knowledge of bitcoin is the reason why you got registered here and stop creating multiple threads with little or no information that will be beneficial to members here.",
