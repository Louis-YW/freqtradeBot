      "body": "(Probably not technical support btw)That's really a matter of perspective. At this point we know a few things for certain:1. It is Currency, people trade it for other currencies all the time2. Digital Cash was coined by people like David Chaum before bitcoin and was used to describe many implementations of currency that utilzed cryptography. In Chaums case it was focused on blind signatures mainly (But suffered from centralization).3. It is both 'Virtual' and 'Electronic' because it occupies cyber space not physical space per-say (but it does rely on physical constraints mainly for security: https://bitcoin.sipa.be/)Ultimately naming something is just a bi-product of such a thing existing. The details for bitcoin are utterly complex but are generally considered to be sound (https://thesaurus.plus/related/solid/sound hence 'sound money' as it is also called sometimes).However many people try to affinity scam the truly decentralized nature of Bitcoin and sell you on some other coin that they own a ton of so they can dump at the next opportunity. Don't fall for that. Ethereum for example had a HUGE pre mine which still causes its price to suffer tremendously. Not to mention shares were sold before the launch of the chain (happens on tons of PoS chain too) which is so sketchy and does not represent even cryptographic computational certainty, it just looks like digital fraud to people who are not insiders like me.",

According to Wikipedia:Quote from: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency#:~:text=Virtual%20currency%2C%20or%20virtual%20money,of%20a%20specific%20virtual%20community.Virtual currency, or virtual money, is a digital currency that is largely unregulated, issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted electronically among the members of a specific virtual community.Which means bitcoin is a virtual currency. Bitcoin, altcoins, CBDCs, traditional fiat that are transferred electronically with the use of bank apps, master card, visa card transfer and the likes are all digital currencies because they can be transferred digitally or electronically. But those, like bitcoin are virtual currencies. Which means that CBDCs and others which are centralized and controlled by the government are not virtual currencies but they fall under digital currency category. Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies. Virtual currencies are cryptocurrencies.Digital currency are electronic cash. According to my explanation, I believe you have known now that bitcoin is an electronic cash, cryptocurrency, virtual currency and also a digital currency.",

People can describe it according to what works for them because it expands another aspects of bitcoin as a new technologies to draw more attentions.Like Facebook, Instagram, tik tok and all.

While virtuality and particularly a virtual world can well be a good-looking extension of reality, it can't exist on its own without software and people actually \"living\" inside its environment. Decisions made and actions taken inside a virtual environment can't affect the state of the physical world, which means they only matter for the concrete instance of virtual reality. Virtual currency is also a part of the said virtual system; all economic activities involving virtual currency simply cannot improve the state of the real economy, let alone this currency has no way of becoming a globally-accepted means of payment. People who understand what this term really means can use it to attack bitcoin because virtuality is often associated with frivolousness, childish behavior, and pipe dreams. In their opinion, people who will use such a virtual currency are certainly not capable of making serious decisions, including those regarding the management of the economy.",

Cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to maintain a public ledger of transactions and ensure that new units are created in a predictable and secure manner.This is simply inaccurate there are a majority of coins that call themselves Cryptocurrency, decentralized, 'use blockchain', etc... And literally one of them is proven to actually be decentralized and that is Bitcoin. The 2nd on the market is a pre-mined, government & big bank affiliated, centralized operation and you can estimate that pretty much everything lower on the market than that has a slew of similar issues. It is legitimately financially dangerous to suggest otherwise.",

All of it is just the same, and it all works to describe bitcoin, it doesn't really matter a lot what are you going to name bitcoin since its all correct but I would pick the Digital currency or Virtual Currency since it was made as a currency that you could use virtually or online. A way to make a transaction online or on the internet.I think the cryptocurrency name is a little broad because cryptocurrency could also refer to other alternative cryptocurrency like ETH, XRP,, and BNB, etc. The way I look at it is, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, and all the altcoins as well, so they are all cryptocurrencies. I mean if you compared it to Ethereum that have a different purpose it might become a digital currency as well since you could send it to someone or use it as a payment I suppose but it wasn't its main purpose. I guess people just easily assume its Bitcoin because a lot of people only know about bitcoin and doesn't really know anything about the other cryptocurrencies other there.",
