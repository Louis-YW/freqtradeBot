  "content": "QuoteThe famous author has warned on several occasions that the U.S. pension crisis is much worse than we thought. In 2020, he co-authored a book titled “Who Stole My Pension?” with Edward Siedle. In the book, the authors discussed “the greatest retirement crisis in the history of our nation and … the entire world.” When pension funds almost collapsed recently in England, Kiyosaki warned that a similar situation could happen in the U.S.Kiyosaki previously explained that “the U.S. dollar became fake money” when President Richard Nixon removed it from the gold standard in 1971. “This is because rather than being tied to real money,” such as gold, “it was tied to the ‘full faith and credit’ of the United States,” the Rich Dad Poor Dad author noted. In September, he said the end of fake money is here; he expects the U.S. dollar to crash by January.The renowned author has said repeatedly that he doesn’t trust the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, President Joe Biden, and Wall Street. In February, he warned that the Fed and the Treasury are destroying the U.S. dollar, advising people to buy bitcoin.He recently stressed that cryptocurrency cannot be blamed for the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, emphasizing that bitcoin is not the problem. He called former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried the Bernie Madoff of crypto. Earlier this month, Kiyosaki explained that he is a bitcoin investor, not a trader, and he gets excited when BTC hits a new bottoI always look up at Rober Kiyosaki when it comes to financial motivation and advises.  I had been following this guy's insights and read his books.  So I was relieved when I known that he is also invested in Bitcoin, which means I made the right decision when I engaged myself in Bitcoin community.  There is not much tosay in this thread since the explanation is pretty clear that the USD is bound to collapse ever since President Richard Nixon removed it from the gold standard in 1971.Source:https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoin-investors-to-get-richer-when-fed-pivots-prints-trillions-of-dollars/",

He has long since predicted a financial catastrophe like no other, which did not happen, and then acknowledged that he was wrong, because he did not foresee the massive stimulus programmes that were to be implemented by the central banks.There is a certain logic to what he says, because at the slightest sign the central banks are going to start printing money like crazy again. The economy is too dependent on it. When that happens, a lot of that money will go into real assets like bitcoin or gold, as usual. To what extent he is right about pension systems, only time will tell, because governments have a lot of room for manoeuvre, and if there are massive bankruptcies of pension systems, nobody is going to contribute to them, and that is not in the interest of governments.",

Sure he wrote a good book however when it comes to investing, almost all his predictions never come true.He was for years waiting for a stock market crash, real estate crash and everything. And for the few months he has been saying stocks will go lower when they bounced.It’s great that he is bullish on crypto and Bitcoin but his predictions are rarely true.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is on a roller coaster ride, so much so that it is difficult to say whether it will continue to rise and soar or fall into the pit of market correction despair. Kiyosaki is an economist and a businessman, so he knows very well about financial matters. He sees the rise in bitcoin prices as a reflection of the Fed's need to print more money and the effect this has on the market. The tone is positive Kiyosaki believes that the current rise in bitcoin prices is simply a response from investors getting ready for when the Fed improves its strategy.Personally I feel we are in a time when the Fed should pull out all the stops to devalue the dollar, including buying trillions of dollars in treasury bonds or increasing the Fed funds rate by at least 2%. When this does happen, I believe common-sense investors will start looking for ways to protect themselves from this potential crash and will switch to gold, silver, and large amounts of Bitcoin.",

This is hilarious.Gold, silver and Bitcoin won't make you rich, they will simply preserve your wealth when fiat money turns into toilet paper.",

And as Don Pedro Dinero said, it's easy to get rich by buying bitcoin for $69k and selling it for $17k. LOL.Bitcoin is an investment that can bring high returns, but it is not a god that can make anyone who invests in it rich. Everyone will have a different investment concept, there is nothing wrong with investing in bitcoin and nothing wrong with someone investing in gold. I don't know if you've become a billionaire by investing in bitcoin, but I do know that billionaires these days, all invest in gold.",

With the ever growing recession this is gonna get worst in the near future. Business owners (like big companies) with management knows internal maths, they have the experts to tell everything about their finances and they already know how recession and inflation gonna burst the fake dollar soon. That's why we have already seen lot of lay offs from bigger companies. New talent acquisition is future stuff now. If they keep printing then definitely what this economist said is the good piece of advice. Invest, but invest in correct asset value.",

When you print free money, people do buy bitcoin that is true and the price goes up, but people also buy stocks and gold and silver too and those prices go up too. That is also called inflation, which means during a period with 10% inflation, if your company made 3% more profit than last year then you failed, you should be making at least 11% profit to keep up, probably more and most companies charge more to make that extra profit, and that means your investments go up, but your costs too and that is why it's not that vital for people to focus just on bitcoin, you could invest in anything and will do fine.",

CBDC I'm not certain about. Would it be more boomer or youth oriented? The real issue here is everyone is scrambling to find an asset they can store their wealth in to stave off concerns of inflation. I'm not certain why Kiyosaki advocates heavily for silver. He's done it for more than 10 years. I remember receiving emails and investment recommendations more than 10 years ago from people who were influenced by Kiyosaki into buying silver. Kiyosaki has literally had the same hustle for more than a decade and it is still going strong apparently.What precious metals like gold and silver really need IMO if they're to gain value. Is for markets in areas that have been devastated by natural disasters to revert to a payment system based upon precious metals. To prove that it can be viable and useful in emergencies or the apocalypse. The way things are going, I don't know if people would know how to recognize gold or silver in a post apocalyptic setting. There would appear to be no infrastructure to support it.",
