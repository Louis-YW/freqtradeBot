  "content": "The Shiba Inu team has announced a major partnership with The Third Floor (TTF), the busiest visualization company known for working on dozens of Marvel blockbusters. TTF will help the developers behind the popular meme coin to define virtual environments for the metaverse project, taking control of artistic development.            The American company has worked on such projects as “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Wonder Woman,” “Thor: Ragnarok,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” and other prominent movies. TTF has also worked on video games, including “Doom” and “Residential Evil 6” as well as episodic shows. Dane Smith, chief creative officer at TTF, said that the artistic-driven vision shared by the Shiba Inu community was “inspiring.” Smith believes that the metaverse can potentially offer an infinite number of possibilities and mixed-reality experiences.Read more on U.Today https://u.today/shiba-inu-partners-with-longtime-marvel-collaborators",

With just a slight increase while you have billions of SHIB, you can already make thousands of money. Its a numbers game really that with just a slight jump of price it amplifies your investment a hundred times already.  Partnership like this may not show spikes of price  yet but maybe when there is a metaverse update for it.",

I like metaverse and want to invest in any of the top metaverse projects in the ecosystem for long-term goal but am not sure about shiba inu as a long-term thing (I might be wrong), just my opinion.",

I don't like to hold it and I don't want to put much money into this. The news sort of brought some uplifting to the investors but that won't define the entire outcome of shiba in the near future because it has to be applied to see how it will go.

I might rethink my thoughts about shiba.",

Well, that's kinda huge and we know how huge their community too, that's what drives Shiba Inu to what he is right now. Not putting that much of an attention but it's good if both of them benefit on each other with this but first we need application from their sides on how this partnership flourish, until then I say it's still unclear.",

The focus is over the development of the metaverse project in which the community members were able to mint land plots on the virtual space. Hope this takes the Shiba to a bigger bounce.",

And since this is their expertise, it might elevate it to new heights?Anyhow, let's see how it goes and let the Metaverse bandwagon continue, and hopefully this collaboration will be a success.",
