      "body": "This is a business and also a very good idea because indirectly those who wear clothes with the bitcoin logo can introduce bitcoin to people who still don't know bitcoin when wearing it. And with this, people who are still not familiar with it will be lured by nice t-shirts with the bitcoin logo, because if they are interested in those t-shirts with the bitcoin logo, they will ask what is bitcoin. Or they can look for it themselves by looking for it on the internet if curious.although bitcoin is now popular but I'm sure there are still many people who don't know about it at all, and introducing various ways to show the bitcoin logo is a good move.and in my opinion the t-shirt with the bitcoin logo that you are displaying is very good and also matches the color of the shirt and the color of the writing or the bitcoin logo, very interesting.",

Why am I asking? Because I know there are people who have zero knowledge about Bitcoin, if such people buy this kind of cloth, they could just be wearing it without knowing what it is, or someone who sees it might not equally know what it is. For example, there are some signs or stickers one will see on clothes, and you will just overlook them and conclude that they're just a design.And also, I hope it's safe to wear those clothes around your country because I noticed that the online store you publish here doesn't allow someone outside your country to buy them yet. So if people only living in your country are the only ones to buy those shirts, is it safe to publicly wear them since buying and selling Bitcoin is not allowed in your country? Just concerned about safety. You know, some countries are so strict with their rules that they punish any idea that tends to go against the regulations.",

A d since bitcoin  is already banned in your country, I wouldn't advice him to keep identifying himself with bitcoin directly as it might be so some point a disobedience to the officials and government  agency? And he might even at some point as well be tag for conspiracy against the government  which is a very big offense that might lead to a brutal consequences.There are other ways he would have done  this than putting himself in a big mess and also placing a price on the t-shirts I'm wouldn't be a nice idea because you don't expect to buy a t-shirt for that amount and still be at the risk of bearing the consequences  of wearing the t-shirt.Whatever  the case might be, your friend should be more careful  and try staying  low key on cryptocurrency in your country now.",

I have seen some people share out Bitcoin Mertc for free just for the awareness purposes.But in this case I can see someone who is trying to use bitcoin popularity for his own good and it’s so sad people are actually taking advantage of that, he is lucky that there one person that has trade marked bitcoin if not that won’t be possible.",

Every bitcoin enthusiast and lover wishes to find a way to spread bitcoin knowledge in their community, but some are unable to do so due to the severe restrictions on the use of bitcoin in such areas. If what he's done won't get him in trouble, he should keep going since I'm convinced he'll generate more sales with this design because it'll be unique in that area. What he has done has also helped to raise awareness of bitcoin in some way. People will be curious about what the inscription on the new clothes implies when they see them. As a result, the public is aware of it, and his goal of sharing bitcoin awareness has been accomplished.",

This will certainly pave its way for more people to get attracted and interested with bitcoin, and it’s now the people’s initiative on how to lengthen their understanding with bitcoin through doing their own diligence in researching. However, while some crypto advocates will appreciate this, but I’m also sure that this will trigger those anti-bitcoin banks and governments, especially if you are living in a country where the government is banning the existence of bitcoin.",

Such initiatives are very important in promoting Bitcoin in areas where people aren't well aware of the technology. He's truly a Bitcoin lover and his love for crypto-currency can be seen in those t-shits.I really appreciate the efforts of the guy as such steps are important in promoting awareness about Bitcoin in a community. Even if Bitcoin is banned in the country but still he's selling the shirts with Bitcoin logo and designs on them. The day when Bitcoin becomes a legal tender in the country, people will admire the efforts of this person.Bitcoin should be promoted by everyone in those areas where people aren't aware about it. The innovation can bring so many opportunities to the people of those areas. Many of those people can be financially stable if they adopt Bitcoin. It's truly a valuable coin and anyone who promotes it is also very valuable. Thumbs up for the guy!",

True. I think this is very possible for those scammers to easily trace bitcoin hodlers since wearing bitcoin T-shirts only means that you are a believer and a long time investor in bitcoin, and that you be could owning already a lot of bitcoin profits. Though this idea is very good for public awareness, but it will also trigger the safety of those people who are actually making profits from bitcoin. That’s why most bitcoin earners are just hiding their identities so they can avoid crypto scammers.",

The idea of also teaching and educating the customers about what they are actually buying and not just the design is good. But on the other hand, we should also look at the fact that there might actually not be a need for that, because the country might also be against it since they have a legal ban on the currency within their jurisdiction. Seeing someone orally promote and educate people about something that's actually not supposed to be traded in the country might attract the authorities. On the other hand, people who buy clothes now don't just buy them because of the mere design; most people buy them because they actually understand what the design might actually mean.",
