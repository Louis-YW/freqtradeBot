However, there are several challenges that would need to be overcome to make this approach practical and effective. The biggest challenge in my opinion is that using RAM for storage could make it easier for attackers to create fake proofs of space, as RAM is more easily manipulated than hard drive storage. RAM is more volatile and can be more easily manipulated than hard drive storage, which could make it easier for attackers to create fake proofs of space or manipulate the consensus process in other ways.",

Proof of space is inferior to proof of work in that, in order to prevent grinding,it doesn't directly commit to the transactions in a block [1].It only commits to a miner private key.The miner then separately provides a signature to commit to the transactions.That means that a group of recent miners can collude to rewrite recent transaction history. A memory bound proof of work, like Cuckoo Cycle [2], seems like a better form of Proof of RAM...[1] https://docs.chia.net/consensus-foliage/[2] https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo",

Since they have datacenters filled with servers just sitting there waiting for there to be a need for them during periods of high use. They could just kick them on to mine your PoS RAM coin.There is no need to change the way things work now. You buy a miner and you mine. If you can't buy a miner you buy coins. If you change the algo from SHA256 to something else it's just a matter of timeÂ  until someone starts building purpose built miners and the people who can afford them get them and those that can't are back where they started. Possibly even worse off if they invested in something that is now obsolete.-Dave",

You need to balance 1) and 2) so that neither bottlenecks the other.Quote from: pwn8 on April 08, 2023, 07:38:31 PMram memory is much more accessible and \"equal\" than cpu and then asics.RAM by itself it useless without the accompanying computing cores to use it.That is, assuming you want to proof of work to actually commit to the contents of the block,so it has to be computed from scratch all the time.Quote from: pwn8 on April 08, 2023, 09:38:21 PMWe can use cuckoo cycle but instead of increasing the difficulty like in hashcash we increase the amount of memory required. Being asics resistant by design.That doesn't work too well, since increasing memory also increases the time per solution attempt, and you need to keep that time a tiny fraction of the block interval to keep mining behaving like a random lottery.",

It can make a big difference depending on the amount of RAM available. For instance, if you have a desktop computer with 8GB of RAM and I have a server with 4x32GB of RAM, are we on an equal footing? If I manage a server farm, the difference could be even bigger.

Have you even thought about the future of such a coin? What if someone starts complaining about RAM coin in a decade or so because the mining process is not decentralized enough?
