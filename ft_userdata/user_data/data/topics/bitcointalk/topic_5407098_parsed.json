If you also add possibility to \"re-buy\" and \"add-on\", the game is not so depressing. Could you tell from your experience, when you took part in one of bitcointalk tournaments, what % of players were - like you called it - \"fish or recreational players\"? I mean - are \"internal\" forum tournaments invaded by pros?",

Add to that the roulette effect when the blinds go up and people start going all in, which adds excitement to the game, and you have the perfect combination to attract an audience. Definitely I do think that why Poker is so popular in the terms of tournaments is the basic fact that it is a social activity which enhances not only interactions but at the same time the players are able to not only practice their skills but also their luck here as well. It is rare to participate in online gambling and see that you are pegged against a player, enhancing interactions with an age old game which have been in the social circle also with the announcements you can see the rewards attached and also some players are able to practice their skills if they were playing it on a particular platform then you must understand that, they are very familiar with the rules and regulations therefore for them it would be even easier.",

The twist of the game that's why it's more fun and the addition of trying to be better than the other guy with bluffs and unpredictability. While if you do tournaments in Dice, Roulette, and other short games, it's difficult to find what makes it more competitive when it's all luck-based games. I'd rather join a tournament predicting sports winners like a parlay than that because it requires analysis which for me is something I like to do.",

      "body": "I mean ask yourself, would you find a competition with Dice to be fun to watch? Where it's basically instant and even if you argue about using many rounds to determine the winner, it's still a boring process to watch. Poker on the other hand involves quite a lot of factors that enhance its own appeal, making it entertaining for both the players and the people who watch them play. The fact that the people are able to compete against each other and where winning and losing can happen regardless of how good one's hand is (e.g. bluffing) makes it really entertaining for most people. It's like watching a dark horse get the top in a competition, an unexpected but welcome surprise.",

There are other games aside from poker but I think the excitement and thrill were not there. So usually, a poker game will be the best choice because also you can increase your luck by picking a card.A gambling casino that offers player-to-player games will usually have this tournament like chess or other card games that can be used as a tournament.",
