  "content": "YOUR CUSTODY PARTNER FOR YOUR BITCOIN JOURNEYWe help people to better manage their own private keys.What's wrong ?Bitcoin is revolutionary. It is the first peer-to-peer computer and monetary system. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer money across the world without a trusted third party and without double spending. Bitcoin's great strength is its simplicity: holding a 12-word mnemonic code - or seed - allows you to access your Bitcoins anywhere, anytime. But it can also be a weakness. If you lose or have your seed stolen, you can say your bitcoins goodbye !Why do you need us ?Little by little, the Bitcoin network is improving and multi-signature wallets are developing. Thanks to this new technology, we thought of developing what we can name \"collaborative custody\". Instead of one seed, there is now the need to have 2 seeds to release funds. This greatly enhances the security of your funds, which is why we prefer this solution to a single signature portfolio. But imagine if you lost one of them: all your savings would be gone ! Couldn't you have given a backup seed to a third party beforehand in case this unfortunate event happened to you ? Then you are saved !And here we come...Together we create a 2-3 multi-signature wallet: you own 2 of the 3 seeds needed to access your bitcoins: so you have access to your bitcoins without us. On the other hand, we have a third seed on our side. This single seed does not give us access to your funds - only you still have exclusive access. If you lose one of the two seeds, we get in touch and you will have access to your bitcoins again thanks to the third seed we have.ADVANTAGES+ Improvement over a single signature wallet: increased security. + Free your mind in case you lose one of the two seeds: your bitcoins are still accessible. + We as a third party are just a bonus for you: you don't need us to carry out your transactions. + Get your bitcoins off the exchange with peace of mind.HOW WE WORKWe work exclusively in Offline/Cold Storage to avoid the risk of being hacked. ‍We do not use hardware wallets, which we believe increases complexity without increasing security.We keep a physical/paper copy of the third seed and all Master Public Keys, located in a safe place. We also keep a digital copy of these elements on our offline devices.PRICINGWe offer two pricing options.1) Monthly subscription: This payment method is preferred if you make many recurring transactions. 2) One-shot: We charge a one-shot fee for the joint setup of the multi-signature portfolio and the backup of the third seed. This payment method is preferable in case you keep your bitcoins for the long term and do not make transactions (#HODL).MORE INFORMATIONYou can visit our website ! https://collaborativecustody.webflow.ioCONTACTPlease contact us through DM or our website: https://collaborativecustody.webflow.io",

Nobody needs this service, I don't understand why you hope to monetize it?And without any legit background, what guarantee do we have about your professionalism and good faith?QuoteBitcoin is revolutionary. It is the first peer-to-peer computer and monetary system. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer money across the world without a trusted third party and without double spending.That's why I think we can do without you. I have read the whole topic, but I confess that for me the service is neither necessary, nor in accordance with my conception of BTC and the way I want to control my coins.",

Why take the risk of an unknown stranger storing my keys in a completely unknown manner, and the risk that you simply disappear or shut down the service?Why are your pricing options hidden? Why do you have a monthly option if someone is making \"recurring transactions\" - what difference does it make to you how many transactions someone makes? You should have absolutely no involvement in the process.If I contact you and say I am user X and I want you to give me user X's seed phrase, how are you going to confirm my identity?",

Entrusting the private key for protection and trust, that is not gonna happen with what is happening with establishments.It is a brilliant plan, but I can't compromise, you can't be trusted with such wallet info, escrew with trusted establishment is enough. The offer may work for sometimes, when trust is built, they do their trick and disappear.",

      "body": "Or you can give the 3rd mutlisig to a relative. Or put it in a bank vault. Or use a well known product like Blockstream Green. Or use something more secure like a hardware wallet with the recovery seed someplace safe.It's an answer in search of a question. The issue is the question does not exist, and similar questions already have better answers.Not saying it's totally bad, just not really needed.-Dave",
