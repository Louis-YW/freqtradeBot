      "body": "I used bianance to buy Luna when it was Luna initially and after purchasing it I sent the Luna to my trust wallet where it has been ever since and after Terra changed to Lunc it automatically changed from Luna to Lunc in my trust wallet. So going by that I would advice you to get a trust wallet and you can definitely store Lunc safely in there with no issues.",

I hear too many bad stories of people who forgot their password to the ledger , or it can possibly break..It's because even in the two popular hardware wallets they're not supporting it. But those stories that have forgotten their passwords? They probably didn't save their private keys or the seeds and that's why they've forgotten everything and lost their entire balance. This isn't about lunc but all about how savvy your are, keeping your assets in a hardware wallet is the safest way of keeping your cryptocurrencies but well, not applicable now for lunc but maybe in the future.",

Just like this, you are downloading the terra station https://docs.terra.money/docs/learn/terra-station/download/terra-station-desktop.html it's also available for mobile. Install it and then try to generate a new wallet and write your seed phrase into the paper to make sure if you are the only one who can access your wallet use your seedphrase. That's the only way for you to generate a paper wallet since terra station was also using similar method like metamask unlike mycrypto based on ethereum network that let you to download paper wallet that automatically generated once you created the new wallet.",

If you have trouble saving your seed phrase, it doesn't matter which wallet you use. The same ledger will allow you to securely store many coins, otherwise you will have to make a new wallet for each coin. Then you yourself will get confused in your seed phrases.",
