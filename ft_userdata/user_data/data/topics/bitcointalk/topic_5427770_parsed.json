This is necessary because the buyer and seller are anonymous so could otherwise scam each other.It works by each party putting up 100% of the item price. So when the buyer places an offer they actually pay 200%, and when the seller agrees to the sale they pay 100%, if the buyer is happy upon receipt they release the escrow and the seller gets 200% back and the buyer 100% back, if not they discus what went wrong in the sale. Escrow can be for less than 100% even 0% which is what one of the eBook sellers currently uses.The escrow also means you can do neat things like send an anonymous seller your coins and they will send you a bank transfer, bank notes or even bullion. All of these have been offered on the marketplace, and it means you don't need to trust the seller as they have skin in the game.",

Clicked on all your links and have been  going round in circles/ dead ends- gave up after 20 mins. Absolutely. It seems the listing has disappeared from the portal, not sure why..?Any way here is a step by step guide:1. Download Particl Desktopparticl.io2. Get some coins    - Particl's atomic DEX (Basic Swap), this is built on Particl's encrypted decentralised messaging system, so its arguably way safer than a centralised exchange. You can trade Monero, BTC. LTC, Dash, FRIO and a few others.    - Wizard Swap    - Bittrex    - ProBit    - HitBTC3. Make a bidMake sure Particl Desktop has downloaded the block chain, after that it will sync all the current encrypted messages associate with the block chain, some of these are the marketplace listings. You will see the marketplace listings appear in the marketplace under \"Market>Browse\", so if you don't see it just wait patiently and keep hitting refresh.You will also need to move some funds to your anon balance as this uses ring signatures and blinding to keep the buyer and seller anonymous. Go to \"Wallet>Send/Convert\" to make sure you have funds in both your anon and public balances.You can then place a bid. Click on the listing and selecting \"Add to Cart\". Then under \"Market>Cart\" complete the checkout process, don't forget to add the password “crypto_competition” in your address somewhere so I know you are from this forum.Once that's done I will accept you bid. I will message you on the marketplace's encrypted chat to confirm.Hope this helps, let me know how you get on and if you get stuck.",

Still confused- apologies  Yes, you need to own some PART tokens to participate, about 2.5 PART should do it, which at current prices is around $3. That will be refunded by me at the end if you win, you won't end up spending the tokens if you don't win.Just to reiterate, the escrow is there as a mechanism to ensure trustlessness. Both buyer and seller are anonymous, so this provides protection for both as an atiscam mechanism, its a necessary, but elegant design once you understand its purpose.",

Right now you can do this manually via Particl's DEX.They had this working a year back with a CEX plugin, but the CEX changed its API so support that was dropped, but it was a good proof of principle before migrating to the more reliable Particl DEX.",

Everything I was able to read up on regarding Particl does sound great... suprised there is really not much attention out there, can't even find many youtube videos on the topic.Oh and last quick question: Was there a pre-mine or ICO etc? Thanks!The competition ends on Friday. The slightly longer version of that answer is I've paid for the listing to last on the marketplace for 7 days and listed it on Friday. After that the listing message will not be propagated by the network nodes. I guess if there is a sudden surge in interest I could extend the completion a bit to allow for people to enter, I get that onboarding with a new crypto, epically one this different, can be a big undertaking, but its worth it in my opinion.I'm not affiliated with the project in any way, I just love selling online and crypto, this is the ultimate combination of both. If I could move my shop to the marketplace and get away from ebay that would be amazing. Ebay's centralised escrow is broken and even corrupt in my opinion as a centralised capitalists system favours the buyer over the seller. However the decentralised escrow is way more pure and I've had some lovely, genuine human experience with customers on it as it removes any scammers entirely, often we split the cost 50:50 when items go missing in the post etc.Your right; particl's marketing is pretty much non existent, but their technology is just incredible. They are the typical cutting edge programmers who build amazing software but then forget to tell anyone about it.Here is a video guide on how to buy stuff on the particl marketplace:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV_xp-r-g7sWhen you watch the video just think that all of this - the money, contracts, images and chat messages are on the blockchain or SMSG network linked to it. This is real decentralization and it runs really fast. And unlike dark net marketplaces particl cannot exit scam on you and take all your coins. That is just incredible, this is the blockchain based future that satoshi promised us.",
