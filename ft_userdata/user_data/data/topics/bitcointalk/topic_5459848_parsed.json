They rush to perform tasks or to connect wallet and claim their Airdrops without a basic research.Another target of these scammers is the community members of a project to scam rapidly. And it works too because many of the community members don't care about it but after being scammed they even don't know how that happened. So much awareness is needed specially for the Beginners.Anyway it would be better if you add these phishing sites to this thread POST ALL PHISING SITES HERE (2023)",

Years ago, it is only a marketcap website with links to projects' websites, social media, etc.They only upgraded their platform like a CoinMarketcap social community after Binance acquired it. I can not recall in my memory that since when they have a Coinmarketcap community and people who have registered accounts can comments directly on Cointmarketcap.Maybe 2 years ago but that article [Tutorial] How to use Coinmarketcap community? was published 11 months ago.Such comments are paradises for scammers to spread phishing links. I am unsure how Coinmarketcap filter phishing links in their community.",
