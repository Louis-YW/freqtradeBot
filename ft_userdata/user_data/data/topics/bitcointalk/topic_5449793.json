That's the picture of the bubble pending to crash.Unfortunately, good number of 9 to 5ers have not yet craved for a moment to think BTC. Even though we also have miners and traders that are ripping lots of gold in bitcoin. Don't be shocked we still have many aware, but zero technical know-how individuals in our populace.Thanks for pointing it out.",

Bitcoin investors dabble on a different playing field as those who invest on land and properties. If the success or failure of one or the other happens, you shouldn't rope it to \"that's because X is a better investment than Y\". That's basically causation without verifiable evidence. Plus I had friends in the past who both invest in land and bitcoin, is it indicative that they are losing trust on bitcoin? I don't think so. It's just the sensible way, you have to diversify your assets, dip your toes in different fields to ensure a higher chance of profit. Otherwise you're just asking to lose it all.",

Sometimes you buy properties that are very much overpriced, and in two to four years time, you would not even regain your capital, let alone to have a profit. There is natural disaster that can make people relocate from the area you bought your property and that is a drawback of real state events. In some cases, some properties can be sold twice and which will result in legal actions. But bitcoin cannot be sold twice to people which is also an advantage. Bitcoin has higher RIO than Real Estate. So, there is a level of risk in every type of investment and Real estate is not immune to such risks.",

Because no wonder real estate will increase your profit ratio (confirmed in your words) while there is risk in BTC because it's so volatile etc. etc. whatever you were saying, The thing is, if a person owns 25 acres of land in my region, bought for around 25 lac per acre and due to economic situation the price of land is increasing continuously, let's say you are making 10% or 25% profit on your land if you could sell them but who is going to buy them. Because the economic situation will make people's financial condition so weak that their money will lose its value and they cannot buy their land. If they cannot buy your land then how can you book profits of 10% or 25%? Like BTC, people can not buy a small portion of your land even. If you talk about renting it out then how many people are actually in need of new homes, these things really matter. Plus you will earn a passive income by renting your place out but that needs a hell lot of money. And you alone cannot buy lands without doing bad work or if they are inherited to you by your ancestors. But what if you have no inheritance (property) will you think the same? I don't think so, because you will have to work for decades, to collect enough money to buy the land first and then build houses or shops to rent them out. This is huge and risky work because what if the economy of your country goes down and you are left with priceless land? Plus BTC is a secure, fast, anonymous, and tension-free investment while you have to worry about cases that can create during buying of new land, as I have seen many scams during buying new land, and most of the time, those lands end up in sellers hands while sellers take all of your money too. But in BTC you just have to buy it, and do not worry about storing it, because there are many options to store your BTC, such as Cold wallets, you should know people who have 1,40,000 BTC (Micro Strategy). which is worth billions of dollar, so how do they make it able to protect them so far.
