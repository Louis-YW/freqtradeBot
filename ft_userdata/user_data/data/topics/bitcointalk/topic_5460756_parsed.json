  "content": "If in the world there are about 8 million people, each of whom will accumulate 2.625 Bitcoins in a cold wallet and never sell them, then the price of Bitcoin could skyrocket to infinity. These individuals, who have gone through natural selection and acquired 2.625 Bitcoins on the market, could unite, for example, in a religious Order, and gain the chance to change the world order. This trend is already emerging today. Pay attention to how more and more politicians and officials from different countries are being influenced by the idea of Bitcoin and becoming holders themselves.You must understand that all liquidations of your margin positions, all losses in the market on shitcoins – these are necessary dues to become a plebeian. Then you must work diligently to accumulate 2.625 Bitcoins on the market, whatever the cost may be. When an army of approximately 8 million plebeians is assembled, you will always begin to win. By uniting in an army or an Order and following a common strategy and purpose, the plebeians' education, work experience, skills, religion, personal qualities, etc., will no longer matter. Only in this way can you defeat the selected elite with higher IQ, better education, more work experience, superior connections, and more capital than you... And you have no other choice; either join the army of plebeians or you and all your future generations will be slaves... Even if you change your names and surnames to the right ones, you will never be admitted to Yale, MIT, Berkeley, or Stanford, believe me. Our army of approximately 8 million plebeians will be invincible. Because you can't kill what is already dead.",

While it is true that for any trade to occur, there needs to be a buyer and a seller, the absence of sellers alone does not necessarily mean there is no market or price for a particular asset.In a hypothetical scenario where no one is currently selling a specific asset, but there are willing buyers, the market still exists, and the price would be determined by the last transaction that took place. For example, you want to use your house for refinancing. How will the bank determine its price? After all, you haven't sold it.",

Well, first of all, I didn't say that the free supply of Bitcoin would be zero. Let's assume the free supply will be one Bitcoin.

However, your example with houses is not accurate - you can build as many houses as you want and wherever you want. A house depreciates and loses value over a distance of, say, 40 or 50 years or may require repairs.The only assets with limited supply today are land and Bitcoin. And both land and Bitcoin have their advantages. For example, if a military conflict starts on your land, you may lose it or, at the very least, won't be able to use it.Quote from: Synchronice on July 23, 2023, 09:02:07 AM But house is a different example, you absolutely need it in your life while bitcoin can easily be replaced with another clone altcoin or with a different one.With this statement, I also disagree. For example, let's consider the Internet network. Currently, all IPv4 addresses have their owners (~1 million (AS) owners over the World), and the cost of an IPv4 address exceeds $40, but people are not eager to adopt free IPv6 addresses. What do you think is the reason?Why your Internet address is IPv4? https://whatismyipaddress.com/",

Only few people would join this \"foundation\", so i expect repeat of Silver Thursday event.Bitcoin is not religion for sure. But... Money is a symbiosis of information and faith.To understand the nature of money, you need profound knowledge of mathematics (especially applied areas like \"Game Theory\") and equally deep knowledge of religious history. I won't burden the chat with mathematical formulas, so let's focus on the history of religions.Many researchers believe that the concept of monotheism is relative, and this idea is a result of the gradual development from genotheism (a state of religious consciousness where individual deities lack specificity and stability, and each can replace all others) to monolatry (a system of beliefs based on the faith in multiple gods with one leading god).Historically, it turned out that the most progressive religions on Earth are monotheistic - Christianity and Islam. This means a belief in one God (although He may be represented, for example, in three persons or more). One can defend a million useless PhD thesises explaining why it is so, but let's just accept this fact as an objective reality given to us through experience. My theory on this matter is that building temples for the entire pantheon of gods was much more costly than constructing uniform temples where everyone adheres to a unified ideology. This also provides a second advantage - monopoly on God (monotheism). It is easier for the state to govern monotheism than a group of scattered idiots believing in different deities, from Athena and Aphrodite to Zeus and beyond.If we draw an analogy between faith and money, it is quite reasonable that humanity will eventually move from \"polymonetarism\" (multiple local currencies of scattered states) to \"monomonetarism\" (a unified \"Ideal Money\" not controlled by any state), and in some sense, this transition is inevitable. The advantages are obvious, as, for example, the Roman Empire (where Christianity became the main religion) no longer exists, but Christianity still does. Today, any money holds value only as long as the issuing state exists, and this is a significant problem for humanity (for instance, if you were born in the USSR).Gold religion -> Fiat religion -> Bitcoin ...? \"Julius Caesar minted gold coins, at 1/40th of the Roman pound (about 8 g.).  The Roman monetary system was stabilized for three centuries, and inflation was eradicated.\"So we need Bitcoin foundation or religious Order.",

I know it's sci-fi but theoretically possible.Bitcoin is limited but that doesn't mean it is guaranteed to stay that way. What if we plan in near future to do a hard fork and increase the limit? So, it's not like 100% guaranteed that bitcoin will be 21m.Btw if military conflict starts, you may lose your computer or hardware wallet too.
