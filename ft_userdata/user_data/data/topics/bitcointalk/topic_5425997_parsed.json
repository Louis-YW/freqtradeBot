Thinking about Bollinger bands.So what do you think?Tradingview has this kind of feature if you click the alarm clock icon but only limited to the indicator that you are using on your chart. You can only use 3 indicator for non pro member so it means you have only limited choices for an alert. I like your idea because we can use multiple indicator at the same time without getting a subscription on tradingview. I’m still not opening due to my current device but BB and EMA lines is what commonly use of traders for their signal. This is a good addition to your app. How many indicator can you input on your ap that can work at the same time to give a signal?",

Main point of this app was to check RSI for multiple coins for example under 30 because I could not find app for that but if I have that on TradingView I would not create this one Well I can create as many as possible indicators for example alert with 30 indicators but for now because it's in the beta phase I limited to the 3(3 alerts 3 indicators) But on the end it will be unlimited.",

You can’t see all the indicators on the alert except if it’s being use by you. Yes hitting the EMA line sufficient but if you can do an alert when EMA lines cross to each other then it will be better. Use only popular indicator for your indicator like Bollinger, MACD, RSI and EMA to make it simple. Btw does the app will be available soon on for IOS or are you just prioritizing android for this app development? Kudos on your hard work. I will give a feedback once I use it this weekends after I get my fund for trading. This is the best for swing trades!",

Bollinger band can help along with other indicators, you should always consider other indicators.",

I didn't see the detail on the right page about the premium plan. Quite expensive if you don't trade regularly for $6 a month imo, but there is a discount right now so you can buy it for around $4. Yeah, it definitely has a good UI, you can use it as your inspiration.I search further and found another website that can be your inspiration/competitor, it needs registration but it is free according to their faq (https://altfins.com/alerts/notifications). Looks like it supports RSI too. It has an IOS app, however, based on the feedback from the users it is terrible. It needs some rework so you have to use the website if you don't want any problems.",

Trading offers limited use of indicator up to 3 for those free member. The indicator is not the main subject on this app but rather the alert notification feature that is vital for momentum trading. The idea of OP is to collect all the useful indicators and allow user to set alert notification on all of this indicator at the same time which trading view and other app doesn’t support since most of them only focus on price alert not on the indicator signal itself.The safety of the app is one of my concern which is why I still don’t download and use the app. Does playstore doesn’t review the app before they list? Is it possible for an app in playstore still contain malware to hack phone?",

Is it possible for an app in playstore still contain malware to hack phone?Yes, I get that but you can see permissions that my app is asking there is nothing suspicious there. Also yes playstore is reviewing the app before the release and every update.Anyway, I start working on an EMA so I was thinking to create it like this:user should define multiple EMAs for example 50, 100, 200...(user should set 2 or 3 EMAs), and if they are near each other let's say 0.5% of the price(if the price is 20.000 then the difference between each EMA needs to be under 100) then I will notify the user.What do you think about this?Also, I was thinking to add a Bullish Divergence signal after the EMA that could be useful.",

You can only try to adjust the parameters and understand it to yourself the way you have adjusted it but you still have to understand that the shorter time frame gives a view of what is to happen at that time and longer time frame is the expectation based on that time. I use it for a longer term like 4hours, 1 day, week and month.",
