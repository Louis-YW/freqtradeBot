No BTC and ETH just these two or other PoW alts.It shows that no one really cares about those coins,maybe in the future they will increase in value and if that is your opinion you can change your mining equipment to mine them.Personally I am very happy mining Ethereum and it is still profitable even with 0.09 dollars cost per kilowatt here where I am,not much but still profitable and I get always paid in Bitcoin,if the price of Bitcoin goes up I will be happy,now is the time to collect.",

Difficulty (which is tied to revenue) fluctuates by +/- 20% in a 24 hour timespan for most of them. I have made noticeably more profit on my Tesla P100 rig by using profit-switching on a group of 3 coins, such as ERG+FLUX+ETC. It switches coins every 3 hours on average, so the downtime from transitioning is just 1%. The gains more than compensate for that 1% loss. I use it for 'difficulty switching' because I want to HODL the coins.Hell, I can already get much more profit than ETH on certain models like Turing or Pascal simply by sticking to FLUX or YEC.The one-trick-pony video cards which have been ETH-only, especially the RTX 3090 or RX 5700, have dropped in price like a rock over the past 6 months or superseded by the RTX 3080 Ti, 3080 12GB and 3090 Ti. They have been the WORST models to own.Quote from: ZeeeN on June 26, 2022, 01:11:35 AMif you want that 2 coins i think best way is mine ETH and sell it or swap to buy coins you likeThe best way is to always mine the most profitable coin and trade it for the ones you want to HODLQuote from: swogerino on June 25, 2022, 08:12:52 PMIt shows that no one really cares about those coinsI remember when Ethereum was the coin 'nobody cared about' because the community either focused on ASICs or DASH/Vert/XMR. Big mistake! Nobody can predict which one will become the biggest, so I don't see what is wrong with owning a basket of different small coins.This short term 'fiat profit ROI' mindset is why most miners never get rich while investors or developers become millionaires. That's why we miners have been losing our voice in the crypto ecosystem.",

You wouldn't believe how it was all the same mentality from PoW miners to those NTFs holders. That they could always sell their thing to the next idiot with a higher price since 'the line just goes up, okay?' or 'there are never ending of idiots'. Hey, if they want to put their money or hash power waste to any random PoW shitcoins, that they think if higher network hash means higher price then let them be.",

Most don't even sell it for BTC. If anything, investors who just buy the coin are the 'greater fools' because at least the value of GPU mining equipment can't go to zero.There were plenty of folks calling ETH a 'shitcoin' in 2015/2016 because it was 'most likely to fail' like the other altcoins at the time. The same 'greater fool theory' can be applied to BTC or ETH; many people argue that BTC or ETH are not actually used for any real business purpose. Most of my portfolio is BTC and I do not invest more than 10% in any altcoin.Quote from: OgNasty on June 26, 2022, 07:19:51 PMthey think if higher network hash means higher price then let them be.I do not believe that myth at all. I care most about the technology behind the coin and how much cheaper it is to mine vs. to buy that coin.Quote from: kensaii on June 26, 2022, 08:44:24 PMHey, if they want to put their money or hash power waste to any random PoW shitcoinsI always mine the most profitable coin for the hardware then trade it for the coins I want to invest in. ERG/FLUX/YEC/EPIC are currently the best ones for my older rigs.",
