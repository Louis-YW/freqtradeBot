Bitcoin.org would never do something like this. They're also not a service and don't ask for people's phone numbers.But let me guess? you have never placed a single cent to the trading platform they're talking about? If you're still confused, you can always cross check with bitcoin.org if the claim is true because if it is, you would've seen it on the front page. Upon checking, there's nothing ofc.",

Because of this, and since many, if not all, of these Bitcoin giveaways are scam, you fell victim to a number of them. I also suspect that you readily give away personal details to these scammers with the hope that you will receive free coins. I suggest that you stop hunting for free coins. Stop signing up for giveaways. Stop chasing all kinds of promos; they're mostly fake, baits, fraudulent schemes. You need to stop this madness. I hope I'm wrong!",

Later, if the offer is related to money and worse you have to go first by sending your money, your bitcoins, it is surely a scam attack.QuoteWhat is Bitcoin.org and what is its purpose?Bitcoin.org is an organization [dot] org. It's not a business company.Use what is correct but use Who is is not good.Domain name updateQuote from: theymos on April 17, 2020, 07:13:47 PMSatoshi created both bitcoin.org and this forum, which was originally at bitcoin.org/smf. Later, the forum got its own domain name, but due to this history, bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org have traditionally been linked, and for quite some time Cøbra and I have together managed the domain names. However, Cøbra has never had much involvement in bitcointalk.org's operation, and I haven't involved myself in bitcoin.org for a couple of years, so the linkage between the two no longer really made made any sense. Therefore, we decided to separate the domains: I no longer have any access to the bitcoin.org domain name, and Cøbra no longer has any access to the bitcointalk.org domain name. The two sites should be viewed as totally separate, which in practice they have been for years.There will be no changes whatsoever on bitcointalk.org due to this, and I'd assume that the same will be true of bitcoin.org. The bitcoin.org open-source project has been advancing steadily, and I hope and expect that it will continue to do so thanks to the efforts of its contributors.Thanks to Cøbra for handling much of bitcointalk.org's domain-name-related work in the past.Since April 17, 2020, 07:13:47 PM, the Bitcointalk.org forum is no longer related to both Cøbra and bitcoin.org.",
