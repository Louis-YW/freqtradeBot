I would rather buy and old pc instead of wasting the money on that NFT thing. That's just waste of money, it's far better to donate that money to the deserving ones rather than investing it on a Jpeg file of crazy monkeys which are basically vector arts, and snaky punks which are basic pixel arts.Back to your question! Everyone wants a scam free marketplace but unfortunately that won't be possible to create. Because these days the scammers are so intelligent that they will find a way to tackle the scam-protection mechanism of the marketplace. The scammers these days are technical nerds and they are also into black-hat hacking thing that's why it's literally not possible to create such marketplaces.Can you please tell us that what scam-free protections are you planning to add into your market? Would you handle everything by yourself? It is in fact possible to handle the market transactions by a single person in beginning stages but with growth of users it wont be possible for a single person to handle the whole marketplace. Lets suppose you add few more members in your team and one of them might be a scammer then what will you do? How will you bring back the agenda of scam-free marketplace if even a single scam takes place in your marketplace?",

There would likely be a lot of interest in such a platform, as it would provide a safer environment for buyers and sellers. However, building and maintaining such a platform would be a significant undertaking, and it would require a lot of effort to gain trust and attract users. If you are willing to invest the time and resources required to create a reputable and secure marketplace, it could be a valuable contribution to the NFT ecosystem.",

      "body": "Well i guess you are all right, and wrong My idea is very very much simpler, it is so simple, that i honestly can almost not believe that it would actually work like the way i think it would. But at least i have to try it out else we will never know.I see that things with scammers are getting very complicated the more we use technologie in order to protect us against them. So i was trying to think the exactly other way.Most scammers have (not all but most of them) to get in touch with you somehow. If they cant get in touch with you they cannot scam you. So i think we dont have to protect ourself from scammers being there we just have to make sure, that they wont be able to contact you anymore. So i wont code a thing. I dont even know how to code something, im not a DAO and there is no big technerd team, becouse thats where i see the weakness. The more technology we use, there more we get scammed...So i wont do anything new, i will take whats already there in order to just do a single thing: Silence them. preventing them from contacting anyone. If they cannot get in touch with you over my marketplace no matter where ore what it is, they will leave all by themselves...at least thats the approach i will follow maybe i can present something for a first rudimental tryout in the next 2-3 weeks, but the whole things needs to be included into my main project which is my NFT collection. perfectly for doing first experiments",

Not everybody would be allowed to list NFTs on the site, always check routinely on the marketplace vendors, if anyone doesn't keep up with rules, ban them. Nothing takes off scammers like excellent moderators. When the site moderators are very strict and takes away any suspicious submission, scammers would leave the site. It's better to have a quality marketplace than a garbage one; with enormous traffic but serves scam to visitors. Most marketplaces allow such activities because of the traffic spammers and scammers add to the website. Currently they're millions of spammers and scammers online that work round clock coupled with bots, so the industry has been growing long ago. Terminating them on your site or marketplace is a great move, but the traffic would reduce too.",

That's exactly what I was thinking. The ordinals have harmed the Bitcoin network very adversely and we all are emotionally affected by the harm that those useless tokens have done to our blockchain. It will take sometime to forgo the fear that those useless tokens have created in minds of many Bitcoin enthusiasts. And, if you check the idea of the OP, it doesn't makes sense to me. After reading his replies I found that the OP is not good at doing technical things currently and has no sense of development to create such market. Even, I observed that his ideas are also not that good because it's literally impossible to create market that doesn't have any way of communication. If that could stop the scammers just by silencing them then man every platform would do that.",
