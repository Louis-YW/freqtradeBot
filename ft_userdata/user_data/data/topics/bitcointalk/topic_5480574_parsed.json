And another amazing thing is sending a million with a $12 fee but it could have been lesser if the fees are quite lower. Just as what satoshi has said, thanks to the donation to the community as this is making each of our Bitcoins or satoshis more valuable. Let's see later if someone is going to claim that s/he has mistakenly sent it there or just trying to flex how much BTC they got.",

We can all see that it was from a multi-signature wallet, which means they have to confirm before sigining in the transaction. There is a very slim chance for such a big transaction to be an error. The question here should be, Why did they do it? Well, whoever has the money can decide to waste it, but sending such an amount to an address where it can't be spent is really questionable, and the exchange that executes such transactions should be aware of who is behind it; they definitely have more for them to spend.",

      "body": "This could possibly have some connection to my involuntary hobby-horse.Recent leaked emails[1] show that Calvin Ayre-- the billionaire rube that has been funding Craig Wright's litigation-- believes that Wright actually controls early addresses in the blockchain, consistent with Wright's initial claims but contradicting Wright's more recent claims in court (that he \"stomped the hard drives\").  Calvin believes Wright can only win the lawsuit against Bitcoin devs by using these early keys and has been pressuring Wright to do so. I'd agree that at this point it would be his only path to even have a chance of winning, and even that would be far from certian given the extraordinary level of obvious forgeries.On December 20th the UK courts increased the security Wright owes the Bitcoin devs for trial from £100k to £900k. The remaining amount not already paid was due today. (We won't know for a few days if the payment to the court cleared).  At the time of the transfer 26.91679286 was worth about £920k.Up thread it's noted that the source of the funds has heavy BRC-20 activity and I've been told that Ayre has been significantly funding BRC-20 activity.I wouldn't expect Wright to make the payment out of funds newly received from Ayre, but rather to make them out of float used to pay his legal representation going forward, and then get a top-up payment from Ayre.  Wouldn't it be funny if Ayre paid Satoshi's address as part of an effort to force Wright to use it?  It would be clever on his part:  If he believes Wright will lose unless he uses the address then funding him via an address he can't use won't make things worse and it might save Ayre money if Wright's inability to pay terminates the case early. It would be a genuinely good idea, given Ayre's beliefs. (a better idea would be to wake up and stop being ripped off, but that would have happened long ago if it were going to happen)Another related explanation is that someone may have set this address as their primary address on a service, either as a joke or because they were LARPing as Satoshi-- and then they either accidentally withdrew to it or got kicked off the platform and automatically had their funds sent there.  Who do we know LARPs as Satoshi and may have needed to access another 26.9-ish Bitcoin today??  History may not repeat but it does rhyme. During the large ATO investigation into Wright, Wright sent some amount of bitcoin equal to his tax-ID *to* some high value address he was (falsely) claiming to own-- so he could then point to his tax ID on the blockexplorer page as evidence that he owned the address.  The tax office didn't fall for it, but I could easily see some people falling for it. 26.9 BTC is a lot of money but relative to the amount Wright is spending on litigation it's not *that* substantial, it wouldn't be impossible for that manic to think he could get some benefit in court by throwing coins away at Satoshi's address.All in all it's probably more likely that someone had the genesis address in their clipboard for some reason,  but I wouldn't find any of the above too shocking and they are fun to consider.[1] Email page 1; Email page 2",
