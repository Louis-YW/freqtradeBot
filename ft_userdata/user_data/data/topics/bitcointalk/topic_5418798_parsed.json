I bet you will come back you just won a huge amount, what will be your motivation or anything that stops you from thinking that you can still win that amount, the temptation is high that you will go back to the table as you run out of money or you there is a match that you think you can easily win.You could just post that you won a big amount and this is my proof and we will be amazed, why post that you're quitting what's behind this post.",

I just hope that you can actually do it, I am saying this because I've known people who say that they'll quit or at least take a break for several months but would eventually go back to gambling after a month or so, sometimes not even weeks have passed.",

I guess that's our first instinct as a gambler because we tend to believed that we are still going to win and we want to have that kind of experience again. The high that gambling brought to us specially if we are winning. Not to burst the bubble, but I have a feeling that you might continue to bet if you see some fight that you think you will profit huge again, just saying.",

Very few people hard to decide to do the same action since other people might do bet more if they win such huge amount the same what you earn.  Anyways hopefully you will not break your set timeline because for sure there are to many big events which can tempt you to bet again.",

This is the primary thing that you would really be having on mindon which you would really be that thinking on playing even more to bag more profits.You wouldnt be able to see people who do just simply say that they had quit up after a win.Most of the time people would be quitting gambling when they dont already have money on their pockets.",
