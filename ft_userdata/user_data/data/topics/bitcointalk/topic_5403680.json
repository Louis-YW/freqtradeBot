  "content": "Bitcoin has a vulnerability against bruteforce, same ethereum and 99.9% actual cryptos, even a home banking system has more chances to survive to an attack like that, except banks that allows their users to frozen their account and set more methods of authentication to the home banking and servers are designed to ban ips and log ins after many failed attempts, but credit and debit cards are vulnerables to those attacks as bitcoin and ethereum and 99.9% of the crypto users.im not a financial advisor, im just here to tell you all what comes.is your duty do your own research about what im talking about.1. make an encrypted iso tool to store in the hardisk the wallet.dat, protect that wallet file from being captured by an attacker to decrypt it as local, there are two options for this, build a program for windows and unix or just manage yourself with more than one device and use crypto as a bank system with a main bank and secndary wallets2. there is a crypto that is solving all the problems that bitcoin and ethereum has, and his method of invulnerability against brute force is better than sha256 and sha512, i wont say what or which coins are, do your own research3. bitcoin for now is safe, in 2022, for now is safe, but not in the future.4. world is going to change, do your own research, is not anymore january 2009“If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.”— Satoshi Nakamoto“If SHA-512 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.”— Japanoshihttps://quantum-computing.ibm.com/",

      "body": "You have included a link to quantum computing in your post. AFAIK, sha256 is quantum hard. Only Grover's algorithm can give an advantage, and it still requires millions of qubits.Anyhow, it won't happen in a day. There's no way. It will take decades and bitcoin will adapt to all the major changes.  Bitcoins will fork into a better hash function.With quantum, you should be more worried about the elliptic curve and we already got Deterministic wallets as one of the safeguards.You are worrying too early my man",

      "body": "you talk about brute forcing the blockchain where a situation may come up to milestone the network and change the mining algo.. bitcoins decentralised nature of the blockdata is not where someone can ever just delete a transaction out of a block where the change of the hashes are not spotted and rejected.not unless they were able to simultaneously change every full node users software to miscalculate the hash maths that is based on the data..the only option is to brute force a block. by this it means go back to earlier blocks form a new version of that old block collated without the transaction.. create a hash that meets the decentralised nodes software math of validating the data to the hash. and do it all fast enough to catch up and overtake the current blockheight of all the other good miners.. to then re-org the blockchain to the narfarious users version where a transaction previously deemed as spent is seen as unspent..but that requires alot of time and expense..here is the thing. in 2013 .. ASICS came in that were able to brute force create a competitive difficulty hash hundreds of times faster then a desktop PC of 2013some altcoiners seen it as a security risk to their altcoin because 1 asic could completely 100% overtake their hashrate and control their networks flow of blocks.. altcoins decided they would instead change their algo to avoid sha256 as their \"fix\" to their fear of ASICsdid we bitcoiners care, no..why.because we just bought those very same ASICS altcoiners feared and made them part of the strength that builds a stronger hash of good morally following blocks... no algo change. we just used the efficiency to make a more difficult prefix to find. and strengthen our network furtherif someone can make a sha256 hash faster then current asics.. people will buy them asics and use them to morally hash good blocks with a more efficient and stronger hash. no algo changes. just a higher difficulty hash...at the moment. there are 1.5milllion asics protecting and creating strong hashes for bitcoin blocks. each of which are milions of times faster then a PC. so the network hashrate is trillions of times stronger then a single PC(spu mining) of 2009 hashrate era.if someone found a method to bruteforce and create competing blocks:50x faster.. they would still need 30,000 systems/devices running200x faster.. they would still need 1,500 systems/devices running1000x faster.. they would still need 300 systems/device running.. not cheap for a single person to buy to hope to overtake the network.. especially if the reward for being nefarious wont cover the costs quick.. in this situation the people owning the 1.5m asics(morally good miners). would just buy 500,000 bruteforcers and use them to build stronger good blocks(much as the case of the gpu->asic transition)as for the wallet and the elliptic curve security of private/public keypairs..yes secure your wallet.dat file..but here is the thing its been sat for a decade now that the very old p2pk addresses are vulnerable. yet 12 years on no one has managed to brute force satoshi's 2009 stash which are stored on p2pk addresses. but if p2pkh or p2wpkh was to become vulnerable. a new tx format can be slipped in and people move their funds across.again a weakness of elliptic curve does not mean anyone can steal any funds from all keys in one go in a few seconds.they would need to choose wisely which address to target and spend time breaking it. one by one.a simple solution to not be a easy first target before the news gets out.. dont have huge sums of value in a single key.. then if we do need to transition to key tx formats.. with new keypair signing methodology. it becomes easier to do. by not making yourself the first target a nefarious person attacks first before a new format is introduced.",

Again, do your own research before you start panicking about sha 256 not being enough to protect your investment.People keep talking about quantum computers but there's actually no proof of their ability to break existing banking encryption. What's there to stop these scientists from breaking into the federal reserve just to show they can? I think we'll hear about real uses of quantum computing long before someone teaches these computers how to break bitcoin's encryption.",

Again, do your own research before you start panicking about sha 256 not being enough to protect your investment.quantum can be heavily more efficient at solving puzzles than binary. (especially puzzles not designed to be understood by binary systems)but here is the thing. the solution the quantum system comes up with has to follow the binary rules for a binary system to accept the answer.which limits the scope of what quantum could do....here is a very simplistic exampleimagine binary is a route planner that only knows 2 directions  forward and rightquantum can go forward back left and right. so in binary knowing a starting point(D3) and having a route of forward right, forward, right, forward, right. gets to the destination. (C3)F         E        >> D       ^ vC       < vB  A  1 2 3 4which can be checked. if you know the destination(C3) and were given the route you can play it backwards to find the start point(D3)..however if quantum wanted to get from C3 to D3 by going eitherback 1orleft left lefta binary system would reject that route.. afterall \"what is 'left' \"  a binary system would say. . \"i do not understand \"left\" command\"yes quantum could spend time making lots of route options involving only forward and right options. and find many paths.. but that is limiting quantum to the binary puzzle rules. and so its efficiency in finding a faster route or finding a route faster than a binary system brute forcing routes is limited",

(as proven)bitcoins economics are magic. they work. bitcoin sits happily in its value window and the prices bounce up and down within that window of value perfectly. other coins trying to play the opposite, which just doesnt play well and doesnt work out well.... you will soon learn this when ethereum 'detonates' to PoS where the cost to mine a block(2eth) drops from over $2k down to just a few dollars)where by, having the less security of PoS due to most exchanging holding most of the stake. causes those exchanges to be the central controllers of ethereum transaction block collating and confirmingwatch for the eth price to tank when it flips to Pos",

I believe that the best case right now we have against this is quantum could be figured out, and could be used to protect it instead of attacking as well.This is a very difficult thing in the world of computing, reaching that quantum level will be quite hard, but the reality is that when it's first reached, and something has that kind of power, then I wouldn't really be shocked about it at all, it would be quite good and I would agree that it is going to be a risk for all of us, hope that it doesn't do anything, but we can't all quit just because of that potential.",
