I have experienced this more than once, and each time I switch over to a stronger network, it works perfectly.Edit: I just switch over my P2P currency option to your local currency as seen in your screenshot to confirm if the error is from your Pair or not. But it’s not this is the sell order from my own view.",

Anyway, if you install the App and it works, I think that there is no problem with your coins but with the visualisation, so stay calm Edit: I've just read that it didn't work. As I said, don't worry, you'll solve it.",

I have checked mine and it is working good. If not network, probably it might be your phone or your phone operating system. If you are using lower operating system or lower old small phone and your phone can not be upgraded to one of the lastest OS, buy a better device.",

Sometimes this happens on some devices but not on others. Currently, I rarely encounter problems like that. But I have experienced it and it was a long time ago. Another problem is that a more stable network connection speed is needed. Because if the network connection is unstable, sometimes errors occur and some things are not displayed.Or you can close the application first and clean the cache and then reopen the Binance application. But more often cases like this are due to network connection problems.",

One could have said it’s probably update issue but that’s not how it works. The only thing that’s came to my mind is maybe you were logged out and when in you just went to the P2P section straight up and that will not show other currency. But that also doesn’t seem as a genuine reason to me. But for the time been you can actually try other decentralized platforms and take your money off Binance. Visit either AgroDesk or Bisq",

Try and re-login with your details and try again because there is no general issue related to this, although they do have network issues sometimes. I was logged out of my Binance app too; I just logged back in, updated my Binance app, and everything was working perfectly as usual. Maybe you will consider updating your application, or maybe they have restricted you from using their service.",

Sometimes even when exchange detect your IP address, that does not mean that they will be the one to choose what currency you will have to use and make transactions. After one has completed KYC on a centralized exchange, it is very important to choose currency which you will be using to make transactions because there are some people that are expatriate in another regions and because they submitted there documents for KYC, that does not mean that it is the currency of the country they come from is the one that they'll want to use for transactions.

This is why we ought to choose currency by ourselves for transaction purposes. I know that. It's customization for your account and I agree with you that to save time, a user should customize some settings for an account. It can be done on exchanges don't require KYC too but it has become less popular because more exchanges do require KYC with time.They can not find against their governments and if governments have a condition like KYC, AML to continue a business, the exchange team have to trigger KYC requirement on their users.No-KYC Exchange Encyclopedia. Because they are centralized exchanges, their policies and terms of service can change anytime so I am always ready to do KYC if I use an account on a centralized platform.",

I mean, you did not mentioned that, if that's the first time, then they must have asked to you comply/agree with some agreement and might ask you to see some tutorial but obviously tutorial are optional. I can understand, you are not getting some useful answers. But we all are guessing the possible solutions. Are you from Pakistan, as I can see the PKR term in the top right corner. Just asking. Sometime, these are the issues of app and by clear the cache might solve it, but I doubt, you already have did that too. If still not find any listings, then try to change the currency, from USDT to BTC or try to change the mode from selling to buying then if you still face this issue then you should contact the support for help. I guess they can help you better. We can but we don't have the full information of your case.
