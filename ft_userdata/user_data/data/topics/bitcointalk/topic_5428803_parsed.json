  "content": "Bitcoin experienced another accomplishment when the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele declared his country was going to accept Bitcoin as a legal tender and went on to grooming his country, going as far as purchasing a whooping sum of $425m worth of BTC. His aim? To ensure he builds a Bitcoin City worthy of attracting investors. In all honesty, all these look noble and point to a man invested in the growth and development of his country using the help of Bitcoin. Then where did he get it wrong??  According to a report gathered, it seems the adoption is failing drastically as merchants over there prefer to accept payment for service using the country's fiat rather than BTC as they believe it's too complicated, while Soyapango, one of the slum dumps of El Salvador, is not benefitting from the experiment Nayib is working on, as it has been described to be one the areas infested with crime. Although the country cannot be called poor, just an economically backward country. I think a new strategy needs to be employed by Nayib to carry everyone along since this one seems to be failing woefully. What are your thoughts?  link",

      "body": "The article you shared (I didn't read through it) is one of many very biased articles about bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. Basically they all expect a large percentage of adoption in this poor country and anything below that is called a failure. The reality is that the adoption in El Salvador is growing like anywhere else in the world, it is slow. But after recognition as a legal tender the speed picked up. We don't see mass adoption and we shouldn't expect it either specially during this time where the economy is bad and bitcoin price has fallen.Quote from: Majestic-milf on December 15, 2022, 05:37:53 AMas merchants over there prefer to accept payment for service using the country's fiat El Salvador does not have its own fiat. They use US dollar!",

Fiat has been in use for generations, BTC as an alternative currency is just barely a decade plus let alone El-Salvador BTC adoption that is very recent.It is normal for people to find the use of BTC for payment a bit complicated since they are used to using fiat all their lives,  it is not enough to start looking for newer procedures because if they can't get used to paying with btc what other ways can they get used to?",

Although the country cannot be called poor, just an economically backward country. At a time like this where the price of BTC is quite volatile, of course individuals/merchants will think of using Bitcoin as their payment, because at any time the value of the assets they hold will change and this will certainly be detrimental for them. And because of that most of them still use USD because the value of this currency is quite stable compared to BTC.The solution that should be provided by the government for better BTC adoption is the guarantee of a fast payment and exchange system at lower fees and an application with a more user-friendly interface for users. So when merchants/individuals receive BTC, they will automatically be given the option to exchange to stablecoins or hold their BTC in their wallet. But of course this will require further development and special attention from the government of El Salvador.",

      "body": "The article covers security and economic problems; in case you didn't know El Salvador is known to be dangerous country, with a history in crime, armed robbery and other vices; they are also economically retarded, so those have been some of their problems even before they ever thought of making BTC a legal tender. Did anyone expect BTC adoption to come and solve these problems in El Salvador, it is the work of their central authority, BTC is just a decentralized currency.Nayib Bukele approved BTC being a legal tender in his country only a year ago, and made some investments in the currency too, all of these is just around a year old or so, it is still recent and unfair to pass an appraisal now, and even if an assessment is to be passed, it should be done correctly and in the right areas, not about the security situation in their country. By the way their BTC investment is a long term one, so the benefits can't be seen now, and BTC adoption is surely going to grow in El Salvador, but it is foolish to divert most of the country's problem from their central authority and direct it towards BTC that's just a currency.",

Although blockchain can be taught, cryptocurrency is just different from typical fiat currency  Volatility makes it complex for normal individuals especially those who are non-investors. They'd more likely be at risk from engaging into this industry ; risk of losing money.Hsaring the idea of this technology is good but forcing it to the majority will just cause more problems instead of pushing general adaptation of this industry. Much better to allow people do what they wanna do. If they are really interested with cryptocurrency, support them. People of this generation especially the past, are not yet ready of a currency which is too volatile to handle.",

ATMs that don't work, shops who need you to scan a QR code and nothing else when you were expecting to just have a BTC address ready.Adoption is people using it, often, a lot, other than for trading.
