For the sake of the casino being a reliable source, people would be interested irrespective of the figures and amount involved.Naturally one would ask some questions as to the real reasons why people wager such amount of money on casinos. Does it mean they are directly or indirectly turning casinos to their safe as I know casinos are not financial institutions where such could take place but come to talk of it, such an amount can be wagered on such basis unknown to the casino.

Any form of bonus that serves cashback is good for gambler to slightly recover losses or take it as profit when he is on green side.Obviously this promotion is only for whales and smart whales always consider any amount of money as profit since they will gamble with or without this bonus.",

OP should give us the link to this promo let us verify and see if it is genuine because I have not seen anything of such coming from stake.  No announcement of such from their official handle yet and their announcement thread has no such update. If there is such then OP should be able to furnish us with such information for us to see for ourselves.This made me check on OP profile and OP has been here for  quite a long time with no activity but all of a sudden appears with a $1,000,000 wager promo code of $1k drp for members on stake platform to use if they had wagered such an amount to use. Who knows what this might be. I am open to corrections.",
