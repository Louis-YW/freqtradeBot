Nodes makes up the network and when one node is down it doesn't affect the network. Like in corel draw nodes are connected to other nodes to shape an image, without nodes the network cannot exist, though its impossible to have no single active node. QuoteWhat is it function in the Bitcoin network?As the governing structure of the blockchain network, nodes have numerous functions to perform, primarily nodes keeps the network running by validating transactions, and securing the network.QuoteHow can a novice get the best knowledge to successfully run a node?This Ricardo Reis guide on running a bitcoin full node on android can easily walk you through on how to run a full node as a newbie. However, it's not advisable to run a full node on Android, but its recommendable for a test. https://youtu.be/IrM8K3XUYwoQuoteWhat are the benefits of running a Bitcoin nodes on you personal PC?Running a full node on your personal PC has lots of economic importance and one scary benefit is that it can kill your computer if it has low memory space. So, it's economical to run a full node on Raspberry Pi than a PC. QuoteHow long does your computer need to remain active for a successful node operation?The computer is expected to run every 24 hours.",

      "body": "A Bitcoin node is a computer that runs the Bitcoin software and helps to maintain the decentralized network of Bitcoin. It does this by validating and relaying transactions, as well as helping to enforce the rules of the Bitcoin protocol.One of the main functions of a Bitcoin node is to validate transactions and blocks. When a node receives a new transaction, it checks to make sure that the transaction is valid and follows all of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. If the transaction is valid, the node will then forward it on to other nodes in the network. Similarly, when a new block is mined, the node will check to make sure that it follows all of the rules of the Bitcoin protocol, and if it does, it will add the block to its copy of the blockchain and forward it on to other nodes.To get the best knowledge to successfully run a Bitcoin node, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the technical details of the Bitcoin protocol, as well as the various software tools and resources available for running a node. This may involve reading technical documentation, participating in online forums or discussion groups, and perhaps even joining a Bitcoin development community.There are several benefits to running a Bitcoin node on your personal computer. For one, it helps to strengthen the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network by providing additional resources for validating and relaying transactions. Additionally, running a node can give you a greater understanding of how the Bitcoin network works and how it is secured, which can be useful for anyone interested in the technology.As far as how long your computer needs to remain active for a successful node operation, it depends on the specific hardware and software you are using, as well as the level of activity on the Bitcoin network. In general, it is recommended to keep your node running as much as possible, as this helps to ensure that it is able to process and validate transactions in a timely manner. However, it is not necessary to keep your computer running constantly, and you can still run a node effectively even if your computer is turned off for short periods of time.",

You should also study technically about bitcoin and how it runs the full nodes, I suggest a Youtube video is quite good that can explain very well than reading articles. There are too many sources that you can gain knowledge regarding how nodes work -- and I think you need to have DYOR for this.",

The right question is one that has not been answered here and elsewhere thousands of times. And it's not even crucial in the sense that if a newbie were to misunderstand 'what a Bitcoin node' is, it wouldn't put them at risk or anything.It would be more important to make sure they don't misunderstand the importance of keeping a seed phrase secure or something of this sort; lack of knowledge on that topic is actually maliciously exploited in the wild.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on December 18, 2022, 09:01:28 PMmisleading information from the various search enginesAlso keep in mind I never recommended a specific search engine, but specific sites that have correct, well-explained articles on almost all beginner questions. You should have made a thread that features those sites and maybe the most important pages from each site. That would have been more helpful; kind of a 'Beginner 101 must-read links' collection that would actually answer tons of different questions.Instead of a dedicated thread for a single, for beginners probably relatively niche, question, in which you don't even answer the question but ask people to do it for you.",
