  "content": "What has an advantage has its own disadvantage but with precaution and proper guidance, it will be easier to minimize the disadvantages; this statement is for people that would say they don't use telegram because of scammers and perpetrators, I understand but there is a good side to telegram and one of the good sides is the bots, these bots help you in many ways regardless of how experienced you are to transactions, the fees, how to scan transactions and also get notify what is happening on the forum when offline.There are a variety of these bots and they are not only limited to Bitcoin transactions, there are other bots that can help you monitor incoming and outgoing transactions on wallet address on other blockchains for free, you can track a wallet address when they have incoming transactions and outgoing transactions, and they help you scan your wallet address and monitor any wallet address without using a browser, they also help you know the fees to pay for the Bitcoin network and also look at sats require to get a transaction from wallet A to wallet B and also get notified when you get mentioned on this forum. These Bots are discussed below and their username is indicated inside parenthesis () for easy recognition of the usernames.Bitcoin Fees(@BitcoinFeesAlert_bot): What this bot does is that you can get the current fees of Bitcoin/Vbyte for transactions with its inbuilt command, it can help you with an alert when the fees go below a certain sat/Vbyte, and when a transaction is pending, it can also help you with an alert when it becomes confirmed with the transaction ID.Screenshot 1: Testing out Alert of If sat <= 5 Screenshot 2: Testing out current fees of Bitcoin transactions.These are some of the tested screenshots from the bot and as you can see, Bitcoin transaction fee is high since last week and to test out pending Bitcoin transactions, you need the transaction ID and reply with the Bot with /tx xxxx(txhash) and it will notify you when the transaction becomes confirmed.TrackTX(@TrackTX): This one is not limited to Bitcoin; it allows you to monitor Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the Binance smart chain transactions all at once. You can get your balance without having to access the explorer through your browser, and they are safe to use because they scan wallet addresses from reputable sources such as blockchair for bitcoin, etherscan for Eth, and bscan for BSC wallet addresses.BitcoinTalk SuperNitifier(@BTTSuperNotifier_bot): This bot is created by a devoted member of this forum, with this telegram bot, you get notified when you receive merit on any of your posts, when any of the forum member pens down your name in any submitted post or quote your previous post, and also help you tracked topics and board in this forum, you can visit the official thread for more details about the telegram bot project.What the bot need is your forum username and UID to get notified about what is happening relative to your account.There are more telegram helpful bots out there but the one I listed will never ask you for any sensitive information, they will never ask you for private keys or request for email address, I hope this helps. Cheers!",

However, it work for balance on BTC and from the bot, the balance give a link(blockchair) to explore more on txs.In addition, it seems that the developers have long stop working on the project, there is an official telegram link for the project but no human activity has been going on, only a welcome messages on repeat for any member that join the group.There is a telegram bot (@CryptocurrencyAlertingBot) that allows you to monitor the incoming and outgoing Bitcoin transactions for real but there is a limitation, you are required to register an account with email and password(not good for decentralization), and after that, they allow you received 20 free notifications for BTC which after that, you will be required to subscribe, and that is why I didn't add that one.",

Nothing against those bot, but if you learn checking mempool, you might other info like Difficulty Adjustment and the number of unconfirmed trx, and where your transaction is as far as block numbers is concern.

The problem with people is that they will get lazy to do the work themselves if they notice the bot made good predictions several times in a row. They will have the opinion that the bot is reliable and there is no need to doubt its suggestions. And sooner or later, it will drop the bomb on your and suggest that you pay 50 sat/vByte at a time where 5 sat/vByte would have been enough.

But you don't have to know what is happening all the time. You should only be concerned about the network status the moment you want to send a transaction. That's when the time comes to take a closer look at the mempool, which only takes a few seconds.",
