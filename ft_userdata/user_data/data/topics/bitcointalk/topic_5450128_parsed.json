The software developers will be having opportunity to develop their own Linux-based applications and upload them to the Katheer OS to earn rewards from that. In the current information and communication technology market, the centralised ownership and control of user-generated content limit users, developers and creators' rights and ownership. Central control over the trading of virtual goods created by users restricts them from generating fair value for their creations. Proving creative ownership of works can be challenging, especially as content is copied, altered, and built upon. With the Katheer project, we aim to overcome these limitations while accelerating blockchain adoption to grow the blockchain information and communication technology market. We will do this by building an integrated open-source operating system where creators can develop, create, use, play, share, collect, and trade without central control, enjoying secure copyright  ownership with the ability to earn cryptocurrency (KAH). This copyright ownership will be established and guaranteed through NFTs, where every item inside the OS will have a unique and immutable blockchain identifier.",

But what are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a blockchain-based operating system compared to traditional operating systems?Thanks Derwin for highlighting that. The advantage of using the blockchain integrated within the operating system can be as the following:Assets are stored in holders' wallets through the tokenisation of UGC.User retention of copyright in perpetuity.Ownership is not tied to the operating system.Creative authorship is immutable.Less fraud possibility thanks to blockchain's record-keeping technology.Developers and creators will receive 100% of the selling price they set for their creations.Multiple creators can automatically share payments and revenue.Blockchain allows assets to be shared between users for collaboration.Peer-to-peer trading.I don't see any disadvantage  . You can suggest if you have any",

What measures that can be taken by token holders to protect their investments from security risks in the cryptocurrency space, and what role can katheer play in ensuring the security of their users' funds?good question  Katheer Project will apply the Security-Enhanced Katheer operating system by default, which implements a diversity of security policies, including forced access controls. Katheer will render a hardening wrapper using compiler features like position-independent executable (PIE). Contrary to certain beliefs, the open-source nature of the Katheer OS helps patch security issues very quickly and spot any security flaws due to its collaborative nature. Moreover, Katheer OS will not give its users admin access by default and therefore limits the damage that users can do by clicking on links that could be malicious. Finally, many companies already use Linux operating systems like the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is specifically hardened for data security and will use the Katheer OS for the same reason.In addition to the above, the Katheer OS will have a built-in security application, the K Guard Endpoint Security. K Guard Endpoint Security provides next-generation, multi-layered protection against all types of cyberthreats on the Katheer OS that detects known and advanced threats, even in memory or boot sectors. It delivers reliable protection with minimal impact on performance and offers complete protection in hybrid environments, ensuring all systems are managed and protected all the time. K Guard Endpoint Security provides built-in technologies to eliminate redundant scanning, protect valuable data and business applications, identify and block the latest emerging threats, and deliver optimal security with minimal impact on other applications or overall system performance. K Guard Security Network is an advanced system that processes anonymised threat data from millions of nodes worldwide, using sophisticated data science technologies to deliver near real-time threat intelligence to every user.This agility means that even in zero-day attack situations, where threat information is not yet available to the endpoint, K Guard Security Network works with K Guard Endpoint Security for the Katheer OS to stop threats. Big data processing of massive volumes of threat metadata from suspicious files makes it possible to make rapid, accurate decisions about their safety without analysing their content - with short response times; it's a significant additional layer of security. K Guard will have the Behavior Detection feature, which provides proactive defences, identifying and extracting suspicious behaviour patterns and effectively protecting your system against advanced threats. It will also have the Auto-scan feature for newly connected storage devices that don't allow malicious programs that exploit operating system vulnerabilities to replicate themselves via removable drives. K Guard can also scan network ports and monitor web traffic for attempts to visit phishing websites and block access to them.",

Why you choose linux operating system? is there any special reason or have any unique feature that give you any competitive advantage?If you mean, why have we chosen Linux as our base for the Katheer OS?? The short answer is that it is a base for most of the other operating systems in the market apart from MS Windows. We can not make Windows our base because it's not open and it's protected by too many ways especially the coding copyright.In general, Linux is the default environment for most software developers and is a popular choice for embedded solutions. However, one of Linux's greatest strengths, and to some extent, its biggest challenge, is that it comes in so many favours and varieties, each well suited to a particular use case. Most of the top supercomputers in the world run on Linux. Many run a variation of this popular operating system from the smallest devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers. The reasons for Linux's popularity depend on its usage; in some cases, it's the open-source aspect, and in others, it's the scale of device support and the spectrum of processors and platforms. Linux scales from small resource-constrained computers to the largest supercomputer. Its portable source runs on various processor architectures (Intel®, Arm, IBM PowerPC, etc.).",

In the Katheer project, we will work on a cautious approach so our project can skip the collapses such as the collapse of the Anchor Protocol and UST, and can protect us against celsius issues, and restrain us from speculating on the funds for product development. Research and Finance team members collect and analyse high-quality economic data to create a passive allocation strategy. Fundamental and technical analysis and examining international laws enable us to set the path for long-term development. We adapt to sudden legal regulation changes and keep up with jurisdiction trends in the countries we operate in. These steps protect us from the bear market impact, as we aim to rely on our stable and reasonable fundamentals, not on the external environment's impact. The activities we undertake in the background aim to enhance KAH token capability.",
