That’s a lot of places and a lot of accounts in between.So long as it’s a team effort, it could work but, am not sure it’s ideal given that most of the promotions that could arise from this sort of large organization would be spam based and that ain’t some means to promote a good project. Not saying it would be but actually say, it could be the case.While, the $6,234,850.00 per day might not seem like a lot to you at OP, I think you should recall that, that would be per day and your talking about six million, two hundred and thirty four thousand, eight hundred and fifty dollar if am to spell it out for you to make sense. That’s a whole lot of money for just a day’s promotion whose result is under probability.",

They get certain contracts from what I understand but I'm not sure if casinos or igaming are allowed to deal with them directly since Kick is basically run by the owner of Stake. Kick is the rival of Twitch in case you didn't know. A lot of streamers migrated there when they were banned on Twitch.If streamers migrated to Kick when Twitch banned gambling promotion then it is highly unlikely they will restrict if they start promoting other gambling based content other than Stake. The reason some of the streamers jumped ship is because of the revenue sharing model and minimal moderation of content, there are some glitches in the app and once it is sorted it will be great.Quote from: burenka on August 24, 2023, 11:27:08 AM~so if we multiply everything on everything we will get.. $6,234,850.00 per one day. The question you need to ask is, whether these casino's are spending money advertising to individual users and influencers. Some of the big casino's are sponsoring major sporting events and they might promote their casino with influencers who are genuine gamblers and they might have a separate affiliate deal rather than shelling out money on a daily basis .",

The possibilities are endless and we just have to be as creative as we can.So the amount we spend on advertisement can never be calculated because it all depends on one's creative thinking.",

I agree that when a casino gets some good amount of users from this forum then they may search for other areas to promote their site and thus they start spending money on social media marketing. That is why it is highly recommended for new casinos to try promoting in this forum. Apart from promoting, the new casinos will also get more useful input and suggestions for their casinos, improving the quality of their casinos and providing maximum service to their users. The reviews from the members here can let the casino know what still needs to be improved and reduced so that the casino can develop even more in the future.Apart from that, casinos can also use social media such as Twitter to share various kinds of promotions. This is enough to do as an initial stage and to see how big the response is from members and other people who become their followers. If the results are as expected by the casino, the casino can try out promotions through other methods that can also provide additional members. Casinos can use all the ways suggested but they have to use it step by step and only some at a time because casinos also need to adjust their budget.Quote from: cabron on August 24, 2023, 02:56:30 PMTrafic brokers that allow gambling-related sites are not very well known, however.

If he could just give a discount or free test of his service, he might just prove his network to be worth the price for a new casino. It's better for him to give a discount on his services because the platform is still new and not many know about it. By giving discounts to potential customers, they can get reviews about their services to get other potential customers who want to use the platform.The important thing is that he can provide what the prospect needs and do everything well. If a customer is satisfied with his service, that customer will tell his friends, providing an opportunity for him to get more potential customers. Thus, the business can grow well and be large, with many customers using its services.",
