In case Bitcoin Fluctuates too much, it will have an impact on Binance users as in case of a dump they will be holding the coins in loss, the stop losses might not trigger Â Binance took advantage of bad operations of Poloniex and Bittrex when cryptocurrency market was exponentially grew in 2017 bull run and hold the first position until now. I believe they do know that if they can not handle such issues well, they will very easily to lose their customers to other exchanges and seriously might lose their first position too.I believe Changpeng Zao and Binance team will do their hard works to fix those issues and bring smooth experience back to Binancians.",

      "body": "I keep getting the feeling Binance is being operated with more in their marketing and management budget then in their infrastructure and hardware budget.Too many instances of things going wrong on a regular bases. Not show stopping implosion things, but now we patch this to make it work and then we patch the next thing and so on. Not actaully stopping to do it properly.I don't use them on any kind of regular basis, but it seems that they have more things happen to them then other places.Could also be that more people talk about it since they are the largest.-Dave",

People will just forget today's (and previous incidents) and keep on trading/depositing at binance until one day when the withdrawal will be halted but will never resume. Believe me, someday this situation will come, so I never trust a centralized exchange no matter how SAFU they claim themselves.",
