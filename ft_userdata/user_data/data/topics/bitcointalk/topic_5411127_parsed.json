      "body": "Aside from being entertaining in a trainwreck sort of way, its garbage. I wouldn't touch it. Every single token that has been launched on it rugged their buyers within 24 hours -- some as little as 2 hours. It is all scams. There's no doubt their \"utility token\" will end the same way. On top of that, there's a good chance the bridge holding everybody's DOGE (real DOGE) will get mysteriously \"hacked\" and drained. I'd give this event a year, tops. It could happen in the next month, even.The founders (Roc Zacharias) approached Dogecoin community members and the Dogecoin Foundation in April. Everyone told him that using the name \"Dogechain\" was a bad idea, and most people thought it was a bad idea in general. For one, there is already a long-time DOGE explorer named dogechain.info. Number two, they hired some of the most scammer-esque influencers to shill their project (Matt Wallace, ProTheDoge... every single token they get behind is a scam). Three, they dropped the \"w\" from their bridge wDOGE and now just call it \"Doge.\"Everything they do is an attempt to confuse people into thinking any of it has to do with Dogecoin (it does not), and everything else about this project screams \"scam.\" I recommend staying away from it.https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1562683131135528960https://twitter.com/JBricaux/status/1562693044436353029",

IMO, I believe that its nothing but just a copycat, as we notice there are a lot of fly-by-night projects in the crypto space nowadays, using the same name just to ride the hype and popularity, of the existing one, there is too many useless meme coin project in the market today and they are also destined to fall down in the process maybe sooner or later thats why for me I don't invest in such projects.",

I won't invest. I'm critical and meticulous into projects that I'd like to invest. As much as possible, the project should be existing long already and it's not just a copy cat of another project.There were the bitcoin forks that have been a trend for a short period of time and then majority of those died. Then, these developers are sticking to any project that's making a buzz. And with the popularity of meme coins, projects like this were made.People should learn with such projects, rug pulling is likely to happen anytime.",

That was obviously a big scam project, don't invest in it. Perhaps, even investing in the original Dogecoin seems not to be considered a reliable investment, and how much more in this cloning project? It ruins the image of meme coins and likely it leads to ignoring them all. I'd say nothing more about this project, we better choose those projects that are worth enough to invest in, not them. Well, enough with the meme coins and these scam projects, it helps nothing on the market either.",

Well if has nothing to do with the real Doge Chain then why would we invest? Even the real Doge is just a meme and pure pump and dump so that alone is already questionable. And if not for Elon Musk hyping it, I think people will forget that we have this coin. Although some gamblers might used it because it's quick and fast but that's it. As @nutildah posted, everything screams scam of this Doge Chain, so no and hopefully no one will fall for this or would be victims.",

I thought it was going to be something fun, but it is not. Stay away if you have not touched it yet, nothing good will come out of it, not to mention the bride out takes 2x24 hours or 2 days to be processed. It is pretty messed up all over the place.",

I personally will not and don't want to take a risk to invest in this project. However, after seeing a listing news published by KuCoin, I think I should reconsider my decision. About 19 hours ago KuCoin published news on their website that they were going to list DogeChain (DC) on their market. You can see the news here.I don't think we can just judge this project, they are still in development. Maybe we will need a little more time to see whether this project is a potential project or not. With the listing of this $DC token on KuCoin, I think they are one step ahead of increasing the confidence of their investors and potential investors.",
