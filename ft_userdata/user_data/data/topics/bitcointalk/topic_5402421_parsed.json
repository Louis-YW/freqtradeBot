  "content": "If there was a vulnerability in ECDSA/Schnorr (maybe because of a quantum computer but it can be any other reason - lattice attacks, etc.) and there would be alternative - new safe locking scripts - and people would start moving their coins into them. What do you think would happen to those UTXOs that don't move at all (lost coins/Satoshi’s coins/etc.)?Do you think the consensus would be to let them be stolen OR  to soft-fork them out (remove from circulation - e.g. “you have 10 years to move your UTXOs, otherwise they will become invalid”)? The first option is better in my opinion but flooding the market with so many coins could be massively disruptive.The second option would probably not be able to reach consensus but the effect on price would not be so disastrous. Some people touched this in the following thread but I didn't want to continue there as this was a little bit off topic:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5400954.0",

There are two sides and some say they shouldn't be locked or anything and another side says they should be burnt.In my opinion if some day in the far away future we come to the conclusion that ECC is obsolete we should define a migration period after which any coins left in the old algorithm becomes unspendable.",

      "body": "It will be very difficult to reach a consensus either way, as there are strongly held beliefs on both sides. I am very much of the opinion that it is better to let these coins be stolen than it is to do anything to lock them or make them otherwise unspendable. It is better to take the short term price hit from lost coins re-entering the market than it is to destroy a core principle of bitcoin and allow a small group of devs or a small subsection of the community start to decide what happens to coins which do not belong to them.It is worth noting that not all vulnerable addresses will be hacked at once, but rather, it will happen gradually over months or even years. There are a multitude of reason in which coins which are not lost may not move for long periods of times. Perhaps the owner is in a different country to their wallet. Perhaps they are in prison. Perhaps the private keys are locked up in some kind of inheritance or trust. Perhaps there is a timelocked transaction waiting to be broadcast at a certain date. If we set a fixed date and lock all these coins, then we will absolutely be depriving some users of their coins against their will. At that point, bitcoin is no longer decentralized nor trustless.If you are careless and fail to look after your private keys or move your coins in time, then they will be stolen. Far better that than the devs say \"Since you are careless, we are going to take your coins away from you.\" You can't be your bank if someone else can unilaterally remove that privilege from you.As I mentioned in another thread, I would only support locking coins if there was some way for the real owner to prove ownership and unlock them again, such as by providing a zero knowledge proof that they own the seed phrase which generated the relevant private keys. But this does not solve the problem of truly lost coins or early coins in P2PK addresses.",

First: they will never move, because even if some keys are vulnerable, other, fully random keys may be good enough to resist many attacks. Second: they will move somewhere by providing a valid signature. That second option could have many variants: they could move into OP_RETURN, they could move as a fee, and be burned in the coinbase transaction, they could be timelocked to the future, and taken later by miners, or they could be stolen once, and then the system will be safe again, after moving to the new address type. In case of the second option, if a lot of coins will be moved at once, then I think burning will reach consensus quicker than other ideas, so the chain where they will be burned, will be followed, and will stay the heaviest.The only unacceptable thing is moving coins without providing any valid signature. All other cases are good enough, and it is possible to reach consensus, when coins will be not moved, or moved by valid transactions (then, that second option depends on the destination).Quotebut flooding the market with so many coins could be massively disruptiveThat's why I think if someone will suddenly move a lot of coins, then the consensus will quickly form around burning all of them, by providing valid signatures. In economical sense, other forks could be just cheaper and lose Proof of Work support from miners.QuoteThe second option would probably not be able to reach consensusWhy not? I read many posts saying that \"burning is acceptable\" or \"locking by soft-fork is acceptable\". I think reaching consensus on burning someone else's coins would be easier, than forming any consensus on stealing them, even if only once.",

In economical sense, other forks could be just cheaper and lose Proof of Work support from miners.But how do you distinguish legitimate users from \"thieves\"? The legitimate/stealing transactions will both have a valid signature.If there is ever a consensus to lock the coins I guess the only way would be to block the UTXOs (to block all coins with vulnerable signatures, not just some chosen coins) after a long period of alert (e.g. a decade) before the attack itself, not after the coins have already moved. After some block height, only coins on new and safe addresses will be movable.

Besides, you'll have a gradual build up to this. We aren't anywhere near the capability of doing it right now, and even when you factor in exponential growth there's going to be a long, long time before something is capable of doing it within minutes. Despite, the exponential growth, it'll still we somewhat gradual in the time that it takes to break it. By the time something is capable of breaking it within minutes, Bitcoin could have well have moved on so much, that the old chain is considered obsolete, or alternatives people themselves might have found an alternative to Bitcoin. What I'm saying is there's just too much unknown factors to even realistically talk about it. Hence, why the discussions around it have been what ifs, rather than anything substantial.

Those on the old chain wouldn't be able to easily prove they owned the coins on the new chain. At least, I don't think there would be a easy way of doing it. Maybe, but probably beyond my understanding, at least at this stage. I thin we're still in the stage of thinking of thinking about solutions, since it's too far away right now that there's not a whole lot of urgency needed.Whatever the circumstances, there's going to be a lot of split opinions when it comes to the proper discussion definitely. I don't want to see old coins released back in, and I don't want to see the destroyed.

It's not all about price either, in fact not preventing old UTXOs from being spent would be against the fundamentals of bitcoin where your coins are only yours to spend not everyone's. It took me a bit to understand what you were saying, and I thought you might have meant the reverse initially - mostly because my view is the opposite.  Such censorship, deleting, and blocking of addresses would make bitcoin obsolete. If the arguments about censoring old coin ever succeed, then bitcoin would have already failed because it would show that bitcoin is not a long term store of value, in which case, the idealogues should move on. It's not that any reasons for censorship are arbitrary reasons, but they are ones that I don't think will ever result in anything because the results are much more unpredictable than the scenarios in this thread. The product of old addresses being cracked is no different than them being re-engaged in by the original owners (or their inheritors), the latter of which could happen at any time. The very top thread assumes two scenarios which I think would happen in exactly the opposite fashion -- someone who has been holding onto coin for ages has little reason to sell them immediately or quickly because they have 'enough'. Their sale pressure is pretty low, so the scenario given above is unlikely. Even if such old coin are sold by crackers or original owners, then it results in a more distributed coin, which adds long term value to the network and is a necessary part for sustainability and growth.",

Let's say there are even 2-3 mil. coins that are lost (nobody has private keys anymore). If the stealing lasts 10 years it's like mining with current block subsidy at that time (approx. 328.500 BTC is currently mined per year). And to be honest, I don't think that many coins are lost and thus would stay on vulnerable addresses.Of course, if the attacker manages to crack keys from dozens of thousands P2PK UTXOs within a couple of months it could be disastrous (pricewise). And there are also other UTXOs with revealed pubkeys (reused addresses, P2TR, etc.).FYI: there is currently 1.73 mil. BTC on 48.000 P2PK UTXOs.",
