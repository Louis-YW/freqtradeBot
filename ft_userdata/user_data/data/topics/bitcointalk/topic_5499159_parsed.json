Download the html and open it on a word editor.You will see where you can past your seed phrase. Paste the seed phrase and scroll down. You will see the derivation part that you can click on to select the one you want. BIP44 for addresses that starts from 1 and the extended private key will start from xprv. BIP49 for addresses that start from 3 with extended private key that starts from yprv. BIP84 for segwit version 0 addresses, it has addresses that start from bc1q with extended private key that start from zprv. The private key to each address can be seen with the public keys beside the address if you scroll down further.Iancoleman can not generate taproot address for now. I mean the bitcoin addresses that start from bc1p.",

There many reasons  someone may want to derive the private from seed phrase in order to access the coins. I have told someone before to use it to get access to his altcoin. He used it and was able to access his altcoin and spent it. Also many wallets have the Iancoleman guide because there are some issues that needed there users to generate the private key and import it instead of seed phrase.",

I am done here and the link to article of How to back up a seed phrase is my help, but I had to buy benefit of the doubt that OP did not make a fake question.I still think there is high probability that this question is not from actual demand for help. I stop here and will not return to this thread even you replied me more.",

      "body": "Other members of the forum have made different suggestions and to a newbie some of them may seem a little bit difficult. Now I suggest you get an open source wallet like Electrum and access your wallet via the electrum software.You should be able to find your private key with a few toggles. If it is an HD wallet you will find both your master private key which was generated directly from your seed phrase and also your child keys which were generated with your master key.Make sure to do All these under a safe and secure network connection. Also make sure that neither your keys or seed is exposed as they are direct access to your wallet .",
