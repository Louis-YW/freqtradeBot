If you do tend to tell them about Bitcoin or with crypto then to those who havent heard it yet would really be refusing on making use or dealing with it due to lack of trust or not being that recommended by the government or something that not regulated but we do know that not all people would really be that something stupid on which there are ones who would really be trying out to make some research on what it is. There are people who do welcome up some changeand welcome innovation and to those who had engaged and decided to deal with it will always be having that advantage compared to those who have none.",

Don't waste too much time trying to convince anybody that is proving too difficult to convince about bitcoins, leave them to their own opinions and focus on gathering more bitcoins so that later on in the future they will see the results of the decision that they refused to take.",

For instance they drive electric cars even though they are known to catch fire and be built in China. They trust Chinese phones even though it was proven that some of them were had spyware. They trust the government, despite so many politicians being corrupt... Bitcoin wasn't proven to be wrong, corrupt, or a scam, yet people don't trust it.",

Most of this people still believe there is nothing like Bitcoin since it is nothing physical and getting to find out the person behind Bitcoin has remained anonymous upto this date this will cause them to avoid by all means yet we can term it ignorance.",

The interest that they have isn't on this market but into something else. Not until they start to step in and have that interest for knowing more about cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, that's how they're going to learn everything else.

There will be a disorder. That is why humans are used to following rules and regulations and whatever is being used by the majority as to not separate from the flock.You are forgetting that fiat money is traditional. It’s coins and paper. It’s tangible. On the other hand, it is hard to grasp the concept of cryptocurrency because you can not actually see nor touch it. This is why most people think it is not true. Especially those who are not that excellent in technology. Cryptocurrency is both new to technology and finance.

But that is also not a real obstacle and we also don't need to force everyone to know btc because things like this not all can understand and all we have to do when we know bitcoin at this time is just to enjoy it by being in bitcoin that is comfortable for us.",

Bitcoin is still very new and at this time we are still in the development phase so it is quite natural that there are still many people who do not know or even doubt that bitcoin is feasible because this is about choice and not everyone will accept bitcoin as a choice to be taken.",
