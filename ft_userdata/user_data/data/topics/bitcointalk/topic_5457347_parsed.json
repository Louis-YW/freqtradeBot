      "body": "You can't actually predict precisely on which of these meme coin will do well than the other, there's no actually competition between coins. One thing you have to take note about those coins is their respective season, DOGE came first and did good pump for early holders, shib came second and did the same thing, now it's pepe turn to do the same but the big question is \" how usefulness/use cases of these coins in the ecosystem, and how consistent the team behind them keeps improving on their development to keep it getting value. A good meme coin can only last if there's a strong backups from the team and the wide usage outside just hype",

Which will be No.1?Just to disregard the nature of these projects, I was sure that Dogecoins will still on the top among these meme coins. Why? Because among these coins, only Dogecoin has a huge community that supports this coin which means that it was pretty unlikely it will die when they are still there. And the other reason is that some traders are using this for moving their coins to another platform or wallet due to low-cost fees. While these Shiba and Pepe, they only got the name and were known to the community because of the hype, nothing else.",

It can be SHIB, or PEPE too, depends on the market sentiment and since Elon is done with DOGE, it will not be easy to take a side here.",

It was the first meme coin that was ever created and all other meme coins including Shiba Inu and PePe are just copies of it that were created in order to make a lot of money without putting much effort into it. That being said, i strongly dislike all meme coins because in my opinion they are bad for the crypto space as a whole. They are offering zero functionality and 99.9% of them are dead again within a few days or are scams from the start.",

Those memcoins are already too old and expensive and well pumped, so you can't make much money on them. Memcoins will always replace one another, because the point of their creation is to increase the price many times over.

Doge is the real winner here. it's not comparable with another copy cat token like shiba inu or even pepe token. Meme tokens will always rely to the hype. No hype and no pump. You can't even sure if shiba inu will able to take over doge coin as the leading meme coin in the market right now. I just saw that the rest was just fake token that used the name of doge coin to get the hype. Quote from: Husires on June 24, 2023, 11:49:57 AMSHIB has an infinite supply and this large supply means that there are more burns and thus sharp fluctuations in the price before this coin dies.Since when shiba inu has infinite supply? Shiba inu's supply has been limited to the 1k trillions. 410 trillions already burned by vitalik through sent it to the burn address. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/17/vitalik-buterin-burns-6b-in-shib-tokens-says-he-doesnt-want-the-power/It's doge coin which has infinite supply but the inflation is very small from year to the another year.",

It's all game money, whether it's topcoins or memes. This is just a financial market where we would take each other's money and then disappear. Don't believe what the projects say, their purpose of creating tokens is just to take your money and disappear.

The same with PEPE, never bothered to enter but then heard many made a fortune, the only meme coin i used is DOGE and after the rally during the last bull run i was able to make a lucky substantial profit and sold everything and i am yet to use them after that but in my mind it is the only meme coin that will last till the next decade.",
