How good is this?https://bitcoinics.com/bitcoin-as-a-retirement-bet/there is no doubt that while considering the options to invest into for the purpose of your retirement, Bitcoin stands as one of the most feasible asset to consider at the moment but you have to consider a lot of factors which will include your cureent age and how long you have left before retirement, if it would be wise to invest everything you've set out for your investment plan into Bitcoin or to diversify into Bitcoin and other none digital asset or wether it's necessary to invest for a certain number of years and then delegate it into starting a Business that will still support your investments. making an investment for q retirement plan is a very long term journey that spans nothing less than 10 to 20 years om the average and from this point, i doubt it's easy to project what will be the fate of Bitcoin at that time.For me, I would rather not be too conscious of investing for my retirement. It could just be as simple as doing a four year investment into Bitcoin and then from the product of the four year investment, I would know if it will be wise to continue investing for another four years and then I continue like that. But then, while preparing for retirement, I always feel that it's necessary to build a business that's going to stand as a strong retirement plan even while you're considering other investment option. If you've built a good business that's strong and doijg well, it's going to be easier to set out a portion of the profit that's coming into the business for your Bitcoin investments.",

How good is this?https://bitcoinics.com/bitcoin-as-a-retirement-bet/Though it's actually not a bad idea to invest in Bitcoin and sees it as something that will keeps you afloat during retirement, but the major concern about this is how long are you holding, and how stable is your source of income, because if you source of income isn't that stable, at some point, you will be force to temper with your Bitcoin investment just to survive for the time being.Another thing I think that will be very important to consider before taking such actions like investing in Bitcoin for retirement purpose is that, is it a money you can do away without? Because most newbies investors mostly do that, by investing an amount they can't do away without, and at some point they will later fall back to the investment and be eating it bit by bit till everything collapse or they start lagging behind in their investment goal, so it's very Important to invest an amount you can do away without, so as to be stable in your investment, because without stability, it would not be possible to achieve the initial goal of saving in Bitcoin for retirement purpose.",

If you increase your net worth gradually year by year, when retirement age comes you will be in a very good position, and you will be able to live off the interest or average capital growth, as well as leave an inheritance to your descendants without spending the capital.",

So maybe the best approach is just like 50% of it into Bitcoin and then the rest spread out across several assets and then you should also have some funds in your bank in case of emergency. So there's nothing wrong with Bitcoin, and it could be the best asset in the world, but retirement money is retirement money, you have work hard for it doing jobs that you may or may not like and you don't want to lose it everything.",

Depends on the specific country.If in a conventional country there is a pension fund crisis, expressed in a reduction in the pension budget due to the fact that the number of pensioners is growing and the working-age population is declining, the retirement age is increasing, pension reforms are being carried out, when your pension savings are declining (or evaporating), then it makes sense to consider bitcoin as pension savings. If it were still possible to abandon compulsory pension savings and direct these funds into investment bitcoin, then it would be simply wonderful, but this is an impossible utopia.https://x.com/APompliano/status/1095288927580233729 - If large institutional investors invest retirement money in cryptocurrencies, why can't you do the same?

I guess that you are talking about yourself. How will an adult that have plans to enjoy his old age be working and investing for his retirement and you are saying that he will put of money. When you are only buying and not selling so that you can accumulate a significant amount of bitcoin. A lot of wealthy people and institutions are buying bitcoin for the future because they know that the price will always be bullish overtime. Fiat is no guarantee as a retirement plan and that is why a lot of people are not being paid their pension. Fiat depreciates overtime and government will not increase your income, if you retire you will die poor without any investment for back up plan.

When you are old, you will be surprised at the amount of bitcoin in your possession because the price of bitcoin increases overtime and it is also the size of your portfolio that will determine your profit.

A business person and even an entrepreneur can set out a retirement plan while he's still actively working. for the context of those that are civil servants and have a certain amount deducted from thier salary and saved up for there retirement plan, if there is an option to decide if you're okay that the portion of your earning that's going to take care of your retirement needs be paid to you or saved up for you, I would prefer to receive it and invest it into an asset I'm comfortable with rather than saving it with the government.It's not everyone that's careless with the money that comes into there account. Some are very meticulous with it and knows how to use it for something that will double the money for a givine span of time. There are a lot of issues with keeping all your retirement benefits with the government and when you've worked for 30 to 40 years, you then get paid. In my region, it's a big risk to hope on your retirement benefits and for most individuals, you will end up waiting till you're dead and won't see the money that has been deducted from your salary as iether pension or gratuity. This is a tale almost 70% of retired folks have had to cope with and others have even lost hope in the system.Quote from: MeGold666 on June 21, 2024, 08:42:19 AMSome want to believe that Bitcoin price will grow fast enough to recover their spending, it's a funny bet on your life and probably will end with homelessness.I agree partly with you on this. I don't think that Bitcoin is the best retirement option. When you're considering what's best for a retirement plan, you're more concerned about what's certainly going to be available at the time of your retirement and not what might experience a dip during the phase of your retirement. I know that if you're still young and starts buying Bitcoin from this period that it's at the rate of $65k that before you approach your retirement phase it would have gotten to at least $250k to $300k hopefully which would be a better choice than the usual savings methord, but that's a risk you wouldn't be able to cope with should things go contrary to plan. As an edge against inflation in a long term that's not as long as the normal retirement circle, Bitcoin is the perfect investment model but anything too far to a point we can't comfortably make speculation on at this point isn't the best bet for a retirement plan option.Quote from: MeGold666 on June 21, 2024, 08:42:19 AMFrom what I've seen it's usually people in their 20's 30's talking about this retirement \"plan\" and guess what, they want to retire at 40.Good luck not spending it all for another 40 years.As for additional money for retirement, yeah sure.there is absolutely nothing wrong when you're making a retirement plan at 20 and even if you choose to retire at 40, it's still good. Planning for your retirement doesn't mean that you're not going to work again once you've reached that point but could rather be that you might slow things down a bit and focused on a rather less adventurous things. If you've set your plans right, you even after retirement at 40, you can still leave a comfortable life till you're old enough to exit this world.",
