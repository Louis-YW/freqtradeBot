I think OP wants to find a live source so that he can bet in advance during live to take advantage on the minor delay on score in sportsbook.LOL no the delay of streams on sportsbooks is not minor neither unnoticeable, it usually lasts several seconds and even dozens of seconds sometimes. If you try to follow the event on the radio or TV you will notice how long is this delay. But usually markets are instantly suspended when something happens in the match and live bets take a delay to be accepted and placed, then I don't think it gives a real advantage to have a faster stream at the end.",

Make bets on your phone on any site and watch everything on the TV that would work best ! But do not create multiple threads because the answer would remain same from people.",

To know the result faster than tv program or any live stream you have to watch the match on the playground. Otherwise I do not think their is any service from where you can watch/see faster.",

That's why IPTV is the better option than relying on free streaming that has some advertisements. I don't know if there's another best way, but as for me, the best way so far is only IPTV. I think there are plenty of providers we can choose from, those providers that has good servers for their IPTV service.",

It's a service allowing you to place bets without using the graphical user interface of the sportsbook or it's a service offering fast live streaming? You say bet365 limits max bets for such games, you mean bet365 closely monitor those providers and is aware of all events broadcasted by them? On most of sportsbooks you can't place instant bets on live events, there is always a delay between when you placed a bet and when it is accepted by the sportsbook. And if an event happens during this lap of time or if odds change, your bet will be rejected.",

Also, live odds are always several seconds ahead so it's close to impossible for anyone to take advantage of a faster stream and if you manage to get away with it you'll eventually get limited by the bookies.Quote from: Saint-loup on June 04, 2022, 07:45:46 AMOn most of sportsbooks you can't place instant bets on live events, there is always a delay between when you placed a bet and when it is accepted by the sportsbook. And if an event happens during this lap of time or if odds change, your bet will be rejected. It's still possible for us to prevent those rejected live bets as some sportsbooks usually have a setting that forces our bet to push through even if the odds changes but the downside with that setting is that we don't always get our preferred odds in time unless there's a small break happening.",
