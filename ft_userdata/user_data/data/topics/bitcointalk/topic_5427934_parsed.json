They are just both task free promotion form some projects to sell out their platform. Some did a good job on showing their goal, but the amount or difference fant be quantify. Maybe bounty is way higher than airdrops but depends on kind of project. If thats a lousy one then chance it would ve valueless is there.",

You're not going to be sure if they're going to be profitable because nobody knows how the developers will manage to get along with their audience and potential investors. Gone are those days when everyone was enjoying the free money in the market although it's a bit lower than the last ATH last year, well honestly I enjoyed more the ride last year than those years.",

Tbh bounties were also depends on how legit the developers are. Sometimes you have been working for a half of year and you got paid only $1. that's really hurt lol.

Bounties has a lesser restriction than on signature campaigns in the services section that even a brand new accounts can join on them.They can't be a waste of time as long as you will only pick carefully the bounties that you will join like apply only on those bounties that are managed by a high-ranked/reputable campaign manager because they likely picked legit bounties because you know, they are afraid that their reputations will get scratched. Some people don't have a proper talent but they also want to earn an extra income, so maybe bounties other than airdrops can be a good fit for them for a while.",
