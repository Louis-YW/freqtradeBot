      "body": "As vv181 already mentioned: Make sure to close the Blockstream Green app if it is installed. Only then you can run Sparrow as admin.Often it can simply be related to the USB port or the cable. So just swap the ports and check the cable.If the problem really only occurs on a specific PC, it is worth taking a look at the device manager. Check if there are any problems with the COM ports. (especially COM4)Often just a driver update is needed.",
