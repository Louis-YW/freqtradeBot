If you don't know what you are doing, it's best for you not to try anything more.This is the best option. There are many specialists who can dive deeper than recovery programs that you might be trying OP.Quote from: BitMaxz on December 06, 2023, 06:49:05 PMDo you still have the wallet.dat file on the drive D?If you still have the wallet.dat file you can brute-force the wallet only if you still remember your password partially.Or hire a professional who can recover your wallet check this site walletrecoveryservices.comOP just so that you are aware, this will probably only work if you know some of the password or if the password is short (depending on your computer power). The more of the password that you know, the less time it will be likely to take to find the right password. If you take this route, there are some open source tools to help you efficiently give this a go.",

(do not try this now since it counts as using the disk)Directly starting bitcoin-qt.exe?Through a shortcut with command line option like -datadir?Using cmd or PowerShell?",
