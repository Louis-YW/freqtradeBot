But sometimes when I also wait for the game to start, it changes to worse such from 1.75 to 1.10I prefer going live for a match that is likely to end 0-0 at half time and then waiting until it gets to 60 mins and going in for over 0.5 goals if the game is still goaless at 60mins, the least odd you can get at this time is BTW 1.50- 1.57 depending on the league, most top leagues offer 1.50 in this case. That's a 50% return on your investment, and it works for me 80% of the time. It's a great strategy, but it takes time. It will not make you rich immediately, but your chances of winning are always 95-98%. If the money line is less than 1.30, it climbs to 1.50-1.80 if the game is still goaless after 30 minutes, however live matches are good if you are only staking on a single game. If you want to run a multibet, place your bet before the game begins.",

      "body": "If you think a club or a team would win a certain match, you can wait for the live matches to start, the longer it takes to score the first goal, the higher the odds become. This is what I like going for with in-play matches. For other in-play, I do not like going for them. People should be careful of in-play matches, they are faster to win, which means to lose too is faster. And losing is very common.What can be most dangerous in in-play are underdog that may be winning with like 2 goals, the big team losing odd will be increasing and the small team odd will be decreasing. But this does not only happen to big teams. It can be big and big team too, or small and small team or any team. It can happen to any club in a way the winning team will have small odd that may attract gamblers, but many of the rematches go otherwise in a way the gambler might lose.",

But sometimes when I also wait for the game to start, it changes to worse such from 1.75 to 1.10As a sports bettor, you should really expect that change of line while the match is approaching. Especially, of course, in live betting.But I'm more curious about your example. Do you mean the moment the game began, the pre-match odds from @1.75 turned to @4.35? As in when the game began? The jump of odds is quite distant and these are the possible scenarios that I think happened to your concern:- Maybe the status of those players under \"game-time decision\" or what would be called it in other sports, are now officially out when the game starts? But for that huge gap of odds when the game began, maybe those players are really key players or a \"big deal\" on that team- Or maybe, you just think that the line moves when the game began but actually, the game was already started, maybe several minutes ago, and it was an early dominance by either one of the teams resulting in that quick jump of odds in the \"live betting\".Personally, I don't have a single preference on whether to bet only in pre-match odds or during a live bet. Hey, both are worth trying.",

But sometimes when I also wait for the game to start, it changes to worse such from 1.75 to 1.10This is the beauty of betting live games, You have the choice to skip betting when odds went down significantly on both ways because you don't need to place any bets on games that you are already uncomfortable. I always use live games to bet strong teams that have a rough start to get a higher odds on prematch. This strong team will eventually recover later on that will give you high odds in return.",

Usually my strategy is to bet on single wins, some specific championships I do multiple wins, and rarely do I bet on under or over goals.This is where I get the best results.",

So don't expect too much about the selection of odds.But if you happen to bet before the start of the game and you are seeing a different results once the game is playing,you can always cash out, if the bookie is still allowing you to cash out, at least not losing much from your bet. Because there's only time duration where you can cash out your bet, otherwise, wait for the result of the game.And this decision depends on the sports you are into, and how well you know the athletes involve.",

      "body": "in my opinion it depends on each person's strategy, for example in cases of games in the main leagues, I'm talking about the premier league, la liga, serie A, bundesliga and liga1, if you are watching it on tv you will see that there are some small delays and if if you are watching on the internet, you can also run the risk of crashing and spending a long time waiting to resume, and this affects a little when placing bets, now if the games are broadcast in the casino itself, because there are some leagues with the usa league and the NBA and some others that are broadcast in casinosso it may be easier for you to bet, but that is if you have already done an analysis of the game and you have seen that team x is better but you need confirmation, and in order to have that confirmation you will have to watch the game live for a few minutes, now on the over and under goals market it may be more advantageous to place live bets. it all depends on what kind of market you feel most comfortable with. In my case I use both options. but in the case of the big soccer leagues I always place bets before the games and now with the holidays in the big leagues I don't have anything to bet on, I tried to bet on the games of these small leagues but I'm doing very badly",

Cause the live games is where the odds makers find it easy to deceive gamblers by making up a high  deceptive odd in favor of a team that could end up losing the game. One of the most disadvantage of betting in live game is that of not been privy to certain information about an on going match that the gambling site have already gotten knowledge of and then use odds to attract glambers in betting for it only to end up having a backlash in the play, by then the gambler has already placed the bet.
