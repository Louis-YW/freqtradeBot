Or we are supposed to believe that you are a legit newbie who came here for the first time and decided to ask for a loan minutes after registering?The only thing that you can get here is a negative feedback so better lock this thread.",

There is more to trading than just using Demo funds. Emotions are a big part of trading, and they usually kick in when you are using real funds, worse still borrowed funds. Imagine the kind of pressure you will haveDemo trading results can be doctored. You will always get demo funds every time you blow up your demo accounts until the one time you have a perfect streak, and that's what you will show us here as a successful trader account.No collateral, no loan.",

Well, this discussion can continue more and more examples.... but it will be always the same...
