But I reckon there will be a few more exchanges to go before that happens. Binance has been immensely popular. It grew fast, basically when there were few other options. However, even though Binance is an important company in the crypto space, it is far from irreplaceable.Who will buy Binance? Probably someone with a lot of money. Perhaps Musk?",

Relating this in a centralized exchanges like bank, a group set of individuals come up and get united and develop their personal bank and fund it to start operation, so therefore I'm of the opinion that individual one or two person's can combine and by binance, so i think that op doesn't know or understand it in such narrative that two person's can pair and own a binance due to the status of their capitals or funds.",

Do you think the Binance owner will sell his exchange that is among the top 5 in the cryptocurrency industry? If I'm the owner of Binance exchange, it's not stupid for me to do that, sorry for the term.Think of the millions of dollars that are being given to me every day and then I will think of selling it, if you think of it as common sense you will not do that. Also, just think how many times the hackers entered the Binance exchange, all of that was passed and it was recovered.",

What just happened with FTX, we cannot trust any exchange. I only hope that FTX opens with withdrawals soon FTX Scam : Unable to withdraw.Also if binance buys FTX, don't you think Binance has become too big for the industry? You will feel scared if you see the magnitude of binance and their impact on the crypto world.Please don't make binance too big that it becomes a threat to the crypto world.",

Yeah! just like our local exchange where they managed to successfully sell it to a new owner but I don't like their way of managing the exchange right now it is as if they were some strict Bank where they just simply easily terminate their user without any warning. This is the problem with the new owner and I hope that Binance won't be like that if ever they gonna sold their company because it is really hard to look for another convenience exchange especially when you reside in a place where everything has always a restriction.",
