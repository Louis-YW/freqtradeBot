If you are aware of that and you still want to use a centralized exchange that requires KYC before you can do anything on the exchange, then you can make use of it. But for better way of buying and protecting your privacy, use Bisq. Bisq may be inconvenient and some people will prefer centralized exchanges for the convenience after getting verified. Traders too prefer to just use centralized exchanges to buy. But if you buy bitcoin using Coinbase, send it to your noncustodial wallet. That is very important because you do not have your keys on coinbase.com, it is not even a wallet but an account. You can use DCA to buy bitcoin. Buying now is good because all-time-high may be next year or next two years. Months after halving will favour bitcoin.",

Wallet like Electrum should be able to do the trick is you're able to create an Air gapped Wallet, as it will give you same security as a hardware wallet since you're going for a long term investment it's very important to choose the right wallet for your holdings.Note: never leave your coin in an exchange.",

The people who believe in Bitcoins know the true value of Bitcoins. So whatever amount is possible, they just buy it and do this at frequent intervals. Then they hold the coin until the price just skyrockets, and hence they sell it for high profits. They know that Bitcoins are limited in numbers; that is, no more Bitcoins can be created or discovered; hence, a time will come when there will be a scarcity to buy the coins, and people will sell the Bitcoins at high prices.",

It is very easy to buy. But holding it until you get to the desired price to take profit is what makes it difficult. Not all people have the mental capacity to handle drawdowns and see their funds melt down to negative. They become afraid and instead of holding or buying more, they sell it. Because when you are euphoric it is very easy to buy, when you are fearful, it is very easy to sell your position.  They don't have realistic timelines and expectations. They don't have a plan for when to average down on their position. Just buying btc and holding it is not a strategy. A strategy consists of managing risk, psychology, and your position. Getting in the move is the easiest.",

But a professional trader can invest in other coins if he wants to because it is his personal freedom. But wise people always choose the good one especially when it is for long term benefit.Anyway I see in your topic that you are choosing the centralize exchange Coinbase for investment.  I won't say that Coinbase is a bad platform, but considering security in longterm investments, I think it's better not to use a centralized exchange. And if you want to know the reason, then you can consider the case of ftx exchanger a few days ago as an example. And finally I will say that following a perfect DCA strategy for investment reduces the risk in the investment.",

Trading is a way to get more, but if cannot trade yet because you know that your skills are not good enough to make profit from, buying and holding bitcoins is also a way to benefit from bitcoins, but to benefit well, do not just stop at buying once, continue buying as much as you can and try your best to hold am much as you can safely away from loss and theft.",

You are lucky if you can recover part of your assets but most cases user lost their holdings once the exchange assets is not sufficient anymore to distribute to users.Purchase Bitcoin and Hodl it on hardware wallet for long term is the best strategy for everyone in Bitcoin.",

Traders too prefer to just use centralized exchanges to buy.Of course - I'd also recommend the Bisq exchange if the OP really wants to keep his privacy. But buying bitcoin anywhere is fine - but only if he agrees and understands the risks of KYC.The fact is that not everyone cares about privacy because some of them need a sense of comfort and convenience when they buy and trade their bitcoin. So far the centralized exchange has a license - it's government backed by rules, but the security of its assets and accounts really depends on the users themselves.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 02, 2023, 04:23:16 PMBut if you buy bitcoin using Coinbase, send it to your non-custodial wallet.

A non-custodial wallet is recommended - IMO, beginners are usually fine with Electrum.",

And yes, the next halving will push BTC again. It could possibly break the previous ATH and create a new record. This will not be surprising because we have already seen this happen in the past. And history will repeat itself. This is why big investors always buy and HODL till the next ATH for profits. You can surely do it because it is a less risky approach toward Bitcoin investment. But be sure that it's a long-term investment plan. You need to have the will to HODL for that long. As you are using Coinbase as the purchase method, know that it is a centralized exchange. Be sure to withdraw your coins after purchasing to somewhere safe. In a personal wallet that is. I would recommend hardware wallets. But if you can't get access to that, be sure to use other decentralized software wallets that provide good security. For example Electrum.",

They need x100 x1000 gains to accomplish their dreams and because of that they choose alts over btc since they think the more risk they take they bigger the potential prize will be.I think your strategy is a very wise and safe but you should also be realistic with your expectations.

When accumulating bitcoin, buying from coinbase is good but leaving your coin on exchange is not good, make sure you get a non custodial wallet address and store your bitcoin their, no exchange is secure for you to store your investment in any exchange, if anything goes wrong with the exchange, then your investment is also going with the exchange, that’s why you should make sure your bitcoin is stored in a non custodial wallet and properly secure your private key.",

A person who asks about the risks of choosing other than BTC should remember. Why does everyone choose BTC?From the institutional point of view of risk management and reliability, Do you know how much dominance bitcoin had in the market for a long period of time and it will continue to hold it? Market capital is one of the main reasons people trust the most trusted one and Bitcoin is the only most trusted one. Just imagine for a while a company wants to bring $1B to the crypto market what will he choose an asset with already $300B+ capital or a $1B to $10B Altcoin or shitcoin. The answer is clear.There are other reasons transparency, Supply, Volume, Widely recognized, and much more. Going with BTC is safe compared with any other coin. Even the profits are high with altcoins but there are great risks as well. Institutes can't afford a high risk.As you are interested in Bitcoin primarily, You should try DCA as already recommended by many.",
