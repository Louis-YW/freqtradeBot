The posts look almost random.The first 4 posts were deleted quickly after I reported them, but I feel like it's not enough. Considering the recent hype on text-spinning AIs, and considering how easy it is for shitposters to produce massive numbers of posts that take some time to read through to realize it's bogus, I'd like to see them banned quicker. Maybe we can still stop this before it reaches massive volumes.If you find more of this, please post them here as examples.",

This would require actual engagement from moderators - like reading the board they're responsible for and deleting/banning without waiting for reports. I haven't seen that happening since frodo was cleaning tech boards and FH in P&S.",

It struck me as very oddly constructed, like it was translated from another language by someone tripping their balls off or something (archived):Quote from: hasan21Although some have claimed that the record ranchers may mishandle it, it will essentially make things harder for them, therefore we should be grateful for that!Currently, all I need to do is come up with a few awesome presents to help me reach 150 legitimacy in the next two months, at which point my actions will raise my status. TongueHappy about the adjustment, perhaps there won't be as many postings about novices learning about ICOs in a string for a mineable coin with almost no ICO.On a hunch, I searched that topic for \"account farmers\" (which was massacred into \"record ranchers\") and found the original post that the above nonsense was derived from:Quote from: Ginzink on January 25, 2018, 08:28:19 AMIt may be abused by the account farmers as said by others, but it will make it harder at least for them and that is a good thing!Now i just need to come up with some high quality posts to gain 150 merit in the next two months when activity would rank me up Happy for the change, maybe there will be less posts of the type newbie asking about ICO in a thread for a minable coin without any ICO I'd appreciate it if someone could make a plagiarism report (I would do it myself, here, but I'm late for something, and have to run).Edit: Thanks @Stalker22, your report seems to have done the business; hasan21 is no more (https://bpip.org/Profile?p=hasan21).",

In the case of LoyceV's report, the reported user has posted four replies in a course of approximately 40 minutes.

I don't see how a captcha would solve that; I don't see the need, since these kinds of services are able to generate a vast amount of posts.Anyway, to return to the starting subject, I believe that the user in question is likely to be an alt account; I can't find any other reason a newbie would make such a large amount of posts in such a short notice.",
