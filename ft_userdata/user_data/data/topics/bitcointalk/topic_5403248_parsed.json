What are the best hardware wallets on the market today, and which ones would you recommend for storing mainstream coins like BTC, ETH, SOL, MATIC, etc.? I'm looking for a cold wallet for long-term storage, and am open to air gapped solutions with a solid track record as well. Which ones would you recommend and why?Thanks in advance! This community is very helpful, and it's a blessing that there are resources like this beginners forum for those of us who are early in our crypto journey.",

But if you forget your passphrase (best to backup your passphrase also, but in different location), you will not be able to access your coins as well. So, seed phrase and passphrase are as important as your coin because you will need both to access your coins.",

Nothing about the security of their products was involved.

Both manufacturers have had issues with personal data leaks, but the one that Ledger caused is a much more serious one and involved more user data.  Quote from: Hispo on June 19, 2022, 07:40:28 PMAs a rule of thumb, you should avoid to provide personal information when ordering a HW as much as possible. Easier said than done. If the manufacturer doesn't ship to PO boxes or the courier in your country doesn't deliver to PO boxes, you have to ship the package to a real address. One way around it is to have it delivered to your place of work. But whoever sees the package and accepts it will obviously know about your crypto interest.Some other things you can do is pay with Bitcoin instead of PayPal or Credit cards. You can create a brand-new or temporary email address just for the hardware wallet purchase. If you live in a country where you can purchase an anonymous SIM card without connecting it to your real identity, that's not a bad idea either.Quote from: LeGaulois on June 19, 2022, 08:42:34 PMedit: I checked Trezor's website, and unlike what the person above says I see MATIC and SOL MATIC is supported by both Trezor devices. SOL (Solana) is not supported at all. Don't mistake Solana for the Sola Token that can be stored on a Trezor. No idea what that is.Quote from: PX-Z on June 19, 2022, 10:46:43 PMIsn't ledger will still need user's information  even using amazon for shipping? Although ledger might not be going to include your whole personal info e.g. name, contacts and address to their database but they will still include you to their mailing list (names and emails) for marketing purposes. If you buy the HW from Amazon, it's Amazon who sees your personal and shipping information, not the HW manufacturer. The Amazon reseller has the devices in their possession, so no interaction is required with Ledger. You have to sign up or opt in for the mailing list to be included in it. @Titanium99If you live in the USA, you might want to check out the Foundation Passport Batch 2.n0nce wrote a great review of the first edition of this HW > https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382675.0.

ColdCard if you want the best security, while still having the benefits of a hardware wallet, although it takes some setting up, so if you aren't confident, I'd absolutely recommend Trezor over ColdCard for the complexity issue. There's other alternatives, but these have everything that you'll ever need. The price of a Trezor is decent, whereas you'll be paying a little more for the ColdCard, and depending on where you live might have to pay a hefty shipping bill also. Any hardware wallet that doesn't have a secure element could be compromised, but the chances are still slim. Someone finding your hardware wallet, which should still be locked up under key, and secured physically as much as possible, and at the same time finding someone capable of breaking into it physically, is slim. Although, remember it can be done. That goes for anything though, usually I say if someone has physical access to any of your devices, whether that's your computer or hardware wallet, assume it might've been compromised.",
