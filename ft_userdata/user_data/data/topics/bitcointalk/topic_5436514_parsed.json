And was also feeling maybe its just allowed to count in as major activeness in the board and no doubt we are all trying our best to make the board grow but what igebotz said is true we should all try to reduce the thread duplication and make the board a little more representable and spam free. And my little suggestions is that if the OP of the sees the comments below and we members are going against the thread he should probably lock it or move it elsewhere, especially the ones that are proposed to be off topic",

But to make things clear we should try as much as possible to do data collection and facts of all our comments here on the local board, since this is a local board we have access to raw data and don't depend on social media and all the other mainstream media for data as there are high practices of corruption and fake news, we try to make this board as clean as possible and all that we need to do right now is to increase our activities level, instead of attacking newbies let fine way to put them though and anywhere we can do that we may need to destroy the low-quality thread or duplicate thread with a higher quality and real fact thread that will pass the right information to the general public with the right information.",

Quote_you will be unable to use your Zenith Bank Naira Cards for International Automated Teller Machine {ATM}, in other words, Naira card means Domestic Card in Nigeria. Another clearly similarities, 1. He made mentioned not Naira card and u made mentioned of Domestic Card which I believe one idealogy. 2. Di first thread is toking about di termination of International withdrawal from di Naira Cards and di second thread is toking about the termination of Domestic Cards and fused it in one, so they are all token about card termination (stop). One of the article must have caused di creation of the other article.That means as an experience writer in the forum, you can use it as a comment in the first Thread and it would still suit your purpose. And it would be nice. But no wahala wi nid dem to progress, just dat we r trying 2 clean di board. 🤝. One love",
