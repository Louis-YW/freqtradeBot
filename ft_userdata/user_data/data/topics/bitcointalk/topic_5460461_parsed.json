And for you to easily get verified in any platform don't make deposit before starting to undergo your kyc process, the problem is either they would likely term it to be cheating or violating their ToS always watch very careful whenever you are choosing a casino or gambling site to gamble.",

      "body": "What you are asking is once of a lifetime achievement? I would like to know the minimum amount you think that can get a big multiplier as you suggested. As per my understanding you would never make big if you place a bet with a small amount of $10. The amount should be more than $50 and it should increase systematically otherwise you won't see a big multiplier like you suggested. This is gambling and I have never seen a platform suddenly gifting 100x multiplier unless a promotion is going on. To be part of the promotion you do need to follow T&C. Those are not made for minimum deposit users.",

      "body": "Majorly every casino of today have made KYC verification a mandatory process for their users, so i would say that if you are looking to sign up newly on a casino and try the method of depositing a very minimal amount of money and gunning for a big win, be rest assured that you surely will withdraw your winnings without problems but you must pass kyc verification.A casino site like Stake.com have absolutely no problem with such winning as long as you did not win by cheating or trying to game their system, but according to their new terms which was updated recently, you must pass KYC verification even before you are allowed to deposit money into your account, this is if you are performing a fresh sign up, this is not applicable  to old users.",

I placed a bet on crash and during the first tries I lost but then the rocket kept going on and since I used a small amount from my initial deposit I just left it even after crossing 10x but when it got to 26x I had no choice but to cash out. And during that game the rocket got to 101x and assuming I had left mine I would have been able to cash out and in terms of multiplier that has been my highest so far on bc.game but as for profit I had more in other games due to the fact that I used a larger amount to wager resulting in more profits. Quoteif yes, how much was that amount? and what was the exchange? I really can't recall the exact amount just the multiplier.  As for the exchange I don't really know what you mean by that. And all these I did without undergoing any KYC verification.",

Multiplier is not the main reason but rather the total amount that you won. Some casino set a threshold for a maximum balance to have no KYC account and you will be required to KYC once you exceeded that allowable balance. On most cases, 20K dollars is the typical amount on balance or wager that you will free from KYC.I manage to win x100 before on crazy time using my whole balance. I bet 20$ on Crazy time then I manage to win x100(10x10 bonus multiplier). I withdraw immediate without KYC and the casino I’m using that time is Duelbits.I undergo on KYC after reaching certain VIP level and not when I win huge amount.",

I really don’t know what’s the purpose of this inquiry since most of the casino has gambling license and has a KYC requirements in random basis. A discussion for the potential KYC on a casino that has a clear requirements about is is useless regardless of the amount.On Trustdice, KYC is just ask when a user is subjected for investigation. I think a user can withdraw without KYC if his game results is not shady.",

Winning that much at first is very low anyway, only few gamblers had the chance to win like that.",

If you win big like x100 or x1000 from your small capital like $1 or $2, they might allow you to withdraw without issue if it is a first time.However if you repeatedly win big like a few more times and request multiple withdrawals, I am sure they will pay more attention on your account and check many things. At the end, advanced KYC will be unavoidable.Quoteand what was the exchange? Not exchange, you are talking about gambling sites.",

I managed to turn those 2$ to 100$ and after completing some of their withdrawal requirements i managed to withdraw that amount without issues or having to pass the KYC process.Quote from: GxSTxV on April 17, 2023, 04:31:25 PMThis is probably the first bonus that I have managed to make a profit with and withdraw without any issues, immediately after fulfilling the requirements set by Trustdice. It was so lucky and a long shot that began with a modest $2 bonus and culminated in a $100 withdrawal. That’s surely doesn’t confirm the fact that any bigger amount than 100$ may or may not cause a problem, some casinos will make you verify your account before withdrawing and also manipulate some things in order to let you play more and lose all the profits.Well logically casinos meant to make money for themselves and not the other thing around so you should expect everything from slow processing or account banning.",

But I think if it is a very big amount of money, online casinos won't allow to withdraw money from anonymous participant. That is why the best thing they do is to require KYC to users. For most this is negative because they cannot provide necessary proof such as ID's and paper of residency. But this thing only gives security both to the player and the casino.

That is why this thread will be amazing for shared experiences.If it looks suspicious then I think they will ask for a KYC and might also run further investigation to check if there's an illegality on the gambling activity. Some casinos might also require you to reach their wagering requirement before you will be able to withdraw high amount of prize so you will still be needing to spend more on their site. If that's the case then you better prepare for either a KYC or wagering requirements. They might ask for it for security purposes of their site as well. I haven't heard of anyone from here who have won such huge amount with just small bets yet but I'm sure that there are already lots of silent winning stories with the same situation.",

But regarding Kyc procedures in withdrawal, you have to start with a gambling site that does not imply such feature and push your luck into it. Problem is, the instance of winning such huge amount is uncertain. This would be made possible if you are playing only with platforms having no kyc procedures until you did such thing. With regards to freezing and holding of funds, we cannot help but comply on that one 'coz it is being done to avoid issues such as money laundering.  On my case, I am fine with Kyc compliance 'coz I'm confident with the platform I am engaging myself into.",
