Atop the begging, Dabs is outright lying.  This is an excerpt that of a beg-PM that, upon information and belief, Dabs sent an awful lot less than “30 to 40 years” before February of 2020:Quote from: Wilhelm on June 18, 2022, 06:34:30 AMQuote from: Dabs on September 11, 2019, 12:29:58 PMQuote from: Wilhelm on September 11, 2019, 10:44:29 AMMy stack is significant... but won't let me buy a ship like that .... yet Hey there, hello fellow Wall Observer thread poster ...How significant is it for you?For me, I've lost everything since last year, but somehow managing to survive ... it's not easy.I am hoping against hope that maybe perhaps you'd like to help those less fortunate than you.DabsP.S. I don't know if you've read my little story here the past few months.More recently, Dabs had someone publicly begging on his behalf in the Wall Observer:archive.ph, Wayback:Quote from: goldkingcoiner on June 17, 2022, 08:08:07 PM[...]You could donate it to Dabs if you don't want it. As he told me, he is in an uncomfortable financial situation and could use any and all help. Maybe WO should help him out?Following OP, this thread shall begin with the following posts:Post #2:  My full, unedited PM exchange with Dabs in February 2020.Post #3:  Full quotes of the most relevant public form posts from 2022, which are briefly excerpted above.Post #4:  Reserved to gather any further evidence that may arise.Post #5:  Reserved for my conclusions.  Blank for now; I want to see what other evidence may develop, before taking any trust system action.In February of 2020, I debated whether or not I should immediately publish these PMs.  I was reluctant to do it.  I decided that I didn’t want to ruin Dabs’ reputation over what may be a one-off, grossly uncharacteristic, ridiculously weak moment.  I felt soft-hearted.  That is always a mistake.After Dabs’ other known begging came to my attention, I awoke my account on 2022-06-29 primarily because I could not in conscience let this matter rest.  (I waited until 2022-06-29, the beginning of a new activity period, because I wanted to go back to sleep without raising my activity by more than 14.)  I have still procrastinated on dealing with it.  I cannot put it off anymore:  Every day, people are trusting Dabs for both charitable and business purposes without being informed about his sneaky begging on his own behalf.I encourage anyone else who has received any Dabs begging PMs to post them in this thread.  Same as for any other relevant evidence.  The community has a right to know about this.Don’t think of Dabs:  Think of the poor, starving children on whose behalf he purports to collect charitable donations.  The community, and Dabs’ donors, should have such information available to analyze and to draw the appropriate conclusions.Rarely would I ever encourage a big dump of PMs.  In this case, I believe that it is not only justified, but imperative—an ethical necessity.  As a separate issue, I should remind everyone upfront that there is no forum rule against publishing PMs; you will not get in trouble with forum rules for coming forward to inform the public here.Re: Publicly posting PMsQuote from: theymos on July 14, 2013, 06:34:48 PMThere is no restriction against it. PM = Personal Message, not Private Message.",

Everything is as I left it, except for some dust amounts of BTC that some unknown entity has been regularly depositing to my wallet. I guess this is done to \"mark\" my wallet and track any future movement of my coins. Well, FUCK YOU, whoever you are, your dust will never be moved from there, so feel free to send more...My advice to cold storage HoDLers: refresh your neurons with your passphrase/PIN/whatever you use to protect your wallet, by viewing your cold storage balance every 6 months or so. You never know when your memory may fail and you end up not being able to remember the key(s) to your precious coins.Everything's in order, waiting for the dip to end, and for a slow, organic, healthy UPpity movement to commence.GTCTTWW.This is fine.HoDL.You could donate it to Dabs if you don't want it. As he told me, he is in an uncomfortable financial situation and could use any and all help. Maybe WO should help him out?Is this now acceptable behaviour?  Asking “because reasons” I have been evasively not replying to Jay’s advice that I should DCA $10/week.  Same reasons I had earlier flipped out when bitebits told me to use my fiat to save my BTC (sorry, bitebits... you didn’t know me).  “Uncomfortable financial situation” does not even begin to describe it.  I lack food security going forward.  It is not the first time for me.  I rebuilt my life from scratch around assets that are now gone, when I am in poor health with other difficult circumstances that are nobody’s business but my own.  It was a hell of a struggle.  And the decisive (un)reason why I started getting stupid a few months ago was time pressure.  It was not greediness:  It was neediness.  Young, spry folks can afford to have patience.  I cannot afford to scrimp, save, and build up assets for another five years to be “set for life”—I do not have it in me!  I ran out of time long ago.  I am supposed to be bloody retired, with zero pressure... write code when I can, or read some books... otherwise, just rest.  I need it right now—right now.Dabs has PM-begged in the past.  He has history about that, so this is not even a one-off problem caused by the market crash which affects us all.  It is habitual for him.  I am concerned if he is asking around for money now—while showering merit blindly (including on a merit-abusing bounty spammer account!).If taking up personal donations for “uncomfortable financial situations” is now acceptable behaviour in WO (or anywhere on this forum!), then this is another example of me getting burned for being too principled.  I would have real money now, if not for principles.  It is not only my saying that; I have sometimes had friends yell at me for it.  Now, hey, I am a privacy expert.  I have no qualms about coins from any source—I don’t care if a coin comes straight from the CEO of Chainalysis—no one would ever find where the money goes, LOL.  Oh, no...  I say to burn the precious money in OP_RETURN, or donate it to miners just to get rid of it.  Then, I get to watch someone incite someone else to pass the hat around WO, due to whatever sob story of needy needy needs.Fuck me, I’m stupid.  I like to eat, too.Quote from: death_wish on June 16, 2022, 01:02:03 PMI must emphasize that I have been at pains to avoid any implication whatsoever of seeking money from people when I am clearly in financial desperation.  I am not here for that!  When I made Jr. rank and set a signature, I did not even put in a tip address—as you have in your otherwise unpaid signature, Jay, and as you are entitled to.  I am likewise so entitled; I often spend an absurd amount of time and effort writing posts that people value, on topics unrelated to the state of my personal finances.  I may put up a tip address sometime, but I am especially reluctant to because of my current financial situation.  I do not want for anyone to get the wrong idea about me.  I mercilessly report beggars for violation of forum rules.I am 0% jealous of people who did it right, who now have cash on the orderbooks as their wallets swell with cheap bitcoins.  Congratulations.  But if anyone starts getting free money thrown at him because please sir I have needs, I will be... understandably not amused.  Just to see that is a slap in the face to me.For the record, I am not asking for money.  I will proudly take my reputation to my grave.  I think my point is clear.2019: More of Dabs’ PM-begging:Quote from: Wilhelm on June 18, 2022, 06:34:30 AMQuote from: goldkingcoiner on June 18, 2022, 01:16:06 AMQuote from: death_wish on June 18, 2022, 12:54:10 AMQuote from: goldkingcoiner on June 18, 2022, 12:43:56 AMI was not begging for him, I was asking WO if we could help him out and suggesting any unwanted BTC can go towards that goal. Neither am I sure whether or not he is sincere. But why would an old member with so much trust, merit and history on his profile on Bitcointalk be lying about a despicable situation that he is trying to get out of? And all that for a few peanuts? That does not make sense to me. Report me if you want, you're still a jackass in my book either way.Consistently with the note that I appended at the end of my prior post before I saw your reply:I am not accusing Dabs of lying about whatever situation he claims to be in.  You are inserting that here as your strawman, goldkingcoiner.Some people repeatedly get themselves into desperate situations.  (I know this, all too personally.)  Maybe he was telling the truth before—maybe not.  Maybe he is telling the truth now—maybe not.  It is irrelevant to anything that I said.I said that Dabs has PM-begged before—and now, you are publicly begging on his behalf.  Right in front of someone who is clearly at least as desperate as Dabs, but who is taking the high road.  You’re the jackass.  Don’t you care about my desperate situation?Incidentally, this is why begging is against forum rules.  Lots of people are genuinely in need.So, are you a betting man, goldkingcoiner?Edited to add, for the record:  goldkingcoiner is also lying about his own post when put it in terms of “any unwanted BTC”.  His post started with that, then segued immediately into a general beg.  (Not that asking for “any unwanted BTC” would be ok, but that’s not even what this was.)Quote from: death_wish on June 18, 2022, 12:05:19 AMPost archived in multiple places (archive.ph, Wayback), because it is drastically changed from the original (LoyceV, backup, more backup):Quote from: goldkingcoiner on June 17, 2022, 08:08:07 PM[...]You could donate it to Dabs if you don't want it. As he told me, he is in an uncomfortable financial situation and could use any and all help. Maybe WO should help him out?I said any UNWANTED BTC (In this case accumulated BTC DUST) can go to him as a donation. And then I said he could use any and all help. Help can be in many forms. I am helping him find a job, for example.And then I said maybe WO wants to help? I do not see the part where I begged on his behalf. I wanted to do a good thing for a good man with a green trust reputation who has been doing good deeds on this forum for a long time.Here is Dabs doing charity for kids: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=300631.0is this considered \"begging\" in your book, too? Do you report the hungry children or dabs for \"begging\" for them? Go ahead, report the whole thread.Were you unloved by your parents and now you want everyone to be as miserable as you?Edit:Death_wish, lets see who else can back up your claim of dabs \"begging\" per PMs in the past. If you are making reputation-damaging accusations without providing witness or evidence, that is called slander Libel. An action seen as illegal in many countries. And I will also not let that pass if your accusations are untrue. So: Can anyone other than death_wish confirm prove that dabs has been \"begging\" via pm in the past for personal gain?Checked my PM and I've got a dabs begging PM. Death_wish is correct.I've reported this to the admin because begging is not allowed IMO.I sincerely feel for dabs but I and many have lost it all and had to rebuild.I've lost coins in cryptsy and btce and have never begged.Proof:Quote from: Dabs on September 11, 2019, 12:29:58 PMQuote from: Wilhelm on September 11, 2019, 10:44:29 AMMy stack is significant... but won't let me buy a ship like that .... yet Hey there, hello fellow Wall Observer thread poster ...How significant is it for you?For me, I've lost everything since last year, but somehow managing to survive ... it's not easy.I am hoping against hope that maybe perhaps you'd like to help those less fortunate than you.DabsP.S.

I moved to Canada in 2015. I did all sorts of things crypto / bitcoin, including sigs, escrow transactions, ... I earned my coins, did not really buy them. Had some from before the move. I brought with me my family, wife, 3 kids.Was not employed until 2019. So you can believe I survived on crypto / bitcoin alone for about 4 years, but my earnings from that went to nothing and I had to keep spending and spending, no matter what, just to live. When I got the job, my income from that job was about $2k per month. My expenses for everything including rent, groceries, milk, food was an additional $4k a month.Up until early this year, I still had a stash, and I had some staking alt coins that were providing me just barely that income and then along the way (in 2017-2018) I had incurred debts, which is why I started looking for jobs in 2019 and I got one in Feb 2019.Then covid happened and everything went to hell, but yet I still somehow survived. I was forced to sell everything. I moved to a smaller housing unit, smaller apartment.I've already applied for 100 to 200 jobs in the last month, gotten a few interviews, and just waiting for one of them to send me an offer. I was even willing to relocate to Kuujjuaq (that is near the north pole, but we're already in Canada, so it's not very far away).Now, I am literally at the end of my rope.I know, I am not really your friend, I am a stranger, but we've both been on the forums and you've seen some of my posts, I've seen some of your posts ... to \"invest\" in me would be a gamble, but one I would say is also an asymmetric bet. Because if you help me, and I make it out of my situation alive and successful a few months from now, I'll be able to also help you, either pay you back or pay it forward or something.I am about 10 days from becoming homeless and having to send my kids away. I do not want that to happen. I am desperate but I am not going to do anything illegal or wrong, however I am willing to do anything for you that I can do, even if it is just a promise that I will have to keep for many months or years.No one has been willing to help or can. Those in a position who can, won't.I need financial help. Any amount is appreciated. You know what I need for the immediate future, but I can tell you this: if I get enough so I don't get too stressed out for the next several months, that would be great and allow to focus on improving and fixing my life and maybe earning back more, get a better job, etc. And I will never forget you. A coin or two (even at today's bottom prices) would be a great help. More of course, is better. I actually won't profit from the coins because they will be immediately converted to fiat. Canadian dollars, that is.Let me know if you can. And I am sorry if this is a very sad story and just bothering you.DabsP.S. I do have or involved in some projects, small ones, they are not profitable, but they have a community. I don't have any coins/tokens with them, I am just there for the tech, but they could be a promising future.Quote from: Dabs on June 17, 2022, 01:29:28 PMAh, yes, I would like that. What kind of community manager? is it here on this forum? I have discord on my phone. What kind of pay are we talking about? I'd really like to do it and continue doing it, but my situation is very dire and I am looking for all sorts of ways to fix that. I think you know what I need, I may have told you already. I don't need \"giant amounts\" and I may look like \"overpaid\" at the start to fix my life, but if you've seen me work on other small projects before, even those that did not pay, I have stuck with them for a long time.If I'm not too stressed out, I wouldn't have a problem working with you on all your projects. DabsQuote from: goldkingcoiner on June 17, 2022, 01:23:51 PMYou know, I could introduce you to some of my projects. Perhaps you would be interested as working as a Community Manager? It might not be a giant amount of money but the pay is not bad for the amount of work!Please let me know.",

B.The accusations of “extortion” or “fraud” are beneath reply, save for a simple, detached and objective recitation of facts that can be verified by anyone who cares to read the relevant thread:death_wish positively claimed that he had certain knowledge that Dabs had begged in PMs.  He positively claimed that evidence would soon be public, some way or another.  goldkingcoiner claimed he was “sure” and “more than sure” this was false; and he very rudely insulted death_wish with clear insinuations that he was a liar.  death_wish publicly challenged goldkingcoiner to “put [his] money where [his] mouth is”.death_wish positively claimed, without even a shadow of a doubt, that he had certain knowledge that Dabs had begged in PMs.  He evidently did have such knowledge; and he never concealed the fact that he did.  He positively claimed that evidence would soon arise, and/or that evidence could be brought out on a deadline.If death_wish had said that he was guessing, or that maybe this could be the case, and if he actually had nonpublic knowledge amounting to certainty—that would be an altogether different scenario.  But to the contrary, he explicitly claimed definite knowledge that would be made public.  As it was, the discussion is fairly summarized:  I tell the truth—I challenge you to bet against me that I am a liar.One of the classic five elements of “fraud” is materiality.  death_wish’s identity is immaterial, and it is entirely irrelevant to this thread.  death_wish evidently told the truth.  Two (and counting?) people have disclosed Dabs begging PMs, from 2019 and 2020 respectively.Whereupon:  Keep this thread on-topic.  Thus far, not even one reply from others has been on-topic.  Rather, there is only classic trolling, shooting the messenger, and thread-derailment from people who evidently don’t care about probable-cause evidence to investigate a potential long-con charity-scam.",

      "body": "Flag 2998 created.Due largely to the factors mentioned in this topic, I believe that anyone dealing with Dabs is at a high risk of losing money, and guests would be well-advised to avoid doing so.  This determination is based on concrete red flags which any knowledgeable & reasonable forum user should agree with, and it is not based on the user’s opinions.A non-exclusive summary of some facts in evidence which, when taken together, constitute concrete red flags which any knowledgeable & reasonable forum user should agree with:Dabs runs and actively promotes a thread whereby he takes donations, allegedly for charitable purposes and not for his own benefit.Dabs also runs an escrow service.Dabs has, thus far, three publicly revealed instances of begging behind the scenes in PMs.In one instance of begging, Dabs explicitly lied:  He said that he had not begged “in 30 to 40 years”.  It is now known that he had secretly begged in at least one other recent prior instance, only four months before.  (When else?  How many others?)Dabs sent not less than one of those begs to a total stranger with whom he had no prior connection or contact whatsoever before that day.Dabs sent not less than one of those begs to a total stranger who, unbeknownst to him, was actually poor.  When, with understandable irritation, the recipient of the beg essentially pointed out that it was horrible to beg shamelessly to a poor person who had never begged, Dabs’ response was arrogantly and quite callously to allege that his situation was “harder”.In 2019 and 2020, Dabs alleged that he “lost 95% (maybe more) of [his] coins” and “lost everything since last year”.  In 2022, one of Dabs’ apparent friends publicly claimed that Dabs “is in an uncomfortable financial situation and could use any and all help”.  Although actual, alleged, or putative poverty does not in itself constitute evidence of dishonesty or untrustworthiness, it is a red flag when combined with such behaviours as begging to strangers in PMs.  How far will Dabs go?  What else will he do, if he is in actual or alleged financial desperation?The foregoing list of concrete red flags could already be continued.  It will thus conclude for now, to avoid excessively repetitive redundancy and waste of time.Negative trust feedback will be issued on the same basis.goldkingcoiner:  Tagged (again) for defamation, viz., factually untrue and reputationally damaging statements made with self-evident actual malice.suchmoon:  Nonsense beneath reply, and off-topic.  Some of it also defamatory—but if I were to tag suchmoon for every defamatory statement that she has ever made about me, I would spend all day writing new tags.  Hereby, I will not continue to take thread-derailment bait in the form of personal attacks that ridiculously try to put me on the defensive—when I have done nothing wrong, and I have conscionably brought out evidence about Dabs that people need to know about.Quote from: Pmalek on July 05, 2022, 10:01:01 AMOk, so all this began two years ago, right?No, wrong.  I myself got a beg from Dabs about two and a half years ago, in which he claimed he had not begged “in 30 to 40 years”.  Alarm bells started then—but raised in volume when I saw evidence that he had done the same thing almost three years ago, and he is evidently doing something similar today.When did this start?  Unknown.  It is known that it has not stopped.Quote from: Pmalek on July 05, 2022, 10:01:01 AMDuring that time, Dabs has continued to provide escrow services and collecting money for charities. Has there been one case or accusation in these 2 years where he has stolen money or misused the community's trust and ran away with money that doesn't belong to him?One of the reasons for the popularity of charity scams is that it is very difficult to catch someone who is not a total idiot.If Dabs were to cheat in an escrow deal, I reasonably expect that there would probably be an accusation.  Thus, although his escrow clients and potential clients deserve to be informed about this, that is only my secondary concern here.Do you expect for starving children to raise a scam accusation?  The question is rhetorical.Do the donors and prospective donors of Dabs’ allegedly charitable thread deserve to be informed about this?  It would be obscene to pretend otherwise.Has there ever been an audit of Dabs’ charity by a disinterested third party?  By “disinterested”, I mean someone neutral towards Dabs.  Not one who will search for excuses, as you seem to be doing.Note that I myself am totally neutral towards Dabs—or rather, I was.  I have no interest in defending him.  I also had no grudge against him, no wish to cause him trouble—that, indeed, is why I sat on this for over two years, against my better judgment.I was very reluctant to come forward with this.  The overall response that I am getting shows that my reluctance was misplaced.Among other things, “neutral, disinterested party” means a party who will not refuse to act appropriately on negative evidence.Quote from: Pmalek on July 05, 2022, 10:01:01 AMIf the answer to these questions is no, I wouldn't worry about Dabs being an untrustworthy individual if his reputation has remained spotless since that begging took place.His reputation has obviously not remained “spotless” here.  The beg itself is a spot.  There are now three known instances.  That reasonably raises two questions:  How many more, and what else?“He has been caught doing something very sleazy only a few times, and caught lying about it only once” does not equate to “spotless” in my book.",

Well, we had that incident with the donations that were collected by 3 Bitcointalk members from a few years ago. I am bad with names, but one of them was cabalism I think. Someone started investigating those and found a lack of transparency in how the money was spent. You are free to do the same thing if you suspect something is wrong. Quote from: nullius on July 05, 2022, 02:46:12 PMNot one who will search for excuses, as you seem to be doing. I am not making excuses. I don't know the dude and I don't know you either. I have never spoken or dealt with him in any way. I am asking questions and looking at things objectively. Heck, I think I have spoken to you more than with him (1 time with you, never with him). Weren't you the one who created that thread about Duchess Anastasia who got her identity stolen? I am pretty sure you did. I was the one who translated the thread into Croatian.Quote from: nullius on July 05, 2022, 02:46:12 PMHis reputation has obviously not remained “spotless” here. With spotless I meant in holding and escrowing funds and his charitable work. If you can find proof of wrongdoings there, I don't see why the community would defend him. They didn't defend those involved in the Bitcointalk charity I mentioned above. He wouldn't be the first one who spoiled his reputation for being involved with the wrong kind of people, campaigns, or activities.",
