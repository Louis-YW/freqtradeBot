  "content": "Age has being a factor depreciating some people in vitualising their dreams. They keep saying \"I'm too old to go school\", I'm too old to start a new career\", I'm too old to start a business\". This make them remain stagnant throughout their life time. Age does define success as success comes in all forms. An adage says \"when there is life, there is hope\". That means success can still be actualized at any age so far ones is still healthy. Let's consider the list of 5 successful people who found success and achieve their dreams at above 60s:1. Frank McCourtFrank McCourt decided to start writing at 65 years old. In 1996, McCourt became the talk of the literary world with his impassioned memoir Angela’s Ashes. Detailing a painful and affecting childhood in both Brooklyn and Ireland, Frank was awarded both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award.2. Harry BernsteinHarry Bernstein spent a long life writing in obscurity but finally achieved fame at age 96 for his 2007 memoir, \"The Invisible Wall: A Love Story That Broke Barriers.\"3. Anna MaryAnna Mary Robertson Moses, better known as Grandma Moses, began her prolific painting career at 78. In 2006, one of her paintings sold for $1.2 million.4. Laura IngallsLaura Ingalls Wilder spent her later years writing semi-autobiographical stories using her educated daughter, Rose, as an editor. She published the first in the \"Little House\" books at age 65 in 1932. They soon became children's literary classics and the basis for the TV show \"Little House on the Prairie.\"5. Wally BlumeWally Blume had a long career in the dairy business before starting his own ice cream company, Denali Flavors, at age 57 in 1995. The company reported revenue of $80 million in 2009.Reference: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/24-people-who-became-highly-successful-after-age-40-2015-6%3fampCONCLUSIONDon't let age be an obstacle in achieving your dream. It's not to late. Neglect your age and let passion move you towards achieving your desired dreams.",

Of course, you should not try to become a povermen at 95, or an astronaut at 100 - there simply physiological limitations will become an obstacle, but intelligence can be used at virtually any age and in any condition!",

Most dreams have an age limit before it becomes invalid. For example, if at an age where hearing or sight becomes impaired, a dream of becoming a painter or becoming an interpreter would make no sense. If however, variables of physical concern do not interfere with a dream to be achieved at an odd age, i would say, why not take the leap.",

Practicing a particular sport or learning a complex musical instrument is not an easy task, even for those at a young age.In addition to the people mentioned in the list, there are many who have succeeded in achieving great achievements at an advanced age. I can mention the Messenger of Islam “Muhammad” who started his call to a new religion after he was over forty and succeeded in establishing a new religion that is believed by hundreds of millions around the world today (the third most prevalent religion today).Age is not an obstacle to learning something new. The important thing is that the person has the necessary mental capabilities .",

Humans have the divinely endowed capacity to indulge in a supposedly restless desire.As much as some might regard age as being just a number, I would also like to add that it doesn't apply in all cases. Like if we are to come to the world of sports, especially for a more physical sports like the baseball and football where there is meant to be contact, age place a role there as to your fitness. If we take a look at Cristiano Ronaldo right now, you can't say his a player at his peak anymore compared to his days under Alex Ferguson. His not playing like when he was in his prime anymore and his always in the gym and meets up with trainings most times. Age has come to limit his dreams. Same to other fields as, your body, mind and brain weakens.",

This is really good writing to build motivation in ourselves as readers. If people who are elderly can be successful because they never give up. then we too young people can do it. To achieve success sometimes we have to learn the habits of people who have achieved success itself.The following are habits that are usually owned by successful people.1. Always dare to take risks.2. Continue to hone yourself.3. Clever and careful in reading opportunities.4. Have big and high dreams.5. Successful people are always open to criticism and suggestions.6. Have good administrative skills.7. Work smart and disciplined.8. tenacious and patient9. think positive and have high hopes so you don't give up easily.10. Fully committed.11.

Basically everyone wants to be successful, every success starts from a dream. But dreams will not come true without effort, and every effort made will pay off. The successes obtained by Frank McCourt, Harry Bernstein, Anna Mary, Laura Ingalls and Wally Blume can be used as inspiration for others, because nothing is impossible if we keep fighting and trying.Maybe some of the tips below can encourage anyone who has the desire to succeed, of course, must try to make it happen even though they have experienced failure in the past.Throw away the lazy nature, start to do useful things even on a small scale.Always be optimistic about something difficult, because being optimistic will encourage you to go through something that is considered difficult and make us mentally strong.Always take advantage of the slightest opportunity that is in front of your eyes, everything can be achieved with effort, no matter how difficult the obstacles are, there will be a solution.Success can be achieved with an unyielding attitude, someone who has the intention to succeed, of course, will try to make it happen even though he has to wait a long time.",

Determination, diligence and persistence is what makes the difference. But for those advanced in age to become successful it will require a lot of extra effort compared to the younger ones and most times the stress and humiliation that comes with learning at old age can be discouraging. Encouragement from the younger ones to any old individual learning will go a long way both to keep them focused and to nurture their visions. Most time this senior citizens are more zealous than the younger ones when it comes to learning and because responsibilities are limiting their passions the settle for less",

On the contrary, it is very strange to see books by young writers who talk about their life experiences. If we consider that Kant was also a \"psychologist\", then the books written by him are a gift to humanity for all his works.But if we talk about ordinary older people who deny learning at their age, complaining that they are not able to learn something, or are simply unwilling to do something, thereby they bring the onset of senile dementia closer, although by training the brain you can easily push this disease away.",
