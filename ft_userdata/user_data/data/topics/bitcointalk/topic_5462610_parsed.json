  "content": "Hello I'm going to make this as a topic since I just want to share some knowledge for everyone that considering making a life by being a day trader in crypto.Since you visited this topic I'm guessing you already have an account on some crypto exchange like binance so fast forward to the topic.So how to be a day trader? 1. Setup your budget - you need atleast $200 (think this as a tuition fee to learn how to trade) to start with. This can give you a lot of capabilities to workaround the sweetspot of trading.2. Learn how  to use the right leverage - In this one you're using your funds as collateral and you're basically borrowing from the trading platform your using. Setting a high leverage means you're increasing your profit potential and quick returns but setting it also has a downside which is high risk of loss and your funds can be burn due to liquidationSetting a low leverage (2x or 5x) means low profit from it but you're minimizing your risk facing a losses and also it allows you to focus on long term growth as a trader3. Use the right indicators for you - This one it depends what will work for you but let me tell you the basic indicators that I use as a daily trader.MACD Indicator - This one has been effective on me, I've been using this one since 2020 you can lookup and watch some videos about this indicator. I suggest you use this with the coin with a minimal volatility. So you can setup a position if you'll go for long/short.  This indicator is a powerful tool that can tell you identifying potential trend reversals. It's also simple and Visual friendly since you're just looking for a two lines that crossing together from time to time. This is helpful also on Identifying the trend changes or change of momentum with the price 4. Using the right graph - I suggest you choose the candle sticks so you can see the patterns that's being made and put it on a 4h time frame. regarding to the patterns you can look it up also on web so you can study different kinds of candle stick pattern. Once you get used to it invest another $200 as a starting capital. Remember the first $200 funds you used for is for studying trading so expect to lose it all at first so stick to low leverage so you can utilized it and learn a lot from it. Setup your target income per day for me I'm currently happy making $300 a day since it covers my daily life essentials and needs I'm living outside the US so the cost of living in my country is pretty cheap and $300 is a lot already. Also Setup your target loss per day for me I'm okay with losing $100 a day but that's it once I lose that $100. I will go outside and get some fresh air and come back once my mind is clear again remember once you're losing you tend to increase your leverage which is bad It will cost you a lot. Trust me I've been there before. So that's it, hope this will help you from being a future trader. Good luck!",

So I think I can share some knowledge and there's nothing wrong encouraging someone who wants to make a living by being a day trader. the $200 is the budget I used for futures trading before and it actually helps me a lot when I was starting before since you can make an errors when you're new to trading that's the reason why I said that think of it as a fee for learning something new just like when you're going to a university, you need to pay to earn some knowledge. This is just a small step for being a day trader so I think nothing's wrong with it? Regarding the indicators there's a lot they can use I just share what works for me up until now. About the strategy they can learn it watching a lot of videos about indicators and patterns QuoteMACD Indicator - This one has been effective on me, I've been using this one since 2020 you can lookup and watch some videos about this indicator.

Demo account is not necessary because you can open future trading with less than $10. When I started, I used less than $2 to see how it is working. Among all exchanges that I know, I only saw demo on OKX and which I do not like how it is to the real trading look. Some traders are not professional and continue to lose in trading.

I do not deny that I have also ever traded on the futures market. And well I came to the conclusion that I wasn't ready. Because to enter futures trading, I think we have to have a pretty good level of analysis. And it would be better for me to become proficient in spot trading first. if i was pretty good at spot trading. then maybe I'll consider trying futures trading again. Thank you for sharing futures trading tips and strategies here. I hope I can also become a reliable trader like you in the future.",

      "body": "Haha whether it's low or High the leverage sucks, in my view if you have lower capital then try to hold your funds in good assets it will take time to build a good portfolio and capital amount but it is the safest and most efficient approach. I use to recommend to my all fellow to avoid Levrage trade even if you have a decent portfolio and capital amount. You should follow the slow and straightforward path. Shortcuts are not good for your funds.In future trade, the trader only learns about profit making which is our main goal as well but sometimes a single wrong trade can evenly destroy your trading career and I have seen people committing suicides on the wrong trades most of the incidents were reported on the Luna crash. More evenly sticking to the topic whether than giving my views on the Leverage trade point is for person who has 200$ cant be recommended to trade in Levrage lose all.",

All exchanges with futures trading almost entirely allow the minimum amount to open a position to be much lower (average $10).I think you just need to mention the minimum cap requirement for the average beginner, or change the word \"you need\" to \"I was\", because after all that number is not a fixed suggestion.",

So what happens if loose the first, second, third, fourth and fifth $200 each, that means he would be loosing $200 x 5= $1,000 , before even crawling because he is going to loose plenty more of it before he gets to his feet.

So I want to enlighten that this kind of trading will not only amplify your profits and also the losses which means no one should try it unless they are capable of pay back the loss.Instead of taking the short cut and make some huge money in short term with high risk I think the better alternative is to stick with the low risk spot trading still anyone who is having goof trading skills can multiply their capital in no time and also low risk means they can do it at their best of interest since no need to worry about paying back if they loss. So over time gradually they will be in a better place financially.",

Usually, we will choose the coins in the top 10 list but if we have skills in analyzing the coins, we can choose other coins to trade.I'm waiting for your lesson about future trading as it seems you are already familiar with futures trading. And maybe you can tell how the selection of coins is, what it takes to find coins to trade, etc.",

I didn’t know that not everybody here is already know how to trade since this is a trading discussion board so I assumed that everybody already knows that trading is risky. I created this topic so we can all discuss our own opinion and what we’re using to get a good portfolio in trading. This is not the case, but you are not only talking about trading, but daily trading with leverage, which is very dangerous for those who have a background in trading, let alone beginners who may read your post.Also, updating your post with some pictures will be useful, although I advise you to start with regular and daily trading instead of using leverage and margin.",
