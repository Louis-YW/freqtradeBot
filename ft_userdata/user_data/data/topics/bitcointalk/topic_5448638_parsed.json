Before choosing this, you must weigh your business's size as offers/benefits vary with the industry's competition. Processors are somewhat secure but nothing on the internet is 100% secure, you should know that, and they always have almost the same transaction fees.Nonetheless, you can trust all the ones listed below, still, you have to research each one based on what you want for your business as they have their varied services even beyond the mere acceptance and processing of your crypto. Your location matters too.1. Bitpay2. Coinbase commerce3. Binance pay4. Alfacoins5 Coingate",

Options are a good thing so I don't mind having that, maybe when I one, I might try paying that way.",

Why would you limit yourself to one choice though? I mean, you can simply use two or three payment gateway depending on what customers you serve. Limiting to Binance Pay or something similar that only accepts payments from one app is not really the best choice, especially if you want to deal with customers who value their privacy. On top of that, an open-source and self-hosted solution is better in terms of control and fees afaik. That being said, I guess tho who want to use instant crypto payments probably don't care that much about which payment gateway you use. CMIIW.",

Options are a good thing so I don't mind having that, maybe when I one, I might try paying that way.Of course, there are many other options available as well, such as BitPay or Coinbase Commerce, to name a few. But that doesn't mean Binance Pay is a less acceptable option. Let's say that you as a merchant already have a verified account with Binance, it makes sense to use their payment processor service instead of opening and verifying an account with another company. In addition, Binance Pay offers some unique benefits such as zero fees, which can be appealing to businesses looking to save on processing costs.However, despite Binance being a known player in the crypto industry, their payment processing service is still relatively new and may not have the same level of adoption as more established processors. It's always a good idea to do your due diligence and research the pros and cons of each option before making a decision.Quote from: joniboini on April 13, 2023, 11:48:35 AMWhy would you limit yourself to one choice though?

CMIIW.To me, using multiple payment processors seems like an unnecessary inconvenience. If the payment processors do not provide any additional advantages, why bother integrating them? As you mentioned, most customers are likely not concerned about which payment gateway you utilize as long as the payment process is seamless. It's best to select a payment processor that is compatible with all wallet types and offers the best options for the merchant, and stick to it.",
