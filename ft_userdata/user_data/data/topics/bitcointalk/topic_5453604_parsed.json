I did not know how to:PostReply postPaste linksEmbed imagesIn a nutshell I spent days trying to figure out how to actually engage, although I read a lot of pinned messages (based on advice I got earlier) and knew what I should do, put doing it properly was a herculean task. I had to seek help from a friend and all he showed me was how to reply posts and he too briefed me that he faced a lot of challenges before finding out how to reply posts by intuition. I knew there would be an assistant somewhere and started searching for it myself. Little did I know that the pre-requisites help I've been looking for was clearly spelt out in the help navigation, All thanks to the forum moderators that provided such a wonderful guide for us. I've consumed that content repeatedly and wouldn't fail to fall back to it in event of further difficulties. It is possible that some newbies like me had given up when faced with these simple challenges trying to engage. Subsequently, I advice all freshers to access the help navigation.It assisted me in a great way and you'll be glad you visited it as it properly explains the forum involvement architecture.",

I have made a post of this nature sharing how I figured out a solution but it wasn't encouraged rather senior mates gave examples of posts of such nature, I don't really know if sharing such a post is bad or good but it seems to me that I should just keep what ever I discover to my self and not share it or create a thread of it. There are some changes that have been made in the forum that is not included in the help e.g Imgur is not longer used in the forum, so have it at the back of your mind.

      "body": "I suppose that newbies can have difficulties finding a forum only if they have never used this way of communicating with people, namely, if they do not understand what forums are. This forum is equivalent; like others, it does not differ much from each other. Yes, the topic of the forum is different, and the rules are slightly different, but one thing is important in all forums: communication and discussion of any topic. What can be difficult, I do not understand. Just read and communicate; do not burden yourself with problems because you may be different from other members of the forum somewhere. We are all different. On the contrary, if a person pretends to be knowledgeable at a time when he is not, he will once again attract attention to himself, and only after that may there be an understanding that the forum is aggressive towards newbies.The best thing that should be in the user who came to this forum is his sincerity and interest in Bitcoin.",

Every post has a reply icon and a text box for messages which shows preview and submit. Very simple. If you want to start a new topic, at the top of every board is New Topic icon.QuotePaste linksThis also is the simplest thing anyone can do. I mean there is no tutorials in copying and pasting a link.QuoteEmbed imagesThis could be the only place a little guidance is need because a third party app is needed to upload images in the forum. One simple method newbies don't use is to quote an already well formated post of a senior member and reveal the structure they used, then learn from it.Note: You can make posts without using artificial colours, to much coloration will make people pay less attention to your post.",
