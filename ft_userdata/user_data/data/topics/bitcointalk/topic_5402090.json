  "content": "Quote from:   ➥ Your private Bitcoin Wallet for desktop [Wasabi Website] & [Thread]  ➥ Live statistics [Here] & [list of participants]The guys from the Wasabi team agreed with me that it is on Bitcointalk that you can get the most constructive feedback, so I am looking for forum users whose reviews will potentially help improve Wasabi. I expect each of the accepted participants to install the desktop version of the Wallet and write a deployed review of at least 1000 characters. Also, feel free to run the wallet in different modes, then it will be easier for you to present ideas on how to improve usability.Payment:➥ Payments will be processed as reviews are received.➥ Full/Sr/Hero/Legendary (3x) - 0.002 btc/review (one-time payment).➥ You will have at least 3 weeks to edit your post or publish a new one (starting June 27th.).Rules:➥ Post a review in this thread / Be constructive!➥ Posts that do not carry a semantic load or posts whose content is less than 1000 characters will not be paid.➥ Suggestions, ideas, criticism are welcome only if it's not abstract.➥ I reserve the right to change the rules and disqualify any review and any participant for any reason.➥ Only 1 review per user / can't believe I'm writing this obvious note.➥ In the second post you will see your name if you have been accepted (I will announce the list of those accepted on June 27th).Download for Desktop                                                [/list][/list]Code:Or build it from source:https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi#build-from-source-codePGP (6FB3 872B 5D42 292F 5992 0797 8563 4832 8949 861E)",
