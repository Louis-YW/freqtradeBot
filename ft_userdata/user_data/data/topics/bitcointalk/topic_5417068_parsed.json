Anyway thank you again No problem, I hope I was helpful.¬† That's one of the reasons I use and recommend Bisq; no KYC, no accounts to register.¬† The software works over the tor network and uses a peer to peer connection so there are no servers that store any of your personal information.¬† Essentially that's the same way bitcoin works, so it's nice to have a trading platform that adheres to the same philosophy.¬† Best of luck.",
