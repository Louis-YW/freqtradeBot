  "content": "Hello dear Bitcointalk community,After a long time, I'm back and I'm here! Let me made a quick summarize what I do while I'm not active in here for about two years.In last two years, I already stop trading in alt coins and I start to made a research and trade NFT's in Solana ecosystem. After Solana, I try to trade degen NFT's in Ethereal but these trades are not good and go bankrupt. It's a very tiny story about my last two years in crypto industry. I know, you're going to ask me why did you mentioned these and why are you here? Here is the answer;Before I became inactive in here I'm a very active user in Turkish local form. I already created very beneficial topics in local form. While I'm producing these topics, I also joined few signature campaigns to earn a pocket money. After few months, I start to write messages in general forums than the worst scenario happens... Because of my comment in Vispilio's signature management, Lauda and JollyGood leave me red trust and my membership becomes like a bin. So, here is my request;As everyone can see, Vispilio is not scammed anyone and I had red trust because of my comment in his topic. So, I want to remove these unfair red trusts from my profile and join few signature campaigns to earn some pocket money while I'm producing new topics and comments. Please review these red trusts and give me one more change to become more active and effective member. Please consider my old activity in local forum and general forum in past. Now, I can speak better English than before, so please remove my red trusts.Thank you for your empath, time and decision.Best regards,BitcoinTurk",

When you examine the comment made here and the profile of the commented person, it is clearly seen that I am faced with an unfair red trust notice. For this reason, is it possible to remove this red trust any way?Quote from: avp2306 on October 22, 2022, 12:56:10 AMAsking sympathy to other people will not help your case since it will just trigger not to do it by the people who put a red trust to you.  Much better if you discuss this matter privately to the person who left you negative trust since if you are sincere on your intentions is pure then he might forgive you.I know, but everyone should think this case in their case because there is unfair red trust notification is sender by DT member. I'll try to contact with him to solve this.EDIT: Of course, he's blocked me for sending a personal message that's why I cannot contact with him from private message. I don't want to open a new account in here to have a new red trust because of multiple account. How can I solve this issue without reaching him?",

I mean, there's a reason why campaigns have a rule \"negative valid DT trust is not allowed\" - if some spamming painter reaches DT2 then that could cause problems for a lot of people.To give a practical example, my trust settings show yahoo himself as +31/=2/-1, the sole negative comes from Quickseller with comment \"running high-risk escrow service\" () - If suddenly Quickseller became DT again, that wouldn't exclude him from campaigns either.",

About Lauda's negative trust, he is no more active and you do not have to be worries about that. If you want to join a campaign, post good and continue to contribute to the community here with gold post. Always check service board to know if there is any offer, apply if there is any from new or existing campaigns. You can use the telegram bot to track already existing campaigns and your forum email for new topics on service board which can be about new campaign.",

But since you only mention those 2 member (rather than all 5 members who gave you negative feedback), theoretically you can ask DT member to exclude those 2 members from DT system. But i doubt it'll happen.I think OP is considering possible DT member's feedback. I looked at his feedback received history. Lauda and JollyGood seems two users who can be in the DT list considering their history. Possibility for others are very little unless some of them start actively contributing to the reputation system and in the future their feedback starts showing up as trusted feedback.Everyone forgot about Lauda because he left the forum but JollyGood is still active and according to my study few months ago I found most of the negative feedback left by him are out of harsh judgement or retaliation. He even leveraged his DT power not to pay a user for the work that user has done for him instead he left a negative feedback to that user to stop his mouth. Eventually the user left the forum.Edit:QuoteTrust list for: starmyc (Trust:  +1 / =0 / -1) (130 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP) (created 2022-10-22_Sat_05.08h)Back to indexstarmyc Trusts these users' judgement:-starmyc Distrusts these users' judgement:-starmyc's judgement is Trusted by:1.

But seems like distrust from nutildah and of course JollyGood himself actually took  down starmyc from trust network so the feedback is not visible anymore under default trust.If adding removing a user from trust list truly based on their feedback leaving accuracy then I don't understand which feedback from starmyc was wrong that he was distrusted by two DT members?Loycev, the trust list on your loyce.club used to show weekly or I guess monthly history of a users trust activity. But it turns out the feature is not there anymore. I am guessing you removed it. This was helpful to check when a user added or removed another user in their trust list.",

The fact that your trust rating is low with some members does not mean you aren't trustworthy; it just means that there have been some concerns raised about your behavior or conduct, and it can be changed if you work hard to improve it. You haven't contributed much to the forum in recent months - more than a year has passed since your last post - and although there are many good reasons why you might not have posted in so long, this is a clear indicator that you are not being an active member of the community and this is one of the main reasons why you cannot participate in signature campaigns or other forms of advertising on bitcointalk. Every campaign manager will have a different set of rules for their campaigns, but the majority will require that you post regularly on bitcointalk and will be looking for the same thing: a high-quality posts with good content. Your trust rating has very little to do with this.",

Please consider my old activity in local forum and general forum in past. Now, I can speak better English than before, so please remove my red trusts.Hi BitcoinTurk, Have you tried to contact the person who has left the negative trust in you eg: Lauda as well as JollyGood who has given you negative trust? If yes, then if they do not want to remove then nothing to do. But if you have not yet contacted them then try to convince them about the reality.",
