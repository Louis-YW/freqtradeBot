Other than showing the percentage of the current value from ATH, maybe you can add how much the coins need to pump to reach ATH, how likely it will break new ATH, how long it stays below ATH, and so on. At the very least, it should provide more interesting data to talk about.",

      "body": "A good application if anyone does not want to use CMC to find what would have been the portfolio balance at the time of ATH. That, for me, would be depressing to watch as it would remind me of my mistake of exiting before time. Adding a few more features like others have mentioned would be interesting for visitors. I can suggest two features like displaying the current value of the portfolio, if possible the projected USD value of the same portfolio in the current market condition. Comparison with the present value and ATH would be another feature that can be helpful, where apart from displaying the comparison USD value you can output the number of days when the last ATH happened for individual crypto.",

But you overestimate potential users if you think that most of them will create an excel in order to calculate that outcome.I agree that it would be advisable to add more features to the website, but this is how lean projects work: you don't wait until you built a high-end car in order to sell it, you start with a scooter which still works, instead.So, from that perspective, there is nothing wrong with the project/experiment. In fact, I think that this is a recurrent question between newbies, that a couple of friends of mine asked me in the past: how much would x be worth if it hit an ATH? they didn't even know coinmarketcap lol. So yes, your service makes sense, another thing is how you increase awareness on it so you generate traffic and monetise it (if that's your aim).",

I have that already. Seems like it would be the same amount of work as inputting the data into an excel sheet. Instead of manual input, perhaps you could just input wallet addresses and let the calculation take it from there? then the only work you would need to do is input the wallet address instead, and it calculates from what you have in your wallet. That saves time and work and would be a vast improvement over the current calculator.",

      "body": "The site is very simple and easy to use, and it is free, which is good, but on what basis is ATH calculated? Is the ATH taken for Bitcoin or each coin individually?In the current form of the site, I do not think that it has much benefit, but it can be improved a little by adding more data and comparison, for example, showing the current value of the assets and comparing it with the value in the case of ATH. It would also be interesting to add a comparison in the opposite case, i.e. the bottom.Anyway, thanks for this tool.",

I have thought about the relevance considering factors bodering on volatility and time and implementation of project roadmap. All of these vary with projects and are not relatable from a single stanpoint. But a percentage decrease from an ATH is relatable as people will want to know what percentage of losses they have incurred or will incure.Systems are actually designed to make things easier and faster and not to make things more complex and complicated. In this case I see a further case of complication but its not to discourage OP though.",

But a percentage decrease from an ATH is relatable as people will want to know what percentage of losses they have incurred or will incure.The ATH calculation is useful for predicting what range the end-of-cycle correction will be, meaning how far we will reach in 2026, as it is expected to be near 69 thousand dollars, meaning that we will be between 59 and 79. Therefore, these calculations are not necessary in the bull market due to the high probability that we will exceed that range within the next 12 months and then all the upcoming predictions are just probabilities because we do not know where the price will go.Right now it's useless.",

Because if that's the case, then the tool will be very limited. Besides, tools like portfolio monitoring are readily available if that's what they need. I'm pretty sure everyone is okay with inputting their wallet address, or if that's not fine for them they can manually add each token/coin easily.I've given my suggestion above, and others also did it. However, It is kinda hard to suggest more features if OP doesn't even respond to suggestions. On the other hand, he probably just does this as a hobby and doesn't want to monetize it, in which case he can do whatever he wants to.",
