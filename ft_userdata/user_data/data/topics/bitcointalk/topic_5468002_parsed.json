If you find two well-paying jobs, you might be able to make it in half the time.Although this story of yours seems to me to be a fabrication, all just to promote your video - but if there is even a little truth in what you wrote, your chances are minimal that you will earn so much money sitting in front of your computer and posting videos on forums.",

I believe that his story is true since he showed us the borrowed money from his bank along with all the transactions from the exchanger and the scam platform he got scammed by. Unfortunately all of this happened due to his greed as you said. If he had just searched for details about what he was doing or questioned why that guy didn't apply that arbitrage strategy instead of sharing it with a stranger, he would have easily realized he was getting scammed. Scammers target people who combine greed with little knowledge about crypto which they think it’s the easiest way to get rich.We have similar cases and warnings about these types of scam exchanges in this section i wonder why you didn’t search here before getting scammed.These kind of scam CEX offer different prices, either higher or lower than any other place in the market, to trick you into signing up, buying coins or tokens in a legit exchanger and attempting to sell them on that fake exchanger. At first you may be able to withdraw small sums, but as soon as you make a bigger deposit you get scammed.Your monthly salary of $1,000 is considered good in Vietnam and making you relatively wealthy. This means you can start a project or a business to begin paying off your debts to the bank and your friends. It's a valuable lesson for everyone to learn from your story but don’t wait anyone to help you probably the opposite and some people will contact you and try to scam you again so be careful.I'm sorry for what happened to you but glad to see you are staying strong.",

Second borrowing money for trading is always bad especially when you couldn't returned in case of lost.What message you want to gives, if you are the real person who scammed? or just helping him with sharing? Mainly, it's because of greed. When a victim is already shown to be gullible, these scammers will be patient on them at least with this scamming tactic that's been done to him. They will take his trust and build rapport through conversations and with little withdrawals that he'll request. And when they think that they've found a gold mine, they will not be vocal about it until they are scammed. Sorry for OP but if the amount is for real, that's a huge mistake that you've made and all you need to do is to start over. There's still always hope for it but it is unlikely you'll recover that money from the person who scammed and fooled you.",

And I hope that your friends from whom you borrowed the money are okay, and I hope that you will make every effort to return the loans to them, as they are not at fault in this. The police claim that it is very difficult to return the money. Does this indicate that you do not have enough information about this scammer? Did this scammer mistakenly provide sensitive information about himself or anything else that could be used??----------When I saw the screenshot of your video, I thought it was the scammer \"Smith Gabriella\" who DMed You first, but I found out that you were the one who started the DM. {What is the explanation for this?)Yes, I agree with what you wrote below on the screenshot of your video. I can say that I receive 2-3 accounts throughout the week from scammers who have pictures and names of women and start messaging me and then try to build trust, but I know their methods, so I block and report without even responding to them.
