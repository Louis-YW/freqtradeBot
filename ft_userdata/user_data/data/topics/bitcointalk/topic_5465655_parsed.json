($8 trillion market cap means 16x, even though the global GDP has increased by more than 25% since 2015: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)",

I just learned the research if blockchain is implemented that can save a lot of educational data. for example in college, there's a lot of data that they have to store manually on PCs and libraries but sometimes it is not effective, because the Old data is often deleted if any new data comes to be saved. So if blockchain technology is implemented for purpose, I really sure the data will be forever on blockchain and can be checked it by the public.",

This can reduce energy costs and carbon emissions.https://www.wired.co.uk/article/blockchain-energyEntertainment: Blockchain can enable the creation and distribution of digital content, such as music, art, and games, that can be owned and monetized by the creators and consumers.

Blockchain is not something magical that can be applied to any field and suddenly it gets improved. Instead blockchain is a very specific database type that only works fine in a specific scenario. Namely as the ledger for a decentralized payment system. Using it elsewhere not only makes no sense but also will bring out the downsides of using blockchain. Not to mention that majority of cases that are usually mentioned (and are in some of the links in OP) such as healtcare should not even be decentralized to begin with! Instead they need a controlled centralized database that can be accessed after going through different \"filters\".",

Even in bitcoin we have another \"normal\" database (a simple key-value db) called UTXO-set or ChainState to use the blockchain.It is not the blockchain that makes bitcoin what it is. There are a lot of things from PoW to the distributed nodes that make it work. The problem with others is that they think they can just pull out one aspect (the blockchain) and gain all the benefits.",

Although schools and universities have their own databases where they store every piece of information that they want, I believe that if someone has access to log onto that database, they can alter or edit any information on that database, but with the use of blockchain, information stored on blocks cannot be deleted.

I don't know what you implied with alternatives for blockchain but I guess one of them is DAG.Six alternatives to blockchain for business to consider. In that article, one of them is DAG but so far it has yet been used too popular like blockchain ledgers and networks like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake.",
