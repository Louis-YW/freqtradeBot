  "content": "So you know how some exchanges will freeze or reject \"tainted\" bitcoin? Bitcoin from coinjoins, or bitcoin known to be associated with silk road 'type' places? What if someone fed up with not being able to offload their tainted bitcoins send small amounts of theirs to public addresses that have lots of bitcoin. Would doing that, taint those larger addresses if those whales then sent their bitcoin to an exchange like Coinbase? How does it work, do these exchanges treat every wallet connected with a tainted wallet as also tainted or do they treat them as separate individuals? Meaning a tainted bitcoin wallet could just open a new fresh bitcoin wallet and transfer their tainted bitcoins to that new fresh wallet as like a new identity... since you know it could very well be a new totally different person. You wouldn't know.",

Or split the coins and send in like 5 to 10 different transactions to address you owned and split it the more, wait for like hours or even days before each transaction, the longer the better.Quote from: Anonohmon on July 05, 2022, 10:06:33 PMWould doing that, taint those larger addresses if those whales then sent their bitcoin to an exchange like Coinbase? Coinbase is a centralized exchange and the coin will be seized and ID documents will be required.Quote from: Anonohmon on July 05, 2022, 10:06:33 PMHow does it work, do these exchanges treat every wallet connected with a tainted wallet as also tainted or do they treat them as separate individuals? No. Addresses. But it is possible that many addresses can be connected together. Another is a centralized server of a SPV wallet linking many addresses of the same wallet together and also with the IP address used.Do not get yourself in anything that is illegal, this is just a means to avoid your coin to be seen as tainted.",

Weren't Bitcoin mixers created with the sole purpose of \"cleaning\" tainted coins?Why would a criminal waste all his tainted coins, when he could just clean them by using a Bitcoin mixer?I'm no expert in this field, but it doesn't make any sense to me. If some random criminal sent you a thousand \"dirty dollars\" (without any reason whatsoever) would that make you a criminal as well? You did absolutely nothing and you have no fault(and you can prove that in court), who is going to blame you? I'm sure that the authorities and the centralized cryptocurrency exchanges aren't that dumb.Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

Bitcoin from coinjoins, or bitcoin known to be associated with silk road 'type' places? First of all there is no such thing as \"tainted bitcoins\". That is a fake term that some companies came up with so that they could make money by calling some coins \"tainted\".Secondly your list contains the obvious cases, these companies working as \"blockchain analysis\" would consider arbitrary outputs as \"tainted\" too. For example they have marked a lot of coins coming out of exchanges as tainted too!QuoteWhat if someone fed up with not being able to offload their tainted bitcoins send small amounts of theirs to public addresses that have lots of bitcoin. Would doing that, taint those larger addresses if those whales then sent their bitcoin to an exchange like Coinbase? Those companies I told you about don't really check the address, they check the outputs so it doesn't matter if the address received some so called \"tainted\" coins, if the transaction doesn't spend them it should be fine. Although as I said, their coins may still be marked arbitrarily!QuoteMeaning a tainted bitcoin wallet could just open a new fresh bitcoin wallet and transfer their tainted bitcoins to that new fresh wallet as like a new identity.There is a much better solution which is to stop using centralized services that freeze your account arbitrarily.",
