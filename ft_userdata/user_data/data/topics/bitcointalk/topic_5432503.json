      "body": "dkbit98 is right. Once the site is up and running, transparent information about the liquidity and the individual coin balances should be shown at all times. That way users won't even have to try to swap more than the site can handle. The website was registered 3 days ago and the exchange service doesn't work yet. I tried entering some random addresses from the internet and blockchain explorers and I am getting internal server errors when clicking on buy or sell.",

Sorry about that, was still in active development. I did a lot of work on the site today and it should be ready, check it out!",

      "body": "Seems better now when I can see the maximum amount I can exchange. The current liquidity is 4.7 XMR. I assume this number gets updated in real time as people remove and add liquidity to XMR and BTC, right?One thing I noticed is that the exchange requires 6 on-chain confirmations for Bitcoin. This might be too much. I know that many exchanges have similar standards, but there really is no reason that people who conduct small trades of $50 or $100 have to wait that long for the 6th confirmation. If you are unlucky, this might take 2 hours or so. Maybe you can take this number down to 2 or 3.   Try to add a dark mode. It's more pleasant to look at.",

Your newest update requires people to only use the dark mode, and I don't see a button to change to the light version for those who prefer that.I have also noticed the Register tab now. I don't think it was there before. What advantages are there for users who sign up to Fryx Finance? What's the difference between a registered and non-registered trade?",

Noted, I'll add the option to select dark or light theme sometime in the future.If you register an account, you can set limit orders on the order book, and withdraw after making several trades.Without registering an account it does just one market order and then withdrawal.The account is for more advanced traders, whereas not using account is for those who just want a single quick and convenient trade.",
