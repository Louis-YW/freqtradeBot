Even 1 sat is relevant. If bitcoin become scarce and its price increases, the quantity that individuals will purchase will be small because of the high price but everything will be normal as usual as they will still be able to purchase the right amount that they want to purchase.",

The only problem is that it will make the price of bitcoin to be more expensive because the price increases overtime with limited supply and high demand. This is why you should start accumulating yours because in future bitcoin price will be very expensive for the poor and average to afford, only the rich and government will be able to buy bitcoin by then. Now is the opportunity for pleb like us to fill up our bags at cheaper rate and hodli for long.",

      "body": "Why do people act like the more the bitcoin price increases, the more its difficult for normal folks to buy? The price of a bitcoin is pretty much as expensive as it is right now, but people still buy. Regular folks are accumulating Bitcoin with the little they have. Bitcoin grows in percentages. If bitcoin increases by 10% you who bought with $100 and the other person that bought with $1 million both have the same percentage increase. You do not make the same amount of profit, but the percentage is the same. So if Bitcoin gets to $1 million for one bitcoin, it would be no different from how it is today. Those who can afford to buy 1btc or more will buy and those who can't will buy the amount they can buy. It doesn't change anything. Also, the higher the Bitcoin price, the lesser bitcoin rich people can afford. If bitcoin gets to a million dollars by 2140, they won't be able to buy as much as they buy today. So they're not going to buy everything and even if they want to, the more they demand bitcoin the more the price increases.",

Then the value of Bitcoin will increase exceedingly and I guess that is where Bitcoin will not only represent a digital gold as always be figured but be acted as a global treasure.Of course future investors will be able to buy but not going to be as easy as it is today due to the limited 21M supplieshas been mined.Considering how miners would earned rewards on the  Blockchain, since the total invented coins has been mined and earned, the miners would hence begin to earn from transaction fees. I am then believed that the current transaction fees is being on accumulations for future use for miners.For future investors, of course holders would always sell as today's because Bitcoin is a currency ought to be used to solve our financial need. So definitely holders and would definitely sell and users would always want to buy but though going to be more competitive and increase in values compared to today.",

But the good news is that Bitcoin can be bought in bits, so it will still be available to buy some. Just like other scarce commodities people will still want to sell their Bitcoin at a given period so there will always be market liquidity. That is why we are encouraged to have a long term plan for our Bitcoin hodling because the time will come when common men will find it difficult to hold a significant amount. Don't always rush to sell all your hodling if you don't necessarily have need for the money, always plan for the future.",

Of course, we haven't even realized a 1 million dollars price yet but there's over a century left until this happens.",

This scarcity could increase demand and pushes prices higher but it might also make bitcoin less practical for smaller transactions if prices become too high. for all bitcoin to be completely mined to anywhere close to the 21 bitcoin that is in circulation, it means that all bitcoin holders won't be ready to trade bitcoin at all but will prefer to hold and leave bitcoin in their storage. the possibility of that happening is to me very slim because bitcoin will continue to circulate every day and the more people are ready to buy bitcoin, the more others will be willing to sell their bitcoin also which will keep the flow of bitcoin in circulation never ending.before the 21 million bitcoins will be exhausted, some of the current holders will want to sell a portion to others who might be making use of it for daily trading purposes. bitcoin traders are always in the market and will continue to be ready for trading of bitcoin any day and anytime regardless of how scarce bitcoin becomes in the future due to basically an increase in it price. bitcoin is still in use as a payment option in different platforms and that in itself is going to keep bitcoin flowing across old and new users of bitcoin till the future that is coming.",

I believe, it’s unrealistic to think that Bitcoin's price will increase simply because investors are holding onto it, nope.. the main driver of Bitcoin’s price is demand, and that demand comes primarily from people using Bitcoin in their daily lives, not just from big investors who buy and hold.As long as exchanges maintain good liquidity, there won’t be any issues with daily transactions. Plus, investors aren’t naive; most of them are seasoned experts who understand how to balance supply and demand without undermining Bitcoin’s core purpose: decentralized transactions. The point is, more transactions lead to a more stable network, which ultimately drives greater adoption and long-term growth.",
