If you do that, your shop might have few to zero customers. But if you accept Bitcoin payment alongside fiat payment, card payments, and other online payment options, then there's no problem and you are probably good to go. The mempool is still congested with more than 300,000 unconfirmed transactions. Fees are still high. This might discourage your customers to pay in Bitcoin.",

We don't know what is going to happen in the future. But if bitcoin transactions increase day by day, the fees will remain like that and maybe it will increase further. It depends on the volume of the transactions. The ordinal things keep growing every day and the number of BRC-20 tokens and their transactions also increasing every day. A couple of Ordinal coins have been pumped in the last couple of weeks. SATS and ORDI are two of them. These two coins have been listed on Binance and since then the number of transactions has kept increasing every day. I hope more ordinal coins won't pop up in the coming weeks. The network is congested at this moment.",

Of course, you will consider customer preferences and prioritize multiple payment options to accommodate their needs. While accepting Bitcoin alongside traditional payment methods may be beneficial for some customers, make sure you're not excluding those who still prefer traditional payment methods. The high transaction fees currently associated with Bitcoin may actually deter some consumers from using it as a payment method. Maintain a reliable and trustworthy payment service to earn the trust of customers to operate a business.",

It is expected that bitcoin’s price will go up by the next year so most likely the mempool will continue to be congested even next month and maybe even increasingly so it would be hard to directly buy or purchase services from you if they have to wait for so long or pay higher fees it would be a bit inconvenient However i do like your business idea it is just not that possible right now to execute if we are talking about accessibility maybe you can use other altcoins although it will still be quite a risk because not everyone might have your preferred altcoin",

There are no problems in telling your customers you will accept payments in BTC, you can even put some Bitcoin stickers and banners in your place to raise awareness, but in every cases, Bitcoin is just another payment method you will accept. Focus in your business launchment and let payment options in second plan. Being paid in fiat or Bitcoin isn't what matters right now, rather it's the efficiency and promotion of your shop which will boost your business and bring more customers and money inside.

Profits and losses are part of the cryptocurrency market. Those who buy at the right time get profit and those who enter at the wrong time definitely lose. However, the risk of loss in Bitcoin is low, but we can lose from our mistakes. If someone opens a shop and demands payment in Bitcoin, then of course it is possible where Bitcoin is legal, but in countries where Bitcoin is illegal, this concept is impossible. It is very good that Bitcoin transactions are allowed in your country, whereas Bitcoin is not legal in our country.Your idea is very good, because Bitcoin growth is definitely expected after the halving next year. I see some issues for payment in bitcoin like, not everyone may have bitcoins to pay for vehicle parts. Another reason could be that just as you think the value of Bitcoin is going up, other people who hold Bitcoin will surely be aware of it.If your aim is to promote bitcoin then this is the best plan, but if your aim is to earn bitcoin then you can always buy from the market instead of opening a shop and get it.​",

That serves to overcome high transaction costs like now. People can choose to use stable coins if they mind the transaction fees of using Bitcoin.You can still own Bitcoin by buying Bitcoin with stablecoins that are already in your wallet. Your business is going well, you have stablecoins and you can also buy Bitcoin. You can use that stablecoin to do DCA. So there are two benefits you receive from using Bitcoin and stablecoins.And when Bitcoin transaction fees have returned to normal, you can make Bitcoin your main choice as an alternative means of payment.

As you won't have any issues with the authorities. however, the current conjestion of the mempool may act as an indirect setback to your decision. This is because, customers may not want to make payment with fees that obviously seem uneconomical. And just like mk4 mentioned, you may actually end up using Bitcoin for mainly bulk and wholesale transactions.Anyways, if all goes well and the mempool becomes less conjested, I suggest you put a discount on payments make in Bitcoin. this would motivate customers to make most transactions using Bitcoin instead of fiat. Like I mean who doesn't like a discount 😁",

If that's the case, I'd suggest reconsidering. Considering the current congestion in the Bitcoin mempool, it's uncertain if fees will decrease soon. So, don't let Bitcoin be the reason your plans face obstacles next year. There are other payment options. If you're planning to use Bitcoin, it should be an alternative, not the only method. You can't expect all your customers to learn Bitcoin for purchases. Consider adding other cryptocurrency like stable coins with lower fees compared to Bitcoin. This will promote cryptocurrency payments, and your store will become known for these payment methods. Goodluck with your business and I hope it all works out as planned.",

Well, if you are really serious about accepting bitcoin as one of the payment options for your goods, then you will have to find an alternative way of receiving bitcoin payment from customers without having them pay exorbitant fees all in the name of to have their transaction to you confirmed quickly.And such alternatives is to consider setting up a bitcoin lightening Network for receiving Payments from your customers. If you ask me concerning the current bitcoin mempool congestion, I would tell you that, it's not looking like something that will get decongested any time soon, January 16th is just a few days away, and we have a major bull run coming, there is a high chance that the congestion could get worser, thereby increasing transaction fees even higher, it's time for businesses accepting bitcoin or looking to accept bitcoin as payment for their goods or services look the bitcoin lightening network way, for a better and smooth experience accepting bitcoin as payment for goods and services.",

By the way It is a good idea to keep up with what is happening in the Bitcoin network so you can make sure your customers have an easy time paying.And regarding Fee so I will say that this is really difficult to predict because there are Ordinals are involving and due to these Ordinals the fee is going up significantly. Soon or later the f*kng ordinals will not exist anymore then the fee will automatically go down. In the mean time I will you should take local currency from your costumers if they can't pay the high fee while making transaction in Bitcoin.
