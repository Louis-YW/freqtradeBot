To be honest enough I didn’t have any bad time with Bitcoins.I mean I don’t really care the price about the Bitcoins.I just buy coins whenever I can and used to sell whenever I need. I am not that type of person who invests his all money and savings directly to Bitcoins and wait for many days to find the right price target to cash out.To my fortune, I haven’t also encountered any type of scams with Bitcoins, for which I am really thankful.",

My worst moment was after the bull run way back 2017. I managed to buy myself a personal computer during that time while studying in college from doing different crypto-related tasks. I was already planning to give some to my parents the next year of that since I have nothing to spend on after I bought my PC. I promised them that I would handle the expenses for fixing our garage thinking that my income will continue until the market crash happened in 2018 and I lose 80% of my crypto portfolio. I told them that I can't handle the expenses anymore since the value of my assets went down a lot. They don't understand how crypto works so they thought that I was scammed and heard many hurtful words from them with that experience. I've never sold my assets during that crash since the value is almost worthless. I stay away for a few years on the crypto space to focus in my studies. After I finished it in 2020, my group chat in crypto started to become noisy and I found out that the crypto market is starting to go up again. I immediately checked my portfolio and saw that its value recovered by 70%. I was able to recover my money during that pump and use it as a capital to start my crypto journey again.",

My worst moment would be not selling my bitcoin when the price was close to $60k in 2021. I was infatuated with with wall observer thread and bitcoin reaching 100k$ that I hodl. Worse decision ever! I could have sold then and bought the dip making huge profits.",

No breaking losses, but a waste nonetheless, especially since those decisions that did turn out profitable were in hindsight not profitable enough to justify the risk. Waking up to a project turning out to be a scam, or at least not as groundbreaking as expected -- not a good feeling.With Bitcoin itself though I just watch the ebb and flow of the markets. I watch them closely and with great interest, mind you, but at this point lamenting about missed buying or selling opportunities feels like complaining about the weather. So no bad moments with Bitcoin, but a few with the cryptospace surrounding it.",

I lost all, so I was unable to invest in bitcoin when the right time came which was like 2 weeks before halving that I planned. Bitcoin rose from $8200 to $69000. I still always see it as a lost opportunity. I wish 2024/2025 would not be another one that I will not have enough money to invest in bitcoin, because bitcoin all-time-high is coming again.",

Unfortunately, the pandemic occurs, and bitcoin surged to $60k, making it difficult for that person to pay the exact amount of sats when it was still trading at $18k.In the end, I agreed to be payed equivalent to the original loan amount in our local currency instead of the original quantity of sats when bitcoin is trading at around $18k. So yea, it's like a losing spot trade with extra steps.Never again!",

I avoid investing when the market is currently not good and chooses the right time to buy low and sell high. Many people really enjoyed the time when they first introduce bitcoins, especially those who have less money and wanted to look for another source of income on the internet luckily they found bitcoin in its early stage and decided to join the financial revolution. Those who don't have money to buy joined some faucets and do some bounty campaigns back then and with their patience, they were able to earn a decent amount of income.",

But later on, after I heard that bitcoin would explode in the future and saw the altcoin have a chance to reach its position and give some profit, I tried to search for further info. The challenge I face from time to time is how to accumulate more and more bitcoin, as I know it will be a long journey to have many bitcoins. But that will not stop me from doing that.",

I've known what Bitcoin was for like a few years but never considered entering it but around the period before Covid went down, I tried investing, and boy I wasn't even doing daily trading but knowing that my money was at risk of being lost was stressful as heck. I checked the prices daily in almost every hour of free time that I had which at the time I was glad about since the price dropped when covid kind of got big, managed to get out before I got hit, but even after that like investing at the covid dip, I still had the same issue which was a huge problem for me. Managed to get over it like after a year of break so now I just invest for the long term.",

This is because I used to be too greedy and emotional. That's what makes me quite frustrated. But until recently I kept trying to learn, and I still continued to stick with free money after all the funds I thought were important had returned. This saa I just need to use the profit for trading activities. The hardest thing is self-control and emotion, but all can be trained at the moment I think I've been pretty better than last year regarding emotions and lust.",

It was a rollercoaster experience as things have been going upward in 2017 but after a few days things change and most tokens have lost their value.
