In other words, is the return profitable, or is it a waste of time in return for consuming resources.I see that the currency has a good number of users, and perhaps it is an opportunity for the short term, especially since the coming months may mean an increase in the price, but if it is not profitable now, even a little, it will not be so in the future.",

Today, the NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics card will earn 7 cents a day at 6 cents per kilowatt. If the video card is in the computer, then mining will not bring profit, and this will be useless work of the PC. It's good that PEPE is traded on exchanges, but it's bad that mining the coin is unprofitable.",
