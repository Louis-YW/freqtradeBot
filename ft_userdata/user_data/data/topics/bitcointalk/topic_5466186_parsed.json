Regardless of the fact you said your signals are free, and you only  accept donations from those are successful through your signals, no body with sense will still risk their hard earned money on you without first seeing your trade history to accertain what your winning and losing ratio is.",

It fall to $0.05153.  if you use stop loss for audio, you would have loss money, because the price went above $0.1630 which is your stop loss. Although the price started to fall after reaching $0.1636. Making use of stop loss would have result to loss of money. But if stop loss is not used, you would have gain by now. But the problem is if stop loss is not used, the day significant loss will come is near for such person.",

In order to do that, you have to provide your technical analysis on the pair your are saying which is MDT/USDT. I went to the chart to check the price action of that pair and I found it difficult to read in the higher time frame since there's no clear direction. I also found out that this coin/token was in the top 445 in CMC which is a very volatile currency. So in this case, this is not a good coin to trade if you only put a tight stop loss.",

Trading is one thing I fear alot because you might be a successful trader and you decided to create a group to be dropping signals and suddenly, you start making loses that you don't experience before. Op has decided to create a signal group but I think he need to show us how his trading history is and how good he is in trading.

This is a clever idea opening a short position then post to your follower the signal so that they will short too and you can take profit. User that first saw your signal make a profit too same with you since he has a price entry almost same to you then gain additional profit from donations aside from your trade profit.

Short means let it opens shortly. If you see a market moves not too good as your speculation, closing your short position and exit with a draw or even accept a minor loss.Your signal, here, is not good too. You open it but how long will you let it opens. Maximum time is 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours or 24 hours?You should not open a short position and let it opens a few days to wait for profit.",
