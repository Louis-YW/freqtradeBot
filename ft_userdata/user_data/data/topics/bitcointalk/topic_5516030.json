One of their advocacy is to educate the public and, especially, the regulators so they can better understand Bitcoin and ensure that regulations are fair. And as we all know that U.S. SEC already approved a Bitcoin ETF, it clearly shows that they are pro-Bitcoin, and the status of the U.S. will likely influence other countries to adopt similar measures.As more countries adopt Bitcoin, it will lead to similar regulations that strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem. With institutional investors leading the charge, everyday people will follow suit. Although Bitcoin is currently not ideal for daily small transactions due to high transaction fees, there is a second-layer solution, the Lightning Network, which is already scaling. Essentially, as long as regulations remain pro-Bitcoin, the weaknesses we see now can be addressed with solutions that promote greater adoption.",

And I do think it's a possibility, that, it will become even more influential because some would even go as far as to create the reserves of it.",

      "body": "These efforts to push for regulations could truly open up opportunities for the crypto space. This clarity could remove the barriers holding back large-scale institutional investment, making Bitcoin and other projects far more attractive to major players who may have been cautious due to regulatory gray areas.This movement could indeed set a precedent, encouraging other, perhaps smaller or more niche blockchain projects to seek similar clarity and legitimacy in the eyes of both investors and regulators. If we see a positive outcome, this could pave the way for broader acceptance and even more innovations within the crypto world!What kind of regulations would you consider pro-Bitcoin? Do you think regulations could potentially limit some of the core principles of Bitcoin eg. decentralization?",

If one state starts seeing more and more companies and startups getting into Bitcoin, others might not want to be left behind.The initiative is well intentioned but it is not enough until the government does hear them out and do implement what the community has been asking for. For now though, this non profit organization has been able to pass some policies in a few states in the US. The best situation is still for the entire country or at least most of the states to acknowledge bitcoin and the policies needed to protect those who use and hold it.QuoteI am curious to see if this wave of pro-Bitcoin regulations could motivate lesser-known crypto projects to seek their own regulation and legitimacy if it succeeds in the US...Definitely. More recognition from the government and policies that benefit crypto will entail confidence among those crypto projects. Small projects now wouldn’t want to risk being at the wrong side of the law but with more positive outlook from the government, I am sure they will be more motivated and not just those in the US. Some may even travel to US and build their projects there if all things go well.",
