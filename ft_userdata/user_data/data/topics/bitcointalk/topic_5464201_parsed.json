First, you need to familiarize yourself with the entire mining process, especially the hardware. Once you understand that, then you yourself will know how to check the profitability.If you already have graphic cards, probably you can get some info on whattomine.com",

Is it so hard to understand how you calculate the profitability on whattomine for example? i mean you must fill in some numbers and thats it.And this is only to protect you, we saw so many new users in the past, and they are blindet by some numbers and at the end, they loose so much. The question about the S9 and mining scrypt show your current knowledge, and this is not much. So first try to learn more about mining and all around this. It is not so easy as all think.",

But the payback period of ASIC should be no more than a year. Don't forget to consider the Bitcoin halving in 2024.",

For example, in the first case you feed in the values under the Scrypt instead of SHA256 which matches with the specific miner you talked ofSecondly, you filled in the wrong values inflating the hashing power, that's why you saw abnormal looking profits.If you use the right values and algorithm, you will be barely making any profits. In fact, right now it's estimated at -$0.72. That's how it is currently in this market. Mining most coins isn't that profitable",
