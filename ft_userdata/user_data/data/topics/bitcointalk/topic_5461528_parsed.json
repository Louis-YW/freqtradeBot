You should not push yourself to wager big so that you can reach the next ranks at the earliest. More you push yourself, more will be the loss. Maybe few gets lucky to reach next ranks in an easier way without losing much. Personally I have experienced the urge we have when we reach 95% and more 5% left to reach the next rank. We need to be very careful during those time.",

Obviously, bet higher.By \"tips\", do you mean what's the best approach?For me, if it's something related to leveling up an account, just don't push for it aggressively since if plan to play on that site for long, eventually, a certain rank will surely reach. About wagering related to certain bonuses and promotions, users just have to read properly the wagering terms of it in order not to be confused. My tolerance level of accepting wagering requirements should only be a minimum of around x30 and the max cashout allowed should also be decent.",

For example, one can wager on Stake, rolling dices and reach the copper tier before one even noticed. Of course, it depends on ones money availability, but it is fairly easy, imo.As long as one is being responsible with money, there is nothing wrong with enjoying tiers",

If it wins go back to the base, if it loses double 4 more times. Very risky and I wouldn't do it with large amounts, but you can get some wager built up fast if you keep from getting unlucky. Mines with 3 mines can be pretty good as well. Usually only pick 1or 2 squares and take the profit.",

That used to be good tactic when i not only grinded my rank up, but i managed to mine tokens that paid dividends from casino's revenue. But those days are over and in the end, trying to move up in ranks wasn't any more worth it than mining those tokens by gambling. In the end i ended up getting less back then i was putting in. Which is obvious in hindsight. After that i made it about being fun. Getting bonuses and ranks is a nice plus. What means more is having fun while gambling. Just trying to rank up wasn't that fun for me.",

      "body": "I'd encourage waiting or looking for a promotion before wagering because you'll hit two birds with one stone. Your participation in the promotion already increases your VIP progress, and once you win a prize, it'll help you accelerate the progress even further as you'll have more bankroll to work with.One of the alternative games for wagering aside from dice is live roulette because Evolution has a roulette game called \"La Partage\" and in Evolution's roulette, you can bet on both sides (red and black). The big difference in La Partage is getting half of your bet back if it lands on green, so you'll lose less and place more bets compared to playing at the regular roulette table. It's not the best wagering game as dice but, it's still better than most casino games.",

Wagering should be done according to the gambler's pocket size, not the opposite way round. Everything is going to fall into its proper place with overtime. Gambling is certainly not refreshing; if you do not gamble with prudence, trust me, it will deal with you without reluctance. Ranks are perpetually attainable with adequate prospects; there is no tendency to be nervous, but rather to continue striving for new heights in the system.",

If you want to rank up faster, then the natural answer is to wager more money, it's the kind of idea that casinos pur in your head when they implemented such a system anyway. Simple marketing so to speak. Promotions are in a way, just stroking your FOMO ego,  but in reality, said promotions will definitely happen again in the future.

It is always advised to check the t&c before wagering otherwise you might incur a big loss. I always prefer reading the condition before I decided to wager as it gives me clear information about the benefits. Higher rank does provide lucrative promotion but they are always different across casinos. Again it is always good to understand the structure and the benefits before wagering.",

Not technically anyways. You can wager $100k and break even on your bets and the casdino made $0 from you. Casinos profit by you losing and the only way you can lose is to keep wagering. All games have a house edge and eventually that house edge catches up to a player. They know if you keep playing that eventually you will lose.",

In this section I've seen people say that with rank up, promotions and giveaways, they beat the House Edge, and nothing could be further from the truth. If you bet in a casino on a certain modality and there is an HE of 2% and by going up in rank it is reduced by 10%, it is not that you are going to have an EV+ of 8%, the 10% is applied on the 2% advantage that the casino has, so now it will have an HE of 1.8%. VIP ranks, promotions, etc., all they do is reduce the HE, but never bring it to 0, so you are always playing an EV- game.Quote from: romero121 on July 30, 2023, 10:38:06 PMWagering should never be done looking for the bonuses and other giveaways.

Even on last based casinos, it's hard to achieved being a ViP, unless you really a big whale as has tons of money to burn.",

This exactly is how I see it. Bet when you feel like it, to entertain yourself and maybe win some money in that session and not get carried away by the possibility of ranking up or certain bonuses and promotions (with some exceptions), which will only make you bet more, probably with less concentration and with more propensity to do stupid things than if you bet in your usual way when you are not chasing the bonus or ranking up.",
