  "content": "First of all I would like to thank my parents because it is only because of their unwavering efforts that I have succeeded in fulfilling my dream today.Ever since my childhood I had many wishes to buy a bike and I always shared those wishes with my parents. My parents tried a lot to buy me a bike but due to financial problems they never succeeded in buying me a bike. Finally I am undecided whether I will invest and that investment will be in Bitcoin. I explained a lot to my parents about this, they told me that you wait for a few more days, we will buy you a bike immediately, just don't risk so much money. I explained to them that success in life cannot be achieved without taking risks. So dad decided to sell his old bike and promised to give me some of his deposit and mom told me that she has some gold ornaments and the money from selling them will be given to me to invest. But I was having a lot of trouble to take this money and still I took the money and invested it in Bitcoin. I think God was with me because at the time I invested, Bitcoin was worth $16K. But after investing I was always very worried and always monitored the market.  I used to feel very bad when the market went down but still I never lost patience. I persevered and yesterday when I saw that the amount of profit made now if I sell my investments I can buy a bike. So I informed my parents about this decision and they were very happy and decided to sell the bitcoins.  And they also told me that we have some more money and we will give it to you to buy a good bike. Finally I sold my bitcoins as per my parents decision. Tomorrow I will go to buy a bike with my parents. And after buying the bike, I would first put my mom on the back of the bike.*But if it wasn't for my parents' tireless efforts and investment in Bitcoin, I don't think I would have achieved success so quickly. I am grateful to Bitcoin because it is only because of Bitcoin that I have come this far in fulfilling my dreams. Everyone please pray for me that I can drive the bike carefully. And a sweet invitation from me to everyone in the forum. Because I want to share this happiness with everyone.Bike is an emotion for me and buying a bike like this is a matter of pride for me that's why my post size is so big please take some time to read my post.",

      "body": "First of all I congratulate your family for successfully buying a bicycle for you, there have been many ways and also trying to raise money to buy a bicycle but to no avail, and finally bitcoin is the solution.The question for me is whether the price of bicycles in your place is very expensive or do you want a bicycle that is very expensive and good for you to use because you did not mention the price of the bicycle you want. Because I think bicycles can still be affordable if you really want them or you can just buy a bicycle with some of the profits from bitcoin and not have to sell everything, and actually you can still use your dad's bike for a while.maybe because your goal is very serious and you have to do it and it's your right, and finally you have a new motorbike which I think might be very expensive. And after you sell everything, can you still invest in bitcoin because the capital to buy bitcoin is the result of your parents' property, and how else can you invest in bitcoin because you have to return the assets your parents sold. And don't you want something more expensive and more beneficial for your family for the future, and you have to do it from now on.",

I can easily buy a bicycle with a small amount of money. But I didn't talk about buying a bicycle. I talked about buying a bike. And the bike that my father had was a bit old model so I didn't ride that bike unless I had to, that's why I wanted to buy a good quality bike from my childhood. And so much for buying that bike.",

But on the one hand there is a risk that you might get an alt connected to it.  But if you don't commit any crime then your alt will not a problem. Many big members on this forum also have alts and use them openly.  Like LoyceV also has alt.  And he uses it by announcing himself",

If you're a newbie who hasn't experienced bear seasons before, I don't blame you. But if you've been through the bear season and you panic when bear season hits, I don't think you will succeed in this market. For a bitcoin investor, the bear market is a joy, not a time for panic selling. To make a profit, you need to buy low and sell high and a bear market is the right time to buy. Investing in bitcoin is not stressful if you hold it for a long time and invest with money that can be lost.",

If I used to sit down because of bad result, then my parents would give me courage, they used to say like this, it's not over just seeing one bad exam, think about the future exam, prepare well, think about the future. It is indeed a blessing to have such parents. Bikes are a passion of mine. Ever since childhood, I wanted to buy a bike. I told my parents but I never pressured them. If I had pressured them, they would have bought me a bike before long. However, what God does is for good. I am very happy now.",
