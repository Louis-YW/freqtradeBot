      "body": "Welcome onboard OP as I can see you are new here.   I noticed this topic was moved here from the bitcoin discussion board by a global moderator which shows that you have no knowledge on how things are done here so I will advise you to take your time in studying this platform board by board knowing the forum policies, guidelines, rules and regulations and lastly on how to make posts and follow up with conversations on thread so as not to get banned or suspended.Nevertheless, you got a good portfolio but with the happenings of hack through links I think members would not want to click any link attached to a newbie account so in that case I would suggest you make post of your portfolio here for us to see. You are free to edit your post and include or attach all of your portfolio  so that it can be easily assessed by members here as it would give you a good edge over others if you have good ones.",
