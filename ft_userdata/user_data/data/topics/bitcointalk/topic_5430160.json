Can't I make modifications and keep compatibility?Do miners have to run the EXACT same code? I mean is it checked by the hash of the codebase or something?This is incomplete/incorrect.There are two things that are being confused here. First is consensus rules that dictate what block, etc. is valid and what isn't and second is the miners' preference to include a certain transaction in their block or not.The consensus rules is something that the miners can't change on their own because if they do that their blocks would become invalid hence rejected by the entire network. That means they can run different \"code\" but they have to enforce the same exact rules.But for censorship (refusing to include a certain transaction in their block) they do not need to change consensus rules. It is pretty much the same as how they treat different transaction with different fees (they refuse to include a tx with low fee as long as there are more txs with higher fee).The way to fight censorship is very similar to the fee situation too. For example if one miner/mining-pool decides to not include any tx with fee rate below 10 sat/vbyte the rest of the world won't follow.There is no way to prevent miners from censoring transactions but what we can do and have done so far is to have the most decentralized mining system by spreading the miners around the globe. That means if a government in one jurisdiction enforced censorship laws on the miners in their own jurisdiction (eg. US government forcing MARA pool to censor transactions) all the rest of the miners in the rest of the world won't follow that.It is the same with nodes. Individuals around the world are each running their own nodes and are under different jurisdictions so there is no way to force any kind of laws on all of them regarding which transaction they relay and which they don't.",

Realistically, you're not doing that without killing the network off in some way (as you've proved it's pretty insecure). It'd take a huge budget to pull off something on that scale though.It's more likely certain miners would just choose to not include transactions they don't like and leave the rest to be mined by someone else as mentioned above.",

So it is not so easy to enforce regulations to them",

      "body": "Thanks guys,Yeah, that was exactly my way of thinking too: A miner in a sanctioned jurisdiction can validate all the blocks (even ones with blacklisted addresses) but it wont include transactions with blacklisted addresses when producing new blocks.So yeah, basically the protocol itself doesn't protect from blacklisting, right?I get your point bitmover that because of stronger privacy the BTC network can be more resilient to censorship. But still it means that miners need to be brave / freedom fighters and undertake the risk of being illegal under their own jurisdiction.QuoteThere is no way to prevent miners from censoring transactions but what we can do and have done so far is to have the most decentralized mining system by spreading the miners around the globe.

What do I miss here?And yeah, even an 51+% attack can occur what jackg mentioned.In the Tornado Cash situation US created the sanction, but they also threatened other countries that they'll get punished if they don't comply.So let's say if a law is enforced on multiple countries by a powerful enough country then theoretically even a 51% attack scenario is not out of the question. But ofc it can be counterattacked by spinning up more and more nodes across the world; and so I ask the same question as above: how small fish can help this situation in POW?",

Bitcoin mining is sufficiently more resistant to such regulatory attacks than staking, because staking doesn't embrace free market competition. In popular Proof-of-Stake based cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, most validators are known. It doesn't matter that some are anonymous, because most staked coins come from identified entities. To put it this way: a Bitcoin transaction, even if 90% of Bitcoin miners consider it \"malicious\" and deny to include it to their candidate block, will at some point in the future be confirmed by that 10% left, because they upload blocks as well. The fact that the majority wants to blacklist doesn't mean that the blacklisting will pass. On the other hand, if 90% of the stakers (or holders that own the 90% of staked coins) vote for blacklisting, there's no way for the transaction to pass forward.",

In POW the strongest get to mine, right?I think you are a little confused about nodes and miners. Running a node does not make you miner. Running a node helps to keep the network running, helps to keep it decentralized, and provides you with security and privacy by allowing you independently verify the blockchain without having rely on third parties. But nodes do not mine blocks.It is not the strongest who get to mine, but rather, anyone who chooses to mine by purchasing some mining hardware and turning it on.Quote from: hollov on December 19, 2022, 04:25:39 PMSo following this, the lot of freedom fighter, average Joes never get to mine a single block, so they won't be able to include the blacklisted txs.True, but similarly there are plenty of average Joes who do mine. They can choose to lend their hashrate to any pool operator, so can choose ones which do not censor transactions and move to a new one if their current one starts to enforce such censorship. Or they can even choose to mine solo.Quote from: hollov on December 19, 2022, 04:25:39 PMAnd yeah, even an 51+% attack can occur what jackg mentioned.In the case of a sustained 51% attack against bitcoin, the censorship of a handful of UTXOs would be the least of our concerns.Quote from: hollov on December 19, 2022, 04:25:39 PMSo let's say if a law is enforced on multiple countries by a powerful enough country then theoretically even a 51% attack scenario is not out of the question.

If regulators want to censor certain transactions, they ought to pay more for censoring than for the confirmation of the transaction. But fees are abrupt. Regulators can't intervene if they don't know the cost.Mining is anonymous. Sure, top pools are known, but if they're leaning towards censorship, they are going to disappear from the top before tomorrow morning, because they're dependent on individuals who are not in favor of censorship (and neither are their users, who're creating mining demand, which is parameter for profit, which as said previously is key to miners' guidance).",

Technically one way to censor transactions is to modify the \"is_spendable\" method that is used on outputs before they are added to UTXO database and return false for the censored transaction. But that is not the way that will be practical and not to mention that this is modifying consensus rules which is impossible without reaching consensus.QuoteFor example, the latest version is 24.0.1. What if as a miner I'm still running Bitcoin Core 23.0 I guess I should not have any problem running this. Am I right?It depends on the version and what it changed. Some changes don't affect consensus rules are just improvements like changing the wallet layer, changing UI, optimizing cryptography, fixing small bugs, etc. In these cases you can continue running the older version and don't miss on much specially as a miner Some changes are bug fixes that could be important like 0.3.10 back in 2010 which fixed the value overflow bug. In this case it is very risky to continue running the older version because the bug that would be known after fixing could be exploited. Some changes could affect consensus rules in a backward incompatible way (aka a hard fork), this is the only case that remaining on an older version becomes impossible. Some changes are affecting consensus rules but in a backward compatible way (aka a soft fork), in this case you could stay on an older version but as a miner you would miss out on newer transactions. For example if you run a version that doesn't support Taproot you can not mine Taproot transactions and you could miss out on their fee or even run the risk of not being able to fill your block.AFAICT version 24 falls under the first category.",

That is the power of Bitcoin: I can do whatever I want as long as I am acting within consensus rules. For example, I can install software that will filter all undesirable addresses and ban misbehaving nodes from connecting to my mining software. Essentially, I can build my own network with local rules, the only constraint is that I can't change \"global\" rules. The moment I attempt to modify global rules by installing incompatible software, I transform them to local rules of my isolated network, but this time I become truly isolated because I have \"blacklisted\" myself from the rest of the world and lost significance. In short, as long as I am a part of the bitcoin network, I have the power to ignore transactions. But I lose it immediately if decide to change consensus rules.",

This is interesting and new info for me.That answers the OP and my question too so it means bitcoin miners or for a full node you don't need to have the same source code you can run any version of bitcoin core or it could be your own re-written source code based on the rules and standards defined by \"Bitcoin\". You just need to strictly follow the Bitcoin protocols and Bitcoin standards and must qualify Bitcoin consensus conformance to be part of the network irrespective of your source code. Last but not the least Bitcoin standards are still maintained by Bitcoin Core any community agreed changes in bitcoin core will force all other implementations to follow the same.

Assuming bitcoin core will always be the most used bitcoin full node implementation.That's a bit more of a nuanced question. It depends on what changes we are discussing.To take a recent example - RBF. Bitcoin Core has used opt-in RBF as its standard mempool policy for several years. Other full node software such as Bitcoin Knots has allowed users to use full RBF. Now Bitcoin Core is allowing the use of full RBF too. But that doesn't stop yet another piece of software from sticking to opt-in RBF, if they want. These kind of changes make no difference to what is considered a valid transaction or a valid block, and so there is no direct impact on other clients.To take another recent example - Segwit. These kind of changes do affect other clients. In a soft fork like this, it would be possible for alternative clients (or outdated Core clients) to accept blocks which the majority of the network was rejecting. In this case, the alternative clients could fork themselves out of the network and start running a minority chain, or alternatively experience frequent reorgs until they upgrade.I would also say that the consensus rules are not enforced by Core, but are enforced by the community. If the community refuse to implement some new change or download new software, then the rules don't change, regardless of what code is published in Bitcoin Core.",

You just need to strictly follow the Bitcoin protocols and Bitcoin standards and must qualify Bitcoin consensus conformance to be part of the network irrespective of your source code. Additionally, it's likely some exchange and mining pool create their own full node software.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 21, 2022, 12:59:37 PM--snip--I would also say that the consensus rules are not enforced by Core, but are enforced by the community. If the community refuse to implement some new change or download new software, then the rules don't change, regardless of what code is published in Bitcoin Core.Although in reality people who took part on Bitcoin Core development have bigger influence than many people/group. Major update (such as SegWit and Taproot).",
