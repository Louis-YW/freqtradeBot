      "body": "lol that's not a real price. Early pump meant nothing. It's caused by lack of liquidity but this time the current price was around 8x from the pre sale price. It's going up caused by okx and huobi listing. I have bought around 300 tokens from its pre sale but there was vesting period for my tokens. I can't sell them all. Â  I got my capital back but i have vesting token that will be unlocked in daily basis. ico is still profitable these days",

I've heard about it from a trader friend and he sure told me the date but it escaped my mind, with twenty one million supply like BitcOin I believe this token will increase even more, Binance listing looks possible too.",
