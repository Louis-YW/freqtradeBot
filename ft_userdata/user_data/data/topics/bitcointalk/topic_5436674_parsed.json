  "content": "QuoteResearchers have developed a new tool and technique that uses \"vortex ultrasound\"—a sort of ultrasonic tornado—to break down blood clots in the brain. The new approach worked more quickly than existing techniques to eliminate clots formed in an in vitro model of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).\"Our previous work looked at various techniques that use ultrasound to eliminate blood clots using what are essentially forward-facing waves,\" says Xiaoning Jiang, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work. \"Our new work uses vortex ultrasound, where the ultrasound waves have a helical wavefront.\"In other words, the ultrasound is swirling as it moves forward,\" says Jiang, who is the Dean F. Duncan Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at North Carolina State University. \"Based on our in vitro testing, this approach eliminates blood clots more quickly than existing techniques, largely because of the shear stress induced by the vortex wave.\"\"The fact that our new technique works quickly is important, because CVST clots increase pressure on blood vessels in the brain,\" says Chengzhi Shi, co-corresponding author of the work and an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech. \"This increases the risk of a hemorrhage in the brain, which can be catastrophic for patients.\"Existing techniques rely in large part on interventions that dissolve the blood clot. But this is a time-consuming process. Our approach has the potential to address these clots more quickly, reducing risk for patients.\"CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the veins responsible for draining blood from the brain. Incidence rates of CVST were between 2 and 3 per 100,000 in the United States in 2018 and 2019, and the incidence rate appears to be increasing.\"Another reason our work here is important is that current treatments for CVST fail in 20-40% of cases,\" Jiang says.The new tool consists of a single transducer that is specifically designed to produce the swirling, vortex effect. The transducer is small enough to be incorporated into a catheter, which is then fed through the circulatory system to the site of the blood clot.For proof-of-concept in vitro testing, the researchers used cow blood in a 3D-printed model of the cerebral venous sinus.\"Based on available data, pharmaceutical interventions to dissolve CVST blood clots take at least 15 hours, and average around 29 hours,\" Shi says. \"During in vitro testing, we were able to dissolve an acute blood clot in well under half an hour.\"During any catheterization or surgical intervention there is a potential risk of harm, such as damaging the blood vessel itself. To address this issue, the researchers performed experiments applying vortex ultrasound to animal blood vein samples. Those tests found no damage to the walls of the blood vessels.The researchers also conducted tests to determine whether the vortex ultrasound caused significant damage to red blood cells. They found that there was not substantial damage to red blood cells.\"The next step is for us to perform tests using an animal model to better establish the viability of this technique for CVST treatment,\" Jiang says. \"If those tests are successful, we hope to pursue clinical trials.\"\"And if the vortex ultrasound ever becomes a clinical application, it would likely be comparable in cost to other interventions used to treat CVST,\" says Shi.The paper, \"A Model of High-Speed Endovascular Sonothrombolysis with Vortex Ultrasound-Induced Shear Stress to Treat Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis,\" is published in the journal Research.https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-01-tool-ultrasound-tornado-blood-clots.html....While there have been many statements made regarding various COVID treatment methods. We have not seen much discussion for treating illness post COVID, as well as treating COVID related illness.Ultrasound being deemed safe for matters as sensitive as tracking fetus development. The high safety rating of ultrasound makes it a natural option for treating blood clots. After reading about blood clots becoming a major issue, I tried to find something that might be a good treatment for it. This was the best thing I found:QuoteNew ultrasound 'drill' targets deep vein blood clotsJune 14, 2017Researchers have developed a new surgical tool that uses low-frequency intravascular ultrasound to break down blood clots that cause deep vein thrombosis. The tool is the first ultrasound 'drill' that can be aimed straight ahead, allowing doctors to better target clots -- which holds promise for significantly reducing treatment time. To date, the technology has been tested only in synthetic blood vessels.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170614091837.htmWhile the tobacco industry has been criticized in the past for investing in healthcare providers and services.Perhaps blood clot treatments like ultrasound can be a feel good investment and moral project to support. If they prove to be viable and effective.",

I mean blood clots are one of the main reasons why many people die, and if they could locate and destroy them before they take the patients life, that would be game changing. As we all know there are \"developments\" in the medical world all the time but we do not see it, like for example you can read 100 \"cure for cancer is found\" articles and %99.99 of them are just another different approach with the same method, but basically what we have today in its core. If this is as good as I am reading and not a lie? my god that will be epic for our future, its unreal.",

One of the questions that came to my mind was whether the ultrasound would damage the red blood cells while breaking up the clot. I saw in the article that this was also prevented. An incredible event indeed. With each passing year, surprising developments are taking place in the medical world and humanity is developing the secret of long life. The effect of a development in health and medicine on the ordinary citizen has always been late. Here we need to appreciate what companies are trying to improve. The state has an important duty to offer the developments in medicine as a service to the ordinary citizen and most of the time, the states make their citizens benefit from such developments with the understanding of social assistance. At least in countries where health care is covered by the state.",

One of the questions that came to my mind was whether the ultrasound would damage the red blood cells while breaking up the clot.its not about wearing a hat and ultra sounding whole brainits not about it as a sound knowing to only target a clotits about doctors doing a MRI scan. seeing a clot. rushing you into surgery, sticking something as thin as a cats whisker up your vein to you brain/lung/muscle(where ever it needs to go) to the position of a clot and then blasting sound at the site. its precise targeting via a small thin device that can blast out enough bass to pound a clot into mush, at the site. when you have 4-5litres of blood through your body. but a cluster of 0.00001ltr blood stuck in a 1mm-1cm area.. its only targetting that area thus only that small amount of blood",

One of the questions that came to my mind was whether the ultrasound would damage the red blood cells while breaking up the clot. That should not be a problem, since the body constantly generates new red cells and these have a relatively short live spawn anyways.You should a bit about it, it is interesting, both white and red cells were born within the bone marrow.Also, there is public health in my country and it is very bad.",
