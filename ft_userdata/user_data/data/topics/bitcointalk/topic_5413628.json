But people will always remain being people, they like centralization, that is why it is not surprising that people uses centralized exchanges to hold bitcoin, which gives power to another central authorities. But you are not wrong, bitcoin helps in so many ways, just like this that you created this opening post about. Bitcoin makes it possible for not to fall victim of such central authority control over your own money.",

Peer-to-peer makes this very easy, which is one of the reason bitcoin was created.

Most countries make bitcoin legal, mute about it or just placed an implicit ban on it in a way citizens can still be able to trade bitcoin. Even about the ban, I was surprised that China that totally banned bitcoin still ranked 10th in crypto adoption index, according to Chainanalysis:https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/ report.",

How will i go ahead to covert from Bitcoin to fiat when i know i will not access the funds afterwards. Humans finds a way to adapt to new developments be it positive or negative. The case of Lebanese Citizens Bitcoin is their only way around and by so i mean the p2p feature originally proposed by Satoshi.

Just make sure that you have sole access to your Private keys.  Okay but this is bad and this might not be the best analogy to spread adoption in my opinion. I mean holding a living as a hostage because you weren't allowed to have access to money with a gun on bank premises is a big offence. Banks can be so frustrating and I can talk from experience but you don't want to get locked up just to get your $13k by threatening the lives of others, you may end up spending all of that in court or probably end up in prisons if the bank terms and conditions don't qualify you to have access to that money.However, this can be avoided in the first place if you don't keep money in the bank, you can switch to bitcoin as an alternative to protect your assets but it comes with its own merit and demerit, volatility has been the reason why it discourages some people to keep their emergency money or savings in bitcoin. Let's say, for example, the woman bought $13k worth of bitcoin when the price was at $40k, that will be a loss to her with half of the value right now and now that the sister is sick and in need of money for treatments, she will have to sell because they can't hold while another life is at stake.

Of course, somebody could steal your money, but there will always be risks involved.Bitcoin/crypto seems like an alternative, but only a minority of tech savvy open-minded people would use BTC/crypto.

If a person has Bitcoin and cannot pay anything with it, and cannot sell it for fiat because the bank has blocked his account, then it is a difficult situation, but there is always a way to sell face to face (risky), or buy something online in international trade.However, I think it is good to remind people that they should be their own bank when it comes to Bitcoin, at least to understand that storing coins on centralized crypto exchanges is nothing but a risk that can be avoided.",

And a bank is a private business, hence they care about their business, not about you. While in EU there are now laws protecting the funds under certain limits, this is rather new, this is only in EU and even there... laws can change. Plus I will not even start with the crap they're doing lately because of crypto, hiding under the \"in the name of KYC\" blanket.But as said, Bitcoin is also not perfect, since it's easy to steal and hide. This being said, being your own bank is, sadly, not for everybody.However, with a bit of carefulness, Bitcoin is clearly superior. And being your own bank certainly gives a nice feeling",

You kinda have it spot on with your mention of Bitcoin being the alternative option. We have seen several incidents in other countries, like Greece... where the government instructed the Banks to close their doors. In these countries, people could not get access to their own money or the supply of the money were restricted at the ATMs.  Bitcoin will always be the \"alternative\" currency, when the shit hits the fan in the Banking industry. It will find it very difficult to be the primary or reserve currency, because the governments are blocking that privilege.",
