There may be a couple of alts that are worth looking into, ETH and BNB.Other than that, hard to trust your hard-earned money if you are looking at long-term basis.You can always diversify as it is your funds, but it is also your responsibility to keep up with the updates of each alt you want to venture with.No one will do it for you but yourself. So you are free to choose your alts but it is your own risk here. No one else's.",

I choose potential coins that is why I have that kind of level, pretty different if you are choosing meme coins and these new projects. Yes, so many new projects had come out these days where halving is approaching, and seems to need to be more cautious because the majority of them are scams or like to be a scam someday. That is why it was not encouraged to hold altcoins for the long term, they are not worth it aside from those projects that have a long market history already.",

So we got many L2 going and we got many dex being launched and many are already used daily with huge volumes. I think that many CEX will even release some form of DEX to stay competitive. Because with all these regulation issues and issues with the exchange itself like FTX, people are just fed up with regular CEX.",

They are actually profiting which is why many investors are preferred to take risks with them than just putting it all in Bitcoin. It was not an assumption or whatever it is because it was proven also that many people got a huge profit from investing in them. In fact, meme coins do (Doge and Shiba Inu) and these P2E gaming structures. As they are on the trend, profit is not possible but yes, if we talk about it in the future, it is somewhat not really confident about it. Unless their trends remain but that is also impossible as for sure other projects will pop out and take the lead.",

We have to be patient, keep buying at the low and hold. Altcoins on the other hand do not give me much hope. The old ones have been recycling and going on which means they can be kept for long term but not short term gains.Newly launched altcoins I would avoid, give them a 2year observation period from your side before you put in money. They are risky and usually end up bankrupt or plain shutdown.More such bankruptcy or hacks or scandals will come in every few months. Nothing to worry about there, just keep your seed and devices secure.",

Because I know and I believe that Bitcoin will reach another high and of course, altcoins are there to follow the trend. Honestly and based on what we experienced in the past, the future of altcoins doesn't just rely if it has a use-case but also, it relies on how much is the price of Bitcoin would reach. Choosing potential altcoins really matters this time otherwise, we make ourselves a loser investing in shitcoins.",

Sadly I never really studied them much in-depth, I just choose some coins that I personally think would grow, most of my metrics being the charts of their past prices and some level of interest of the general public (that I judge on my own). Well I do tend to let go of them after profiting off, so that may be a part of why I don't judge them that strictly.",

I don't have any suggestions of coins in mind but I believe there will be many coins that'll do well immediately the bull market starts. Alot of investors are waiting on the side to get a green signal that the market is back and usually the influencers are those they rely on for this kind of news and immediately that starts happenings, you'll begin to see money entering the marketAlot of project both good and bad ones will benefit as they usually do during the bull market. I'm confident that altcoins will do well because not everyone would want to buy Bitcoin that they know can't give them much profits but many people investing wants to make money quick so they'll go for altcoins. To profits we have to be among early investors.I think coins in the top 20 should be given much attention for security purposes and they can also give good returns as if you invest when the market is down, you'll be among the earliest investors and can profit when the whole market rise.",

But eventhough that incident happen I believe many investor still have a good impression to other alts and they already moving on the dark chapter happen to them on FTX and Luna crash.
