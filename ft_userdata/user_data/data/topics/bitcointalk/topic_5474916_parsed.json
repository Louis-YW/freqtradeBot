The news, well, they have impact at all times so if there are bad news then expect the lesser interest on it by the people and if it's positive news then it is the opposite.",

      "body": "The correct answer to your questions have already been answered by some members earlier, but I'll like to add that despite SEC's charge against XRP their future still depends on the investors both small and great, because without them the coin will just lost all its value and fall back to the ground. So even after clearing all charges from the SEC they still have to convince their investors that they are worth investing in. This coin has suffered for too long but I don't think the SEC has any plan of backing off until they crush its progress totally. Ripple ought to be one of the worlds greatest altcoin with a good price, but today it's just like other coins, struggling to survive.",

There is a lot of speculation about the future and what it can handle, but for now, the challenges are limiting its growth, but it still maintains a strong position in this market. I believe that in the upcoming cycle it will receive more attention when legal issues are resolved, but the investment decision still depends on you.Quote from: SAHASAN on November 21, 2023, 03:20:18 PM(...)I want to know the opinion about the future of xrp ?",

While being optimistic is fine, looking at the exact numbers and market cap of it won't be determined then. What can happen is it can reach $1 first and then from there, people will start to see that there's a significance to the speculations that it can be back to at least $3 for the next bull run. And with all of that, this is not a financial advise and I'm not holding XRP but only uses it for transfers.",
