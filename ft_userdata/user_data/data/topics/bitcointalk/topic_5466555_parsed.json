  "content": "Hello guys congratulation to me, I just purchased my first  bitcoin, it really feels good knowing that it's one of the best decision I've made so far, I am proud of myself even if the start up amount is small, I hope to add to it consistently by the end of every month. I purchased the coin on an exchange but am looking forward to buy a Trezor hardware wallet for my coin storage.I can't even express how exited I am, even if this is just the first phase, I believe the amount of knowledge I have accumulated about bitcoin through this forum will strengthened my emotion not to panic when the market goes bearish.Thanks guy for your support, advice and wonderful opinion.",

Now on a serious note first of all do not flaunt your asset on online platforms like this keep your anonymity. To start with that this big on you purchase is certainly from binance base on the image you just posted. So my first advice is take your funds off exchanges to self custodian wallets like electrum, because not your keys not your coins . There many other wallets to look into you can have a snip at this thread for bitcoin wallets. The most recommended one is the electrum wallet, here is a thread on how to verify it.",

At this point, I don't think you should publish an image of the exact amount of bitcoin you bought, because now it's trivial to just hit that number on a block explorer and have you traced within a minute. Now as for the hardware wallet, it's a good practice, yes, but for such a small amount as 41,629 sat, I think you should stick with an encrypted wallet on a well-reviewed wallet software like Electrum. Good hardware wallets are worth like four times that amount at least.",

And it’s also good that you have been able to read through the forum and realize that storing crypto in an exchange account is not safe which brought you to the decision of think of getting a hardware wallet. For the main time considering the amount of coin which you have purchased and the cost of hardware wallet, truth be told hardware wallet is not what you need right now, you can go for mobile or desktop compatible wallets which you can use for the main time wallets like that of Blue wallet and Electrum as they are among the highly recommended Bitcoin wallet as they are both option source none-custodial wallet. You can start from their then later when you have top up and upgraded your Bitcoin holdings you can then consider to get a hardware wallet, the money for the hardware wallet can be use for the main time to get more Bitcoin.",

If you don't have a budget and just intend to keep bitcoins for a long time, Electrum cold storage is a good alternative for the Trezor wallet.And always remember don't leave your asset long to any exchange just like what happened recently with Coinex there are many customers right now having issues with withdrawal they currently suspended withdrawal due recent hack.",

I completely agree that keeping lots of crypto on exchanges isn't smart. However, withdrawing may not be the best solution for the OP given the amount involved. I don't know Binance's withdrawal fees, but losing a chunk of your funds to secure a small amount doesn't make sense. In my opinion, $10 isn't worth the hassle, so using Binance should be fine.Quote from: Makus on September 12, 2023, 05:58:28 PMHello guys congratulation to me, I just purchased my first  bitcoin... Hey there, OP! First off, congrats on your purchase. If you plan to continue investing, here's a tip: consider moving your Bitcoin to your own wallet whenever it reaches a substantial amount in your eyes, like hitting $100 worth of BTC. This way, you won't have to worry about your funds getting stuck on the exchange, and you'll save on fees by making one withdrawal instead of multiple smaller ones.",

      "body": "Huge amount or small amount of Bitcoin you buy is the same because it is the same but if you are going to compare it to huge amount then you can buy again in small amounts until you accumulated enough Bitcoin. It is indeed a good decision if you ask me to decide buying Bitcoin instead of buying other crypto that you aren't sure about it or not the best crypto there is. I also agree with the decision of not flaunting your wealth or assets online as it may compromise your wallet and may lose all your assets. Good luck mate qnd congratulations.",

I purchased the coin on an exchange but am looking forward to buy a Trezor hardware wallet for my coin storage.The journey of a thousand miles always start with a step so it doesn’t matter if the start up amount is small or big all that matters is you have finally purchased bitcoin. Purchasing it is one step and protecting it is another step which you must not play with if you don’t want to lose your bitcoins. I’m sure you must have learn about how to safe guard your coins and your keys. Just be careful with storing your assets on exchanges, they are not realiable and they cannot be trusted. Not long ago news came in about an exchange CoinEX being hacked, loosing 27 million USD worth of crypto which i think is now confirmed. that’s one of the reasons why you shouldn’t keep your crypto assets on exchanges.

The amount you bought doesn't really matter but what matters is the safety of your coins and you shouldn't leave them in an exchange because they are centralized and have control over your keys.Electrum wallet is good for you to use to keep your bitcoin based on the amount that you bought.

The only way this will be possible is if the OP contact other members off this forum himself or herself and that can be a very bad thing to do, because we can't tell the type of people that are on this forum. I don't have anything to hide on here because this forum has nothing to do with KYC and that's why I am loving it, if verifications are available then it's possible to become a target, also if this forum requires for phone numbers then it's another reason to become a possible target.Many Bitcoin whales addresses are available everywhere online, and nobody knows who they truly are, OP use a nickname to open his account so I believe there is no way to get your identity revealed, unless you do it yourself.",

It is good to have people like you in the Bitcoin society, people who can take risks with the little money that they can afford, although the amount of Bitcoin you have purchased is not the matter, but the real truth is that your Bitcoin is not in a safe wallet. You should try and send it to an ELECTRUM wallet just like as @Frankolala explained earlier. Please, next time you shouldn't disclose the amount of Bitcoin you bought, but now that you have removed it I believe you will not make the same mistake again.My advice to you is that you should never be in a rush to sell but be in a rush to accumulate more coins, especially this season when you are so comfortable buying your first crypto-currency (Bitcoin).",
