This is due to the new age investors, probably they are thinking that they are investors by themselves without even knowing what kind of risks they are taking. Luna project collapsed but in a week the developer created new and people went crazy for it, this just show how people are falling for the traps created by social media manipulation.",

Don't get FOMOed there as we have learned from the past and projects like LUNC isn't going anywhere. The remains of it is no longer good and if it's pumping, it's just all about the pump that he's taking but eventually, we'll see it start to drop.Otherwise, if it continuous to pumps, then don't catch the falling knives because it will not be forever at that situation.",

The mistake you will make is jumping too quickly into conclusions with mere assumptions and not the facts. The major reason why we are witnessing LUNC pump and why investors are trooping to it is because of the scheduled burn to start on September 12th.You can learn more about it here",

They should learn from the experiences of others who have had bad experiences with Terra Luna and will not try it. Or maybe they still hope to be able to benefit from the project. Too much speculation will make us even more confused. We can leave them to decide while we see what happens next.",

Expect the unexpected even Luna Classic did receive lots of negative sentiments and opinion but it cant really be removed that there's always the chance for these projects to be pumped.You would really be  boggling up yourself on what he hell is happening considering on how shitty these projects are.Same goes or opposite into those good projects which does have actual potential but still ending up on getting dumped or its price is on the floor which it would really be creating those questionson what the heck is happening into the minds of those investors on supporting shit projects and leaving the good ones.",

I totally agree with you that this is madness and i also have no idea why this is happening at the moment. I first noticed the crazy trading volume of Terra Luna Classic on Kucoin when i wanted to try out on of their trading bots for the first time and there the LUNC/USDT trading pair has the highest volume of all USDT trading pairs on Kucoin which i just can not understand. A lot of the trading volume on Kucoins obviously comes from the trading bots because that trading pair has a high volatility and huge volume which are both great things for a trading bot. That still does not explain though why the price of LUNC keeps climbing. I mean, who would buy that coin now?",

The possible update brings that hype again and many are still optimistic about what can happen to LUNAC if they succeed on that update. Though it’s already over bought and probably can drop any time from now but let’s hope that many are already able to sell and exit on that project after being trap for months now. I will take this carefully before dealing with LUNAC again, it can be another trap.",

Why are you surprised?, it is very clear that they have been pumping it hard right now. Most of the pump and dump groups will choose a coin to do their thing and obviously this is their choice so obviously everyone is riding on it, until it goes down hard again. There is no reason except the people doing it is looking to get more money, simple as that. If you want to join, you can do that, but just be careful and don't be greedy, if you have profited enough then take it already and don't wait for the price to continue to go up because there's no such thing as parabolic rise in crypto.",

Everyone is pumping, Bitcoin, ETH and the rest of the altcoin market, this is a sign that we are on the road to recovery after a bleeding that started this weekend.I haven't followed the news about this two coins, and so if there is none but the price is going up then you know what is the meaning of that, it's a pump and dump scheme.But if there is news and hype about something new or development in this project, then it's the anticipation of the investors.

Apparently, that is how manipulation and hype influence the market trend, or maybe a fake trade volume is also possible. It is really eye-catching and even surprising but I have no regrets about not investing in this coin for I have no trust in them anymore. But what I think is that this pump won't last long and a terrible drop can be possible. I have to say that the trap has been setup and losses are way possible for those who buy now.",

It is madness but there is nothing we can do, if people despite all the evidence that is circulating the Internet about those coins still decide to invest in them because someone else is doing the same then that is their call, even if we do not agree with the decision they are taking we must respect it, but having said that if those people lose their money and then they come to complain to the forum about it then we must be 100% honest with them and tell them they are completely responsible for what happened to their money, as they knew very well what they were getting into.",

If you already know this is a crazy project then don't ever try to put it on an investment list, what I'm trying to say is people expect too much hype, thus ignoring the level of risk they will accept. Although on the market, there are still many other coins that we can use.Expand knowledge about coins, then leave the ones that make us unprofitable, that's the safest way to get out of losses",

It is too risky to go along with this situation, putting money into unrealistic pumps and projects, I can really imagine how we lose our money. Well, I encourage holders to sell their Terra Luna if there is one and not invest in them again. We can't hide the fact that nobody was able to expect such a market spike without any reason. Something really fishy around this situation and you probably got it mate, this won't stay long. Might be seeing this surprising increase will turn into a huge decline leading to its dead.",

Just like other noobs in the market, when bitcoin is at $19k no one dares to buy for fear of falling more, but when bitcoin rises to $25,000 there will be a lot of people jumping in to buy for fear of missing the train. Likewise, people will buy Lunac when the price spikes, but they don't know that it's a price trap and the sharks will dump it from there.",
