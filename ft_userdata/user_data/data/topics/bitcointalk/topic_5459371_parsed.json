If you complicate the backup method, what will happen if at the end, you can not use the backup for wallet recovery?It is not only about you but for your loved ones if they need to recover your wallet if you suddenly pass away. It will be nightmare if you pass away and your wife, kids can not recover your wallet. If they need to find helps from other people, they will have more risk to lose your bitcoins. It is hard to trust anyone to recover a wallet from backup. If they have your keys, they can steal your coins and your wife or kids don't have anything to prevent it.",

Anything that has the possibilty of compromising the security of your coins should never be put to use. Afterall the tool is still very new, Uploaded two weeks ago, no one has been to use and analyse it properly to see if there are any cons in using it.If anyone is looking for a fun and secure way to store their private key/secret phrases then, they should try that of fillippone: Securing Your Seed Phrase with Washers.",

You can not print a colorful paper piece and use it for recovery if you don't know the HEX code.I don't see good convenience and safety with this colorful backup style. It is like I have to encrypt my seed phrase to colors which are hidden in HEX codes and later will have to decode it to get seed phrase. It is so complicated and inconvenience.If something is wrong with one or few HEX codes, the backup will be unusable. LIke if ff4219 becomes blurry, broken like I only can read ff4... and three last numbers are unreadable, I will have to try with so many numbers.

Let's  share our opinions on this When it comes to the security and safety of financial data, it is always better to stick to standard practices that are time-tested, well-reviewed, and widely adopted. For example, two months from now, a malicious developer may decide to slightly change the encoding algorithm to make all existing color backups impossible to decode. Given the low adoption of this encoding scheme, you are risking to lose access to your funds because an old version of code may be unavailable.",

You can use any solution for your seed phrase as long as you feel it's safe for you, you don't have to follow others.

If that implementation disappears, would you remember how to recreate the process and recover your seed phrase from your color palette? Probably not.You cannot print out your colors, since no printer will print the exact accurate hex color and no scanner will scan in the exact accurate hex color, meaning any printed back up is worthless. This limits you to either storing the hex colors electronically which is a security risk, or writing them down by hand. If you are going to write something down by hand, it is much safer to write down a human readable seed phrase where one or two incorrect characters is still easily recoverable, than it is to write down a string of hex numbers where one or two incorrect characters may lead to permanent loss of your funds.No one should use this.",
