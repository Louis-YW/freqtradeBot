I have not noticed any complain about the site to seize customers money, not because I wear the casino site signature, but I have not seen any new opened thread about someone complaining about the site.  Maybe I means one or two, I am not quite sure.But you can not only blame casinos, you should also blame customers for not abiding to the rules.",

Can you show me a thread that never had any reputation issues on this forum?Imho every post praising a casino/business and every post calling a business to be scam, all have to be taken with a grain of salt.Various crypto casinos did/do offer faucet or various bonuses. Some tend to abuse that money. Some use multi-accounts or other tricks attempting to cheat. When caught they call the casino scammer.Sometimes bugs happen in casino software, leading to friction and, again, calls for scam.And sometimes the casinos do try to scam.A special mention is the KYC rules, some users hide behind VPN trying to avoid the rules, some casinos hide behind KYC rules trying to milk some easy money.As I said, both parts have to be taken with a pinch of salt. Nobody is perfect, but also there are some good casinos too around here.",

      "body": "Not all casinos have bad intentions. It depends on which casino you play at and what the reputation is like. Then you also have the fact that not everything is a bad intention. A casino that does not pay out within 24 hours does not necessarily mean that it is a bad casino, for example. It depends on how the user is in it. A payout is most important for the user to receive it as soon as possible. You could also think of certain limits when gambling, which is also very annoying for certain users if they want to bet high.",

The problem is that a lot of gamblers are degenerates trying to earn a free ride. There are members here who literally make it their job to harass companies and demand extortion payments to stop. It’s a shame and I’m not sure if any of these casinos ever pay off these troublemakers, but you should take everything with a grain of salt.",

Can you show me a thread that never had any reputation issues on this forum?As a business, it's hard to please all its customers. So you will always find multiple allegations against any casino. Especially without the presence of a regulatory body, the numbers are higher than in land-based casinos. So it's always good to go through their ANN thread and the scam acquisition section before choosing a casino for playing. But don't expect a casino without any single issues unless that casino is very new in the market. Look for the withdrawal problem. If you see there is a bad history of suspending withdrawals or freezing accounts without any justified reasons, avoid them! That's why you will see a lot of gamblers are actually active in Bitcointalk. They get to know the latest information about any crypto casinos from this forum which they actively consider before choosing a casino for gambling.",

Can you show me a thread that never had any reputation issues on this forum?Be reminded that handling a casino can be a double-edged sword- expect lots of complaints and allegations against them. Since what is involved is money, it is nothing but natural for people to complain against a certain casino. But the determining factor is the amount of evidence a person has against a certain casino.Every casino will always have that one person who incurred delays on payments, etc. as nothing is absolutely perfect. Even the most trusted cryptocurrency casino had already faced a similar issue- but the difference would be on the amount of evidence a certain person has against a gambling website.",

I would say there will be no funds frozen or account banned if users had read the TOS carefully and if they are not abusing the casino. Not unless the accusation is true, there are cases that casinos do this to avoid paying their users. But trusted casinos stick to their TOS, and we must face that there are users who abuse casinos' promotions or even avoid KYC due to country restrictions and yet use VPN to gamble.",

Very often it happens that the casino user himself has not figured out the rules unknowingly violates them, but the casino acts at its discretion and most often such users are banned. After that, you can hear a lot of angry stories from them, but only without providing the community with hard evidence.Of course it happens that the casino violates its rules, but it is better not to mess with such casinos. In addition, the Internet still uses black PR, so even some casinos with good reputations have anger stories.So my advice is to read casino feedback and believe only the facts, not gossip.",

I certainly don't disagree that most seem to have complaints of some kind, but I also think we have to look at the people who are doing the complaining pretty closely too.  I think some of it is just miscommunication, not understanding the rules etc.Now don't get me wrong there's plenty of accusations which stand true, and thankfully we have an avenue to expose those here on the forum.",

Can you show me a thread that never had any reputation issues on this forum?You should appreciate that people get very angry when they lose money and often feel aggrieved because of it. There are definitely some legitimate complaints out there when it comes to casinos and it requires a fair look at each individual case, however I would hazard a guess that many of them are just disgruntled customers who cannot accept that they wasted their money and are looking for a way to get revenge against the people who took it. Anyone who does just a little research and has a basic comprehension of mathematics will understand that given enough time casinos simply do not need to cheat, they are designed from the ground up to take money from customers due to the advantage each game gives them.",

Every one has their own set of shortcomings and things that they completely lack. What sets good gambling companies from bad ones are in my opinion, how they deal with customer painpoints. There are casinos whose complaints of their customers fall on deaf ears, and there are some who go above and beyond in making sure that the customer's experience is turned around for the better. You should look out for these types of casinos because when push comes to shove and things go awry, you can always rely on these casinos to help you when you are in need and not leave you hanging.

I can choose a casino and become their loyal player without making a change for whole year as long as they don’t disappoint or deprive me of their services, it is also possible at the same time that another player from the same casino can choose the same but may encounter one or two problems that is sometimes above their power and it may be as a result of the player trying to outplay their terms and conditions.You made mention of withdrawal delays, I think these are process manually and the reason why I think these may occur can be as a result of either the technical team in charge run into issues or the player has been flag suspicious if they don’t see transparency in the history of all his bets. These can result when they suspect a player doing dubious things on their casino.",

A casino can ignore accusations or respond in a thread. There are many false accusations too where someone starts a thread but fails to provide proof of misconduct. I am more on this thinking, as long as the casino resolves the issues on hand without delay, then that's fine.Also, some issues or complaints were not the casino's fault but the player himself. So you need to read what the complaint is all about because definitely, you can't please all players. At some point, the casino will deal a troublesome player, who doesn't read the ToS of the site.In my opinion, if the casino resolves such complaint in a satisfactory manner, then, I wouldn't consider the casino as problematic.A business can't always run in a smooth manner continuously without any bottlenecks encountered.But if they can overcome such bottlenecks successfully, it will earn credibility from the community.",
