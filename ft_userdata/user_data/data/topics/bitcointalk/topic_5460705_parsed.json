But OP, on the title it's $60 but in the topic you are asking for $100. Which is the correct amount?With the case of peanutswar recently which his account is high rank that earned enough merits too, I think we should start making sign message as a must for taking a loan since the account might be  hacked without a trace. I’m not accusing OP is hacked right now but he has no record of loan history on hist trust page and it’s better to play safe. Actually I mention on my post that has enough merit to be considered for a loan grant.",
