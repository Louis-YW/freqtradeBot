Thank you.Bank transactions and Bitcoin transactions don't work the same way; with bank transactions, you cannot check the number of confirmations the same way you can with Bitcoin on the Blockchain explorer. In a bank transaction, you will just see a notification of the transaction being successful but can't check the success rate. If the bank network is bad, you might get debited, but the receiver will not get credited, and after some hours or minutes, you will receive back your money. But for Bitcoin transactions, you can go on the Blockchain to trace the level of confirmation your transaction has received, depending on the wallet or platform you are using, but if there is no single confirmation on your transaction for like four, five, or more hours, the Bitcoin you are sending might fail and your Bitcoin will come back to your wallet. There is a difference between a bitcoin transaction and a bank transfer.For banks, the transaction can be successful, and you will even be debited, but the money could get reversed to you, and the receiver will not get the money you sent.For Bitcoin transactions, if the transaction status has changed to \"Completed\" after some number of confirmations, there is no way the bitcoin can be reversed to you.Awaiting confirmation of bitcoin transactioncompleted bitcoin transaction.You will also get a Notification when the transaction fails.I also had a case where I sent money from my bank account to a client; I got debited, but the client did not get credited, but after like 24 hours, the money got refunded to my account. You can read about it here. This bank transaction issues is not experienced in some countries.Quote from: LoyceV on May 10, 2023, 11:28:47 AMAlthough true, for most practical applications 1 confirmation is enough.

Thank you.In the case of fiat transactions, once the transaction has been processed and confirmed, it is more difficult to cancel or change it.  If a problem occurs, as in your case, you should contact your financial institution's customer service to resolve the error and request a refund or correction.  However, the process can take some time and there may be complications depending on your financial institution's policies and procedures. As for Bitcoin transactions, the system is based on blockchain technology and has some significant differences.  Once a Bitcoin transaction is submitted and included in a network-confirmed block, it becomes part of the blockchain and cannot be directly reversed or changed.This immutability feature is one of the main properties of Bitcoin.",

But do not accept a transaction that has no confirmation only means a warning to people, to let them know that there is a possibility of cancelling an unconfirmed transaction in a way that the recipient can lose through spend double attack, or during mempool congestion if the mempool is full and the fee used is too low to make the transaction to stay in the mempool but dropped, a means that the sender can decide to spend the coins to another address. Because a transaction is risky to be accepted as successful does not mean that I can not accept such a transaction from my sister, but just because I trust her.

However, they don't allow users to withdraw after that deposit transaction has like 1 confirmation minimally.Risk consideration and accepted confirmation in recommendations from Jameson Lopp (but each person, each platform has to make decisions).How many bitcoin confirmations is enough?QuoteIf you are patient enough to wait for at least one confirmation then you are no longer vulnerable to race attacks or Finney attacks. Now your only concern is 51% attacks. What's the rule of thumb for an acceptable number of confirmations?1 confirmation: sufficient for small payments less than $1,000.3 confirmations: for payments $1,000 - $10,000. Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000. Six is standard for most transactions to be considered secure.10 confirmations: suggested for large payments greater than $1,000,000.Bitcoin confirmation risk calculator",

It's possible that the network becomes congested and the unconfirmed transaction is dropped from the mempool. It's also possible that the sender makes a double-spend and invalidate the unconfirmed transaction.",

Amount of fee a transaction pays (and fee rate) is one of the factors that can be used to determine the risk of accepting a transaction. There are other factors to analyze such as the parents of the transaction and whether they are confirmed or not. Another would be analyzing the transaction to see if there is anything non-standard or uncommon in it that would lead to miners not be willing to pick it up.And some more. With these things one can use some sort of scoring system where 1 is super risky while 100 is risk free. Then the closer the \"score\" is to 100 the safer it is to accept.",
