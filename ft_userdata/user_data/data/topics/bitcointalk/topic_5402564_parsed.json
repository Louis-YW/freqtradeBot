  "content": "Can we influence the lowest limit of crypto fluctuations and our peace of mind?The price of bitcoin consists of two factors: technical and human. If technically (programs and hardware) everything works fine, then the price of bitcoin will depend on the human factor. The floor price of bitcoin will be determined by people's trust in bitcoin and the penetration of bitcoin (crypto) into everyday life. In order for the level of popularity to grow, it is necessary that transactions with bitcoin take place. The speed of government action to tax bitcoin transactions also depends on the level of popularity of bitcoin in everyday life. Right now, bitcoin mainstreaming depends on government action on taxation and the willingness of people to negotiate bitcoin prices in a highly volatile market. The willingness and ability of people to negotiate prices in a volatile market would push to the development of the crypto application environment. Raising the lower level of bitcoin fluctuation would reduce the risk of fatal losses.",

Can we keep the natural volatility but raise the level to which the value of the currency falls?Any investment will have volatility, it depends on which asset it's since some asset do have low volatility, while the other are high volatility.You wanted to control Bitcoin and there's a limit of each day how much the Bitcoin can drop or increase? well that's against of Satoshi vision who make Bitcoin is decentralized, it's pretty much like a stock who have a limit on each day.",

      "body": "Technically every product get the value based on demand and supply even though a product with zero usecase can have the price tag of million dollar so what determines the price is actually the holders of Bitcoin. The transactions are happening all the time and government shown interest in the taxation but not really towards the decentralization so the future is still uncertain when we talk about government accepting it as legal tender but one thing is Bitcoin is going to stay alive even though governments are against it.",

And as it shows, bitcoin is proven to be volatile, so again, it will always fluctuates regardless if we are in bear or bull market or some big shot crypto influencers says something about the market that can sway investors. So there are underlying factors, yeah maybe technical and others look for fundamentals.",

Fluctuations can't be controlled and despite there's a market manipulation.You can't still be free from this, that's the reality. Because no matter how hard you want it badly to reduce the risk and potential losses, volatility has been the nature of bitcoin.",

The willingness and ability of people to negotiate prices in a volatile market would push to the development of the crypto application environment. It is not a bloodbath because of government action on taxation, interest rates anything from government. If you see the Bitcoin chart, you would see the correction must happen. It must happen just in one way or another. The trigger for correction can be from government or pandemic, whatever. And it is not a real cause of correction. The real cause is price grows too much and it must be pulled back to prepare for a new cycle.It's not negotiation on the market. It's not a story or balance between supply and demand. Just a zero sum game between market makers and retail investors. A game of bet and liquidation.QuoteRaising the lower level of bitcoin fluctuation would reduce the risk of fatal losses.It is best to stay beyond the market for a while.",

      "body": "It is always the human factor. The bottom line of Bitcoin's price fluctuations is always the people, their decision to sell, buy, or HODL.Sometimes I don't understand why the demand is so weak when the mainstream currency is much weaker. I understand that a lot of people are in need of cash right now but I doubt this is the single biggest factor that drove all these dips. It must be emotion that is driving all this. And perhaps failure to understand the technology.Of course there all kinds of talks about regulations and taxes and bans, but those have been in existence for a long time. As a matter of fact, the governments' enmity against Bitcoin is at its highest years ago. I mean, we only need 19 million out of 8 billion people around the world to own a single Bitcoin and this bear market is all over. And this is very possible despite Bitcoin's lack of use in everyday life. People only need to realize the madness about fiat and Bitcoin becomes the thing.",

Do you have a plan? It is extremely difficult to achieve in a global market like bitcoin. Had it been a local market, it would have been easier to control the people around it but for a global market, it's impossible to control. That's where bitcoin is unique from all other traditional assets. It can't be governed by a central authority, it can't be controlled either. It's a free market where anyone and everyone can participate. That's how the demand is determined.",

You got a point here but I don't totally agree here because there are a lot of possible triggers why the mainstream is still low and the price is really volatile. It will not always be the government because we all know Bitcoin si decentralized even if there is government or no government, Bitcoin will work, you still can use it.The only downside is the government or media when they start talking negative things or imposing such laws about Bitcoin but the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, no one can stop it or control it.",
