One thing that I don’t like about this notification is if someone that you didn’t like reply or mention on a post that you didn’t want to read. There’s no feature back then to exclude user by notifying which defeats the purpose of ignore button feature of the forum. To be honest, the notifier on telegram is a bliss for a thread starter because you will become updated on the comments that being address to you in regards with the topic. I hope forum will have a notification function instead of relying to 3rd party apps just to get a notification.",

There’s no feature back then to exclude user by notifying which defeats the purpose of ignore button feature of the forum. That's not true, though. There is an \"ignored users\" and \"ignored topics\" feature right in the bot's menu.Quote from: TryNinja on May 16, 2020, 10:43:40 AM- Ignore members or topics so you don't get notifications from them.Quote from: Maus0728 on March 11, 2023, 07:22:07 AMTo add, I am also using what LoyceV has made in the past for monitoring the topics or posts created by specific forum members[1]. And as far as I know, Tryninja is also planning to add a similar feature to his Bitcointalk Supernotifier bot, but I am not sure when it will be implemented.It's already live. You can track/follow users (by new posts/topics) and even boards (new topics).Quote from: TryNinja on February 27, 2023, 09:49:23 AMNew update!- Added Tracked Boards: get notified for new topics made on specific boards (e.g topics made in the Meta board and its children boards).https://talkimg.com/images/2023/05/13/blob0874fb0d8291f5f9.png- Added Tracked Users: get notified for new posts (or only new topics) made by specific users.https://talkimg.com/images/2023/05/13/blob8de6c6975cfaef1a.pngJust run /menu to get the new version of the menu.Let me know of any bugs, this is mostly still WIP.",
