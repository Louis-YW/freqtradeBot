  "content": "Heya!I was wondering if there is a specific career roadmap in cybersecurity that is related to Web3 or cryptocurrency in general. I mean, with the introduction of blockchain technology, it's kind of difficult to think about how cybersecurity will contribute to mitigating threats presented in blockchain since it is immutable by itself.As for my background, aside from my hobbies in digital arts, I am a graduating student taking a 4-year computer-related course, and I have decided to pursue a career in cybersecurity, which I know is a vast and difficult field, especially when finding an entry-level job. Since I am also interested in Bitcoin, I think pursuing a cybersecurity career closely related to Web3 applications or crypto, in general, is a good idea. I am currently taking the newest Google Cybersecurity Certification, though!Any input would be appreciated!",
