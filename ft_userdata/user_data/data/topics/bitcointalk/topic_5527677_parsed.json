  "content": "For those who truly understand his importance, feel free to share your insights. I notice a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon, treating Ross like some kind of hero. The reality is, this guy was convicted for running a platform involved in illegal drugs, weapons, and other unlawful activities, which led to him being sentenced to double life imprisonment plus an extra 40 years. Recently, he was pardoned by President Trump.Given that, it’s clear he isn’t exactly the \"good guy\" some might think. But what’s interesting is why he remains so relevant today despite his past. Being relevant in this context likely means he has gained the love and support of many, with people donating millions to him. That level of support suggests there’s something about him that resonates deeply with others. It would be great to help the community understand what makes him so special now, even if his past actions paint a very different picture.",

      "body": "It’s nothing personal, but it’s about Ross’s significant contribution to Bitcoin’s transaction system. The problem was, his platform was used for illegal activities. However, the sheer volume of transactions on Silk Road played a big role in making Bitcoin popular. Back then, the government didn’t see Bitcoin as something with future potential, they were against it because they couldn’t monitor the transactions. That’s why Ross ended up in jail, given his major role in Silk Road.But those days are long gone. Silk Road is now part of Bitcoin’s history, and ironically, the US, which confiscated Bitcoin from back then, now benefits from its current value if they decide to sell it. In my opinion, the time Ross served is enough to pay for his mistakes. Now that Bitcoin is mostly used for legitimate transactions, it’s a sign of how far the space has evolved.",

This was the root of Bitcoin’s bad reputation back in the day when people associated it solely with illegal activities. But we can’t ignore the massive transactions happening in the market at that time, even though the US eventually shut it down. That didn’t stop Bitcoin, it had already proven itself as a decentralized asset with immense potential for transactions.Fast forward to today, and we’re seeing big companies adopting Bitcoin. Its beginnings may not have been ideal, but the progress and development have been remarkable. And no matter how controversial it is, Ross Ulbricht deserves recognition as one of the key figures who help create more Bitcoin transactions with his platform.",

Did Ross deserve to go to jail? Yes, did he deserve two life sentences plus 40 years, hell no. It’s not unfair in the eyes of regulators, considering that his platform facilitated a lot of illegal transactions, everything from weapons to illegal drugs, and even, possibly, prostitution. All those activities thrived because of Silk Road, and without it, they likely wouldn’t have had the same reach.Maybe the government now sees that Ross’s original intention was to create a free market, which aligns with the push for decentralization back then, away from the eyes of government control. But it got out of hand, and that’s why regulation became necessary. If we want Bitcoin to truly prosper, a level of oversight is unavoidable, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing now.",

That situation its punishable offense especially that he didn't regulate his platform well and he let those illegalities happen on his platform then also earn with it.But if we look on other side where people seek about right to have freedom well I this is what they are looking for.

There are ton of credible info about that, and compared to evidence of Luigi murdering CEO for example, those hired murders seems 100x more credible.I have always wondered why bitcoiners lift notorious criminal men that are somehow only \"victims of censorship\" on a pedestal? Trump, Musk, McAffee, just because they are rich and bitcoin somehow needs their power? Seriously? What was wrong with sticking to Andreas Antonopoulos? Too hard to pronounce and too intelligent? Was the problem that he wasn't spoiled by money and that he was accused of zero rapes? Not everyone famous involved in crypto is good publicity. In fact these people are the ones who can do damage, that people don't want to associate with, for years to come.Here's a nice little documentary for people praising Ross -> The dark side of the silk roadAnd here's some more interesting reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht#Court_proceedings",

I personally do not consider him a prisoner in any way, but I take into account two important facts that can explain the current state of enthusiasm in the crypto community; First, Ross was a real supporter of Bitcoin and was one of the first to use it as a primary payment system on his platform, which made the network more dynamic and active, supporting miners and the prosperity of the emerging market. Second, the mistakes he made are not worth all that time in prison. If Ross founded and managed a platform for suspicious products, the authorities did not prevent the platform’s users from continuing their activities after Ross was arrested, and today we have many platforms on the same network that provide more criminal services and we have not heard that the authorities intervened to stop them. I agree with the need to release him as someone who spent a long time in prison that is not commensurate with the mistakes he made, but I am against making him a hero because he made it easy for drug dealers to distribute their goods.",

In prison he realized the damage drugs were doing and he changed his mind.Given that he was no longer a danger to society, and that he had shown in prison that he was a good person, notably by raising funds with his art for the children of prisoners, it was important that he be released. Life in prison is a kind of slow death, a nightmare.He's going down in bitcoin history, not in the best way no doubt, but this time he's got big things to achieve, no doubt because he's an intelligent person.
