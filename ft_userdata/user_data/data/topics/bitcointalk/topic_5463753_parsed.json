  "content": "I'm ready to trade a small amount of BTC to XMR to test Monero's system because it's supposed to be a privacy coin. I don't know what happens in functions which makes XMR private so I'm trying to learn. I've downloaded Bisq but didn't use it for my thread. For Win 11 I've used Unstoppable. Others were online instant exchanges Changelly, Changenow & Exch.cx.You'll see rates differ in swappers. When you're exchanging you're looking for top rates but what else's important before sending to instant swappers. Which instant swappers are you recommending?",

But, if the trade goes wrong you have the option of posting from your main account.*Getting back to the 'never' get as good a rate, if you try long and hard enough you might, but then it begs the question of if it's worth the time to do it for an extra 1 or 2 %-Dave",

It's a risk ppl take getting funds frozen if they'll go for the best prices not checking risks involved. I'm putting privacy ahead.Quote from: Findingnemo on August 20, 2023, 02:48:27 PMHere is a site https://orangefren.com/ which you can use to compare the deals offered on different swap exchanges.Thanks this one's helpful. Orangefren's rating from kycnot.me indicates swappers to use but any which can freeze funds isn't an option. Orangefren's 0.1 BTC capped Unstoppable for 17.13978178 XMR.FixedFloat's for 17.47379494 XMR so that's a surprise.Quote from: DaveF on August 20, 2023, 05:39:58 PMWith that being said, my question is are you looking for more privacy or better rates or I've thought about this it's privacy. If I'm going to use Monero to study why it's a privacy coin the rate doesn't matter because I'm holding a small amount of bitcoin from my sig campaign. I'll want to swap some for XMR.Quote from: DaveF on August 20, 2023, 05:39:58 PMAlthough some people don't like them, and they are not instant I have been using https://tradeogre.com/exchange/XMR-BTC on and off for years and they never asked for more then an email address.Thanks it's another new name to more learn about.",
