  "content": "This first series of the São Satoshi dos Milagres collection is composed of 6 NFTs, the first is zero and the others from 1 to 5. Each NFT is equivalent to a real image of São Satoshi, made by an artist from Santa Catarina.The NFT bearer or carrier will also receive the image, if desired. We will ship all over Brazil and abroad, if the buyer lives outside Brazil. The shipping method must be agreed later.The NFT holder will also be able to participate in the next editions of BITCONF, held over the next 5 years, as a VIP guest.The image of São Satoshi appeared for the first time at VI BITCONF, at the World Trade Center in São Paulo. It is a joke, obviously, where the image of Dorian Nakamoto, \"discovered\" by News Week was used to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Of course it became a big meme and now it has also become São Satoshi Nakamoto.To see the images, access the BITCONF profile on Instagram instagram.com/bitconf and to bid, access www.bitconf.com.br/nftSales of this first series end today.",
