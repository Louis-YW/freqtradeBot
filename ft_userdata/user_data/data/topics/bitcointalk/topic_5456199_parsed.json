You have contributed a lot to this forum through your articles and your merit generosity,you have been in the cryptospace for a very long time and you have 7yrs experience in CEX,it shows that you have all the knowledge on CEX. I was thinking of buying bitcoin through CEX this morning but when I read through this thread,I have to do it the way you have advised to avoid any issues on my transactions. Especially,that part that you said instead of sending in a huge sum for exchange,it should be done bit by bit. And also what you said on a new registered account on CEX,how to use it to avoid the account lock. You did pretty good on this...A stitch at hand will save 9. You are a good mentholKeep up with your good works in the forum.",

If i talk about my self, it been more than 2 years, i am active on this platform but my intentions and my understanding of crypto and to this platform was totally different and i did not contributed to this platform till my first post in my local thread. Point is, your efforts and time you put on this platform was totally valuable and helpful to all members. I wish you may live long a healthy, wealthy and happy life and stay more active on this platform and gain more respect and trust from the members. Plus, i have read your suggestions about CEXs and i do agree with all of your points and some points were totally new to me. Like:Quote from: Ratimov on June 13, 2023, 07:13:29 AM2. RegistrationI would not recommend registering exchange accounts by phone number, only through email. I never thought to remain anonymous with centralized exchanges, because you suggest to avoid usage of phone number for registration and most of the people (like me) prefer phone number because my mentality was, it will be more safer for us because when we will sign up using our phone number then exchange will trust us more. And you mentioned that we should also avoid the use of KYC and you have not made any KYC on any exchange then i am wondering how did you made p2p trades as many exchanges didn't allow that until you complete KYC, well i am so eager to learn about those exchanges which you have mentioned in another thread and i will look into them. This Usage of KYC point, is totally unique to me because i have always thought we cannot use any exchange without performing KYC and when we will complete it we can use all the features of those exchange with security levels.You definitely have put some work on all those mentioned topics of you and i wish you very very congratz for that and i hope you will keep growing and will remain motivated to contribute more to this platform.",

And do not forget to save and duplicate the 2FA key, because if you lose it and want to restore it, you will fall into 9 circles of hell of communication with technical support, and in this case you will also be forced to undergo KYC.2FA is very important to be used for exchange accounts, only password is not enough. But the 2FA app should be on a different device while your exchange accounts should be on a different device.2FA that synchronize with online as backup are not secure like those you will backup offline. People that are using online backup 2FA should know the risk. I will not point anyone to use online ones like Google and Authy authenticators.Quote from: Ratimov on June 13, 2023, 07:13:29 AMIf you try to enter the exchange from a new IP and withdraw your entire balance, then there is a very high chance that you may be blocked and forced to undergo KYC. Do not use free VPNs and cheap proxies for those exchanges where you have funds, keep your accounts and privacy much longer. People themselves provoke exchanges to additional checks, and then complain that exchanges suddenly introduce KYC for their account.I do not know about other countries, but IP address in my country use to change. Assuming you login again after some days or weeks or months after not login into your exchange account, do not be surprised if an email is sent you that a login from a different IP is detected.Quote from: Ratimov on June 13, 2023, 07:13:29 AM- If you buy a verified account, then select a choice similar to your geolocation and country. It will be very strange if you buy some account from Bangladesh, and you yourself will sit from a computer in the euro zone.This is one of the reasons I see no reason of buying an exchange account because you can easily create one for yourself. People that I think will make use of a bought account are either no allowed to use crypto or the exchange in their country or people that have online criminal act.",

Please note that if you register using a phone number, this number will now be embedded in all important functions when working with the exchange, any device change, security settings, withdrawal of funds will require SMS from you everywhere. This is one mistake I have made in the past that has affected me strongly as an early trader in the crypto space. And I have learned from it. Back then, before I actually learned how to reduce risk and identity protection, I saw the mobile number form of registration as the easiest, not until one of the exchanges stopped sending codes to my country number. No reason was given for that; some times it was actually from the network provider, but you never could tell when it was from the network or from the exchange itself. Another challenge for the mobile number registration option is that when you travel outside your country to neighboring countries, your SIM stops receiving service, which will be a greater problem.Such options should even be completely removed from registration means; they can be added as security measures that one can either choose to use or avoid.",

We probably also have different experiences. As for me, I could even say that in a hundred ICOs, 90% of them are most likely scam, unrealistic, shabby, unsustainable projects. I encountered so many seemingly promising ICOs way back in 2017 and 2018. Most of them are dead. The same is true with airdrops. Retrodrop wasn't a big thing before.

The portfolio is long-term, designed for ~3 years. I do not follow the development of altcoin projects at all, only the charts. Long term for me is at least 5 years.

No more than 20% of the portfolio is pledged for unprofitability and death of altcoins.I hope you'll prove to be right in the end, although I really think 20% is rather too low. It's too optimistic for me especially considering that you probably end up with around 150 projects. But I wish your portfolio the best of luck.

Not so much because of the wealth of experience being documented, but because it can be tied to a known frequent user, as opposed to random reviews online and what I call incidental or anecdotal records, which is wholly unreliable if you come in as a new user wanting a serious dig in to \"what to expect\".I want to add that experience probably differs greatly on your nationality. Myself, without revealing too much (I hint many times throughout my forum use as I also want to add my experience and help people who have my not-so-unique challenges), I find that my nationality has had a significant impact on my use of CEXs.To start off, I actually don't use CEXs so much, and rely heavily on p2p over the years, despite it being more and more difficult, it was helpful that I started on LBC in 2016 and the networks I still use today are built from the trust of these 6/7 years.Without going into too much detail (yet) -- the biggest reason I don't use CEXs is that they've slowly made it more difficult on the KYC for me. Since 2021, particularly, I've been subject to pretty heavy Proof of Source of Income and Proof of Asset (they use slightly different terms) checks. These range from straightforward tax documents, employment contracts, to pretty serious stuff like signing from depositing addresses (to prove ownership of the wallets I use to deposit). I wrote about it on some of the discussion threads but can't easily find them, but asking others, I actually don't know personally anyone else who's had to do this to keep their accounts.At the accounts I still keep, they actually request this annually. So this year, my 3rd time doing it on one CEX. And no, it's not even to do with value transacted. I hardly have 5 figure dollar annual volume on each!I'm surprised you didn't mention it, or is this also because you're not subject to them?",
