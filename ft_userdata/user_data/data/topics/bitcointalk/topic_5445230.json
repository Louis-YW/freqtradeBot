  "content": "I sent Â£77 worth of BTC i got from Kraken to my electrum which was already saved on kraken so I didn;t even have to copy or paste anything, my electrum address was already there so I just sent it, around 5 minutes after sending two transactions appeared on my Electrum, one for receiving and one for sending to another address, I didn't realised they were for receiving and sending until after they were confirmed, I just thought it was getting sent to me in two different payments, after around an hour, I checked electrum and those two transactions had around 8 confirmations and there was no BTC in my acc, one of the transactions was to receive it from Kraken, then the other transaction was to send to this address:1DRJ3pkdSXTgYh59Rv7yUUQBErhTJ5rskB and its the exact same amount I received, I don't think I was hacked on my electrum because there wouldve been a fee but there wasnt, I'm suspicious of kraken and I just want my funds back please someone help me out",

Say, a message when you tried to send a transaction?If so, what was your Electrum version prior to the update?That's because most versions from 2018 are vulnerable to phishing malicious messages from rogue public servers.Also, verifying its signature will clear all doubt about it being fake, guide: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-verify-your-electrum-download/You can download the signatures for old version in \"Previous Releases\" link in Electrum download page.",

That's why that address is no longer shown in \"Receive\" tab. This has nothing to do with the fund being stolen and unfortunately, there's nothing you can do.

There is a guide here on how to verify Electrum.Because I feel that you are using a fake Electrum. did you still know exactly the website where you download Electrum?",

I'm just trying to determine at what point your wallet became malicious, because you've obviously done similar transactions before, given that you had your BTC address saved in the exchange.What is indisputable is that the transaction reached your Electrum wallet, which means that the BTC address was still correct (no clipboard malware), but it is also indisputable that someone other than you had access to your seed/private key because he made outgoing transaction.Can you remember if you ever saw this or a similar message in your Electrum and did you update in that way?",
