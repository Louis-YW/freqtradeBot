I'd think the nft folks should be glad they are not taxed as collectibles... capital gains are 28% for them- ouch!Per that article: QuoteCollectables are taxed at a rate of 28%, compared to assets such as stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies which are taxed, at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on the seller's income.",

NFTs are no different from crypto currencies, it's just that they are not fungible and therefore not that liquid otherwise all the qualities are exactly the same so the tax treatment also is bound to be same. But best part is they are being taxed at 20% rate which is lesser than rate of tax in India which is exorbitant 30% flat without the benefit of any tax slab whatsoever.",

But best part is they are being taxed at 20% rate which is lesser than rate of tax in India which is exorbitant 30% flat without the benefit of any tax slab whatsoever. NFTs are very different from cryptocurrencies because they are not fungible.You cannot manipulate the price of bitcoin or ethereum, but you can very easily manipulate the price of your non-fungible NFT. This is a big problem for the tax authorities.I'm assuming a common situation like you have $100,000 worth of cryptocurrencies and $100,000 worth of NFT tokens. The price of the cryptocurrency in your portfolio has increased by $50,000. To avoid paying tax, you need to sell NFT tokens for $50,000.",
