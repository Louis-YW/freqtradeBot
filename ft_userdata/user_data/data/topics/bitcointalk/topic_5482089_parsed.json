Many people question the effectiveness and real security of this method, which although it seems promising, brings some insecurities, as no electronic system is proof of fraud or failure.Could blockchain technology solve this problem definitively?Would it be a good thing to apply this technology in elections and put people's future in the hands of blockchain?I personally believe more in the security of the blockchain than a ballot box made using technology that is subject to alteration and fraud, controlled by the government itself.",

I don't believe blockchain would help with such things as a centralised voting process. Blockchain seems to be more interesting in the financial and technological sectors.I'm not also grounded in coding but I have a strong feeling that blockchain technology could be of help but it will involve some kind of complex processes. The uniqueness of blockchain is in the integrity or data, making the election process decentralized where each citizen is assigned a unique identifier and access to cast a vote that is distributed and choice made available for public views even when the identifier is kept anonymous, this could actually lead to some sort of transparent election process. The challenge is if countries will have the political will to pursue this? Will the elites allow power to truly shift to the hands of the citizens?Your guess is as good as mine. Like I said, I'm still a novice as far as coding is concerned but I feel there is a possibility in deploying blockchain technology in electioneering process.",

On one hand, adding the voting system to the blockchain seems like a good idea because it's often seen as an open and decentralized system recording transactions publicly. On the other hand, there's concern that it could lead to congestion, similar to past issues with the ordinals. Elections, despite advancements like electronic voting, still face manipulation. Each vote added to a block requires validation by miners, which could be challenging for individual political candidates who might not want to pay fees just to cast their votes. Governments may be hesitant to adopt this due to blockchain's secure nature, and if they may want to rig the elections, they might not be willing to wait for potential changes that could be controlled by developers, risking delays in their election processes.",

And this has come clear in my country last year election. The Electoral Body promised to transmit the results online but when the time comes, it was manually transmitted and the opposition parties against it because there would re-write the results manually so it caused a big issue. And after the election, there was a conference held by the opposition parties and one of the presenters said, election results can be transmitted through Blockchain. And it would be more saver than any means. But I know politicians will not allow it because they can't manipulate it election again. But if really Blockchain is used in election, it will change the narrative of elections manipulation.",

Just like bitcoin is a currency that is superior to fiat money in many aspects, but governments and politicians always seek to ban it because they know that it will benefit the people but will threaten the their power.
