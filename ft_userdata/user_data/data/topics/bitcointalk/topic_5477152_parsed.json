People who are already working are finding it very difficult to survive with a single stream of income, how much more someone that is not working.Even if you are not all that skilled, use the one you already have to make some cash that will help you to depend on yourself for your upkeep.Everybody has his own challenge that they are going through and you don't want to add yours to it. Even the Bible when most of us believe in talk say if you no work make you no eat so na serious offense if you decide not to do something with your life no matter how good your excuse of not working his.",

That is usually the conditions of the dependants.It is literally said to be that you only gives what you have and not what you don't have, every dependants has a responsibility to stick to but at your point still a dependent in enslavely in need is your point of failures from responding to your responsibilities.Untill a man is foresighted to release what he is natured about being a man, he would always fell that relaxation even at the moments of rightful deprivation. It is uncalled for.A well planned man would always have the tough thoughts that yesterday was good, today is better while tomorrows that never ends would be the best of allnand get finding faults and strive to make it right. This is something that prompts and energies a man so he doesn't have to settle for less.Only man who knows how freedom of independence feels like is worth of striving at all costs to make a better living.",

We are in a digitized world now, almost everything is going digital so we need to make sure that we get the real update about things that's happening around us so that we won't be left behind. Another is for those of us that have connections and links should help others with the rightful information they need as there is joy seeing that you're the only one being successful why others meet you for money or help all the time what makes you a boss is your ability to lift others and show them the way to become successful just like you.",

This is letting your mind open for laziness and corruption. But meanwhile I feel that just few of the Nigerian youths prohibit this attitude as most are always huzling one way or the other, so for those who depend on their parent and relatives for financial aid 8s doing themselves more harm than good. What a person earns by himself is being managed very well than what is being given to him. His/Her parent might get late someday and will be faced with the dilemma of catering for one's self mostly to the men which will at one time become the head of the family and needs to perform so many functions which requires money, so it is best we become self dependent",
