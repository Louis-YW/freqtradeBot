I came across this story, and I'm not sure I understand everything.So, a court declared that $4.2B worth of customer deposits belong to Celsius, allowing the company to use the digital assets in bankruptcy proceedings. But what happens to the customers now? Will they ever get repaid?Source: https://app.getresponse.com/view.html?x=a62b&m=BVxpy5&mc=9I&s=BtgXWnG&u=QcLhh&z=ESSrIqt&https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/05/celsius-earn-assets-belong-to-bankrupt-crypto-lender-judge-rules/",

Also Im not sure if the money would be use for that purpose but definitely some of it will be credited for that, at least even fraction of money by the customers will be saved.But this is how the process works so sorry for those.

They don't want to repay current left funds to investors, so they can continue milking the 4.2$ billion through wages which are paid to the company's employees, including the CEO and his first tier team. They are earning more time to do this, so once the case is finished and they are sentenced to repay left funds to investors (probably in years from now), there will be only pennies left, because the rest of the money will be already gone to the scammers' pockets and to pay for operational costs of the business. Pennies are everything investors are going to retrieve.",

They are totally covered and protected by lawyers advisors. Since these companies deal with billion of dollars, they have the best (or the most unscrupulous) professionals by their side. And as we already have an example of how judges act in such cases, it's really better to avoid lending platforms for passive income investments, because after all, the justice isn't going to defend investors, rather it's going to decide in favour of the scammers.",

Feel sorry for those who lost their money in Celsius, but that's how crypto is without any regulations. Companies will create a platform, put some interesting feature and then when shit comes out, they will just say shit things and will just file a bankruptcy. Just look at SBF now.

Maybe a small amount for those who used FTX lend but most users never agreed to lend out their crypto.Gemini earn however is in the same situation. All people there lent out their crypto to earn a yield and the judge for that case might also deed the same outcome.So far no chapter 11 yet but the way dcg is handling all of this most likely it’s the path that will be taken.",

Unfortunately, who does even read an ToS/TnC and Privacy Policy, those two documents might be the biggest lie on the internet. And for those who are wandering about the particular ToS parts, ask yourself whether such a ruling is probable or not. Here is the snipped parts I quoted, the emphasis is not changed:QuoteThe Debtors contend that the Terms Version 8 are explicit and unambiguous with respect to the ownership of Earn Assets. (Amended Motion ¶ 3.) Terms Version 8 states the following:In consideration for the Rewards payable to you on the Eligible Digital Assets using the Earn Service . . . and the use of our Services, you grant Celsius . . . all right and title to such Eligible Digital Assets, including ownership rights, and the right, without further notice to you, to hold such Digital Assets in Celsius’ own Virtual Wallet or elsewhere, and to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time, and without retaining in Celsius’ possession and/or control a like amount of Digital Assets or any other monies or assets, and to use or invest such Digital Assets in Celsius’ full discretion. You acknowledge that with respect to Digital Assets used by Celsius pursuant to this paragraph:1. You will not be able to exercise rights of ownership;2. Celsius may receive compensation in connection with lending or otherwise using Digital Assets in its business to which you have no claim or entitlement; and3. In the event that Celsius becomes bankrupt, enters liquidation or is otherwise unable to repay its obligations, any Eligible Digital Assets used in the Earn Service or as collateral under the Borrow Service may not be recoverable, and you may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with Celsius’ obligations to you other than your rights as a creditor of Celsius under any applicable laws.With such agreement from both parties, the debtors and creditors, I think the probability of the ruling being discharged is unlikely.",
