If this happens, it is modern slavery.I knew these guys were scared of the freedom and privacy Bitcoin gives to people but I never imagined the length they'd go just to keep having control. With her real intentions camouflaged under the guise of protecting Americans from scam, I think we know the real motive",

The most famous example of this is freewallet.If this is what the bill aims at, then there will be no difference between these wallets and crypto exchanges.As for traditional (custodial) wallets, how can they apply regulatory restrictions to them, especially if their developer is anonymous and they are open source?",

Even I personally back then couldn't immediately grasp the concept of non-custodial money. We've simply just been so accustomed to custodial everything that custodial services is pretty much the norm.^And we all know how stupid politicians can be a lot of times.",

Not crypto exchanges, mind you, but the wallets themselves.I could be wrong but if my memory is well, it was raised a few years ago like in either 2019 bear market or 2020. Now it returned but let's sit down and think about it.There are two types of wallet: Custodial vs. Non Custodial Wallets - \"Not your keys, not your coin\" Explained.Even without Elizabeth Warren, we already know about the big lesson \"Not your keys, not your coins\". It is just we really practice it for our coins or just listen, read, watch it and forget about it immediately or a few days, weeks later.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsIf you have your keys, you have control of your coins fully. You don't have to worry about E. Warren and any similar proposal.",

I remember that these law makers have no sense at all and it was during when Mark Zuckerberg was summoned and ask for funny things in the congress or senate(cmiiw) about how they're gathering data. It seem that they're like kindergarten that don't do any further research before the investigation. It's also the same with the hearing that they've made for the TikTok CEO. The senate is becoming the entire circus with these regulations they're trying to propose.",

Not crypto exchanges, mind you, but the wallets themselves.Somehow the contents of Elizabeth Warren's grandmother's mind, I think maybe it's like she doesn't have a key in her mind and heart. Because he has hated the crypto system that is currently running for a long time, even though if you think about it, this crypto system is very good and very efficient in managing transactions to make them faster and safer. But until now Elizabeth Warren's grandmother has not been able to open her heart and mind to study or explore this crypto system. Indeed, I also know, that not everyone on this earth has to like crypto. But in my personal opinion, if you really don't like crypto, go ahead. But don't incite other people to join in the anti-crypto ideology. But in essence, we as investors in crypto, don't take too seriously what comes out of Elizabeth Warren's mouth. Because I'm sure, this ideology will not have a big effect on crypto.",

The cosponsor of the bill Senator Roger Marshall is 62, so it's not the age but they are backed by powerful bankers and federal agents that are threatened by the ever-increasing popularity of decentralization. I think there are other Senators that understand the inevitability of privacy, so doubt if they will get the required vote to pass the bill into law.QuoteMore exchanges are getting regulated already, but some people just think there should be nothing called self custody and privacy.
