Why does the US government always want war, even though the people don't?The Antiwar Movement Roars Back to Lifehttps://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/03/ron-paul/the-antiwar-movement-roars-back-to-life/The speakers list included four former US presidential candidates and a broad and diverse collection of antiwar activists from beyond the left and right.The aptly-named \"Rage Against War Machine\" rally drew thousands of attendees, however many pro-war advocates eagerly pointed out that it did not match in size some of the larger rallies against the Iraq war 20 years ago.To that I say, \"who cares\"? The US mainstream media engages in war propaganda non-stop, with the only exception being Fox News' Tucker Carlson. So I think it's a miracle anyone had the courage to travel to the heart of the war machine in Washington, DC to make their voices heard! We don't need a majority to fight back – an educated and dedicated minority will do quite nicely. And we certainly had that at the rally!As I sat in the green room waiting to speak, I had the opportunity to visit with former Democrat presidential candidates Tulsi Gabbard and Dennis Kucinich and former Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Political commentators Jimmy Dore and Chris Hedges were there, along with many leading and well—spoken libertarians. Everyone backstage carried the same message: we must put aside our differences to build a new, broad coalition against this war!I believe the antiwar movement is starting to catch fire both at home and overseas. The DC rally was followed by much larger antiwar rallies in Paris, Berlin, London, and elsewhere....",

I believe it happened this very week.Also, It is an exaggeration to say that there has not been some anti-war movement in the United States, so far I have noticed that some hosts in Fox have called out  President Biden for allegedly providing weapons, instead trying to reach a peace agreement, so the conflict can deescalate, I assume many viewers of conservative points of view agree with that particular position.Besides the expending, which some politicians and the people of the United States, find to be out of proportion as the common person is struggling economically.Ukraine: Anti-war protests take place around the worldSource: https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-anti-war-protests-take-place-around-the-world/a-60930141",

Actually, competence between countries and companies has always been a thing, but now with the advance of technology and communication, we talk about globalization.There are defenders and detractors of this new order, while the distances between nations are shorter and companies now need to face competence worldwide, instead nationwide. I am not sure how one can change this actual trend, to be honest, countries who go for protectionism exist to this day, and we could argue that they are not doing very well or did not do very well. Not all countries are able to manufacture all the products they need, that is why net importers and exporters exist.https://www.statista.com/chart/18356/net-importers-and-exporters/",

Sorry, but you seem to have misunderstood or partially understood my idea. Stopping wars between countries once and for all requires a change in the global economic pattern as a whole, and I do not mean the Russian-Ukrainian war in particular. When the economic policies of countries change to a better system based on controlling resources, there will be no need to create conflicts and go to war.The economies of Russia and Ukraine are closely interconnected, and this did not prevent the outbreak of war, which took in a large part of the economic sectors as part of the conflict.",
