  "content": "Has it really been four years? It's hard to believe that what started as a practical joke all those years ago would get quite this out of hand, but here we are. It has led to so much mischief and controversy of the sort perfectly becoming of a fox: a gay prostitution and/or pornography scandal, me winning Miss Bitcointalk twice despite confusion* as to whether I qualify, and many more shenanigans both public and private (including this one). None of this would be possible without the support of my loyal band of foxhole felchers, followers, and wannabes (you know who you are). And so, as promised last year, I am celebrating by offering a new peek into everybody's favourite foxhole. (Peek linked offsite because SENSOR SHIPS.)*This thread should hopefully eliminate all pre-existing confusion and replace it with exciting new confusion. Admit it, this is what you all came here to see:ü¶ä GRATUITOUS VULPINE NUDITY ü¶ä(Image is very much not safe for work, unless you're talking about Measure B compliance - I always stay safe when engaging in this type of work.)Image copyright 2023 Foxpup. Model is over 18 years of age.(Alternative nude image link if Cloudflare's being... Cloudflare.)Now let's get this party started! üíìLocal rules: No transphobia, homophobia, trypophobia, etc. If you have a problem with certain kinds of holes, keep it to yourself; nobody's forcing you to look at them.EDIT: Added alternative image link using forum image proxy (hopefully theymos doesn't mind).",
