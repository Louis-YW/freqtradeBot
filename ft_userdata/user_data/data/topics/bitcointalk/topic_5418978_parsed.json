  "content": "Hello!Bounty and Ambassador programs often require you to create videos. These are video reviews and translations of videos from other languages.To do this, use a speech synthesis service with neural networks https://speechgen.io/Benfints:- Cheap. Speech dubbing by robots is hundreds of times cheaper than a voiceover from a studio.- That was fast. In less than 1 minute you can voice-over a text for a 10-20 minute video.- Profitable. Video content is loved by Ambassador programs. I'm a bounty hunter myself. Recently got $400 worth of tokens from Axelar for neural network voice-over videos.Try speechgen.io and earn more on the bounty.",
