For now we don't need to have your details or KYC when you want to signup. So we can ensure you are anonymous while playing poker with your peers. We have been around since mid 2021, and HunnyPoker was one of the earlier projects by Hunny. Other than poker, we have our crypto casino HunnyPlay as well. For more details on HunnyPlay.com you can check out our official thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422950 .One awesome thing about HunnyPoker now is we are giving out free prizes through daily FREE ROLL. And there is no need for anyone to deposit to get the prizes. FREE ROLL is now available only for the time being as we are getting more users, when we do have enough traction, we will consider taking this awayJust take note of the timing and register the games with \"buy-in\" as FREE.",

I have a few feedback. Is there an better timing for the free-rolls to be played? It seems that the timing is either too early during work hours or too late in the night. ...We are revising and combining the prizes soon. The timing of the free-roll will also be changed. We will update the community once its fixed.¬† ¬†Quote from: gambleman on January 16, 2023, 05:04:01 AM...There seems to be a few bots in free rolls playing with us, is there anyway to remove or restrict them?We have disabled same user with same IP address. That should deter some bots or user with multiple accounts.Thank you. A lot of bots are hindering me to play poker properly, especially for free-rolls.
