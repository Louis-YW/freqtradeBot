Your financial life should be kept secret from the eyes and knowledge of others. That way, you can rest assured of your own personal safety. It has already been said that time without privacy matters a lot. It's not just because you want to hide your identity, but for security reasons. If one starts broadcasting their bitcoin holdings, then there is no privacy attached to their investment; they can just add a name tag to all their addresses so that people will notice how wealthy they are in crypto. Only those who are looking for attention always share their holdings information, and their reason for such is what I can't really figure out as they always fall victim to either being killed, rubbed, or any sort of criminal assort.",

Because there’s a higher chance that you’ll attract people with ill intentions toward you just as what happened to the person in Op.And this is the reason why I always admire those that still go out of their way to publicize bitcoin; because if I should try to tell people what bitcoin is, even when I don’t have much in possession as long as I know what it is I’ll be categorized as a very rich person because they think only extremely rich people can have bitcoin and this is also an example of how one can be at risk for letting other know about their finance.",

That only works for people who have a moderate amount of wealth, when you move to a certain threshold, the money you're earning and the wealth that you've got is going to show and the only way you can be secure is hiring a security services and isolating yourself from others which is sad and deplorable as it's going to remove you the human experience as time goes on. Also, it's not entirely the fault of someone when they flex their wealth or celebrate the money that they've got, we are forgetting the fact that someone's committed a crime on someone because we want to force our ideals on others about not being a show-off, it's not a crime to flex your money or wealth anyways.",

This is not new. Actually it’s dumb to flaunt Bitcoin in public while the main goal of using Bitcoin is for decentralized transactions. Most of the people doing are those arrogant or someone who’s using his gain to attract other user to invest while benefiting on them through referral link.I have a lot of friends like this on social media and most of them promote ponzi after sharing huge holdings of crypto asset. Not only Bitcoin is subjected to this but anything that is valuable because you are attracting someone to rob you because you don’t who will rob you while they freely observe and wait for perfect opportunity to attack you.",

Lol, in the current decade, the most dangerous people are our relatives.They easily get jealous of our growth and continuously find ways to harm us in one way or the other.It's not just about bitcoin but we shouldn't disclose any of our assets to anybody (except for the one who can inherit our holdings).",

This is not only for Bitcoin ownership but also for ownership of other assets.We have to be careful not to arouse evil intentions from people we don't know. We should just act as we are and if we want to teach Bitcoin to other people, we just teach what we know and don't need to show them how many Bitcoins.In addition, by hiding the amount of Bitcoin we have, we can stay safe. No one will be suspicious or have evil intentions. It's better for us to be ordinary people who don't invite any suspicion from people.",

The world is wicked, and so is the heart of men, and that's why I will always keep respecting Satoshi for staying anonymous despite after Bitcoin got mass adoption and the price skyrocketed higher for his safety and other reasons best known to him/her. But however, financial literacy is one that I have noticed that most people lack after investing, and securing their funds, knowing fully well that no matter whatever relationship you may have got with anybody, when it comes to financial status, that's one thing you ought not to have reviewed to anybody, but yourself alone. As you never can tell who could hurt you tomorrow, since people changes everyday, and as such the only way to avert such scenario is to keep our finance private.",
