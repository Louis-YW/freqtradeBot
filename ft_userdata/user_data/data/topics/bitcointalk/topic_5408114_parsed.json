It has time to store deleted posts or PMs. Deleted posts will go to trash can and after a few months, they will be moved to forum archive. After a long time in forum archive, they will be removed completely.However, there are other sites can archive posts on this forum, longer or forever. They can be fake Bitcointalk forums too.Nothing is bad by deleting posts if a poster consider it is off topic, low quality or something.",

I don't think nationality is something I'd censor: if you don't want it known, don't post it. Bitcoin addresses are often used to prove ownership, so I don't want to censor those (the one I posted by myself was a mistake when copying a PM I sent). I'd probably censor email addresses and IP addresses when requested (but since it takes my time to censor data, I really hope people think before they post it.",

Seeing that such posts are below standard or they are off topic and in the quest to sanitise their profile they delete them.I am not a fan of that idea. I have never deleted or edit my pasts posts, I will only do that if I have promoted some scam projects unaware to me, when I become aware I can go delete them. But because of quality I won't delete or edit. Those are my days of little beginning and low knowledge, they should serve as my personal achive where I can visit in 5 years time and have a sweet smile.",
