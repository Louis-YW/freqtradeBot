The last time I tried it with my friends and we continue losing has been when I lost interest. It is on local sport gambling sites and I saw it on a foreign gambling site which I will not mention its name for not to advertise the site. I do not like doge race gambling because you can easily lose money there than win.",

I never bet on dog races and never heard of betting on it. A dog is a pet so everything can be done with it.  Its race is sure to be very enjoyable.  But it is very difficult to predict which dog will win by looking at the dog.  Gambling is very risky One thing I think betting on dog races would be very risky. There are many types of gambling so I can also imagine that betting on dog races can be a lot of fun even if it is risky.  However, if you want to bet for this, you should bet for fun and not for earning money",

Something I noticed about the dog racing which made me never interested about them is that they appear not to be probably fair due to to how  people that bets on it hardly win, particularly when a particular dog has the highest number of bets on you find out the dog doesn't do fine in the race. However if I get to find it on online casinos I'll give it a try and see how theirs could be.",

Don't you think a person interested in this kind of sport is also interested in a horse race?  If they do then, there is more horse race to chase than dog race. There are probably more dog show events these days than dog races. While this dog race is not very common you won't be seeing an event every day or on weekends. You might just go bet on a real horse race. Not the computer horse race but the real one.",

Did make out some research and these links might really be helpful for you.https://www.gamblingsites.org/sports-betting/sites/dog-racing/https://www.mardigrascasinowv.com/greyhound-racing/live-racingThis might not really be that in connected with crypto but somewhat if you are really that interested on betting with it then those links above might really be that relevant on your part.",

A racing association found that betting on greyhounds plunged from $3.5 billion in 1991 to about $500 million in 2014. Since then, many more tracks have closed.https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/greyhound-racing-nears-its-end-in-the-u-s",

Since we have Virtua soccer games same we can find virtual dog games too that can be pretty cool and give us some profits if we are very good at making predictions.",

Which are you referring to, because If it is the actual real life dog racing game you are referring to, then I will like to put to your understanding that organizing such a dog race is not that easy, as it requires you having a lot of high intelligent dog breeds to work independently, which are not always that common, unlike in the case is horse racing which involves the use/influence of humans. While secondly, due to the fact dog race is kind of not a regular game just like soccer, it makes it difficult having such on casinos.",

My guess is because it is just not as popular a sport so the participants are virtually unknown. In my area there are large dog betting tracks and growing up you’d always see events at fairs and things.",
