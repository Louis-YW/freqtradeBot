If the casino has their IP detectors and are strict, as you said, that's the beginning of 1000 ways of losing your funds in the casino. This is why, if the casino is not allowing the use of VPN, better not use it. Make sure you have read their ToS before sending any funds to them, otherwise, it will be your fault if you lose your funds. And if they are VPN-friendly, do you think you won't get any trouble if in case you win big? Some casinos will find loopholes not to pay.",

      "body": "You can view this topic in several ways. Today there are already sites that are so extensive and sophisticated that they can automatically detect and block the use of a proxy. I think it is mainly a matter of carefully reviewing and reading the general terms and conditions. Then you also have the problem that a VPN is only allowed in certain situations, there is still a lot of difference. By the way, to avoid problems with gambling sites, I recommend not using a VPN at all.",

Take citizens of the US for example most casinos place restrictions on that location, and anyone from that region uses VPN to bypass that restriction to play on the casino and run into problems that require verification with Id this can lead to a loss of accounts forever because of verification. This is why I discourage the use of VPNs.",

This has been what I just noticed, I use service provider IP address frequently for accessing gambling sites and I will not advice you to use VPN either.There is a difference between using a vpn for accessing an online gambling casino and storing your hard earned money on the same website. Why? Because I doubt they are going to care about every single random newbie account registering and logging on to their site and someone who puts funds on the site. From a legal standpoint, if they hold your funds, they are responsible. And I don't think they will stand by and watch you do whatever you want.I would not risk it. I think they will see if you use the same account with random IPs everytime.",

I have some friends before who are using VPN to gamble before and the result is not good for them, luckily they don’t have much money on the site and they are able to withdraw it before that problems occur. To OP, maybe there are still some site that works in your country even if you are not using VPN, just try to research it.",

When that happen then the chance of your account getting banned is high and possibly your funds in that account will be taken.

A lot of this might also depend on whether some sites ask for kyc before you deposit/withdraw. He can ask around his locality anyone from the community can get him quick response. Basically newly user can't find information so faster and quickly because they have restrictions on how much time to search and to make new post over here so I suggested he should locates their local board and asked over there to get the best response maybe someone from there might also been searching for same thing and they could get it over there.",

If they agree on your situation, then only make a deposit there and gamble.Right now I can’t name a site who allows players with VPN, but you can try stake.com .
