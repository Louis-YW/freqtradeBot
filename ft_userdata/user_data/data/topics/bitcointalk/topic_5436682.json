One should be careful the way at which they log into sites connecting their wallets all in the name of airdrop. Now the Airdrop scam pattern is if you have interacted with their site before you can claim a free airdrop for early adopters which is fake. They do this because previous mega airdrop such as uniswap used  that pattern for their adopters and beta testers and that was why it could be said that many got the airdrop with easy and now scammers are using that pattern to wanting to rake our people's funds off their wallets which I think would be difficult of only the people are aware of their gimmicks.  OP, you did well by unveiling this for bitcointalk  participants to see. With this, we can thread with caution if we come across such.",

Since these two airdrops were the most successful, there is disappointment among many who missed these two airdrops. Scammers have targeted those crypto users to scam. Scammers aim to gain access to crypto user's wallets, and this website was created with that in mind. If a crypto user connects his wallet to this website, scammers will get access to that crypto user's wallet. Newbies should keep this in mind to refrain from connecting wallets to any unknown websites other than bookmarked websites.",

Also, you have to check the end of the official domain and know if the domain of this airdrop ends with .com, .org, .net, etc., or is it a fake domain for a scammer? There are many sites that scammers create daily to target people who are looking for free tokens and every period they develop their methods, we have to be more focused and discerning and take enough time to do our research so that we are not an easy bite in the mouth of these scammers.",

The biggest mistake they make is that they don't disconnect sites after doing transaction which sometimes  leads to emptying of their wallet. Most of these users are not aware of crypto scam and yes It is greed that makes them blindly connect personal wallet to these sites. QuoteTrying to close these sites is good, but the ease of creating them makes this idea absurd.I hope to spread awareness because it is the fastest weapon.These sites are in large numbers and they also appears sometime in top when you search on Google. Once I searched for Metamask in Google to install extension and the first website appears was Metamask phishing scam site which was promoted. I wrote many times paraphrase but it wrong paraphrase error was displaying. When I checked the. I realized that it's a scam site. This was my first experience to Metamask phishing site.Awareness of these kind of scam are must . Binance academy have created some courses for this purpose to new users which made a great impact. I think this is not enough and there should be lot of work on this to aware all .",

Before you connect your wallet, always check the contract address of original coin & compare it with supposed airdrop coin. It is an important step to verify the authenticity of the coin. Additionally, it is also important to use hardware wallet, or a reputable software wallet with good security features and always secure your private keys in a safe place.",

It is easy to create hundreds of accounts using MetaMask or any ERC20 wallet, and therefore you can create a new account for each airdrop you want to subscribe to, and without much costs, you can avoid your wallet being emptied, I do not know, but it is either laziness or ignorance that makes individuals fall victim to this scam.Scammers are lazy but people's laziness with their money is what makes such scam profitable and therefore persistent.",

Thank you for the warning, yes this tool Revoke cash is very useful.Airdrops are the most popular way to attract victims because people like to get free coins easily, scammers are taking advantage of popular names like decentralized exchanges to attract victims. Therefore, you should always check the official websites before connecting any wallet.Phishing sites are becoming more common on the net and they are the most dangerous because they collect all sensitive information such as passwords and seeds, so it is always better to avoid airdrops that request wallet connection.It is a common mistake that some people use the same username and passwords of exchanges or other important sites when subscribing to airdrops, so it is very necessary when subscribing to airdrops to create a new empty wallet and a new email because they also steal passwords.",
