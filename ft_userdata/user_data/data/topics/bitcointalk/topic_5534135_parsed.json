  "content": "Bitcoin has been on a very long/short dip since the beginning of 2025 and it's has seem like a norm that we all don't care much about the little drop down from it's former ATH to this current price of $86k even though we do show concerns but perhaps with our believes and expectations of the 2025 bull run and using the the know patterns of bitcoin bull run the dips are still normal as long as it has not dipped below/above 32% according some guys.But then my major concern is the recent reaction of the market, after a tweet from Trump about the Crypto Strategic Reserve which he mentioned Alts as major Strategic Reserve before reconstructing to mention that he also love bitcoin and the mother of Alts Eth. Immediately after that bitcoin price rallied from $85k to $95k which is more like a 10% increase in less than 5hrs and now in less than 30hrs bitcoin has return back to its previous position of $85k.  This image displays a complete manipulation With all this happening I feel that the sudden reaction of bitcoin or the market generally is more of a manipulation it may seem very unlikely but from what I'm smelling bitcoin has left it's fighting stage with the former regime to a new phase of \"manipulation\"One of the biggest fear of a coiner (bitcoin) must be fear of bitcoin being manipulated one but perhaps it seems that we are likely to begin to face our fears as the Pro bitcoin or crypto regime is now a manipulative regime. This thoughts has been on me for quite some time now before the sudden reaction of the market which seems to point more to my instincts interpretation of Trump pro crypto statements during election and/or campaign.  This is just my opinion, your opinion might be different.",

If you don't know.Bitcoin price action mirrors 2019 ‘Xi pump,’ are new BTC lows incoming?It is just the news for you, but I disagree with the news title because 2019 is a bearish year, and 2025 is a bullish year. The writer tends to spread fud and make inexperienced people in the market panicly react.The common thing between two pumps is they are from National Leader effects on national policies on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market as well as blockchain industry. The bottom line is more simpler than that, do you see China has any progress years after the Xi-pump?Think about it with Trump-pump.Honestly I did not know the first article and I only see it when I tried to search for Xi-pump for sharing it to you. Someone already connecting the dots, but attaching some perhaps 'manipulative' initiative to spread fear.",

Some means to influence investor decisions right. Investors learned eventually.Here yet again, we have Trump pushing similar narrative and this time, it’s a lot different, it’s from a president of the US, then we had the Trump coin. Soon, we would find people having to learn too. No matter the tweet, you still wheel how your investment goes.",

But I don't blame Trump or his speach that made people to add or pull liquidity to Bitcoin, but rather I blame this new era Bitcoin investors who allow themselves or their emotion to be controlled by a mear speach. My concern is that if people continue to buy Bitcoin only when there is a positive speculation and sell when there is a negative speculation then Bitcoin is likely to be manipulated. Bitcoin was not meant to be controlled by any body or group of people if not it will become a manipulative asset  but people are gradually pushing Bitcoin to be controlled by government or centralized entity as a medium of making money since Bitcoin is not centralized. Because Elon musk may also comes up one day and want to control the market, then he will also come and proclaim to deploy his own Bitcoin strategy to follow suit with microstrategy or Trump and Bitcoin will zoom like a train and he may decide to post a negative feedback and Bitcoin falls and he may buy in bulk and post a positive news, and Bitcoin will rise and he will pull out liquidity and market will dump.

Yes. It's the same promise some politicians make when they start campaigning for themselves but in a much more simplistic capacity perhaps.Trump has been in the spotlight for his pro crypto statements and most investors may have welcomed this as something positive, but along the way this kind of thing has become taboo because his statements are based on interests that not many people know for sure.I don't know how his promises can be realized but there is an interesting part of the old man's statement.If that is true, then we can see how the market has played out since he was inaugurated until now.",

The crypto whales? The big crypto exchanges? Someone else?I think that the markets are simply reacting to the whatever news are coming from the White House.

      "body": "Bitcoin is currently resistant to manipulation. It was a deliberate measure put in place around 2021 or so to prevent the \"former regime\" and others from successfully attacking it. But the countermeasure does not prevent organic influence depending on how influencial the influencer is. If it reacted positively to President Trump comment then it was most likely not a manipulation. If the comment wasnt organic then the price reacted to something else rather than the comment.The countermeasure will probably need to be weakened for a manipulation to be possible, but that possibility was anticipated, and a more powerful countermeasure was put in place incase it's weakened.It was possible to manipulate Bitcoin before 2020\\2021 until the countermeasure came into effect, as you probably notice how Bitcoin fought and countered the past regime's attempts",
