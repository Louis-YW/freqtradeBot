  "content": "I built a trading bot and have been using it on the BTC/USDT market for the last month  - no leverageIt has worked in the sense of it is profitable but not a lot and needs improvementsI need to look at moving stop loss and having a trailing stop loss but what I have noticed and I will do a full assessment this week is that you need as a trader limit opening trades in a flat marketIn backtesting I tried to do this with an ADX indicator but it reduced the amount of trades too much. I dont know what the best tool for this I am looking at the squeeze momentum or an other volume indicatorThe other issue you dont want to miss movements if the market does change or wake upAnother issue is large candles when your code opens a trade after a very large candle, problem all momentum is generally in the large candle and the market resets again afterwards. However I do have code to now to detect this",

I dont know what the best tool for this I am looking at the squeeze momentum or an other volume indicatorAnything that helps to limit the position you open should be consider good if you make profit from it, but the profit can be little though but better than loss. I do not know much about the indicators you are talking about, I only know about the basics ones like MA, EMA, RSI and Bollinger bands. But if indicators fail, 1x leverage strategy do help.

However I do have code to now to detect this Use RSI and Bollinger bands to check overbought Nd oversold market, but indicators can also fail. You are using 1xleverage strategy, even if indicators fails, patience makes the market to correct itself and the possibility that you will still make profit is very high.",

A higher volume will probably lead on to higher volatility later on (if not already present) but may also change its direction.",

      "body": "This is very complicated trading strategy because you are even considering impulse trading which might be turned into mess once your code failed due very quick movement of the market.Why use the simple grid trading rather than use a complex condition on trading? The crypt market is unpredictable so you might end up applying multiple parameters and condition just to come with a bot that will be profitable at all times.",

No if you do proper analysis and set up your analysis well then you should winning more than you are losing.Quote from: Oshosondy on August 02, 2022, 01:32:26 PMLeveraging can make a trader to panic and close position or sell at loss while over leveraging can result to fast asset liquidation.This is one of the reason that traders are cut up in difficult trading situation and when they low liquidity, they begin to panic and close market that will later become a winning market.",
