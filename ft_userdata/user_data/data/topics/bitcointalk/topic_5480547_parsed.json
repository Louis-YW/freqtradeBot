      "body": "most ETF authorised participants(agents/basket makers) are not going to buy/sell large clumps of coins on the public spot marketthey use darkpools.. AKA OTC markets insteadthe spot market is for low yield investors to buy small allotments of mostly under 0.001btc per order. where as the darkpools is where the big deals happen between larger investors the SEC has already spoke with all the ETF applicants about how they will onramp and off ramp their AP agents baskets. whereby they will use darkpools to settle in-cash when offloading bitcoin. and custodians like coinbases OTC darkpool has enough liquidity to cover this.there are other things like when making a basket to then assign a number of shares, to then offer shares on the ETF platform. for a basket to then be removed requires enough share holders to accumulate enough shares for a basket to then vote to close the shares and return the basket to the custodian in exchange for cashthis alone makes it less easy to close off a basket and cause bitcoins to move out of custody to then enter the spot market. because the custodian will just find new buyers of the baskets on the OTC darkpoolthe only times a custodian would then sell unlocked coins to the spot market is if the custodians liquidity of fiat is low and they cant find another basket buyer on the OTC.. other economic things are in play toorather than a share holder accumulating enough shares to then vote out that allocation to then OTC to fiat that basket. they know they wont get best price on the OTC market. so they are better off not closing the shares to remove them from the ETF but instead just sell the shares within the ETF at the going rate",

I can remember the news took the price from $24800 to over $40000 now. But just yesterday that we read a news about the possibility that United States SEC may reject the application, bitcoin fall from over $45000 to $40200 until it increased back. That is not manipulation. It is because people having bitcoin are buying when the news is positive and selling when the news is negative. It is people and no just a single person or few people that are buying or selling that makes the price of bitcoin to be much volatile as it increased or decreased. Bitcoin marketcap is over $860 billion, that is more than what that can be used to manipulate bitcoin price.",

There are some reasons for that.Bitcoin already has a consolidate volume. There are many big players in already, and more big players coming in will mean less concentration of power in the hands of the big players.Sec regulatory requirements may be pain in the ass and terrible for privacy, but they do work to make market manipulation more difficult.

It has to happen the same time by a group of people who hold large amount of BTC in their wallets. The news of Bitcoin ETF that is affecting the market is not a manipulation from SEC per say. But the news will have a lot of implications and impact to the bitcoin holders that are waiting for the verdict from SEC about bitcoin ETF. SEC might not want to be a part of market manipulation but as it is now, the news of the spot bitcoin ETF is playing a substantial role now and affecting the movement of the market. Whatever happens, it is just a matter of time for bitcoin to recover even when the news would have caused changes to the market movement, it won’t last long because bitcoin cannot be manipulated by a single entity.",

The SEC just has a strong view about Bitcoin not being a security and thus not being under their regulations, and ETFs are a way of bringing Bitcoin, at least partially, under their regulations. Bitcoin has a huge market capitalization, so actually manipulating the price by operating big amounts of money is extremely hard. I guess there's no consensus in that regard, but I agree with seoincorporation about the amounts that don't have an impact. So it's not about potential price manipulations, in my opinion.",

The privacy and decentralization of cryptocurrency have given room to this unethical practice which is of one the worries of the government. Over time, I think there will be some kind of solution to this, I am certain that the crypto space can't remain the same in the next 10 years in terms of regulation.
