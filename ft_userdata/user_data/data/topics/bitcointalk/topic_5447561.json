If your password is in the green, chance to brute-force it is silm.",

On this case was only the electrum backup or simply wallet.dat file is the OP holding which means this is an encrypted backup to access his balance. Private key is a different item from wallet.dat.Nevertheless, the suggestion above is right on this case by brute forcing the password.  But it might took a significant of time if the OP remembered password is different to the real password. This is the gamble on using brute force with a keyword set on it.",

In .my opinion OP should just forget about it since he can't get the password to access the wallet from his head and from all indication it doesn't show that he had the password written down some safely 8 years ago that should warrant a search anywhere. It's painful to agree but he should just let go, maybe in the nearer future there maybe possible technological brute solution to such case but not until then.",
