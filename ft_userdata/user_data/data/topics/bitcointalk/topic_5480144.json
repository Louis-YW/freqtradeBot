However Bulgaria is one of the countries along India, China, USA, Nigeria etc. who has a good number of its citizens owns BTC.From all occurrences there is no better time to buy Bitcoin but for last year. The price of Bitcoin fell to a lowest of $17,000 Just spot you own minimal and buy as many as you can afford. You can start accumulating gradually which is one way a lot of persons here in this community did. However this year 2024 will pose another opportunity which you can profit from but remember ETF approval is at the corner, Halving Event is forth coming. This serve as opprtunity for BTC to go high.Be watchful.",

Thanks to payment processors, you can pay with Bitcoin almost anything you can think of - but the idea of Bulgaria as the country with the most Bitcoins has long been dispelled.Quote from: https://bitcoinist.com/bulgaria-not-bitcoin-1-6b-finance-minister/The publication claims that Bulgaria’s finance minister, Vladislav Goranov, told the Prime Minister’s Security Council the sale had taken place, and that the coins were sold piecemeal so as not to crash the market. “Several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors” purchased the coins for around €15,000 each, with Deloitte acting as a consultant, Bivol references Goranov as revealing. Even more curiously, “experts from the US FBI helped to ensure the safety of transactions,” the last of which occurred April 1, 2018, Goranov is reported to have said.",

Op people are still predicting that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in the next bull market and now Bitcoin is still $45k therefore you still have the chance to invest in it. If you have the $1,000 invest in it now that is still on the low key. And it is said by someone here, everyone was skeptical at the first encounter of the technology or the project because many were afraid to loss their money to scammers or others. Well I can't say much about Bulgaria Bitcoin status because I have not heard of it. But in Nigeria, we are the giant in Bitcoin in Africa. Yes cryptocurrency will take over the digital world but it can't the physical. And cryptocurrency might even influence the exchange rate of the fiat currencies in the world.",

You already had the chance to invest in Bitcoin when your friend talked to you about it, but you did not listen. That's also how many people had the opportunity. In my case, when I first heard about Bitcoin, I was skeptical as well, but if I had had a true friend who was a true Bitcoiner, maybe he would have helped me understand better what Bitcoin is, and I would have invested earlier, but it was until 2019 before I got the real knowledge and invested.Since you are now convinced about Bitcoin, it's not too late to start investing now. Even if you don't make much profit now that the price is getting high, you can still hold your investment till the next bull market after this one that is approaching.",

Well, I didn’t say it’s impossible, I’m rather saying that for the person who got the Bitcoins from Laszlo, I think the chance is slim that he didn’t use it already. The fact that he even wanted and made the trade with Laszlo shows that he saw value in Bitcoin and knew what he was doing. It’s not like he just carelessly did it. So, even Bitcoin at $1 was already a tempting time for him to sell. I’m assuming he was also skeptic if Bitcoin price will go back down. That’s a lot of gain to not be tempted.But let’s think of something, how about Laszlo himself? To spend 10,000 Bitcoin, he must have had a lot more (I assume)… how about him then?",

I will trade 10,000 BTC for 2 of these pizzas any time as long as I have the funds (I usually have plenty).  If anyone is interested please let me know.  The exchange is favorable for anyone who does it because the 2 pizzas are only about 25 dollars total, maybe 30 if you give the guy a nice tip.  If you get me the upgraded extra large ones or something, I can throw in some more bitcoins, just let me know and we'll work something out.My 1 year old daughter really enjoys pizza too!  She just smears it all over her face if you give her a whole slice, but she does eventually manage to get most of it in her mouth (minus a few loose toppings of course).Quote from: laszlo on June 04, 2010, 05:51:05 PMWell I didn't expect this to be so popular but I can't really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore   Thanks to everyone who bought me pizza already but I'm kind of holding off on doing any more of these for now.",

Currently, many shopping malls, hotels, factories, and many grocery stores accept Bitcoin payments.

All these improvements in the digital world are now possible with Bitcoin and the popularity of Bitcoin is increasing rapidly day by day. People who invested when the price of Bitcoin was very low made a lot of money and profited, but many of them didn't invest because they were afraid of losing money. However, we saw that the person who bought two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins only had $42 worth of bitcoins in all.But now if he had this amount of bitcoins then he would have become a billionaire and there is no doubt that he could have opened pizza companies in different parts of the world.
