So what crypto debit or prepaid cards there are for Africa/Asia/South america? I am not going to recommend using centralized exchanges but if you are already doing kyc verification for debit cards, you might as well use some cards that are issued by crypto exchanges like FTX, Binance or Kucoin.If you want to stay somehow anonymous there are few options of using virtual cards and anon physical cards from websites like coindebit.io, but they won't be active again until November or December this year.Do your own research before applying for any of this cards, and never hold more money on them than you are willing to lose.",
