  "content": "I'm thrilled to announce MoneyPot.com, a Bitcoin crash game with the lowest house edge. What sets MoneyPot apart from other online casinos is that we start with a house edge of 0.1% and only increase it as little as necessary. We invite you to check out our manifesto and our maths page if you want to learn more.Rock-solid source codeMoneyPot builds upon the code that powers bustabit and bustadice. I acquired the source code from Daniel a couple months ago, after having helped with its development for several years. As a result, MoneyPot has all the features you already know and use:Instant deposits availableHighly optimized withdrawal systemScripting support for custom strategies and botsBacktest strategies with simulated moneyShiba the botMoving forward, my team and I will focus exclusively on MoneyPot. We have an exciting roadmap ahead and will be delivering updates over the coming months. Also, more games are coming in the future. Stay tuned!Even higher bet limitsBet limits have been virtually eliminated as we use the Kelly criterion to determine the house edge in each game. However, to prevent excessive loss in a single round, we have set a limit on the amount a player can win in one game to 4% of the bankroll. Additionally, we have set a limit on the total amount of winnings per game to 5% of the bankroll. As a result, high rollers can make even larger bets, win more, and overall players will be forced to cash out even less often.Augmented provable fairnessProvably Honest participates in our provably fair game result generation and maintains transactions records of our games. This offers much better guarantees to players and investors:The burden to validate games is no longer on the players. Provably Honest verifies all games on their behalf, without compromising their ability to independently validate them.We can't know future game results until the start of the game. This helps us have a more secure system, which indirectly helps our bankroll investors and players.Please feel free to explore their API docs to see how it works.Investment systemMoneyPot's bankroll is publicly funded. The commission we receive will be calculated by converting the bankroll to special drawing rights (XDR) using the average exchange rate of the past 180 days, then dividing the result by 30,000,000 XDR. Thanks to our adjusted probability scheme, MoneyPot can offer higher limits without the need for a larger bankroll.To incentivize investors to participate in the bankroll, we are waiving all dilution fees until further notice.Back to the originsAs some of you might already know, MoneyPot was the first crash game in the industry. In 2014, when Ryan took over, he rebranded MoneyPot as bustabit. Subsequently, the moneypot.com domain was sold and eventually faded into obscurity. In MoneyPot's early days, the house edge was dynamic. That's our main differentiator, and since we're starting with crash, it only seemed right to acquire the domain. That said, we are in no way affiliated nor know the team that operated it after Ryan. Back to the good old days!",

When the original Moneypot went there was quite a bit of drama surrounding it, would be nice to learn if it is a completely new start or what is really going on. They do have a nice bankroll however (if the stats shows are accurate)",

I checked your terms of service and I did not see any thing minimum and maximum deposit and withdrawal does it mean one can deposit and withdraw as much as they want? and another is KYC I could not see any option for KYC on your terms and condition of service. Does it mean you are KYC free. I ask because it would not be making any sense that after one registers and possibly winning big and upon withdrawal, one is being asked for KYC which is not making any sense as it is misleading. You had better spell it out properly so as not to deceive members here.Lastly do well to upgrade your account t a copper member so you could introduce your graphics properly.",

To my knowledge there's been 5 owners (me included) and has been used for various things. I bought this domain because it was originally used as the very original \"crash\" game, and when it had invented crash it used a \"dynamic house edge\" which is something I am hoping to re-popularize.Thank you everybody else for all the feedback!",
