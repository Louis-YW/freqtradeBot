  "content": "I'd start a trust fund or self sustaining family company.Aiming for real estate, commercial and residential.(apartment complexes, franchises and houses) Snowballing most profits into more properties/investment portfolios,compounding any high interest thing I can find while only absorbing a nominal % of profits. My family wouldn't know but I'd have them on the trust and everyone eventually would start getting 2-6k a month from said trust, and the trust could continue growth. I wanna hear what some of you guys would do aside from the buy a big house and a lambo. How would you turn 1billion into 2+?",

You can never spend that amount of money in several generations, if you live even semi normally.If I won that much I’d obviously have a great life, beyond my wildest dreams. I’d have to give something back though. I’d do a lot of charity & give some away.",

Opt for the annualized payments for maximum value.After that, I would carry on living life normally while making smart, calculated investments. It's really the only way to live a normal life after winning that much money.",
