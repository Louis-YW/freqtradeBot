  "content": "One of the advantages of bitcoin is anonymity, where the owner of a bitcoin address cannot be known by anyone because it is not connected to a personal identity. But another advantage of bitcoin is transparency, so that transaction a bitcoin address will always be publicly recorded and can be accessed by anyone. This is a problem, especially for holders of lots of bitcoins in wallets, they will worry about their identities and transactions being tracked.Maybe this is where the beginning of the bitcoin mixer idea is needed. Bitcoin mixer will make transactions untraceable and as a double safeguard for the anonymity of bitcoin. But in practice, bitcoin mixers are misused by certain people or groups to hide money generated from crime. Maybe we often call it money launderingI think this is a problem, and cases of money laundering using bitcoin make bitcoin's image even worse. Even though in reality there is also a lot of money laundering that is carried out through bank institutions by falsifying bank account identities.In your opinion, how to prevent the use of bitcoin as a means of money laundering? While we may not recommend going to KYC, it is useless and the anonymity of bitcoins will be lost.To this day, many bitcoin mixers have been caught in money laundering cases, such as Chipmixer, Tornado Cash, Bitcoin Fog, and others. Apart from that, even though the bitcoin mixer users are at fault, those who make the mistake of using a mixer as a way of covering up their crimes, why is the Bitcoin mixer platform also considered guilty? Or is there a conspiracy between them?Reference : finance.yahoo.com",

Just like you can't prevent money laundering happening with cash money.but when you know that using a knife/gun generally is more risky than using a spoon/waterbottle. laws, common sense, policy, directions and instructions appear about knives/guns, but spoons/waterbottle dont apply to the same rules,instructions to reduce the risk of bad use of such things like knives/gunsand so when mixers are a defined risk of money laundering. then rules, policy regulation instruction and directions appear about mixersby the way money has NEVER had any \"privacy\". history of money has always been audited and subject to things like tax and declarations.. for hundreds of years. financial privacy was a new feature promoted when bitcoin was invented. but that was back when bitcoin was defined as private property(2009-2013) however when defined as currency(2014+) it then fell into the remit of financial lawsthe most foolish thing is that now there is regulations that define mixers as a laundering risk, and crypto as currency, there has become sets of rules to monitor users.. yet people still use services defined as mixers.. trick is to use something else not defined as a mixer. be clever. find something else not trying to be in the 'mixer' definition.. but solves your same privacy concern..its why fiat users dont use old laundering techniques that have become regulated. but keep changing the methods of shuffling money around, methods outside the traditional definitions, but give the same end result of their desired utility",
