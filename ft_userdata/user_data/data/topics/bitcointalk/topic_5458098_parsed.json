      "body": "Well I did a test online for this and I am a Extrovert. I like to be a talkative person when we are in groups out to have a good time. My friends will listen to the things I say so I like this feeling. I think it is good to make friends. We do not want to be alone for our whole life. I will party with my friends and I think it is good to be social interactive with people. I do like to make new friends, it is not a waste of time to be with new people.",

It might take work to make changes.Besides, this is the wrong place to ask this question. People who frequent the forum don't like being alone, or they wouldn't be here.",

Like being alone can promote creativity and being with friends can make you happy if you have fun with them . By the way I have few friends. Sometimes i feel better with friends and sometimes i prefer to be alone.",
