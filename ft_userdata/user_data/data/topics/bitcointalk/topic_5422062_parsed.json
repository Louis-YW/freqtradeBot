Better to have a mention of them here as scam than their domains. They appear daily, that's true. I have a database of over 15k+ sites with screenshots and addresses and I add arround 100-150 daily.That base is very much outdated.And about posting their addresses is very much important because that's basically the only real and valid tracking unit we have to not let this scammers launder their coins freely. Myself I work as aml in crypto so this is mostly my daily job.But thanks very much for your input! much appreciated",
