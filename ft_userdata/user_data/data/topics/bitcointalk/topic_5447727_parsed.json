  "content": "I have been fan of Bitcoin since 2016 when I found it for the first time. Its decentralized nature made me to love it. Because of Bitcoin, no government or authority can control the way we use our money digitally. Other than that, Bitcoin has a value that has the potential to increase far higher than gold, and at the same time, it doesn't carry any weight due to its digital nature.Here are some valid reasons that made me to love Bitcoin:Bitcoin is completely decentralized, which means that no government or banks can have control over it. Traditional currencies, such as fiat, for example, the US dollar, Euro, and others, are controlled by banks and governments, but Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone. It works on a P2P (peer-to-peer) network of millions of users.Another aspect of Bitcoin that made me love it was its lower transaction fees. Bitcoin operates on P2P, which is why its transaction fees are lower than those of banks. When you are sending BTC from your wallet to someone else's wallet, you will pay a little transaction fee to the network. Even that fee is used to inspire the nodes so that the transaction gets validated.Other than that, Bitcoin is completely transparent. Every transaction since its first transaction is recorded on the blockchain. The best thing about the blockchain is that anyone can access the record. Due to this transparency, the transactions made by Bitcoin can be tracked easily, which adds a perk to its security.Bitcoin is accessible to everyone, and that's an amazing aspect of it. Anyone from any part of the world can access Bitcoin through the internet. That means that anyone can transfer and receive Bitcoin anywhere without any restrictions. It even works in those areas where traditional banking infrastructure is not present.Another very important thing about Bitcoin that made me love it is its limited supply. Bitcoin has a total supply of just 21 million bitcoins. It means that there won't be more Bitcoins ever, only those 21 million Bitcoins will exist forever. That makes Bitcoin a store of value. Due to its limited supply, its price can move to way higher levels. Some people even believe that one Bitcoin will be worth 1 million in the future.I use Bitcoin every day, and it's an important part of my life. I can't imagine my life without Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I believe that its adoption rate will increase in the upcoming days, and many new users will start using this amazing invention of this century. Thanks a lot to Satoshi Nakamoto for developing such an amazing infrastructure that has made our lives easier and far better.All those features of Bitcoin made me to fall in love with it. I believe there are millions of lovers of Bitcoin. Kindly share your love for admiration for this amazing invention. Thank you!",

I believe there are millions of lovers of Bitcoin. Kindly share your love for admiration for this amazing invention. Thank you! It has indeed made life easier for those who have already found a source of income and a way to conduct transactions in a comfortable and stress-free manner through it. We are already in an age where transactions, particularly border transactions, should not be a big deal, but our governments have made a big deal out of it, so I believe bitcoin has made that aspect easier for all of us, among other reasons for its use.Quote from: Mr.corol on April 05, 2023, 10:44:58 PMBitcoin has become a joy in everyone's life.

      "body": "Bitcoin is the simplest, easiest, and most stress-free investment I have ever known. There was this investment I made some years ago in which I had to transport myself from my house to the company, sign some documents in their office, and they gave me their company account number to go and deposit the money I intended to invest. I had to go to the bank again that day to do an inter-bank transfer to their company account before I returned to their office again to complete the documents and complete my investment. It almost took me the whole of that day to complete the process, but the first day I bought Bitcoin, every transaction took place in my house, I did not have to travel anywhere to invest. So bitcoin investment is the easiest way to invest. Even if a person has a business to run, Bitcoin gives you total freedom to do other things while you still have your Bitcoin investment.",

Some started nothing and when they met Bitcoin, which they've studied then they earned profits. Not only for people that are trading and investing, some people also donate their profits in Bitcoin to charities. If you explore more here in the forum there's a many thread here that are about donations to poor people using their Bitcoin.

I use Bitcoin indirectly, Bitcoin is now considered an integral part of my life. I'm not interested in keeping money in the bank due to the inflation of my country's paper currency, so I've started converting all my assets to Bitcoin and holding them in a self-custody wallet. I agree that in the far future Bitcoin will be the only digital currency accepted by all in this world. Once all the people in the world start using Bitcoin directly then the increasing demand of Bitcoin will increase tremendously. I also add a bit more that Bitcoin will exceed million dollar after 2025-2030.",

On the one hand, the reasons the OP gives for saying that he loves bitcoin are the same reasons that all of us who have known about bitcoin for a long time can have, and we might think that this is yet another post designed to fish for merit, as it adds nothing, and does not explain what you are asking about. I would like to use bitcoin more on a daily basis, but I simply can't because I have no options.I hope the OP will take heed and answer your question.I'm not claiming that it's a fabrication, but it sounds too good to be true, and we're sick of seeing threads like this in this section aimed at getting merit.",

I am always very curious to know more about places which accept BTC for daily transactions (if it is your situation of course).But I'm surprised that you did mention the fees : it is pretty rare to have bank transfer fees more expensive than BTC network ones, especially since Ordinals.Could you explain what you mean ?
