Since you mentioned that the person is going through some financial crisis so it's very likely that he/she is going to sell it to settle the issue at hand. But you wouldn't know now unless you have tried him with other gifts in the past how he went about with them, but for now all the response you'll get will just be based on assumptions. Op, I think you should gift him the Bitcoin and then take your mind off of it. after all a gift is gift it's not something that's meant to be monitored by the giver.",

People who don't have a job will focus on finding a job first rather than investing because they don't have money to invest yet.I once gave him a bitcoin gift of 0.005 BTC when the bitcoin price was under $5,000 and he still has it. It's like he doesn't care when the bitcoin price has reached $60k because I already told him to sell it at that price but he only does it the next day. But till now, he didn't and still kept the bitcoins.",

I personally gave away bitcoins only to friends and acquaintances who were already involved in the cryptocurrency space or at least familiar with the concept and expressed their interest. I did this because I wanted to spread the word about Bitcoin and help my friends get involved.I think it's important that the person you're giving bitcoins to has some interest and experience with cryptocurrencies already. They're unlikely to appreciate the gift if they don't understand or care about it. If a friend or family member does not have any interest in bitcoin, then you should probably buy them something else.",

I think splitting the 300$ to 150$ in fiat cash and 150$ Bitcoin is more appropriate because you can help your friend to deal with his current finance problem and at the same time help him for his future investment. I’m sure that he will not touch it since people that new on things that involves money tends to leave it as is and just wait the person that gift him to help him cash it out to convert in fiat.",

Honestly, if you wanted to help a friend out, and get them out of their current situation there's better ways of doing it. For example, helping them find a job or something like that. Bitcoin isn't always the answer, as much as we'd like Bitcoin to be the answer to everything, it really isn't.

I'm asking this question because of people who wish to gift bitcoin to people who are going through difficult financial challenge,  is there any need to give bitcoin as gift to people who need money to settle urgent financial problems. The question is really amazing. Okay, a little insight from me for you that you can give Bitcoin to anyone who has a wallet to receive it properly and the problem here is do people with difficult financial conditions already have a wallet to receive gifts in the form of Bitcoin? And one more thing is if they don't know about Bitcoin or don't know Bitcoin at all, I don't think it's any good if you give Bitcoin to them because they don't know how to cash it.QuoteOr bitcoin should only be given to those who can truly invest and yield profits.  Can you gift bitcoin to random people who may not make profit from it.Those who are experiencing financial difficulties and are experiencing a difficult life with great urgency will certainly not use the Bitcoin you provide for investment. Because they will definitely exchange Bitcoin for fiat to meet their urgent needs and will solve their difficulties first before using the rest to invest and even then if there is still some left. But if the rest is not there, they have to use other capital to invest in Bitcoin or any investment that they understand and are happy with.",

Most people send bitcoin because of the stress involved in cross boarder transactions like converting between two country currencies.
