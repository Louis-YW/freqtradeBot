      "body": "WTF, you ask the question and then answer it by yourself. In Bitcoin there's no clone terms, but fork (soft fork and hard fork) or 51% attack. Soft fork is just a development in Bitcoin, while hard fork is a fake Bitcoin e.g. BCH, BSV, WBTC etc. 51% attack is when the attacker adding their own blocks and make the valid blocks become invalid, it's not change the coin, but it can't be trusted anymore. The good thing is BTC has no chance to get 51% attack.",

Many users or developers have tried to recreate bitcoin with a different name but has the same purpose but since bitcoin is the first its literally hard to clone. The presence of any clone is a clear illustration of the fact that the original is more valuable. The more clones, the higher the value of the original. Look at the bitcoin forks. There are quite a lot of coins, some are more popular, others less, but none of them comes close in terms of price, capitalization and user base. For the most part, these are all garbage and pathetic fakes trying to profit from the well-known bitcoin brand.Technically, it is not difficult to clone bitcoin and many cryptocurrency projects do this. I mean the coin itself and the blockchain.And if think about it, what makes the bitcoin unique? This is decentralization due to the lack of a project team and the fact that bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency created.",

What about BCH and BSV?They tried to clone the result in front of you. What is the benefit of cloning Bitcoin while you have the original bitcoin in front of you? People do it because they were unable to buy bitcoin when it was cheap. Now they want to recreate it and hold a big portion from the beginning so they can manipulate the market in the future. But, this is not going to happen because there is no reason people will choose fake bitcoin over original bitcoin. Right? Basically, those cloners and the creators or fake bitcoins are scammers! I don't have good words for them, unfortunately.",

Ofcourse, you can create a copy of Bitcoin that contains the whole data of the original (by downloading it & choosing to become a distinct network) , even with satoshi transactions but the copy will become a different chain and incompatible with the Bitcoin chain. That's pretty much what it means to clone but it's given another name on Cryptocurrency space. To clone mean to duplicate. You don't need to alter or change the data of something to successfully duplicate it.",

      "body": "Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin. People have tried copying it or should I say cloned it multiple times and they were successful in creating something but not so successful in terms of delivering what Bitcoin does. They have copied every feature that Bitcoin has (people call it forking) but that's just it. From what I understand, Bitcoin's success lies in its being decentralized. Every crypto somehow is a copy of Bitcoin. Either those coins have fewer or more features than Bitcoin has or are the same as Bitcoin. So the answer is that it is possible to clone but not entirely. You can't copy the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. People want control and they will do it by any means. That's the reason clones never work out the way Bitcoin did. So you can also say that it is not possible to clone Bitcoin in that sense.",

Why do you mention that as a common misconception? Because in my opinion, every asset that is very valuable and valuable in the eyes of many people will always be difficult to clone, because if an asset that has good value like Bitcoin can be easily cloned by many people, that will be a problem that can affect its value too. So it really can't be cloned by anyone because it is hindered by blockchain technology which is very reliable and very trustworthy.",
