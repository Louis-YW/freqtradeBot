What I notice is that Bitcoin can rise at any point in time either you purchase when the price is low or when the price is high.",

      "body": "No one can get the exact direction of bitcoin movement every week or months but it can only be speculated through past records. No need of all the worries if you are a bitcoin hodler and the market wouldn't be your concern. That is why people are advised to use long term investment on bitcoin and do DCA,so that such company like OP's wouldn't come out with claiming to be able to guess the market right with their system. Only traders will fall for this and short term investors who think that bitcoin is a get rich quick investment. The volatile nature of bitcoin makes it a mystery.",

I’d advise those considering a Bitcoin investment to look at Bitcoin in 4 year cycles, not week to week. Strong point sir, but there are both types of people One of them who use to invests their capital in a longer time frame as you've said for cycle to cycle or year to year, in other words, Bull run to Bull, on the same time there are few people who want the fast profits to be booked in the short period of time like from 1st-week of the entry to the 3rd or last week of the month, even on the very next week of the month using this time frame they try too book $1k to $3k if market supposedly goes I their favor.An accumulator never chooses the short timeframes, but a trader does. For now, the market is completely following the sentiments based on the developments, The market should start picking up the line but sentiemtally still under pressure so I think more likely there we a tight range of movement for a couple of weeks, or at least for the next week.",

It's kinda impossible to determine whether Bitcoin's price will increase or decrease next week or even next month.It's often more reliable to make predictions when looking at longer cycles, such as at least a four years cycle, like the years of halving. This way you can gain a better understanding of how the Bitcoin chart works and gather a lot of data which can help you make more accurate predictions imho.",

That's the second support I think where the price can go. $20k from current prices will be almost a down move of 22 percent, which is huge I would say after the bear market of years.",

I’d advise those considering a Bitcoin investment to look at Bitcoin in 4 year cycles, not week to week. This should be exactly the look we should look at for Bitcoin investment. You won't get anywhere with the gains that can be made with short-term strategies. Although these strategies will bring you profit, they will be very little compared to the return you will get in the long run. Of course, you also have a situation where you can't make a profit. If you are thinking of making a profit with short-term investments, but things do not go well, you will make a mistake and ultimately lose because you do not think about investing in Bitcoin in the long term.I think the message given here is very clear and explanatory.

I agree with the recommendation to look at Bitcoin in 4-year cycles, not week to week.Taking profit in the short term isn't the best because it depends at what price that you bought and how you understand bitcoin market movement with patience. One can buy now at 25k+ and thinks that the price will increase to 27k+ so that he can sell and make profit. It the price goes downward to 23k+ and that investor doesnt have patient for a rise in price or don't understand that the prices are only for short term, he might sell at loss due to FOMO. That is why long term hodlers don't bother about bitcoin price movement but they are patiently waiting to see the bull market. Short term investment is a bad strategy in bitcoin investment,because it is 50-50.",

Well, having to vote on whether the Bitcoin price should go up or down doesn't mean it's going to happen according to how we have voted or in the sense that it will work with the majority of the vote. Well, even while investing in Bitcoin, you must not really place your hope in the pump-and-dump logic, because it's something that only work for  altcoins, or else the person will just be disappointed. It is doubtful how all you have said will turn out in the coming week, but I will urge you to also go to other social platforms to do this pool because on this platform, you can't get any users to agree to it. From the start of Bitcoin, this has not been possible and is not going to be possible with your project.",
