Do in mind and try to comprehend what each step of the Ethereum site tutorial explains to you, and adjust accordingly the network with mainnet.For example, step 11 requires you to have the environment variables using goerli API, and it is interconnected with the next step where the hardhat.config.js consumes the env variables.

I had to delete and create a new Alchemy App. Now I have the task of verifying my NFT contract, created according to the instructions from the Ethereum website. An error is coming out:ParserError: Multiple SPDX license identifiers found in source file. Use “AND” or “OR” to combine multiple licensesI flat my contract and uploaded it to Etherscan, but it didn't helpBut this is probably another topic?",
