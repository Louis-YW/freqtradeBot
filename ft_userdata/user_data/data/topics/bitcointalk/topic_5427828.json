  "content": "Just went to merit a bunch of posts and ran out before I finished. Eliminating the become a merit source option, how about something like a copper membership so you can post images, a way to buy some merits from the source. Would have to be handled on a case by case basis, since you don't want to be selling merit to someone who might abuse it. But, a couple of bucks for 50 or so merit might not be the worst deal.Or I just start making notes and when I get some I send some. Never thought about it until now.EDIT: This is not a beg for merit since something like that would only work once (now) but a more in general thing. I get some now but run out again in 7 months and wind up in the same situation. But throw a couple of dollars into the bitcointalk treasury and get some would be a workable thing.-Dave",

If it was a 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1 it might be a different story. Or I might have given more to some posts so would have wound up in the same situation anyway.Since a few people did send some merits (thank you) I will keep them flowing. And now that the report posts that need merit post is back in my brain I will add to it as needed.-Dave",

So I remain mostly leaned not to implement this.On the other hand, if the administration decided to give this idea a try I would personally recommend to set some restrictions on those bought merits, to avoid abuse by some users: restrict this offer to reputable members of the community, daily/weekly limit to send those merits, etc.I believe things work good enough as they are and it would be bad to over-complicate things. Would not be more interesting for us to have the chance to revert 3 of our received merits into 1 smerit? So if someone actually wants to send (and does not have any smerit), there would be a path to, with an intrinsic \"tax\" to discourage abuseMy two sats.",

Of course it may not be ideal, since the Merit Source and delegate may roam the same boards and perhaps have similar meriting likes. <…>The above idea would easily fit the narrative of more people acting as Merit Sources (albeit by delegation), having no buy/sell ties to the concept, but rather extending the idea of trust as a basis (the Merit Source trusts the dMerit Source enough to pass on a certain amount of sMerits to another person).The board rules may need to be given a thought (i.e. only applies to Merits Sources above with a certain threshold of sMerit – not the smaller ones), but it doesn’t seem like something too complicated from a conceptual point of view.",

My opinion in this merit issue is that, theymos should increase the allocation of the merits for the merits sources both the local boards sources. Or if there is enough merits in his merit generating bank then more Merit sources are needed but if it is not then he should increase the present sources allocation.The merit sources are ready to work now and the merits are not enough for them so theymos should look into the matter.
