      "body": "Yeah, Bitcoin's progress is efficient as we enter 2023. For now, everything is looking to go really in a smooth way.However, there are no guarantees about the future.  Neither Adam Back nor anyone else can predict anything about the price of Bitcoin in the future: his predictions could turn out to be right or completely wrong. However, I am quite optimistic about the price of BTC going up in the next year or so, the halving is in about 1 year and we all know that this implies (historically anyway) some very interesting price movements.I hope you're right about 70k in December, but better to wait and see what happens rather than waste energy trying to make calculations and predictions. As said, we are one year away from halving, the hardest part is done (I mean for the holders who bought after previous bull), we just have to wait a little bit and keep an eye on the rates.",

Anyone who follows the evolution of the price knows that it never goes up like that. It's more like a roller coaster, not a straight upward line.On the other hand, we are supposed to beat the peak of this cycle in 2023? I would like to see strong arguments to support that this is the case, other than that it is simply thought to be the case, full stop.",

Just because there is a certain price pattern, that doesn't mean that this price pattern will continue in the future. I don't expect a 70K-100K Bitcoin price by December. I expect the crypto winter to continue until the spring of 2025. There might be a big bull run several months after the 2024 halving, but nothing is guaranteed.",

As for the growth, we have recovered from last year so everyone is very happy to see the price touching $30k after a bad 2022.As I have said, we can make our own prediction so I would say that definitely $100k can be achieved around 2024-2025 bull run.It will be massive and we will break and have a new all time high. That's how every bull run is, so the best thing to do right now is prepare and stack sats, as much as you can.",

We don't know what will happen because bitcoin relies on both internal and external factors. An internal factor is hash rate, number of users, state of exchanges, and external factors are the dollar index that depends on printing and rates, legislation, and many more. The chart that you've posted is also biased and relies on a similar failed rally in 2019 where price kept going up to 14k and crashed to new lows. At that time there was no threat of recession, there was no FED pivot and the demand for decentralized money was much lower.",

He also believes price can reach $10 million per coin by 2032, which sounds ludicrous to me, as within 10 years seems way too soon for this price target.Personally I think his initial target of $48K in June is possible, this would be a very similar bear market relief rally to 2019, even if a month or two too soon. However, the predictions after that seem out of touch with the reality of Bitcoin's 4 year cycles that so far very much remain in tact. The market would have to break it's 12-year long 4-year cycles in order to reach any targets such as $80K, let alone $100K by end of year. More relevantly, it'd have to continue a parabolic run until the end of the year, which seems like the most unlikely outcome given last year's bear market.Anything is possible when it comes to Bitcoin. For all we know a major recession this year could push Gold and Bitcoin prices much higher, but so far I don't see this being very realistic.",
