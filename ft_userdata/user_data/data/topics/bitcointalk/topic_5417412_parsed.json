This article will discuss the particularities of the 5-minute scalping strategy!What are scalping trading strategiesAs you might have already guessed, this trading strategy takes its name from the frightful word “to scalp”. Traders who follow this strategy are known as “scalpers” because they quickly enter and exit the market but take the profit. The adopters of scalping strategies open from 10 to 50 short trades per day, depending on the trading pair volume. You can choose any crypto for scalping, including such giants as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), ChainLink (LINK), etc.Scalpers make a relatively low profit on all their trades. However, as their number increases, the final win amount also grows up. The scalping trading strategy targets small price movements and is particularly efficient due to the extreme volatility of the crypto market. Consequently, if you are trading a token that is not volatile, scalping strategies may be not profitable here.The scalping strategy is built on fast-momentum trades, which means that investors who choose this approach should be experienced and skilled in risk management. In scalping, one needs to make investment decisions within minutes and sometimes even seconds. That is why this strategy might not work so well for crypto newbies or those who do not want to spend the whole day monitoring cryptocurrency charts and markets.Scalping is not super risky as traders usually do not invest large amounts. Indeed, they make money on minor price changes. However, to avoid potential losses, it’s recommended to have strict exit rules.Read full article: https://coincasso.com/blockchain-academy/the-5-minute-scalping-strategy/",

Even if we say that it has a risk because the high or low risk depends on the idea or knowledge of a trader.Now, if for you it's easy to do and earn income, well that's good for you, what about others who don't have enough ideas and knowledge or know very little, of course, the risk level for them is high.Also, for me, scalping is not advisable for newbies who don't know anything about crypto trading.",
