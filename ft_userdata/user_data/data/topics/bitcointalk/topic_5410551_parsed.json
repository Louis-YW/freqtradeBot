So whatever the case beware of it.The pancakeswap telegram group does not have 238 followers but the 78k followers are official so it's possible that you are included in a fake telegram under the name of the official Pancakeswap so be careful about this scam.This must be avoided because telegrams are cattle of fraud everywhere, even those who DM first, we need to know a lot if it doesn't make sense to you then get out and report the group.",

So whatever the case beware of it.Thats the best thing telegram did actually.  The group is surely a fake account whose an older group for other project or such group which changed their name into pancakeswap official telegram.  Well,  they could change and imitate the format but the record or the tagged as scam will be there for community sake. So dont ever try to deal or negotiate when you already saw the tagged.",

So whatever the case beware of it.Indeed, very often someone sends messages on Telegram either in the form of a link in the form of an investment, but I always ignore it, because many events are in the name of whether it's a project or investment by exchanging via links. So I think what happened to you is a scam, moreover you have to synchronize your wallet so please always be alert and be careful if anyone exchanges messages on behalf of pancakes, you have to find out first to make sure it's true or not.",

It’s better to go on the official website and browse on there social media account to see there official telegram channel. It’s better than sorry just by doing shortcut just to find the group easily.",
