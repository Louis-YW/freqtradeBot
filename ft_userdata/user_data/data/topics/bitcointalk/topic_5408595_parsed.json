  "content": "If you disagree, explain your point of viewWhen you observe the Bitcoin market, it is much more used as a financial asset than as an alternative currency. ( Except for countries like El Salvador and others but that is very minimal and the emergence of digital currencies from central banks will not really move things in the right direction). Even in El Salvador, where it is rarely used, it is a bit of a failure, speaking about adoption.It is a fact that people perceive Bitcoin &co as an asset class in which they can invest and get a return on investment. The higher % possible (why not I heard Santa is real) even if they need to buy the latest shitcoin of the week! Which makes cryptos behave following a speculative logic. If a market attracts investors, it becomes volatile, while if the market attract people with a real need, it won't be the same. Yes, still volatile but a lot lot less.Store of value ≠ Save haven Bitcoin has no place in bothSimilarly, Bitcoin cannot be considered a store of value as we cannot (for the time being) use it to buy goods or services.The function of a safe-haven asset is to withstand a crisis without losing value. Did Bitcoin survive? Not really. In fact, you may notice that the market is increasingly correlated to traditional finance (the result of considering Bitcoin as an investment instrument).Whereas a store of value must be able to maintain its purchasing power over time. Where is the purchasing power protection for people who invested all their savings when the price was 60k, 50k, 40k, 30k?Inflation is the role of central banks to regulate/limit/brake it. How do you want it to be the same with Bitcoin?",

I expect though that in the future it will be shifting though from a very volatile asset to a more traditional store of value, where people won't have to wait for 4 years to be pretty much certain they're not losing.",

In fact, you may notice that the market is increasingly correlated to traditional finance (the result of considering Bitcoin as an investment instrument).It's quite a weird market though because bonds (including just government bonds) didn't survive well either.

How do you want it to be the same with Bitcoin?There are times that are both happy and sad in this market as there are points where, if everyone bought a coin before then and held it, they'd be in profit now - it's sad personal circumstance and other things can force people to sell at a loss but you can't backup the price.Most investments demand a few years in the market. European stocks used to face 3 years of bear times, 3 years of stagnation and 3 years of growth (on average) - you might've needed to be in the market for 7 years to have made a good profit on your investment. A lot of etfs for bitcoin normally suggest a minimum term of 4 years before their pessimistic estimates become positive (not sure if this is the one neurotic fish is quoting, I saw it on a factsheet from a Swedish bitcoin etf manager - it was an interesting read).Edit: their recommended investment period was updated to 5 years.",

For those concerned, I have the feeling that it is because they are directly or partially associated with the crisis. Or maybe it's the GAFAMs. Let's not forget that many companies received hundreds of millions in state aid during the crisis. Without that, many would have closed.",

But it doesn't.I think that the fact the market is young and not properly regulated everywhere (allowing market manipulation) do create this volatility. I think that the even younger businesses (and scams too) relying on Bitcoin price - altcoins (yes, let's not fool ourselves), DeFi, whatever - do affect the volatility big time (just remember Luna buying, and also Luna crash).

Bitcoin is a very young asset [under 2 decades] compared with others like Gold, which was discovered thousands of years ago. The focus will shift slowly from a speculative asset to a store of value down the line.Quote from: LeGaulois on August 03, 2022, 10:12:04 PMBut it can't happen until Bitcoin is massively adopted.

Bitcoin went from nothing to excess of $60k. Certainly, people would be excited about it, and want to get rich as well, with time bitcoin should morph into a much more mature state with a bigger audience who understand how it can be used.I think it is too early to try and define what it is or is not.- Jay -",

I don't think that replacing the investors with \"people with a real need\" would make the Bitcoin market less volatile. Having a limited supply and unstable demand is what makes the price so volatile, the type of buyers doesn't matter. This is basic supply and demand market law.

Of course not as good as fillippone's freshly baked home bade no GMO one, but still pizzas.  I think this might be one of the moments when we have to draw the line and realize that past performance means nothing when you're looking for a store of value that's by definition designed for the future, too many make the mistake of grasping at specific periods ignoring the fact that when it's about losing and earning money, earning 10000% on 10$ won't make the loss of 50% on 100k.Quote from: LeGaulois on August 03, 2022, 12:51:19 PMSimilarly, Bitcoin cannot be considered a store of value as we cannot (for the time being) use it to buy goods or services.Here we disagree, gold can be a store of value and you can't really directly buy a car with it, neither can you with government bonds which at least in some countries have been considered the safest of the safe, but with most of them, it's even harder to convert them to fiat and exchange for merchandise that with bitcoin. You can't walk to an ATM and sell your bonds and neither can you do with gold.I actually think here Bitcoin gets a plus for being easy to convert, far more than traditional things, but what it gets a minus is the lacking of actually storing that value at any given time.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 04, 2022, 09:41:44 AMThe problem is that the world is not America, the world is not western Europe, the world is not the bigger cities ... you got the idea.In many countries there are so few places you can actually pay with bitcoin they almost don't deserve to be mentioned (they do, but they're, again, painfully few).

I don't doubt that everything else from computers, mobile phones, the internet, and even chain stores had a long history before being available to all.The thing is that just like you couldn't find a damn working ATM in all of Milos prior to the Greek crisis nor somebody to accept your card things change as demand arises and customers want to use it. And you won't have someone accepting Bitcoin in a town where there are only two bitcoin users, so this is why big cities win all the time.And we're back to the electric car dilemma, there are no electric cars because there are no stations to charge them and there are no stations to charge electric cars because nobody is buying electric cars.",

If it is wrong, it can be reprimanded and I accept.Since we were little, we only heard that gold is the right solution to maintain an investment portfolio and avoid depreciating value so that any money earned from work is saved and when it is collected it will be bought gold and stored for a relatively long time.This means that gold is part of a good history since the economic crisis and investors make Gold as a long-term store of value.Over time, the presence of Bitcoin has also become a much better solution for storing value in my opinion, although until now I have never held it with my own hands like gold.As we all know that inflation only occurs in fiat which is not based on the market value of a tangible asset. With fiat currency, the Government has the power in terms of printing money, but when confidence in the government falls, it can lead to inflation.It is very different from Bitcoin, so it is appropriate for Jeff Dorman to say that Bitcoin is not a \"store of value\", but a \"store of excess value\".",

      "body": "I don't disagree completely, but I have two remarks:Quote from: LeGaulois on August 03, 2022, 12:51:19 PMWhen you observe the Bitcoin market, it is much more used as a financial asset than as an alternative currency. [...]It is a fact that people perceive Bitcoin &co as an asset class in which they can invest and get a return on investment. [...] If a market attracts investors, it becomes volatile, while if the market attract people with a real need, it won't be the same.I agree with others that only the fact that Bitcoin attracts \"investors\" doesn't make it necessarily volatile. But you have a point here: the style of investment that happens often in the Bitcoin space is the culprit. I have called it sometimes the \"hoard and sell\" style: hold it for an extended period (often for ~3 months - 2 years) and then sell it for fiat and forget it (it's not the same as what convinced Bitcoiners call \"hodling\" - very much the opposite). This behavior is what characterizes also other high-risk assets, like penny stocks. You can be lucky with this strategy when you catch a bull market, and if not, then you're probably among these who increase the volatility panicking just in the biggest crashes (and sending the price further down with your market order panic sell ).Now how could we stop or at least discourage this kind of behavior? Of course with technical means, we probably can't, due to the descentralized nature of Bitcoin. What could be done is using communication from user to user, promoting long term hodling, contrarian trading and so on. But communication only is probably not enough.So in the end I agree with you, Bitcoin must be used more as a currency, as this would boost liquidity and lower volatility.It is definitively possible (albeit still not everywhere and for every purpose). I think for now the best is to promote every little step made in that direction, like the electronics shops that already accept it or the still timid El Salvador adoption (which is, in my opinion, much less of a \"failure\" than it's often described, as it was completely clear from the beginning that not all Salvadorians would embrace it from the start, so the ~10-15% of companies already having conducted Bitcoin payments are a good start.)The other part of the strategy to encourage \"currency use\" and discourage hoard-and-sell are instruments to protect the investment using Bitcoin means, as you write here:Quote from: LeGaulois on August 03, 2022, 12:51:19 PMThe function of a safe-haven asset is to withstand a crisis without losing value. [...]Whereas a store of value must be able to maintain its purchasing power over time. Where is the purchasing power protection for people who invested all their savings when the price was 60k, 50k, 40k, 30k?Bitcoin alone can't currently fill this role taking into account the short- to mid term. In the long term it does (as many have already written) but what we would need are instruments for people to protect the purchasing power during weeks or months. For example, it would be much more attractive to get your salary in Bitcoin if you can be sure that it won't lose more than (let's say) 5% until the end of the month.Perhaps one solution could be based on being to be more creative with financial products based on Bitcoin. For example, there are several platforms offering Bitcoin option contracts - in unsafe times put options could be promoted to the general public to protect you from crashes, using a \"collar\" (selling call options) to finance it.Another idea could be to create financial products based on the long term price trend, e.g. using long moving averages like the MA 500 or even 1000 (see this thread). These have a low volatility and very seldom fall significantly. The exact organization of such a contract however isn't totally clear to me - to be really interesting it should be ideally a \"perpetual\" contract.There are also Discreet Log Contracts which only depend on an oracle, not an exchange platform as an intermediary, which can be used for this purpose. Or this idea for decentralized options (which however would use a stablecoin to be able to protect from a purchasing power loss).",

One area bitcoin is much better than gold is in long term profits, that is why it is called a speculative asset.Quote from: aylabadia05 on August 04, 2022, 04:59:09 PMIt is very different from Bitcoin, so it is appropriate for Jeff Dorman to say that Bitcoin is not a \"store of value\", but a \"store of excess value\".That is an incorrect way to describe bitcoin in my opinion.",

How do you want it to be the same with Bitcoin?Gold is a store of value, but there is no mechanisms for stabilizing its price, no regulators who would prevent it from crashing to zero. And yet it demonstrates good performance, it retains and increases its value when stock markets are falling and inflation rises. The argument for Bitcoin that it would be just like gold, it would be viewed as a store of value because of its limited supply. That idea failed. It could still prove true in the long run, in a few decades at least. But there's no strong evidence that it will happen, it's just hope and speculation.",
