  "content": "Binance is one of the largest crypto market exchanges in world. It holds its token also as binance (BNB) coin. This token is now one among the top five crypto currencies. Binance coin price is on roller coaster currently with after FTX drama. Binance CEO CZ, compares the collapse of FTX with 2008 fall of regulated TradFi, which had been in existence for more than 70 years.He is optimistic about the crypto market and predicts a swift and significant recovery for the sector. In 2021, the BNB coin prices soared close to 1688.77 Percent and, from there, the market is waiting for a price increases at least until 2023. Since inflation fears are expected to become more severe at the beginning in the year ahead, Coinpedia Binance Coin Price Prediction(https://coinpedia.org/price-prediction/bnb-binance-coin-price-prediction) for 2023 is $275.2227 towards 2023's close. Currently BNB price is at $289.52 on Dec 6th 2022.What do you think, Binance price will surge above $289 or bearish trend will drag it down?",

However, I don't think the $300 price is unattainable for BNB in the coming year 2023",

Its outperformance seems a bit suspect. I actually wouldn’t blame people for shorting BNB here. I am bearish on it. I think it’s past due for a correction and think it should be trading below $200.",

The bear market has already pulled it down from its all time high.It's also a follower of the trend from bitcoin so as the other cryptocurrencies. $300 is easy price for it to met if you're thinking only with that price. That's not that much to think and very highly likely it will be there by 2023 and becomes stable.",

What do you think, Binance price will surge above $289 or bearish trend will drag it down?Well every price prediction that is coming from an average small investor like me is just a personal opinion and does not really say that much at all because it is just a guess. That being said i really think that a price of 300$ per BNB is very likely to be reached in 2023 i mean come on that is only like 12$ away from the current price. With the high price fluctuations that we are seeing in the crypto market in general it is even possible that we see a price of 300$ per BNB in the next few hours or something like that.So if we are not going downwards from here on with the crypto market as a whole i think 300$ per BNB should be no problem.",

We need to understand that in order for the coins to rise it needs the developer's development and updates. Continuous development will make a coin stable and it will be the reason to stay in the market and be one of the most competitive coins around. But with the current situation of the crypto market, you don't expect BNB and other coins to rise on their own without the help of bitcoins. When the bitcoin price will recover, top altcoins in the market will also follow.",

Did you think binance coin doesn't have ability to make it happen? i don't think so. Binance coin is the strongest coin by backed by the largest exchange site in the crypto. If bitcoin will be pumping even higher above 17k and binance will be easily surpassing such rate. The possible scenario for now if we will be seeing the price of binance will be going down as bitcoin dumped as well. The scenario in the crypto is very hard to predict now. People can't predict crypto accurately.",

And now it's price is much lower so we can enter in BNB coin now that will be a good investment.Investors more than ever need to be very careful, BNB as it is known is a coin released by the binance exchange, and while it has shown a good behavior over the years at the same time we need to be very wary of any centralized coin at the present due to the specific circumstances that we are going through, binance seems to be in  more solid situation than other exchanges but we cannot simply trust them, as this seemed to be the case for the FTX exchange as well and it collapsed in less than a week.",

CZ has this stranglehold on crypto which he aint letting soon Mind you that CZ is a businessman who will definitely put his own pocket first in anything he does, even if it has to do with manipulation or pumping his token for the meantime, only for it to dump later on after his desired effect has been actualized, i wonder why you should have so much trust in an individual, in a network that is meant to be trustless. Having said that, i know quite a lot of people are bullish on the price of BNB, but as you accumulate on that token, watch out for a possible dump sooner rather than later, so do no put everything into it expecting a constant pump.",

However, I don't think the $300 price is unattainable for BNB in the coming year 2023You're right, we have seen several times that the domination of Bitcoin has greatly influenced the movement of Altcoins, if the price of Bitcoin has decreased, then the majority of altcoins will also follow that flow (there are even some altcoins whose declines are even worse). But I personally think $300 isn't an unreasonable target for $BNB, right now $BNB is at $288, just a few dollars short of reaching that target by the end of 2023. Well, back to our initial point that the movement of the majority of altcoins will still follow the movement of Bitcoin itself.",

I think it will more like be 500 dollars by somewhere close to end of 2023, we are going to see it actually go super high. That doesn't mean that it will happen in January though, maybe in October who knows? So, just because it hasn't reached where you want it to reach, do not let it go, you should still invest into it for sure.I personally believe that it will go a lot higher, but that would require a lot of waiting and in order for you to make a profit, you need to buy it and also wait, you can't just do one and not the other and expect to make a profit.",
