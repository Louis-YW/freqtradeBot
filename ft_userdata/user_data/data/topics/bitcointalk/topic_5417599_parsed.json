These ads are not intermediated by bitcointalk.org in any way. If you are interested in advertising in this way, it is recommended that you hire a signature manager.\"But, if you happen to be new into signature campaign, here is a brief explanation. Signature Campaign is a kind of campaign just like ads, whereby members of the forum are hired to promote a given project by means of post count and been paid a given $ rate either weekly or monthly.But for a signature campaign to be successful, 3 things are involved.1. You have a hire a signature designer who will design a very good looking signature for your company2.  Hire a manager who will manage your signature campaign project.3. Hire a specific forum members base on rank to help promote your project on the forum And you can get a good Signature designer and Manager both on the  \"Service\" board of the forumExample of reputable Signature manager that you can hire are:1. Hhampuz2. CryptopreneurBrainboss3. Icopress4. Gianluca95",

But for my project, I am not sure anymore.No worries, it's better to know beforehand since it could be a costly mistake should you advertise only to find out later.Based on my observation, casinos have mainly been the prime choice because there are plenty of players and high rollers here, hence the competition. However not all brands could or would sustain after a few weeks. If you're looking for a more affordable choice, there is the Bounty (Altcoin) board which you could pay in altcoins or tokens but generally the qualities of postings are much lower unless you are totally fine with the quantity > quality, as that subforum is basically for those that either are ineligible for signature campaigns or are simply there for simple tasks.One more way is to find some popular or well-known members' avatars and/ or signature spaces for rental. Those are in the Services board.",

Thing is, majority of people here are bitcoiners that don't care much about anything altcoin/NFT/Metaverse related or anything else popular at the moment. Don't get me wrong, signature campaigns can be good and effective way to promote your business around here but only if there's a lot of your target audience which I don't think is the case.",
