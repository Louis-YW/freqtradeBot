There is no free gift anywhere. At first it might be free but second time will not be as lucky as the first time. Just like Doan9269 Said, there is no Father Christmas anywhere. They come with offers that would Leeds you to spending your reserved funds. When something is too good to be true, just stay away. It's better to use your fund and invest in bitcoin and make profit after a period of time. rather than going for such things.",

Don't feel sad, dude; most of my friends, including me, missed the $JTO airdrop. However, we need to go on since Christmas is here, and every Christmas brings us new events & opportunities. Along with several big projects, exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Bitget, Gate_io, and others also offer many exciting events for their users. So I am preparing to hunt them. Earlier, you mentioned the Christmas trading event: is this open to all or only for the new African users?",
