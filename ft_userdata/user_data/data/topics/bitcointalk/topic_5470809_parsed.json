They personally play in the casino to make a review so you can assure that everything that they stated on the casino feedback is genuine.It will save you a lot of time by using trusted casino review website.https://www.btcgosu.com/https://gamblingbro.com/",

Is it ? I guess this by the tone of your post which suggests that there may be no trusted sport bookie  Anyways, to your knowledge, you can safely play your bets at https://stake.com/ and rest assured that you will never be scammed. This is one of the best sports betting sites (they also have a regular casino section too). You can check the Ann thread of Stake here on bitcointalk and see the feedback of the gamblers playing there.It is always better to know and get true and honest feedback from the players, before choosing a casino site or a sports betting site.",

      "body": "Guys, he is looking for bookmakers.Stake has a terrible sportsbook with even worse odds, total waste of time.On most other bookies you get at least 10% better odds than stake. Even sportsbet.io has better odd, even though they are using the same odds provider. Shows you how greedy stake is.I shared this some days ago. At basketball odds are bad but not as bad as on for example volleyball or tennis.Still pinnacle is much better.The best odds you will always get at pinnacle or betfair. Betfair surely is great but since it's a betting exchange this might have a huge impact on limits. If nobody is offering odds then there is nothing to bet on of course.Pinnacle on the other hand has the best odds online in my opinion. Sure the live betting is not as big and fancy as bet365 but if you don't care about live this is the site you want to use.They also offer crypto deposits and withdrawals now, the money in the account though is always converted into a chosen currency.",

There are some complaints of delayed withdrawals, crediting of deposit, or something along those lines, but those are isolated cases that never really happen most of the time to a lot of people. They also have high limits, so if you're a high roller looking to change bookies then you can go and give Stake a try.",

Well, stake and many of the reputable casinos here won't do that to you. If you're a meticulous type of player and you don't want to get scammed again, choose what you think is best for you. And for the set choices, you're already in the section where announcement threads are made. Explore and read from their threads to have at least the idea that you are looking for. But to give you an idea, all of them have satisfied and dissatisfied customers, the good ones will give the experience that has been done on them and little to no complaints at all. And the other one doesn't have a good experience that even makes them not consider them anymore, so to each their own.",

From my personal experience when I joined the forum newly, I don't know what signatures are. I was just wondering seeing other people with different write up under their post while mine doesn't have, not knowing it's even call signature with encrypted links. I get to know it after my little stay here and I assume it will be the same case with op.To op, if you want to give stake a trial as suggested by the reply I qoute above, just click on the link under his post before the next person's post and you'll be directed to stake's site.
