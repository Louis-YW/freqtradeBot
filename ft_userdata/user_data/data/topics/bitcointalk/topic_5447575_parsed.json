  "content": "For a long time, we have only talked about great guys who have made significant contributions to the cryptocurrency industry and those who made history using cryptocurrencies like \"BITCOIN.\"      But we seldom ever discuss the efforts made by women who helped create the cryptocurrency sector. Is it because we don't care as much about them or because they are less important?A female acquaintance of mine who has experience in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets just introduced herself to me. I was initially astounded by how much more knowledgeable she was than I was on the market cap, Blockchain, and other trading activity. She said that it was a family custom and that she had genuinely learned it from her experienced older sister. This got me to thinking about why there are ladies out there that are so interested in cryptocurrencies yet go unnoticed. Therefore I made the decision to look into some women who have made significant contributions to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sector.##Lightning Labs, the business that created the software for the Lightning Network, was co-founded and is led by American entrepreneur and computer scientist Elizabeth stark. She serves as a consultant to a number of blockchain and cryptocurrency firms. She has really been involved in the cryptocurrency industry since 2011, when she co-taught a course at Stanford University on bitcoin and decentralized systems, and later served as an advisor to many Blockchain businesses.##Amber Baldet is a co-founder of Clovyr, a Blockchain-based platform that aids in the creation and administration of decentralized applications for businesses and developers. She is a well-known figure in the Blockchain sector and was in charge of creating the quorum Blockchain platform.##Laura Shin was the senior editor at Forbes and in charge of the majority of the company's blockchain and cryptocurrency assets. She is currently employed as a crypto journalist and influencer for we'll know Bitcoin.##The London Bitcoin Women meetup group, which Rhian Lewis co-founded with a friend in 2014, is co-hosted by her. Rhian Lewis is also a co-developer of the altcoin portfolio tracker CountMyCrypto. She is a former digital journalist for the Times of London and holds a BSc in Economics from UCL.you can click this link, to see more women who has contributed in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencieshttps://cryptoweekly.co/crypto-female-50-awardsAccording to my study, all of the women who are currently in charge of cryptocurrency are co-founders of significant crypto companies. They have contributed significantly to the development of the Bitcoin Blockchain and other decentralized systems worldwide.",

She has a heart of man & could be the wisest of them all. I strongly doubt others are independent/smart enough to survive in the end",

Let's not separate this kind of thing and there's really no useful context. Anyone can own Bitcoin, women, men, young and old all have the same position in holding Bitcoin. If we classify Bitcoin ownership only from gender then indirectly Bitcoin is won by male groups. But is that the point? But I really admit that the contribution of women in helping to improve blockchain technology is extraordinary. The list above shows us that women have equal rights in participating in a part of crypto adoption.",

So in what aspect of the cryptocurrency ecosystem that women are not mentioned? If the thread the user creates concerns women and t has to mention their name, their names must be mentioned has you have done. You mentioned those names because the thread concerned them. If they are not mentioned by another person that does mean that they are not contributing to the development of the system, just that the particular article did not focus bon them but males at the time.I have seen thread mentioned women at USA that talked about blockchain. Therefore, OP don't think that they are not carried along in the ecosystem.",

There are several factors that can influence why some women are not so interested in technology discussions. One of them is their educational background, work experience and some because of personal interests. If we look at the nature of women who are more gentle, not rational and more emotional. Making decisions based on emotions and feelings. Women actually have a larger Hippocampus than men. The Hippocampus is part of the brain that is able to store and organize memories well and remember new things as well as connect certain sensations and emotions to these memories.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HippocampusQuote from: bitmover on April 04, 2023, 05:17:37 PMThis is a characteristic of the culture we live in.

One thing certain is that everybody must not be popularly known in a particular sector just like in the case of crypto, because by virtue that these women were listed on the \"top 50 most influential people in crypto\" on the article link you just shared, it is a great sign they are indeed truly recognized in the crypto sector. But moreover, you don't expect these women to be as popular as \"Satoshi\" the creator of Bitcoin or \"Changpeng Zhao\" the owner of Binance (the world's largest exchange), or even \"Laszlo Hanyecz\" the guy who sold his 10,000 BTC for mere 2 pizzas, which had turn out to be a day to always remember in the history of Bitcoin.So in conclusion, I don't believe women are neglected in the world of crypto, but only just that they haven't done thing enough to make them globally known/go viral in history.",

In this forum, we respect each other and respect anyone, whether it's men, women, young people or even old people who are involved in the world of cryptocurrencies.Apart from that the OP's post is good and maybe it can be an inspiration in itself for all of us, especially the women who join this forum so that they are not insecure and can be confident to do activities and be actively involved in the crypto world.",

You can be anyone from any place and still own Bitcoin. We are we to judge! Let's just enjoy what we have today rather than thinking who are involved or what they are doing.",

But, as the awareness grows and it's becoming obvious that crypto is here to stay, then we'll see more women joining in.There was actually a recent study in Singapore claiming that women actually (slightly) outperformed men in profitability in crypto trading.
