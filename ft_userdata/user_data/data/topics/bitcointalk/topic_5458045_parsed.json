Today, he would have been $7.5million richer had he invested.  They say do not invest in what you do not understand which was largely the principle the speaker adhered to but what if despite not immediately understanding the business model and its profit making model yet your business instinct pushing you to invest. What should you do? Listen to the former or follow your instincts?",

What should you do? Listen to the former or follow your instincts?I would say follow your instincts but sometimes our instincts are wrong so it is proper to listen to peoples thoughts on some certain that then you could proceed to do your own proper research and if you feel comfortable then you can invest on it. Why I don’t want people to trust blindly others advice is when the loss hit comes it hits you heard because most you might have put up all hopes on that project due to the things you heard, and we all that project promoters will hardly tell you the risky part of the project just to lure you in. But if it is your own research you would have surely find out that the risk is there and probably have a plan B just in case it doesn’t work out like the other plan. This will surely minimize the impact of the loses.I wouldn’t blame the professor because just Like he is actually snapping on himself by missing this opportunity it is the same thing that had he invested he could have lost. In his own case of not investing he didn’t profit but also he didn’t loses is own 100k which could have an option should he invested. So the thing is invest in what you believe in even if it is an amount you can lose",

You don't expect him to invest in every idea that comes his way. Worst of all, a business he doesn't understand. Now people might only look at how much he would have gained if he had invested, but these same people would have called him stupid for investing in a business idea he's not really familiar with. Not everybody should go around following their instinct in matters like this, so they follow the normal business model. For you to use your instincts then you have to be someone that has a good business instinct.",

I may say that the professor's choice not to invest  in business is the best  in the circumstances of the in the story.I think everyone who makes blind investments is willing to take too much risk which can likely end up in scam",

Which is a solid point but also rules out lots of potentially good investments.I get why someone wouldn't invest into something that didn't have a plan to make profit, but i constantly invest into things i don't fully understand. That's because i am honest to myself and admit that there are smarter people than me. Usually i listen to several smart people before buying something. I am not always the smartest guy in a room and sometimes get fooled, but i've learned a lot from those mistakes and now i require much more information then i used to.But i still wouldn't invest into anything that didn't make sense to me. That i see different than not fully understanding (tech) and still buying.",

What the speaker did is just correct, and since he did not understand the business model of the one who gave the pitch, he passed on the offer and went on his merry way. At best, he just lost an opportunity, but not money in general because we wouldn't know either way if the business will succeed or not at the moment of the pitch. I guess the regret is there, but disciplined people always tend to succeed in life in a lot of aspects, and since he's practicing that discipline, I'm pretty sure that that speaker found another opportunity that he knew well.",

In the category of high-risk investments, you can divide your investments into high-risk investments that you know about and high-risk investments that are unknown to you.With a good diversification of your investments, high-risk investments may be unknown to you, representing about 5% of your total investments, and then an investment of a small amount such as $ 1,000 may achieve an excellent return within two years.for some people bitcoin is high-risk investments known to them and for other is unknown, you need to learn and read about many things to be readt for this investments.",

I think knowledge about investing is the most important point. If you have an instinct or interest in unknown investing, then you should first study that field. If you just stick to instinct then it's just speculation or gambling. It might work but it's just luckThe bitcoin case, which is currently very expensive, might be an example. In the past, I think many people were familiar with bitcoin, but most people either didn't believe in bitcoin or thought bitcoin was bullshit. Or maybe a lot of people have sold their bitcoins by the time they hit $2000. I think there are a lot of people who regret selling their bitcoins. But that's investment, investment is a gray space, it's very difficult to determine which projects will be successful in the future. One way to find out is with analysis and knowledge, although not guaranteed but better than instinct",

Listen to the former or follow your instincts?Everything should be for reference only, and always summarizing your own experiences, you can dig deep into the startup, its business model, related industry and growth potential. This will give you a clear view of the company's likelihood of success and risk. Listen to what your business instincts say, but consider it carefully before making a decision. If you believe the startup has great potential and you have done enough research, you can decide according to your instincts. Consider your finances and determine how much risk you can accept. Don't invest important money that you can't lose. Refer back to the sharing of people with experience in the industry or from investment experts. They can provide useful information and advice on investment choices. Consider all of the above factors and make a deliberate decision. If you can learn more about the company and its business model, this could be an attractive investment opportunity. However, always remember that investing in what you don't understand carries risks.",

Now that it turned out to have ended in profit, he at least has his $100k and maybe have grown it in other investments as well.Should he have narrated some other stories, am sure there would have been occasions where these principles might have saved him.Understanding how a project hopes to make profit or grow the project and the risk associated is of great importance. Don’t be deceived by instincts. They aren’t always right but it’s your decision either to follow or not. You ought to be receptive of the outcome and learn from them.",
