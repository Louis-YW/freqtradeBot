Or maybe, during the election season and everyone’s watching, he used it to hype things up and even slipped in his Trump Coin because he knew people would buy it. And then what happened next? It dumped. So , don’t trust Trump too much. He always has some hidden agenda behind his actions.",

Maybe Donald Trump supports Bitcoin for reasons that the price of bitcoin and the overnight increase will be foolish. Bitcoin’s price usually rises on supply demand and its price may also be upward under the influence of various varied events such as the global epidemic or ruling decisions of different countries. When the epidemic began around the world, people’s trust in crypto currency was created as people began to trust cryptocurrencies during the coronavirus. The comments you made seem reasonable to me but there are many reasons for the increase in bitcoin price to accept it.",

Since the speech in Nashville and the Bitcoin reserve, there has been a positive push in the price. But you shouldnt forget the halving, which also have played a part in the price going over 100k. The cycle after the halving has always been good in the past, and the period after the elections in America was also good. So Trump is one who has participated in a time that is positive for bitcoin. But bitcoin does not need presidents in the long term, but in the short term it is a faster increase in the price.",

At present though at 85k I see a stagnancy in price, I hope this changes and we can go back to 100k and then grow from there.With the strategic reserve idea going around, a bullish movement will be coming in. If the US does this, more countries are going to follow suit and that should make the governments there more lenient towards exchanges and users.However we are still in the dark about what Trump actually wants.

At best that namedropping helped break that resistance. But the rest is normal market behavior after such a resistance is broken (price shoots up a lot higher breaking more resistances easier). See 2023 for example to see similar event. In the last quarter of 2023 price is stuck behind the $50k resistance and when it is finally broken the price keeps on breaking more levels and reaches $70k in about 3 months.We had the same in last quarter of 2024, after being stuck behind $70k wall it was broken and then price reached $110k in about 3 months!",

There's no reason to give unnecessary credit to Trump as the god that made it possible for Bitcoin to quickly catapulted to $100k. Do you agree with those people that are giving credit to Trump? What do you have to say. Well, just let those people do believe on what they do believe because if they are those people who do love to see or watch news and other sentiments in the market then they would really be that thankful if ever there's something that made out the market do make out some pumps on which they will be having that kind of positive approach towards it. We do know that presidential election did really give out that kind of positivity towards the market on which we do know that Trump isnt that negative towards Bitcoin on which if ever this was the reason of the pump then so be it, but just like on what i had read earlier that it did made out some negative fundamentals as well on which it did really made the price drop. This is why it could really be that interchangeable if we do speak about trend because news could possibly impact the market movement or behavior.In overall, we do know that FA isnt really that always been effective or could give out that impact to the market but as a trader or investor then you will be having this kind of assumption on using up these informations on which it will really be that helping you out on what will be t he potential movements that it could really be having. For me then i dont make myself that being too optimistic whenever i do see some positive news or sentiments on which anytime it could really be make out some changes and left you unguarded with your entries and possible exits.",

What do you have to say. This is true that Bitcoin has been orgranically growing since 2009 but in each market cycle, there are very bullish and euphoric months when news have very big impacts to boost Bitcoin demand and price. There are narratives in Bitcoin market cycles to boosting it to new all time high, but will Bitcoin adoption damages after a bull market? The answer is not, price is affected more than Bitcoin adoption in bear market.Sustainable adoption with time, years and cycles mean that Bitcoin value and price will continue its upward growth over year.If you are still doubtful about it?Check Bitcoin Yearly Lowest Prices over years, you will see more bullish trend.",

What do you have to say. It's all in the past and you can say whatever you think is true, even if you say that if Harris won, Bitcoin price would have hit $150k instead of Trump winning. This is also true if you insist that your thinking is correct.I agree that we should not exaggerate and glorify Trump as a god but we should also not deny that he has had a significant impact on the markets before and after becoming president. Like right now, many people are complaining about Trump and blaming him for the market correction. Do you think it's Trump's fault? If you blame Trump like many others but deny his contribution to the rise in bitcoin prices late last year, it's ridiculous.",

It’s expected that as adoption increases and Bitcoin becomes less volatile, we won’t see massive price surges like before. That’s why I call a $30K jump huge as it’s a big move in a short time.It might not match the Bitcoin characteristics you’re expecting, but my evaluation is based on its current status. I believe that as more institutional investors adopt Bitcoin, the market will become less volatile and more stable. In the future, even a 10% to 20% swing could already be considered massive.",
