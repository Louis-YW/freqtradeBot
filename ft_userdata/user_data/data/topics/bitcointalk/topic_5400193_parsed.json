  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk community member and Bitcoin art collector I am creating bitcoin art since 2017. I decided to create even smaller artwork than usual. I didn't wanted to write the story behind the artwork, I think this creation of art will speak for itself. I tried to imagine the feeling of our guy Laszlo who bought the pizza for 10,000 Bitcoin and hour for hour after my therapies I drew this artwork \"Bitcoin Pizza Day 2022\" by mx12#24 hand signed pieces/artworks in size 15x19 Inch(together with frame)Thanks to our community member \"dkbit98\" for tip, I found the BitcoinPizzaDay2022 contest as well.if the price ticker is not loading then update the link BTC=¬†+ (US 45$ Shipping ) + (EU 25$ Shipping)Payment address: 3Mvy8qdm7wZugfK5dvwtjiXfjmXm8kwSUS1.
