My emphasis is on \"really very\" there. Just take a look at how the FTX saga is dragging other stuff into issues and bankruptcy with it. You can imagine how many other exchanges that rely on Binance to draw their sources from it and what will happen if Binance goes down with what's happening with little FTX compared to Binance.QuoteCan crypto survive without the centralise organizations and projects? It will drag the development backwards. We can recollect how difficult it was a few years ago buying cryptos on the internet.

Their chain, Binance Smart Chain is bigger than Solana too.Unless their report - Our Commitment To Transparency - is cooked, their finance management is good and healthy. According to this, they did not use customer money inappropriately and did not take too high risk like FTX.Tether is a biggest stable coin and its impact (if it collapse) would be bigger than UST impact in May 2020.Whatever happen with Binance and USDT in future, I am sure governments will launch more laws and execute more strictly regulations on cryptocurrency and blockchain.

If (or when) Binance will go down, another exchange (or, hopefully a DEX this time, although I doubt is) will rise and take the lead. It has happened before. Many even thought that FTX will replace Binance, heh.Plus, \"crypto\" will probably get a well deserved blow, since most projects' reason to exist is just to suck up money. Although many will just switch to Bitcoin intead of Tether, for example.Actually, without Tether the system (the prices!) could become clearer and more honest, since Tether is, let's be honest, overly inflated.I don't know why people keep relying on centralized stuff no matter how hugely disappointing that is...",

Crypto was doing fine just before the centralized exchanges came and it will continue to live on if a Cex like Binance goes down,only problem with this is many users will be affected as they might be holding coins on the exchange which means markets will bleed for some time.Can we do without them? Let's just say we have become comfortable with a Cex and at this point cannot do without them.",

It would be a general shitshow, no questions about it, given the Binance market position and amount of people that are using Tether  for either trading or hodling (creazy thing to do, but people do it nevertheless). But no, it wouldn't be over for crypto and certainly not for Bitcoin. It would be the end for thousands of useless shitcoins though and probably more exchanges/platforms that are in some way connected to Binance.Quote from: XEN_Protocol on November 20, 2022, 05:22:31 AMCan crypto survive without the centralise organizations and projectsSure it can, but centralize exchanges would continue to exist, as before.",

Can crypto survive without the centralise organizations and projects? Just as others have commented, no it isn't over for the cryptocurency industry if those scenario you mentioned above does occur instead it'll push for more decentralization of the industry and increase awareness for the use of more of dApp instead of centralized ones. Just to take you back memory lane, back when Mt. Gox exchange was still in function and arguably more powerful than Binance, it got hacked and that didn't end the cryptocurrency movement. For more clarity read;.QuoteThe first major crypto hack occurred in 2011 when the crypto exchange Mt. Gox lost 25,000 bitcoins worth approximately $400,000.  At that time, the crypto exchange was handling nearly 70% of all bitcoin transactions. The attack didn't stop and Mt. Gox was attacked again in 2014. It lost almost 650,000 of its customers' bitcoins, and around 100,000 of its own. At the time that was 7% of all bitcoins, and worth around $473 million. Initial reasons for the coins' disappearance were unclear, but later evidence showed that the coins were stolen from the company's hot wallet.Source: https://www.investopedia.com/news/largest-cryptocurrency-hacks-so-far-year/As you can read, back then Mt. Gox was incharge of 70% of all Bitcoin transaction yet that hack didn't end the Bitcoin movement. Today although binance is the most dominant exchange but we have other options out there that even as dominate as Binance is, institutional investors still has other exchange they used for their purchases.",
