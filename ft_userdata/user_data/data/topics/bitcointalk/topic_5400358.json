  "content": "Hello, how are you?I hope you're all doing well! Today I come with a query related to the RSK Blockchain ecosystem.Recently a project within this Blockchain called Blindex came out, as I understand it is like a PancakeSwap within the RSK Blockchain compatible with RBTC.My interest about this platform is to invest in a LP where they have their algorithmic stablecoin + DOC, in this LP they are paying 70% per year in USD.It is very good percentage and from what I read blindex stablecoin is algorithmic but not all of it, that is, it seems to have a part with collateral backing and the other with algorithm.I wanted to know if anyone knows, if you invested, if you prefer other platforms within RSK like Sovryn, MoneyOnChain or Tropykus.Thank you very much!!!",

      "body": "hi there! I invested on Blindex plataform and yeah! it had huge ROI but the highest ones only reach when more time you lock the value. and I take a peep and to be a recently new, it start with the right steps.first they do a \"SEMI-Algorhytm\" Stablecoin, that is for sure totally different to LUNA UST( and all we know what happend there) the LP at 70% occurs on long time Value Lock, that for me its nice to see high returns in a long time, make the proyect strong, and always they are developingto make a better product every dayTropykus wallets have support to RSK and recently release features to integrate the NFT support too!, I see a brillant future there, also RSK have its own RSK Swap",

      "body": "Hello everyone! I did not know about such high percentages of returns, I am going to investigate more about that project, thanks for sharing the information.At the moment I am taking advantage of leaving $RBTC as collateral to mint $DOC. The truth is that I am very happy with the operation of the network, the low fees and the fast transactions.",

Once you exchange btc for rbtc the transaction costs are very low, you can be free and fast! And about Blindex is a DEX that lets all users mint, swap, invest, and redeem any pegged currency without any exposure to USD when getting in or out of a trade. It is a very good option.",

Considering everything that has been happening in the market such as Terra Luna, now bad news from Celsius is being publicized and negative things continue to appear. I found in RSK and Tropykus a secure DEFI with RBTC.",
