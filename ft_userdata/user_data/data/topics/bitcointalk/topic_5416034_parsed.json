We never had any client issues with it.You can also use our live chat for any issues or guidance, and our support staff works 24/7/365 which you can reach from client area, support ticket system, with a guaranteed 15 minutes response time.Please note that as an offshore dedicated servers provider, we keep our clients confidentiality and privacy very high, and you can also signup with us using proton email for further privacy, as our many clients do same.Thanks.",
