  "content": "In order to keep Ukraine's military and populace connected, the richest man in the world turned on his company's satellite internet infrastructure there in February.However, according to US media, the Tesla owner asked the Pentagon to fund the program in his place last month.Musk tweeted on Friday that his space company, which creates the Starlink system, \"is not attempting to recoup previous expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system permanently.\" Starlink uses a network of satellites to deliver high-speed internet. It has proven essential for the military of Ukraine as it battles to regain Ukrainian territory from Russia. According to Mr. Musk, maintaining the program costs $20 million (£18 million) each month. Recently, he said that SpaceX has already paid $80 million to keep Ukraine online. He stated on Twitter that \"in addition to terminals, we have to develop, launch, operate & replenish satellites & ground stations.\" We also had to protect ourselves from more difficult cyberattacks and jamming.If Elon Musk decides he no longer want's to bear the cost of funding the Starlink system, will the pentagon step in and take over the funding or leave Ukraine to their faith?https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63266142",

There is a lot of efforts to be done to give the Ukrainians an internet access but Elon quickly managed it to provide. If he was just a regular investor who would want to get paid in providing internet access, this investor will be first battling with a political party before a satellite can be up and running.But I think Elon is also brooding for his suggestion to put an end to this war with his peace negotiation plan cause the internet  users to go against him.",

He showed the world how effective and quality service his company can provide at any time in any situation.

      "body": "According to the statements of a Pentagon official today, Elon Musk has provided a service to the world and now he wants in return for that service. This statement reflects US reluctance to fund Starlink.On the other hand, the situation is very embarrassing given the situation in Ukraine after the United States announced its unconditional support for it, so it is not good to abandon it with regard to the most vital component of its communications (the Internet).Personally, I cannot consider Elon Musk to have abandoned Ukraine or the Starlink project with this step, but it is natural that he will not be able to fund the project indefinitely, especially if he does not make any significant profits from it.",

The amount of donation Ukraine is receiving is I think enough for them to find an alternative way or buy the service from starlink. With Russia trying to sabotage the starlink satellites, it would become more expensive for them to maintain the network. Elon has done as much as he could and it's his decision if he wants to donate more or not. Likely the media is going to twist this against him since he wanted to make the Ukrain-Russia peace plan but most of them was against it.",

While on the one hand, I understand that Ukraine doesn't want outsiders interfering in their war (ironic if you think that if it wasn't for the west, who knows how far Russia would have gone), Elon was just stating one very possible scenario. On the other hand, I find it completely unprofessional from the diplomat's side to respond in that way on public social media.",

I don't remember where I saw this, so I am not sure its reliability. If true, the two events are likely related. There is an argument that SpaceX was giving free internet access to Ukraine as a marketing gimmick. The news made headlines, and I am sure that many looked into using SpaceX internet service that had not previously done so. It is also possible that SpaceX was not generating enough additional paying customers for it to make sense for them to continue giving Ukraine free internet service.",
