Because anybody is risk averse, to make people accept risk, you have to force them at gun point. Don’t invest, yes, when it’s a fascism, then you have to give in, may be just some of the money, just don’t go full retard and invest 101% into it.",

You have successfully explained how the Tesla stocks prices have increased 12 times in about 3 years(before going down). I don't know what exactly you are trying to say in this forum thread, but it is well known that many companies can artificially pump their stock prices by getting loans and buying them back from the shareholders. There was a term for this financial operation, but I don't remember it. Maybe it was called \"financial leverage\" or \"leverage buy back\".Your example isn't completely correct because a market cannot consist of only one person. You need at least two people. This has something to do with \"the biggest fool\" theory. A financial asset costs as much as the highest price that a fool could pay.",

Is it important to know this? You can’t be rich if you don’t know this, that’s whole reason why middle classes are poor people today, clearly it’s too important to ignore completely. Of course I know what’s the impact when too many people learn this tricks, when everybody buy their own raspberry and flip the price to higher, the entire society would collapse, the money value would plummet, the hardworking group of middle classes would stop working for money, a bunch of de-civilisation would take place, think of Greece in the making on real-time. Greater fool theory? Tbh, it’s a bit misleading, nobody is fool when it come to money, it’s when anybody can be fool when belief in the religion, anybody can become mindless cattle when they believe it’s a honour to die for fighting the wars.

This is why you and I can't make a big profit in the long run if we do it ourselves, we need to give our money to them so they can get their cut, if we do not, then there will be plenty of people who lose money because they can't hold long enough.There is a reason why people say \"market could stay illogical longer than you can stay solvent\" and this is one of the reasons. Basically rich people get together and make moves that could destroy your portfolio and then get all the profits later on.",

Also remember there is nothing new about shilling your own raspberry, a lot of people has been shilling their own old coins collection since for <insert_year_here> ago, but the practice has just took a new level, now it’s shilling itself on the internet.Also I never include an answer to the question. So I would tell you here directly, despite the raspberry soar from $5 to $25 on perception, I didn’t make a single profit out of it, yup totally ZERO profit, it’s intriguing the price has changed but no profit is being made, which sound like what the Warren Buffett like to boost about magical compounding effect, I called it bullshit, the growing number is just an old man tricks to fool little kids, while trap them and enslave them financially, talk about someone with ulterior motives for their action.Quote from: SquallLeonhart on February 15, 2023, 07:44:09 PMBasically the mindset is that stock markets are already controlled by a few big companies......could destroy your portfolio and then get all the profits later on.I don’t care what are other talking about, they’re trying to push their on belief which for me I think is very bad because I don’t want to get near with religion, religion always ended up with them getting conned there is no exception through the history every religion conned it’s worshipper, every damn religion, I can name a lot but you can conveniently just search in the internet. But I’m strongly convinced \"front-running\" is the new tool on the town for the hot boy to play with, they’re nearly always he house when they can front run anyone else in this trading game system.",

It’s just not for me to work so hard for it, and the Wall Street enjoy all the fruit of my labour to trade stock.muh make passive income from stock, stress free, and without efforts, free money!Good luck believing on that bs.

However until someone actually buys it, it doesn't change the market value for that particular item.One of the main problems is that people think of the stock market as a speculative marketplace where people try to sell stuff higher than they bought (like in the crypto space). Stocks are not collectibles, their price doesn't depend only on supply and demand, they are pieces of companies that you own and that make money. Stocks appreciate in value because companies appreciate in value. When Nvidia was a small company its stock had little value. Now when it is a dominant player in GPUs the stock is worth much more, because that piece of the company from before is much larger and makes much more money.Stocks are nothing like raspberry, houses, or Hondas.",

Which is one of the hardest things to do with investing as many good trades run contrary to rumor mills and media.I thought hard about buying tesla when I saw it close to $120 but got distracted and forgot about it. There are still good opportunities in stocks. Although, I don't think that a always be in the market type of mentality is a good strategy to have in bear markets such as our current one.",

You need to sell to someone else for it to be a valid transaction...I have had the answer to this, but I decide to reserve it for the very final show. When I’m the house in this game,  getting a buyer isn’t a concern, I rephrase getting a buyer doesn’t need to take any efforts, house always win, it doesn’t matter getting buyer or getting seller, house is above the market, it’s above the buyer market, it’s way above the seller market, house is the king maker who decide even who can be the buyer and seller, the ultimatum of the game who have the final judgement. In the eye of a house, both buyer and seller are treated as a 4D chess player, buyer being the black player, seller being the white player, doesn’t matter black or white or buyer or seller, as a house I decide who win the game, all at my wills, also they’re all at my mercy and disposal, whether you’re buyer or seller you can’t ridicule my final judgement no matter how hard you try.Is it crazy thought? Not so crazy for a house, but very crazy thought for a trader, because trader can never be the house and think the same.I believe many have the answer to it at their mind at this point. I would still like to see how many can see the picture, without me giving complete hints. I can expect many can’t see it since they’re too obese with poor mindset.",
