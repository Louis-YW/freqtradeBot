Until you cash out crypto, taxes can't be demanded from you. Therefore, when you want to make any purchase, use all your charm to convince seller to accept payment in crypto. You still owe taxes on this. This would just make you a tax cheat - a criminal.Hopefully eventually here in the US (and well, same thing in other countries), Congress will pass a law that exempts purchases of a few hundred dollars or less in bitcoin from being taxed to encourage using bitcoin as payments. It has already been proposed a couple times in Congress though I'm sure it'll be a number of years until enough politicians care about Bitcoin to actually pass such a law. Whenever that happens though that would allow bitcoin to be spent on daily purchases without tax implications. This is a necessary requirement before bitcoin payments can start getting popular because until that happens the two options are you track your profit from every single payment or you are a tax cheat criminal. Of course we've got many years before bitcoin payments are even going to be implemented on the merchant side and until there are enough people who want to spend bitcoin to make payments a regular thing. But until we get such a law you can't simply convince someone to accept bitcoin as payment and now owe taxes on that lol. Let's not promote ideas that screw over people's lives and turn them into criminals. We want Bitcoin to HELP people, not hurt them.",

So now I've got tons of tax losses to use to offset my taxes that I owe each year, until these tax losses from 2022 run out. So in 2022 that cancelled out most of my taxes (I paid $353 in taxes that year), its cancelling out all my taxes in 2023 so I owe nothing. And unless Bitcoin is already peaking by end of this year (in which case I'll be selling some bitcoin) I'll again pay no taxes this year. But of course this is all only because I stupidly thought in 2021 altcoins were gonna start gaining traction long term and I ended up taking a 6 figure loss on that assumption just to get out of that crap. But that mistake allows me to not pay taxes for a few years until I've made back in profit all that I lost.",

Really, I think, that's a very high amount, isn't it? However, we still don't really understand how tax is determined and calculated in each country.Because indeed, the more the government looks at Bitcoin and crypto as a whole, the more eager they are to make various regulations. the end of which, again, is taxes. For this reason, it cannot be denied that there are many parties who hide or manipulate their assets as much as possible in order to avoid taxes. And is this possible?",

So it's better to comply with the rules where you are living right now.

You would be taxed when you use centralized platforms for crypto transactions.

In Germany, crypto profits are completely tax-free for a holding period of 1+ year (as far as I know, there is no other country where this is the case). If you sell them within the one year, then the personal tax rate on the profits applies, and this can be between 0% and 45%, with only around 22% of the 45% being pure income tax.
