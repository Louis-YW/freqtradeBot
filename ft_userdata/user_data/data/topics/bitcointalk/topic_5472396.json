I think scalability will be more focus because can only handle limited transaction per second.Everything can be improved in future, with upgrades of Bitcoin Protocol but something you have to know.People must use their Bitcoin inputs, outputs well to secure their privacy. It is their responsibility, not Bitcoin. Their practice decides protection on their privacy and anonymity.Scalability can be voted and protocol can be upgraded but you have to know Bitcoin Cash had bigger block than Bitcoin but people less favorite to use Bitcoin Cash blockchain. They actually prefer Bitcoin blockchain, that is more secure, stronger to be against 51% attacks.https://howmanyconfs.com/With 6 Bitcoin blocks, you will need like 860 Bitcoin Cash blocks that need about 6 days, to have similar security. Do you want to choose BCH?",

I think scalability will be more focus because can only handle limited transaction per second.Scalability is a big issue that is not yet solved since inception. There is definitely lightening network available but it is a side chain. So it cannot be claimed as a part of Bitcoin network. If we want to have global adoption of Bitcoin payment system scalability is something we need to solve sooner than later. I personally believe the best feature of Bitcoin is its privacy. That is why a lot of people use Bitcoin apart from the investor group. But unless scalability issue is resolved the Bitcoin network will struggle to accommodate ever increasing number of transactions.",

Which they are trying to solve and finding a good way to resolve this kind of problem, since Bitcoin is an impressive technology that was invented so it won't be possible to fix this issue. For sure it might take years or decades for Bitcoin to reach it's peak for adoption that a lot of people use it in everyday life. But imagine this Bitcoin survived existed for a long time without having any problems with the system itself. And it would be a good impact to crypto industry once it got a mass adoption.",

I think scalability will be more focus because can only handle limited transaction per second.In my opinion, from the past until now, bitcoin has remained safe, the security of bitcoin lies with those of us who own bitcoin. As long as we are able to protect our wallets from dangerous viruses and no one knows our keys, Bitcoin will always be safe. Bitcoin is a ledger that can verify all transactions so that anonymity can still be traced, but as long as we do not link our wallet with KYC or other identity then our privacy will remain safe. If we want to better protect our privacy, we can use mixers to disguise bitcoin transactions Apart from that, of course Bitcoin will always be upgraded regularly to make it more efficient and easier to use, such as the presence of Segwit and Lightning.",

Bitcoin is not meant for offline transaction and that will not happen but only online transaction. Once bitcoin is made available for offline transaction then the purpose of bitcoin will be defeated because the decentralized nature of bitcoin will be automatically change to centralized. And authorities will be controlling it to their taste. In fact they will eliminate bitcoin from the currency line because bitcoin will have problem with the Fiat currency.Quote from: DapanasFruit on November 01, 2023, 04:45:48 AM Hopefully, the Lightning Network will be playing a significant role in the push of Bitcoin into the mainstream population where anybody can be using his/her Bitcoin to pay for tissue paper or pay someone who polish your shoes.

We want bitcoin to be accepted in the whole world so that things like cost of living will be reduced. Probably inflation will not be as it is again because fiat will not be the default currency for exchange.

And this is because I am sure that it will increase in price, because no other coin is called digital gold. Bitcoin is number one and even if it drops in price compared to other coins, it will still grow in price as a rarity later. It's a pity that Ordinals showed how outdated the bitcoin network is, and how slow it can work. But I'm glad that there are solutions like Lightning.",

If you look round the whole world, you will discovered that BTC is everywhere for people to have access and to let their government know that it is very important for the government to make it legal tender so that they can apply it in their businesses like the way El Salvador and other countries that made it legal tender are using it to improve their economy.I believe many people are waiting for such thing to come for everybody to start using BTC in their various environment to do physical business since is very safe and secure in the process of transaction, and it hard for the buyers and sellers to have issues about their transaction.",

When compared to ethereum, Bitcoin fees are still relatively low.I am sure that as there are more BTC users and transactions on BTC, the scalability will also be upgraded.",
