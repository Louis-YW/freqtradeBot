It might just be a case of someone crafting their transactions manually without realizing the total input value and factoring in the fact that anything that is unspent is considered as fees. At times, mining pools are willing to send the fees back if they're kind enough and the pool's miners are willing to cooperate. Hope that this is the case.",

Is this a joke or what.This is one thing I like about electrum wallet, before it will allows proceed with your payment you received warning about the fee you are using, and if it's too low it will also warn you that your fee is extremely low that you can't be able to bump fee later. But wait a moment, is this a kind of being haste to perform transaction or maybe the owner was drunk? Because I believe there are two things involved.Is either;Feeling drowsyOr the person is drunk.$800,000 gone just like that??",

If it was done in auto mode, it's very strange there was no check for the funds needed for the fees and if they are too big or not.",

Other than the fact that most good wallets have good UX as mentioned above, I also think that you can only do so much to improve UX. If someone ignores a notification or doesn't verify their inputs for whatever reason you can't really help them. I don't track cases like this actively but I'm sure this is the second time I read a case like this in the past year or so. The number is too small to conclude that most wallets need to improve their UX significantly. CMIIW.",
