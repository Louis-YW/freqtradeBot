Do you plan to sell them to people who want to mine? Or sell them for other purpose, like gaming etc?",

Obviously people will buy a GPU from you, as long as it is in good condition (or even in perfect condition, since I assume you will not use them). But, you must of course sell them less than the price you can find in stores or online. The price of hardware will go up if the supply is not enough. The whole China-Taiwan situation has caused a decrease in supply. Please inform yourself through valid websites, since I have the general idea, but I don't want to misguide you.Regarding BitcoinSince you posted in the Bitcoin mining section,  it is true that GPUs are not profitable anymore. In order to make money you have to generate coins using ASIC miners which are specifically designed for this purpose. Therefore, I believe you will not be able to sell them to people who want to mine. Take a look into other coins / chains though, because there may be some other coins, where the difficulty may be much less than Bitcoin's and therefore, GPUs could be profitable. Perhaps I am wrong, but I would look into it.",

But as most altcoins are using PoS already, there might not be increase in the sales of graphics cards.Quote from: Alaks1 on September 25, 2023, 10:02:38 AMWell it doesn't matter in the near future if they go up in price a bit right? whether it will be used for mining or gaming I'm just hoping they will go up in price so i could profit a little Using graphics cards in gaming was not the main reason the price increased to the highest price it was, it was becuase they are used in mining. I can remember when china banned bitcoin and other crypto mining, the price of graphics cards dropped, because graphics cards are used for mining altcoins. If cryptocurrencies are no more requiring graphics cards, the price may not increase as it should be, but fiat will continue to decrease in value which might be an advantage.",

If they're just sitting idle or mining at a lossthey're depreciating while waiting for the next pump or bull.
