  "content": "I have read, heard close discussions, rumours and rumoured misconceptions and misunderstanding about Bitcoin as it relates with Exchanges.As we all are aware, the ussge if centralized exchange defeats the whole idea of Bitcoin and perhaps the reason why it was created by Satoshi Nakamoto which is decentralization and self custody. Regardless of how people speak condescendingly to friends and families about backing off from investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the recent FTX collapse.A bit furious about it summon myself to make this up, that the failure of an exchange can and will never be the failure of Bitcoin.Satoshi Nakamoto who I believed mined the highest number of Bitcoin has not 1% of those Bitcoin holding's on any of those popular exchanges. That should be enough for every or any sensible human out there to mimick and imitate. I consider it pure cowardice to think that if an exchange fails that Bitcoin will fail, not even the level of crypto scams will crash it nor lead it to stunt growth and adoption. Jim Cramer has been such a stupid influencer pushing people to exit investment in crypto and also to panic sell which is wrong as he said that months behind. A dialogue with people who have seen worst in the bear market and exchange collapse will have you disciplined and leaving exchanges for good, buying the dip in the process as it also an opportunity to accumulate more satoshis.Below are something's exchange do;In Reality, Bitcoin is a digital gold and can actually do without exchnages.. they haven't represented Bitcoin from the very beginning, an example is that the first pizza bought with Bitcoin, had no exchange playing any role in that process.If there were no cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin, there wouldn't have been an exchange... Centralized Exchnages rose up after the creation of Bitcoin , are they any different from local banks? Making profits is the sole aim.Since the rise of Centralized Exchnages they have more harm and ruins... From MT. GOX, Quadriss and to thr latest FTX collapse, all they do is put investors in doubt about the continuation of investments in crypto projects, both life savings and retirement plans have been shattered.The bottom line of this all is that the failure of Centralized Exchnages can never be that of Bitcoin which after every bear market has been tested, the cycle continues, gather sats around and be patient for the bull.",

Because ones these investors (mostly new ones) loss there funds it discourages them to continue on the path of cryptocurrency because without the in-depth knowledge of bitcoin they take it as same. Another area is the fact that bitcoin haters always attach any crypto scam or fall to it just to wave people against it, most especially the government sponsored news outlets. You will see news heading of exchange collapse as “so so amount of bitcoin was lost due to so and so exchang collapse. This is only an agenda against bitcoin and I feel people teaching others about bitcoin should severely warned them about storing their funds on these CEXs and that it has no connection with bitcoin",

Bitcoin is not a company managing exchanges and exchanges aren't managing Bitcoin either. They are causally unrelated. That being said, not everything works out according to logic.You know how a GPU can be a bit less common and gaming developers won't optimize their code for it? People will still be less motivated to buy that GPU, even though game devs are at fault. Similarly, if people like exchanges and  exchange fails, they'll feel less motivated to use Bitcoin, even though it's not its fault. I know the analogy isn't perfect, but I think it's okay to make a point. Consequently, the price of Bitcoin without centralized platforms or with failing centralized platforms can still decrease significantly.",

A collapse of any centralized exchange does not relate to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has its market, has its price and volatility. If a centralized exchange has bad fund management for themselves and for users, they are responsible for bank run, collapse anytime.They collapse usually not because of Bitcoin but because of tokens. Tokens are more easily to have dumps like Terra $LUNA, $UST, $FTT token from FTX exchange. Who will be able to dump $BTC from $17,000 to $1,700 in 24 hours? I believe we don't see it with Bitcoin nowadays and in future. With altcoins, we see a lot of dumps by panic sells, liquidations, rug pulls.",

No one can blame Bitcoin for the failure or collapse of the central exchange. This is far from true. Bitcoin is alive even before the emergence of these shit exchanges and after the failure and collapse of many central exchanges, Bitcoin was able to maintain its market value and the confidence of investors in it, because it is indeed digital gold and one of the best safe and reliable currencies over the years. Only ignorant and skeptical people throw these false accusations against Bitcoin due to their lack of knowledge.",

It will get sold, leading to collapse in price plus the uncertainty of investors on the severity of the hack. There's also that false impression that the public—and also the uninformed investors—has built over the years that when an exchange gets hacked, bitcoin may also 'be' hacked, which then causes panic sells that affect the price. You're correct that bitcoin can function without exchanges, but traders and investors cannot really do their thing without exchanges. Bitcoin is only dragged on the issue because it's what's being traded on the exchanges, and it's mainly the target of hacks. Bitcoin doesn't share any of these faults and insecurities of exchanges, but it may seem like it because the price of bitcoin afterwards is what's getting affected unfortunately.",

It's limited to 7 transactions per second, while exchanges can have hundreds of trades per second. Bitcoin market as we know it wouldn't exist without exchanges, and millions of people would never buy Bitcoin without the convenience of centralized exchanges. So the price today would likely be below $1,000 and we would have huge problems with transaction fees if all the trades happened on chain.

To be honest, without these exchanges, the barrier of entry for a person to earn cryptocurrency can be difficult. That is why we can say that exchanges enable the public to at least earn BTC for the various wallets they offer.Unfortunately, with convenience comes running the risk of getting scammed.
