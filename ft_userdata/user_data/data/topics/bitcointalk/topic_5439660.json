Luno is a place for buying and selling cryptocurrency.A wallet and an exchange are different things.Storing assets within an exchange is not a fully good thing.Conduct trading on the exchange and then store it in a wallet.Wallets can take many forms, so you need to find out about crypto wallets, here are some references: https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-walletStoring assets in an exchange opens up the risk of loss, as in the recent case of FTX.",

Having this kind of behaviour means that the probability of you getting scammed the second time is high. Trading is not something you just dive into without proper training if eventually you go into trading blindly in less than no time you'll fold up and be back to square one. So just take your time to learn and during the process you can start applying all that you have learnt and I'm sure you will see positive results.",

But when you click the wallet, it doesn't contain anything beside the various coin and price graph, it doesn't mention if the wallet is secure, open source, non custodial etc.@OP a good wallet is always non custodial where you're the one who have the seed phrase or private key and better to choose open source than closed source in order to make sure your wallet is 100% secure from scam developers. You can use either Electrum or Bluewallet, it's a friendly choice for beginner.",

OP's desperation must have left him with no option than to choose BTC, which is a good take. I think from his motives he wants a starting point to begin his trading journey. Binance would be a good place for OP, as they offer trading tutorials for beginners and he could as well start with small funds. They're nice wallets recommended for him already, but some like electrum seem technical for a newbie like OP. What matters now is for him to try hot Android wallets for now then move on to open source wallet like electrum. But, first, like you said Op needs to cool off and watch how the market works, he sounds hurried, like he wants a quick turn up from his investment. I hope he won't get in the hands of cheater again, if he sticks to the forum he would learn how to do it himself.",

But learning the process is the best way not to inevitably loss on a particular trades. Usually those newbies thinks that it was so easy, but the truth hurts that it more lossing side than gaining. We all knew how risky it is and the golden rule of invest you can afford to lose must be implemented as always.",

This is a bad practice for any crypto adopters in 2023, no doubt,  a bad practice it is. Wallets like Luno and Freewallet are missing users Private keys or recovery seeds, this mean that the team are the one keeping the keys for you, and this means that they have access to your funds, I believe this is not what you want OP.

This market has chances to earn good profits but also invite the number of scammers to find different ways to make you fool as this is whole digital money into your wallets and exchange so it's more prone to risks.But the first thumb rule states that invest once you understand the market and in your case you have been already scammed of your funds and don't have knowledge for it so best is not to invest at this time.But if you want then best is to invest only in bitcoin with the amount you are willing to loose and keep it safe for long term in your wallets.Also learn about bitcoin which will help you to understand a lot about it and how to manage your funds safely.",

Luno looks like an exchange and if you want to make an investment by holding more Bitcoins try to choose a good wallet as suggested by @_act_ in his post instead of keeping it on any exchange because you can't have full control over the wallet that is on any exchange like you manage a wallet that you make yourself personally.
