  "content": "I'm an old bitcoiner and thought my story could help others.I've downloaded Bitcoin in March 2009, as my bank account was frozen for a debt of 200 euros, and when your account is frozen you don't have the ability to have another bank account in France.I've tried to find an alternative way of storing digital value in a P2P manner and found out about Bitcoin to pay for my server. I've mined with my CPU but I cannot found a single block (mining was built-in bitcoin core at this time) so I uninstalled it as the ecosystem was too tiny.In 2011, I came back and saw that an exchange popped, mtgox, and GPU miners, bitcointalk. I was working as a life assistant for an handicaped person and we decided to mine Bitcoin with her computer.We mined 6 bitcoins in 4 months.In 2012, It was worth a few dollars and didn't remember that I haven't saved my wallet, I formatted my computer. Bye bye the 6 bitcoins. I was working as a store merchant employee.Disgusted in 2013 as I saw the price climbing. I bought some bitcoins onto localbitcoins and starts DCAing with my 450 euros monthly paycheck, 20 euros each month.I dived into Ethereum in 2014 and put money at the ICO. In 2016, as the value soared, I've sold most of my 200 hard gained bitcoins and my 2000 ether but decided to work full time on bitcoin. I've bought a 4500 euro boat (450 ether at this time) to have a spot where I can live without paying a rent. And it cost me every single ether and bitcoin earned.Bull market in 2017 was hard, as I spent more coins than I earned. So In 2018, I was back at 0 with a huge mental depression.Since 2020, I work on mining pools as a Lead Engineer, working helped me a lot to focus and forgot depression.And in 2022, I'm more bullish than ever but am still at 0.1 Bitcoins.So I decided to make a solo mining pool with provably output jobs and started developing it in 2020 in Golang and from scratch.Now all my bitcoin life is onto these two projects : - [ANN] ⛏️ Soloblocks.io - 0.4% SOLO Mining Pool with Provable payouts.- [ANN] Lottery mining blocks (BTC and lightning accepted)If you have jobs where I can bring my passion and devotion, my pm are opened.If you want to help and get a reward, you can try mining on my mining pool.If you want to help and get a reward, you can try my lottery.I'm selling the mining pool for 12 bitcoins if you want.I think my level of understanding of bitcoin is atypical.For my twitter handle: send a pm.",

I’ve done this before but not at your level since you are way earlier on Bitcoin investment than mine but I remember that I sold all my 5 Bitcoins when price break 1000$ because I thought that it will go down already until Bitcoin never stop growing until 20K during 2017 which gives me a depression at that time. I become inactive in crypto for so many years until pandemic hits and gave me opportunity to enter again in crypto with the better price. I think you can bounce back too and recover part of your supposed to be gain from your previous holdings. I crashed the shitcoin market with doge. It's the native that carves the value.I just bought it and it went clueless. No lies. Don't buy my old seedbank twice.",

You should not grieve about this and remember the past with sadness, but rather focus on future opportunities.

I have experience recovering a few altcoins before when I accidentally formatted it and even if the drive is overwritten I still manage to recover the wallet.dat file and recovery backup(nothing will be lost if you try).  And honestly, that amount that I sold at very cheap price I just recover them using Recuva and EaseUS and data recovery listed on Hiren's data recovery tools.",

You can try using one of the best open source recovery tools out there, PhotoRec. It's available here: https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRecQuotePhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted. Take your time, read the documentation, and try to recover the wallet file, for free.It should be able to recover Bitcoin wallet files, as discussed here https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1byfy0/photorec_able_to_find_lost_wallets/",

Otherwise, don't bother. Most don't realise that quick formatting of disks doesn't erase any data, only up to a few MB (KB even?) at partition/disk start depending on the format. It just restructures the way the disk reads the data (filesystem).Last I remember when doing recoveries is that disks write chronologically (or at least the formats I was using), so if you previously had 100GB on it, and now only have 10GB on it, there would be 90GB to recover for example. The hope would be the wallet file is towards the end of the disk and therefore not yet overwritten. Just imagine if it was still there after all these years! It could be a filesystem restoration away...Think it was PhotoRec I used before for restoring filesystem as nullama mentioned, but otherwise it was EaseUS for hard data recovery (and filename recovery) when recovering a partition failed. One of them I remember listed previous filesystems formats I could access (as some create their own backups), so it was like flicking a switch to restore data. No hard data recovery even required...",
