Not all Bitcoin mining companies or farms have profit from mining. To have profit, they must have good plans for their income and outcome. Most of miners and mining farms start in bear markets but they fail to stay in bear market. In fact bear markets are best times for miners to mine Bitcoin and get more mining rewards (in BTC) than in bull market. Their income in BTC is bigger but its value in USD can be smaller.So to survive in bear market, they must have good financial budget to use. If they join in bull market and smartly cashed out as well as reserved some of profit for bearish months, I am sure they are smart and profitable miners.For beginners, they don't understand it and mostly don't have plans for bear market. It's generally so risky for beginners to join Bitcoin mining.QuoteFor example; bitcoin merch, as they sell it for beginners and look friendly; just plug in a USB to a PC then the beginner can be mining the profit. Nowadays, who can mine Bitcoin with PC or USB?If you use PC or laptop to mine Bitcoin now, it is stupid and can burn your PC or laptop.",

But yes, I believe it is best for hobbyists who enjoy tinkering and experimentation. Just be aware that, for the most part, the device can be very unreliable as you'll gain an extremely small reward in the long run.Now if you are newbie, learning how to mine using this would only scratch the surface, you'll still need to learn how to choose your mining rigs, knowing the electricity consumption, hash rate, mining difficulty, and the mining pool -- which all of them are pretty extensive process.",

Including, safety guides if anything were to go wrong with the internals or even exposing it to the elements. A lot of this stuff is ignored because it's generally common sense, but I believe it's a law that they have to provide it. Teaching them how to take great photos, or make the most out of their computers doesn't happen though. So, the mining equipment should come with a basic how to guide, and a safety sheet, but not exactly teach them in the ins, and outs of mining.",

First of all what we see over internet and social media is not always right and most of these lucrative offers are just another way to attract people but when you get into the depth you come to know about the true picture.The mining profits is made by the pools who have huge mining farms and get rewards of 6.25BTC which is not possible with these small tools.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on January 19, 2023, 12:37:01 AMFor example; bitcoin merch, as they sell it for beginners and look friendly; just plug in a USB to a PC then the beginner can be mining the profit. Do you think it's this easy to earn profits with bitcoin mining when the prices are trading at $20k so you would be having easy gains with these machines? You can be part of mining community with it but making profits is entirely different case.You need to differentiate between the both.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on January 19, 2023, 12:37:01 AMis the company know what the risk is if they sell it to anyone especially a newbie who doesn't know anything about mining?They are into the business of selling these machines and for them when you are spending money on it you have the knowledge and need to use it so we can't blame them.As @Welsh said above they can provide you with manuals guiding you how to operate the machine and set it up but you are expecting too much from them.The risk associated with mining has nothing to do with them as you buy any tech from market without analysing what's the use and risk associated with it we can't blame the manufacturer and for them you are customer not any newbie so you should be responsible for knowing all the details before hand.See there are lot of factors which you need to consider before jumping into mining or say will determine your profitability like :1) The cost of electricity in your country as you need to have the machine constantly running so high cost will reduce the profits and vice versa2) The initial investment and time to recover the cost because the actual profits will be after you have recovered the initial cost3) The maintenance of the system also includes in cost of mining as due to heating some parts may get damaged and needs replacement or maintenanceThere are many other factors but if you believe you can start making profits with spending less amount and early then you have no knowledge of the current mining conditions so have your research about it first of all and then see how it actually works.",

The cost of of electricity is what makes Bitcoin mining risky because you can suffer a serious losses if you didn’t compute your profit on mining versus the electricity expenses in the long run.Bitcoin difficulty is increasing in the long run while competitors to solve a block is increasing too.

They just want to get their product sold. Customers need to do their own research before they buy, even if they don't plan on buying a mining rig. You should explain to them why it is not a good idea then.
