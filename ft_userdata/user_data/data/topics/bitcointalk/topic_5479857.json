So, As you think, How can we bridge the gap between mainstream adoption and the complexities of blockchain technology? Share your thoughts on making crypto more accessible to the general publicI couldn't agree more with you that there is still a big gap between the intricacy of blockchain technology and its widespread usage. I think Making the blockchain technology more user-friendly so that humans can interact with it more easily could be one possible approach. Another is spreading awareness of the advantages of blockchain technology, including its decentralization, security, and transparency. Lastly, I believe it's critical to support the creation of practical blockchain applications, like supply chain tracking, identity management, and other use cases.",

So, As you think, How can we bridge the gap between mainstream adoption and the complexities of blockchain technology? Share your thoughts on making crypto more accessible to the general publicOne of the major reasons for Bitcoin adoption by the mass is it's own complexity. Bitcoin usage is not really very easy for non technical users. The users need to understand couple of things before they can really start using Bitcoin. Also structured financial industry like banks have been spreading false information about Bitcoin to their customer base. I have personally received multiple mailers from my banks about Bitcoin and how big scam it is. Such emails sure do have some negative impacts. Right now the biggest road block for Bitcoin's adoption is its transaction fees. Unless and until this issue is resolved, it's very difficult to convince someone to use Bitcoin. This needs to be solved on highest priority.",

Share your thoughts on making crypto more accessible to the general publicWell its not like werent gonna be there but the adoption really takes time especially that its bound by restriction of the law. How is that? Some countries dont want to be associated with crypto and thats like a boundary betwern adoption of crypto. People inside this area are doing it but with certain rules they cant maximize it or spread it around it. So as long as there is a line between it might be hard to fully implement a full crypto adoption.",

Share your thoughts on making crypto more accessible to the general publicJust make the world or your country a more internet friendly place for all and make it a priority for all citizens in the country to learn about the bitcoin technology. In no time, you’ll see many adopters of the currency as they will want to make good use of their internet knowledge to earn themselves a means of livelihood which they can get through bitcoin investment. It is very essential to also make it user friendly, from the UI/UX interface of it while interacting with people.",

If a new person has to use Bitcoin for its core uses like P2P transfer without involvement of third party.But now how would you explain newbie about the transfer fee which is higher than the actual amount itself if you wanna send lesser amount? Also there should be educational campaigns and seminars but who is going to take the initiative? I feel we cannot ask people to adopt Bitcoin as a decentralised P2P transfer medium due to the complexity which occur during every bull run when it comes to transfer. Transaction related issues should be sorted only then people will even think about Bitcoin else why would they leave the traditional transfer method and use Bitcoin?",

Yes, we can spread things or ideas about bitcoin, but we can't guarantee that everyone who listens to or reads about it will be interested in it and will spend time and effort to know about it. This is a common problem with other people. When they have an idea or knowledge about bitcoin or crypto currency, they will be held back because they heard about the complexity of this field, and the investment is long-term, so they will be wary about what will happen to their investments or if their investments will have a profit or not. But we can still do our part as spreaders of this wonderful technology, but we can't ever hope that all the listeners or readers will have the interest to adopt or learn about this bitcoin or crypto currency stuff. Anyway,  in fact, there are more establishments or businesses that are slowly adopting bitcoin or the payment mode through crypto currency.",
