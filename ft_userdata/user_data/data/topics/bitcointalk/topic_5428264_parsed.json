  "content": "I'm wondering if anyone has tried putting miners in front of the beer making process.  I live in Vermont with tons of breweries.  I'd love to find one these breweries that would be interested in trying to use miners to reduce the cost of brewing beer.  There has been a news story going around about Dutch flower farmers heating green houses.  I'm wondering if miners could assist in the mashing of grain and the boiling of wort.  Some sort of submerged miners heating oil and then pumping that oil by a heat transfer to heat water.  I understand a miner can not get a mash or wort fully up to temperature but miners could assist in a sort of pre heating of the water/wortwould make for interesting marketing at least.  BitBeer or maybe a nice Satoshi IPA",

      "body": "Although it's a neat idea, using miners to heat anything is going to be an issue. Using them as space heaters / additional heat for things is fine. But now using the beer as an example you are going to need networking and expensive miners and an air to something radiator and so on. Or you can keep using the same gas / electric setups that beer makers have been using far a while.Getting things like that up to an industrial scale is hard. Playing around as a hobby is also hard, but if it does not work it's not going to matter. Except for the fact of no beer. That would matter.-Dave",

His idea totally has nothing to do with cloud miningSpeaking of Bitbeer, have you ever imagined having mining making losses as it is right now. No beer making company would love to make losses in bear markets while trying to heat their beer. That is double expenditure",

But they say that it can hurt their pump and plate that touch directly to CPU like metal or copper. So i think is a bad idea",

This is a little bit more expensive, but can be done by an experienced person.",
