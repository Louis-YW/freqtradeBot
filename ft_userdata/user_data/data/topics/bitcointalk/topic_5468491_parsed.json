      "body": "First of all I don't understand why you opened a self-moderated topic when you're only sharing information. From what I gathered and understood from the video you shared is that guy got scammed using the Coinomi wallet after trying to move his assets, the team behind coinomi’s wallet response to what happened seems quite nonsensical and seems like that either they are completely unaware about how their wallet works which is a bad thing and tells us they used a third party to create it or they only wanted to deceive the public which they think they are so stupid to believe what they saying in case the victim tried to speak about his rights (which he did).Moreover, I don't believe there's a hacker involved in this story, for me it seems more likely that the wallet team itself was responsible and stole the assets with that method, because their explanation was nonsense. So I can say that’s not their only victim and might me just another victim.",
