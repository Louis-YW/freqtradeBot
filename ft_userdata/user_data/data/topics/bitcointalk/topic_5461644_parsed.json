You'd have to move the thread to altcoin discussion. Should be more appropriate given that it's about DEX.For DEX, I recommend popular ones like Uniswap since their code has been fully audited (this doesn't mean it's hack-proof btw). CEX is not recommended except you need quick on/off ramps fiat services which most CEX offer out of the box. For DEX recommendations, Popular ones like Uniswap, 1inch, etc should do just fine.",

Meaning users funds won’t be confiscated by the exchange whenever an unusual activity is detected.If you’re the type that takes privacy and security seriously then you probably would go with Dex, I would love to believe that the main reason why a lot of people still use cex is because of the features that they offer and still pretty much easy to navigate which usually draws the attention of newbies.In all Dex has more security and privacy than Cex.If you wish to learn more then check out this link",

First let's ask yourselves why you did not search?Because with searching, you will get enough answers for the basic questions and won't have to ask them here. You can ask after doing your due diligent research and got some ideas. You can describe what you understood, what you did not and what you are confusing. Your topic is purely questioning without any signal that you already did your research.CEXs usually have higher trading volume than DEXs but not all CEXs have higher trading volume than DEXs.",

You have always been able to trade Bitcoin using a DEX... Uniswap and all them altcoin-swapping platforms don't lay claim to being the first DEXes around, you know. They may have popularised liquidity pool style AMMs but certainly weren't the first, nor the only ones.They're not even half as decentralised as p2p exchanges like Bisq. Non-custodial is probably the only aspect most DEXes can claim accurately.",

Dex is the best,as it gives you high level of privacy. Unlike Cex that is not private and needs KYC for you to use it. Cex only have am advantage for traders because they have so many cryptocurrency and you can convert it to your local currency,and I think that these are the main reasons why people are using Cex. Cex has so many disadvantages like,users can be tracked by the government, it relies on third party for transactions and the they can easily sell out your information to whoever pays for it. We have some good Dex like bisq and Agora Desk,you can try it out. Big Cex has more liquidity than Dex because some small Cex depends on the big ones by keeping their funds with the big ones.",

It has less fee as compared to the slippage on DEX and also the chance of the transaction getting failed. On the Ethereum layer, one transaction of this type can cost 40-50 bucks. If I want to pay somewhere using Crypto, that also I can do with Binance and most of the companies have started using Binance Pay, which allows instant payments on Crypto Network without paying any fee.DEX can be used for trades on-chain and when you want to invest in a project which isn't listed on CEX as of now.",

Without more info from you, i can't just tell you that dex has more reputation and security because there are many dex that use smart contracts and are a product of DeFi, and many of them aren't truly decentralized nor exactly safe, but since you posted this in the BTC discussion board, i believe you are looking for p2p exchanges for trading BTC.You have options for truly decentralized p2p exchanges like Bisq, AgoraDesk, RoboSats and others, in terms of security, they are more secure because there isn't really a single point of failure and customers control their funds and trade p2p, but most people use cex because it has more liquidity, even though it is less secure and private than a true p2p exchange like Bisq for example.",

Both are trying to build their liquidity but CEX has it here, the CEX's liquidity is far more, and it can't be compared to that of DEX. The reason is the businesses and convenience that CEX builds around its networks which attract more participants. Also, the users of DEX rely solely on the liquidity provided by the users, but CEX could create additional liquidity through strong external financial sources for profits.",

At one point, I lost all the coins I have as someone got hold to my private key somehow. If those coins were on a CEX, it would have been difficult for any hacker to steal as it would have multiple degrees of security. Though there are some cases of Exchanges going scam, there are good options that are more transparent and secure at the moment. I'd keep my coins on CEX and make my trades on them anytime.",

It’s just that there’s pretty much no way to create a CEX that’s non-custodial, provides liquidity, so many trading pairs, the quickness of a CEX, customer support etc all while still being non-custodial. It’s either they go the tough route and provide less advantages than a CEX and simultaneously their profit drops too, or they just follow the typical business model and offer users the best user experience but you’re not in control as much anymore.",
