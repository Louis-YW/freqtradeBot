(demand stops)however there is another number the \"underlying value\" support. this is the baseline no one wants to sell below. its the lowest cost on the planet to acquire bitcoin. and when it reaches this point no one wants to sellas energy prices increase even at the most efficient mining farms on the planet. this helps increase the underlying value support line(below market rate) which supports the market from going below that amount",

      "body": "The impact of bitcoin mining can INCREASE the cost of generating electricity if it consumes an appreciable portion of the electricity generated. Today the situation looks like this: ~27 thousand TWh of electricity is generated in the world, the share consumed by Bitcoin mining is 0.43%. Total energy production in the world reaches 168 thousand TWh, Bitcoin's share is 0.15%.We cannot say that this is at the \"error level\", but mining does not have a significant impact on global generation at the moment. It can be assumed that with increasing complexity, consumption will increase, but in my opinion, the impact can be seen if mining will consume somewhere between 5 and 10% of the world's electricity.",

      "body": "Your analysis makes sense regarding the relationship between Bitcoin mining and electricity prices. However, several things must be taken into consideration to reach more realistic conclusions:First, electricity prices are linked to the cost of production, which changes depending on the energy source. This means that the energy produced by solar panel farms is different in cost and price from the energy produced by nuclear reactors. Electrical energy producers cannot work in isolation from these mechanisms, which in turn are the responsibility of other companies that undertake interconnection and distribution operations.Secondly, most of these companies are fully owned by the state, or the state shares ownership in them. Of course, these countries will not allow the transition from investment in consumer electricity to the mining sector, which is capable of consuming huge resources, and they in turn play the role of adjusting prices to be in line with the purchasing power of the beneficiaries.",

Bitcoin still more stable and enjoyable than the electricity according to my research despite that government use to promote energy supply in different countries of the world, but Bitcoin is dominating all over the world without the help of the government, and investors are investing in Bitcoin more than the electricity because Bitcoin is trusted and reliable for long term investments and short term investment. Government has the authority over the electricity which they can decide where to supply energy in the environment to enjoy their taxes and where not to supply not to enjoy the energy supply which is not like that in Bitcoin, as long you have the knowledge of Bitcoin and you know when to buy and when to sell your Bitcoin, you will definitely enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin.  Anything can happen to electricity that will make people living in that particular country not to experience light through out the months until government release money to fix it before they can continue enjoying their service.",

BTC adoption right now is already a widespread and there is only a few percent left for it to be completed to 100 percent.

So the power company will not only have to increase their power generation to have extra available power, god knows why but also to buy gear and to maintain it and to have to deal with the fact that no matter how much they try they will never be able to beat the 2.5 cents per kwh Riot and Mara are mining at.There won't be any worldwide currency as long as half of the hashrate is in one country and the majority of the rest in another 3 or 4.",

China took the \"drastic\" action at the time of effectively banning all miners because of the impact that power redirection was having on electricity prices across their country, which had a bit of a domino effect and there were even rumbling in places like the European Parliament that the same action should be taken there. The general public hold the ultimate power if things really get too bad and will force the governments to take action if electricity prices get extortionate again, but crypto is a very easy target for politicians in that scenario so it could happen again.",

Lately the solar panel world is getting cheaper and more durable, that is of course technology getting better. So for mining, you have to spend a lot less on solar panels and you will end up with a result that should be all that better.I understand that it may not be the fixed rate that you get from the companies, it's a different method, but if you are doing something like a crypto mining company, you should be able to spend some on solar panels as well. It would make it self sufficient as well, it will definitely cause you to get a lot better one way or another. I believe that we could have some situations that will be profitable for the miners, so they should try their very best and could probably end up with a result that should give them a good return on their investment.",
