I would quit my job and do whatever I like. (of course that's if you don't like your job)For example:Let's say you are making $3k from your job and making another $3k from your passive income. If you don't like your job you can quit it and do something you like. Maybe you will make less but you will have more fun.What is life without fun? Why do we live? To live a fun and happy life. If you are not happy with what you are doing, you should quit that stuff and do what you like.Heck you can do nothing and spend your passive income too, that's called retirement.",

If passion doesn't make you money, I believe you will hate it too. As long as it can make money and help feed my family, I won't hate it.Congratulations on creating the passive income you've been dreaming of, but there's no guarantee it'll outlast your current job. And I think having multiple sources of income is better than having only one. Many people dream of having multiple sources of income while you want to give it up.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, there isn't a straightforward answer to your question; it depends on a variety of parameters, such as your current living costs, country of residence, and so on. First and foremost, are you getting insurance benefits and stamps (for a pension) from your current occupation? If yes, that's another parameter you'll have to take into account. Moreover, how stable is your passive income and from where does it derive? If it's coming from real estate, such as renting properties, chances are that you'll be able to have a passive income for your entire lifetime. Bear in mind that your current way of making money may not be viable in the next 20–30 years. I could be completely wrong, but you haven't specified what exactly you do. Although you mention that you truly despise working at your current job, I'd quit, take a small break from working, and start looking for something that is at least part-time in order to have an extra source of income and the working benefits I mentioned earlier.",

My advice is that if your hobby that you do to gain more passive interest than your salary job is reliable and will not end, you can leave the job. But nowadays, having multiple sources of income is best because you can't rely solely on one. If the two works provide you with the best financial support you require without overburdening your mental health, you should stick with them both.",

But if that job is too stressful or you have to give up one of them, then you should quit and focus on the passion generating passive income for you. Depending on your current situation, you will make a decision. We're not in your position, so we don't know what you're going through, so we can't give you the best advice.",

There’s nothing wrong to quit your job if you’re not happy on it and your profit on your other side hustle is greater and sustainable than your current job. The only good thing about jobs was you can get promoted in the long run plus the company benefits that pays your insurance, health card and other personal things which you can’t get on others.Sustainability is the most important here as deciding factor to your question. Try to weigh in your 4 years of experience to your current profit.",

If you have a family, whatever you do, whether you have to or not, the fact is that you can't deny that there are people for us to provide for. Even if your passive income is basically more than your base salary, that doesn't mean you're giving up something that has added value. However, depending on your intentions, if you find it difficult and burdensome, maybe there are other people out there who want your current job position. In fact, their income is below yours.

In my opinion, that would be the most reasonable solution, far better than quitting your job and relying on that other source of income that you didn't specify, but if that other source is in signature campaigns, then don't even think about quitting your job.No matter how you look at it, two sources of income are always better than one, and it's unlikely that you'll run out of both at the same time.",
