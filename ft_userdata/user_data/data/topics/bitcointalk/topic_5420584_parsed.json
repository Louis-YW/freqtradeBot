Because I believe this is an inside job and they want to make profit(almost all companies want to profit).And honestly, they already made a profit by just creating their tokens and selling them. And look why they didn't hire a professional security expert. How defenseless their website is? If they hire security experts, then it's impossible if they monitor their business 24/7, it won't happen unless if there is someone inside of the company wants to do it for the sake of profit.",

The future is bleak and some people have put in life changing amounts hence it's too much to ask them to calm down. It's a sad day and they can be sad/mad/whatever about it.

That’s not gonna happen because that’s not how it works for the owners and victims. Welcome to the 21st century, the era of digital scams and at the same time digital layer masking to your scams. It’s not going to be simple task to dig exactly what happened. A law suit might get opened up, dates on dates will be passed on, owners will try to defend and try to save themselves from giving back the money and circle of cases will keep running all the time. I barely see a chance here. And as mentioned by others, you reading it right, this already happened with well known companies and yet justice is unattended.",

But will this solve your problem with getting your deposit back? I strongly doubt it. Now you can’t influence anything in any way and you can only observe the ongoing changes from FTX. Your expectations that the authorities or someone will fix everything in your favor (return of money) seems to me too naive. This is not the first and not the last exchange to crash, and as it has already happened, not all users of such exchanges have received compensation. These people will figure it out for you, but not in your favor. I'm not trying to intimidate you, but I'm trying to dispel your rosy illusions that Uncle Sam will make everything beautiful for you.",

FTX was their greatest competition and they were taking clients from them so helping FTX was never in the plans of CZ (Binance CEO). Also it won't have been a wise business decision for Binance exchange to save the day as it would be very hard to build up the trust of users to continue making use of FTX exchange. They lost the trust of their loyal customers and investors that would just move on to other exchanges.As FTX is no longer in the picture, that means Binance exchange have all the time to win back the customers of FTX that's why they have introduced Proof of Reserved and that's just to trick customers into thinking their exchange is safe for storing of coins but no exchange can be trusted.",

I don't think that was possible to do. Like you said the customers can only be wishing for a solution to refund otherwise they are as good as losing what they have there. This is one of the negative effect of having coins in exchange. It is an example for the wise to act appropriately and secure what they have from exchange.",

Please avoid any interactions with the website and uninstall all related apps.

But I should tell you don't keep such a thinking, obviously in this scenario whatever happened cannot be changed but this can be taken as a lesson for the future, as to how you can be intelligent and clever in advance, make sure to keep just a small proportion of your fortune on Exchanges and not become the victim of such scams.",

Of course, you can invest in FTT, since now this coin is traded at a minimum price, but the risk of losing your money is very high. It is much easier to invest in top-end coins, which are also currently trading at a minimum price and which have the prospect of increasing the value.",
