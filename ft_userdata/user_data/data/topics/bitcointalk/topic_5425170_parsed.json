All miner code written by ourselves. 2.   Fast automatic frequency tuning technology saves 50% of boot time.3.   Unique custom control board design compatible with stock hardware.Overclocking and underclocking performance improvements.1.   [ Underclocking ] S19 25.88J@56TH, S19 Pro 25.5J@88T!2.   S19J Pro 104T overclocking to 30.6J@136T 3.   S19 XP 133T Overclocking to 22.5J@163TMultiple Deployment Solutions.1.   Use Kingdra Control Board replace the stock control board.2.   Use Kingdra SD Card version.3.   For some models of stock control boards, it is possible to use SD card or USB to replace the bitmain firmware.Fully Custom Control boardWe're not just a software team, we do hardware design as well. And we operate a world-class FPGA mining farm.  Kingdra CB's custom design fixes many problems of the stock control board, such as Hashboard IIC bus signal interference, noisy power IIC bus signal. And the Kingdra control board has added independent auxiliary power supply control of the hashboard, independent IIC bus for each hashboard, additional power control IIC interface, and support for up to 4 hashboards.  We are proud to say that we did not use any code from cgminer and other open-source miners, we completely rewrote the whole miner in golang.We also have an original sentry mode, the sentry mode's refined management function will be adjusted in real time according to the environment of the mining machine, so that the mining machine is always in the best condition!If you need customized services or want to contact us, please send an email to contact@kingdra.com-- Get notifications from: --Website:https://kingdra.com/ Telegram:https://t.me/KingdraMining Twitter:https://twitter.com/KingdraMiningDiscord:https://discord.com/invite/bCVATRaTM9",

      "body": "A breakthrough in Miner Tuning Firmware – We release the Kingdra v1.5.0.109 with a significant boost in stability and efficiency today.1. 95% less hashrate loss through our cutting-edge thermal managing and power control system. Unexpected uptime losses have been reduced by 50% compared to previous versions.2. World's first tuning technology to maintain about a similar level of efficiency (J/Th) even at 4kw+ power (~30J/TH for S19j Pro).3. Within 3 minutes, our ultra-fast frequency tuning technology can find the optimized frequency for the stable mining mode.4. Up to 99.7%+ ASIC potential released from the ASICs to mining, minimize hash rate waste, the first in the industry to achieve similar results.",

      "body": "lol - you should fire whoever came up with the picture above.That's a concorde - they've all be taken out of action, never to fly again, due to the one that caught fire during take off and killed everyone in it.Though overclocking miners that much is probably just as likely to catch fire",
