  "content": "Below is a link to a spreadsheet I've been working on in my free time.  The goal is to compress the volatile fiat price of bitcoin, using objective calculations based on BTC trading history, into a range of value that can be agreed upon to use as the actual price of transactions.  In this spreadsheet the 'contract' price changes quarterly and, idealy, varies no more than 10% from quarter to quarter, and is also always priced higher than the market value of BTC.I feel my methods are very mechanical and rudimentary and would really like to hear other peoples ideas on getting these results with a simple formula.https://drive.proton.me/urls/1FJXBE6FRG#AsII0mF3ehjn",
