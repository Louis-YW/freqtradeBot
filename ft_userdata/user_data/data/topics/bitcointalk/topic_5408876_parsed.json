It seems other local banks are open in accepting deposits from these exchanges so they can still move their funds there.",

But don't worry with that since for sure bitcoin users in that country will find many ways to exchange there bitcoin since there are so many choices available online and they can still exchange BTC to USD so there's no big deal on what banks decisions done with it.",

I was under the assumption that Purtugal was trying to be rather crypto-friendly.An example would be that Bitcoin-based apartment sale earlier this year.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 06, 2022, 10:44:56 PMQuoteAn apartment in Braga, Portugal was directly sold for bitcoin for the first time in the country, without needing a conversion into euros.Source: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/first-ever-direct-house-sale-for-bitcoin-in-portugalThis is what we need for the Bitcoin adoption as a currency, we don't need to fucking care with the value in fiat. If we always need to convert Bitcoin's price to fiat when we need to pay something, fiat wouldn't ever get replaced by Bitcoin. 1 BTC = 1 BTCAnd tax-free cryptocurrency earnings.Quote from: https://govisafree.com/crypto-portugal/Did you know that cryptocurrency is tax-free in Portugal? The country has announced several incentives over the years and today cryptocurrency traders and miners enjoy Portugal’s crypto-friendly environment. Earnings from crypto are exempt from VAT in the country and there’s little legal and regulatory burden on cryptocurrency businesses.That was apparently last updated less than 2 weeks ago.",

Bitcoin in portugal could be yet another case of the unbanked demographic adopting crypto as a digital payment option. Due to banks refusing to lower their standards enough to become viable to the lowest entry level customers.Bank based crypto bans mainly target whales and larger investors. They ban will be ineffective on them, as whales travel enough to get around it. This doesn't achieve much aside from limiting portugal's financial options and economic growth.

This is about banks closing the accounts of crypto exchanges on the ground that crypto could be used for money laundering. But I see incoherence here. First, these exchanges are legally operating and approved by no less than the central bank and the regulating authorities, which means that they are all AML-compliant. So why are these banks making decisions that are in effect a contestation against the approval and the issuance of license from the central bank and the country's regulating bodies themselves?Second, the decision is basically grounded on fear, potential, or possibility. But does fiat money not have the same potential? Is fiat money not being laundered every minute of the day? Have they not checked the figures which says up to trillions in USD are actually laundered every year? That's larger than the entire Bitcoin or even crypto market cap. So why are they not imposing the same decision on fiat if it's this fear that they're taking into consideration?",

The European Union wants to impose KYC for all transactions, of any amount, something for which a draft bill has already been approved, a law is underway, and at least some ATMs are starting to implement. I don't see much future for crypto-friendly countries within the European Union. They are going to want Bitcoin to be as controlled as stock trades and/or bank transfers.",

It's good there is no restriction currently on the customer level, but it's a bad omen for this to happen out of the blue. There must be some government level pressure and this could be a signal of further banning in future. Let's hope all existing customer crypto is safe.",

If it's KYC that's enforced by some law, then why can't an exchange require KYC and easily open an account? Or would that lead to such a significant shrinking of customers that it's not worth it?I'm sorry that the companies will seek other countries to open accounts, as that means money flowing out of the Portugese economy.
