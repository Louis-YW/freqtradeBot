  "content": "Hello everyone! It was launched new crypto bot in telegram. It monitors round-the-clock BTC wallets of whales / people with insider information. When majority of them buy / sell BTC at the same time, bot notices users. These pumps / collapses are short and usually the price after 20-30 minutes returns, but main feature here is that these pumps / collapses are guaranteed, so to earn here, you should trade with leverages 10x-20x. This project in the beginning was only for developers. But after some time we decided to share this project with others and created telegram bot. You can read more in the bot itself.So, the bot: https://t.me/predictor_project_bot",

Do not try to scam the subscribers, there is nothing guaranteed, just as the whales and before they made a onchain TX output, they may have made a buy order a while ago or it was bought using OTC market and thus with a good discount.There are also services available such as on Twitter and others, so what is distinguished in your service.",

      "body": "How would the bot know if a whale will use their wallet to make the purchase or sell any coins? They could use centralized exchanges for their operations, how would the bot track that? Besides, leverage trading has too much risk, especially if someone is following the instructions of a bot when taking a position which is like risking your money deliberately.It is better if someone just watches the charts after learning to do basic analysis and make predictions themselves, market news and events help in that too. This can greatly reduce the risk of taking wrong positions at the wrong time.",

The only way to get some kind of profit is knowing the scammers personally and knowing which coin will be used in the scheme. Sometimes they have VIP groups or whatever they call them nowadays, trying to make you look important while they take your money. Perhaps, just perhaps, you might get a small profit if you manage to set up a sell order together with your buy order to sell as soon as the price hits 10% or 20% above the value you bough at.",

You can read more in the bot itself.So, the bot: https://t.me/predictor_project_botI don't believe in these prediction bots as none of the bot and humans can predict the pump and dump of bitcoin or any other altcoin. Also when the boy will see an unusual buying or selling of any coin, the pump and dump are already done and the bot just notifies you of what happened in the recent past.I know there can be many wrong intentions associated with the bot.Â  Are you selling this bot for a price?Even if it is free, I would caution everyone not to try and risk their crypto.",

Profit (for the scammer, only ).Additionally, Those shitcoins exist only on some nameless platforms like latoken.I remember I used to buy a bunch of shitcoins after missing the Doge pump. Some of them were a million tokens for $1. I forgot how many of them were named Inu or something like that. I saw the $20 buy/sell pump/dump price by a couple of percentages (4-5%). Imagine I bought a $100 coin that pumped 50% in price. When I place a sell order, it doesn't let me sell them all. You must sell them for under $50 or maybe less than that. Even if they claim that they will give the signal for Good, Established coins (Not stable) like BTC, ETH or BNB, I still suggest not believing them. No one can give you a guarantee about the market movement. We all can predict what they predict. Do your research. Those platforms/bots won't regret your loss.",

Trusting a platform like this is just a stupid act that will harm us. Such opaque bot signals only give false hope to ordinary users, leading them to coins that are actually not good to buy. Potential coins like BTC ETH will not give you profit if the signals you get from prediction bots are not clear. A type of scam targeting ordinary users to get attracted. A bot platform like this will only drain users' money, especially if implementing a premium bot, it's better to do your own research and learn so that you have more insights about trading independently.",

Moreover, suddenly the bot becomes premium and promises to provide many benefits from the predictions that the bot makes. Usually they will continue to send good testimonials so that victims who are beginners in trading will be even more interested. Maybe they only need to pay $ 50- $ 100 and promised thousands of dollars in profits.",
