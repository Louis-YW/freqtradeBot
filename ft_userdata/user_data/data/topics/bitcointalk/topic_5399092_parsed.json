Why? Because the evil in Nazism is really its weakness.Russia was tainted by another form of evil, but has since stepped out of much of that evil (of course, on the outside of things). But the one thing that Russia is still doing is fighting Nazism, Nazism which the US has incorporated into its money-making schemes for ruling the world.Nazism is weak, no matter how many people it has. It will fail, and fall before Russia. Let's hope it doesn't take the US with it in its fall.",

Where else in the world has the US secretly been doing all kinds of biological research that can be used in war?One way to make things happen that you want to happen, is to say them out loud so your opponents realize that they are happening (even if they aren't happening, yet). Another way is to write them in stone. Check out 'The mysterious Georgia Guidestones and the Globalist plan to reduce humanity to half a billion' - http://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/325663-2022-05-17-the-mysterious-georgia-guidestones-and-the-globalist-plan-to-reduce.htm. Some major leaders in the US government are using government to prepare biological warfare in other countries of the world, to reduce the population of the world for their own purposes... no matter how much this hurts average people like you and me.Briefing: Analysis of Documents Related to the Military Biological Activities of The United StatesQuote from: https://www.lewrockwell.com/2022/05/no_author/briefing-analysis-of-documents-related-to-the-military-biological-activities-of-the-united-states-on-the-territory-of-ukraine-may-11-2022/Briefing on the results of the analysis of documents related to the military biological activities of the United States on the territory of Ukraine1. Summary from the Russian Mod telegram channelIdeologues of US military-biological activities in Ukraine are the leaders of the Democratic Party.??Thus, through the US executive branch, a legislative framework for funding military biomedical research directly from the federal budget was formed. Funds were raised under state guarantees from NGOs controlled by the Democratic Party leadership, including the investment funds of the Clintons, Rockefellers, Soros and Biden.??The scheme involves major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Moderna, Merck and the US military-affiliated company Gilead. U.S. experts are working to test new medicines that circumvent international safety standards. As a result, Western companies are seriously reducing the cost of research programmes and gaining a significant competitive advantage.??The involvement of controlled nongovernmental and biotechnological organisations, and the increase in their revenues, allows the leaders of the Democratic Party to generate additional campaign finance and hide its distribution....",

That's actually your considered opinion, based on the evidence?Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_UkraineDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities and armed forces were accused of committing war crimes by carrying out both deliberate attacks against civilian targets and indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas. The Russian military allegedly exposed the civilian population to unnecessary and disproportionate harm by using cluster munitions – a type of weapon that is prohibited by 110 states because of its immediate and long-term danger to civilians – and by firing other explosive weapons with wide-area effects such as air-dropped bombs, missiles, heavy artillery shells and multiple launch rockets. The result of the Russian forces' attacks was damage or destruction of civilian buildings including houses, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, nuclear power plants, historic buildings, and churches. According to international law experts, evidence points to Russia deliberately targeting Ukrainian hospitals across the country.As of 28 April, the attacks had resulted in the death of at least 2,829 civilians and the wounding of at least 3,180.After Russian withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv, according to The Guardian, there was a \"mounting body of evidence\" of rape, torture and summary killings by Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians. There were allegations of forced deportations of thousands of civilians from Russian-occupied Mariupol to Russia, including children, systematic and massive sexual violence and deliberate killing of Ukrainian civilians by members of the Russian forces. At the end of March, Ukrainian forces recaptured the town of Bucha, located north of Kyiv. Afterwards, evidence emerged of a massacre perpetrated by Russian troops, including torture and the deliberate killings of civilians. According to Kyiv police, more than 900 bodies of civilians were found in the Kyiv region after Russian forces withdrew, most of them summarily executed, and the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine documented the unlawful killing of 50 civilians – mostly men, but also women and children – in Bucha. In the first month of the invasion the Monitoring Mission also documented the arbitrary detention in Russian-occupied territories of journalists, activists, public officials and civil servants.You could also look here: https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/03/ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-russia-controlled-areasYou think the good guys are the ones doing the rape, torture, and murder of civilians, not to mention thousands of forced deportations... whilst the other side are behaving like the Nazis in WW2?I have absolutely no idea what your crazy comeback to this will be.

No Ukrainians have died or been mistreated, it's all been faked? It wasn't the Russians, Bill Gates did it?What, really!?The US has been killing civilians all over the world for a hundred years or more... many of them right in the USA itself. Consider all the people the drug war has killed, and broken families, with kids being sent away from their homes. And all that without anybody hurting or harming anybody else.So, now we have Russia performing a police action, just like many the United States has done worldwide, and Russia is suddenly the bad guy for doing it, right?Police actions being done by an outside nation are never squeaky clean. All you have to do is research the police actions the US did around the world, often without the need of protecting us from a hostile nation, often all for money for big corporations. But Russia is fighting for its life... to maintain its autonomy as a free nation of the world.And here you have little Russia trying to protect herself from US aggression, and she happens to do a few bad things like the many the US has done, and all of a sudden Russia is the bad guy. Don't you realize that the civilians who were harmed or killed by Russia, were Ukrainian taxpayers? They were supporting their Ukrainian Nazi government just like you are supporting your murderous US government.You got it backwards, hypocrite.",

But as the war continues I never knew that this war that is fought far away from my country would affect me drastically. Today I am not only sorry for myself but my countrymen. Food, gas and fuel prices have soared that many people can no longer afford them. My country is moving to the stage of national food crisis. Crime rate has increased because many companies are downsizing causing unemployment. This war is not militarily anymore but political and economical. The third world war that predicted might not be fought with arms and ammunition but with food. Negotiations and compromise should be initiated before this food war escalates.",

Marx and Engels were idealists. The fact that anybody can ruin their systems shows that those systems don't work.This doesn't mean that Communism in any fashion works. It doesn't mean that US fascism works. All it means is that the system that can give people enough freedom so that they think that they are free, is the system that works. Marx and Engels were good at figuring out a system that was good. But they weren't good at implementing it.Check out Hitler's NAZI platform... the points that made up the platform - https://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/25points.htm. If you are living in a land that has been reduced to poverty by war (WW1), this NAZI platform might look good. But when you compare it to free USA or free Russia, there almost isn't anything good about it.Just because the US wants to bring the Ukraine into NATO using NAZIsm, doesn't necessarily translate into benefits of any kind for the people of the Ukraine.
