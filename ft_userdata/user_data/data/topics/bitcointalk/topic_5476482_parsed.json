  "content": "Good day everyone,,, I would like to share my winning with you guys, but I am not just doing it because I won the bet, but it is because it wasn't the amount I wanted to stake that I staked.A friend of mine collected $10 from me earlier yesterday and I wanted to use the money to gamble, but based on, he is my friend. I gave him the $10 he asked for, and the guy said he would return the $10 back ASAP after 3 hours, but he didn't and the $10 was the amount and same money I wanted to use and stake a bet (I have some coins but don't have cash and I don't want to sell any penny of my coins for any reason). But letter on, I used 1000 naira ($1) to stake the bet and I won 49,814 naira (about $50+).Now I am angry at my friend because he didn't keep to his words. Although I am still happy about the win, I wish he had given me back the $10. Then, I would have win bigger money.",

      "body": "Good predictions. If you borrow anyone money, have alternatives and not depend on the money because your friend can disappoint you. Sometimes it is understandable. I do not borrow people money that I can not afford to borrow them. I see money I borrow people as a lost money. If a friend is truly worth borrowing money, I borrow him or her the amount I can afford to lose.",

It's not that big of a win for me, just 1.94x odds, but at least a win is a win and I wasn't able to bet on the matches that I really wanted.In any case yours have a good odds and obviously you could have won bigger money.So it's up to you whether you will still him as a friend still because you could have double what you supposed to get with that parlay and that odds is really incredible to begin with all 2.x and above.",

      "body": "What makes you so sure that luck is still on your side that you have such an assumption?Stopping and cashing out is always the best way and choice rather than in the end you regret it because instead of getting a bigger win but the opposite happens, all the winnings you have obtained at the beginning are lost again because of your greedy actions which are certainly too confident in something that has absolutely no certainty for a much bigger result.I hope that before you choose a decision without careful consideration you should think that \"regret always comes at the end\", although it cannot be denied that you could have won more if you continued but believe me that the possibility is very small, and casinos rarely provide such good opportunities to gamblers, and \"prevention will always be the best decision / action rather than cure\" that's all.In addition to the money issue like the case experienced by the OP, on the other hand I think it's more about the level of trust and responsibility, if you really trust your friend by lending money that you basically want to use immediately it means at least you have to commit to him by saying \"I need that money, and anyway the money must be returned as soon as possible\", this is a matter of how close and how much you trust your friend, but the OP is still lucky here by still being able to get a win even with a small amount.",

I see it as win-win here. You still get to collect your money from your friend and still keep the $50 you have won. I know you may be tempted to bet higher stake this week but don't do it. Best advice to use 1% of your winnings. That would be the best strategy for you.",

      "body": "If you knew before lending money that you really need that money, you shouldn't have let him borrow it from you. You don't have an obligation to your friend. Whether it's your close friend or even a relative, you shouldn't feel guilty or responsible of lending them money especially if you also need it. Remember, you should only lend what you can totally afford to lose. Once you lend your money, there's no guarantee that a person will pay it back despite having a deep relationship. And this is the reason why I ignore all money borrowing matters. You can't really trust anyone, but yourself. It's better for them to be mad or resent you than you resenting them because they can't pay you back. One more thing, once you lend them money, if they fail their obligations to pay it on the agreed date, trust issue will form and it might even destroy your relationship. So be careful next time around.",

Right now, even though your friend might repay you eventually, you didn't have the money in hand when you actually needed it for yourself. I personally avoid lending money unless it's someone close to me or cannot avoid me, because it puts me in a difficult position. Congratulations on your earnings, though. That's a great yield for a $1 wager. Don't stress too much about how much you could have possibly won if you had the $10, because there's always the possibility of you making different wagers, betting different amounts of money, and ultimately losing your earnings.

As a gambler, we have all the chance to try our luck or use our skills if we believe that it could help us win some big money, but always be calm, never regret especially on a win as sometime that word \"if\" in gambling would make you unrealistic with your experience, so stay consistent and on the winning side.

It sounds cruel but in fact gambling requires responsibility, even if in the end your friend returns the amount of money he borrowed, the rule from the start is never to use loans to gamble. In fact if you use $10 and make more than what you make today, that's clearly 10X in front of your eyes. But in the future will you still lend money to others to gamble? I hope that in the future you also need to consider this, gambling for your own pleasure will be better.",

And there was one incident where I had done an analysis, but when I wanted to place a bet, the money was used for other things. So I could not place a bet, which in the meantime the results of my analysis were very precise. And if only I had placed a bet at that time, maybe I would have gotten a big win.And when it comes to friendship, I always avoid when a friend tries to borrow money from me with the excuse of playing gambling. I do that because I am not brave enough to collect debts, when the borrower is a friend, besides the possibility for the money to return is also very zero. I would rather give him a small amount of money for free, than have to give him a large loan.",

This is the downside on lending someone money that is your only money because you don’t have any guarantee that you will not use it urgently after you lend it while the borrower can’t return it back to you.Just think of it that there’s still risk of losing the bet that’s why it’s still good that you didn’t risk more. 45odds is not an easy bet to accomplish so I’m sure that risking more might makes you tempted to early cash out in case you manage to bet 10$.",

Sometimes our kindness wouldn't seem like one, when we begin to regret at some point. Yet, the $10 may have helped your friend a long way. I'm impressed you had the right predictions for the games. At least it looks mature, booking few games and staking a reasonable amount. Most gamblers, would play the game with few cents. Next time you can try with $10 and be careful not to lose on that. I've felt similar ways, after winning with smaller amount. I'd crosscheck how much I would have made, If I played with a bigger amount. But, that's how gambling works. No need to blame anybody.

On the other hand, it's true that it's a little annoying, I'm sure with this incident it looks like OP will have a little trouble with his friend or means a little tenuous in their friendship, but I think it's natural as a form of annoyance that comes out of humans who have common sense. Well exactly, don't think about it too much and just accept what you should get, because basically it's simple if indeed the big win is for you then there will be no possibility of problems like this between you and your friend which makes the big win blocked for you, so I'm not saying you're unlucky but maybe it's not time for that much luck.",
