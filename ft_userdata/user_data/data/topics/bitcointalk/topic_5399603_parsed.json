Probably alien invasion cities burn fire everywhere.But make no mistake, those places where the money is printed and data centers wich run the stock markets and futures options and all kind of forex those locations are always protected in the world becouse financial system its most important so the elite making sure war never reach those places and electricty and emergncy back off system is always on.But we need each time bigger bigger and bigger crisis becouse current financial system is addicted to crisis u like it or not u got 2 options to complain about it or take advanced...of this and accure wealth and enjoy  the life of the super wealth as much you can becouse the world will be addicted to the crisis.Its great gatsby on steroids but this time we will have 1-2 years circles max of 2 years of good and next 2 years of bad the goal is to print massive ammount of money in one year massive ammount of printing money= simple way to response to the crisis. So 2020 crisis 2021 printing massive money and 2022 preparing to new crisis crisis needed to print more money 2023 crisis and 2024 will be big prosperity becouse again massive printing money will be as the response to the crisis.We choosed this way and its addiction and society is too soft for full instant hard rehabilation....better to be just addicted",

But it’s one of those situations where due to covid they had to close everything and had to send people stimulus.They sent people like what, $600 a few times. Maybe $2000-3000 in total and what was the result. Everything pretty much since then went up 20%. Let’s say you spend $10000 on Food and Gas, with inflation you are spending $2000 which is what you were given. You are not better off, nobody is. Except maybe the rich.",

      "body": "I think there's some nuance to money printing and a crisis. It matters who is printing the money, and how much. If it's a poor country whose fiat is not in demand internationally, it can easily backfire and lead to hyperinflation. If it's the US, whose fiat is in very high demand and trusted, they can print a trillion dollars and face minor repercussions but won't jump into the hyperinflation mode.Also, while when inflation rises, the stock market often rises as well, if we're talking about an economic crisis, the market crushes.And the war is NOT a solution to well-being and financial sustainability. Surely neither you nor your loved ones ever faced an actual war if you are saying that. A war crushes the economy, makes tons of people lose their jobs, many end up in poverty, and then there's also the risk of dying from shelling, war crimes, starvation or lack of medical care.Yes, the current system isn't good, and it's often very unfair. But an actual war won't fix it, it would only make things worse.",

It worked for the last 60 years, so why shouldn't it work for another 60 years? It's much easier to accept the current situation and not try to change it. Unfortunately the reasoning is wrong. Just because something worked in the past is no guarantee that it will work forever. We can already see today that that our system is failing, we haven't reached the optimal system that makes everybody happy. Relying on large amounts of debt to drive growth only means that problems are transferred into the future. Even if it won't blow up in our lifetime, our children and grand children will feel the fallout. In my opinion we should pressure the politicians more to change our monetary and financial system.",

But the real problem is deeper, we are entering into a stage of chronic resource shortages, 20th century consumed everything and 21st century will be payback time. With polluted seas, land and skies, we will see lower agricultural productivity and more crop failure.So we will witness that because of resource shortages there will be hyper inflations and money wont buy us what we need. So ther is a need to invest more in innovation and technology. Only science can save us not money",

Although sometimes opposed because it is not in accordance with what we have. The government will remain in control and will not let finances go unreported.When the pandemic is so chaotic and only the government restricts us from being able to move freely. The increase in interest rates due to financial swelling in the banking sector has become the theme of economic recovery.",

I agree with you, mate. OP's logic is traditional and is enclosed with the idea that what worked before might actually still work in the present and in the future. When in fact, it won't be always the case for every subject matter. The systems, once in a while should have changes and improvement dedicated for the greater good of the people and the community.If there is something we could enhance about the current system, we should do it and we should let them execute it.  After all, in every system, there are flaws which should be addressed and solved. There were numerous times  that the financial system failed, and instead of just being complacent about it, we should carefully scrutinize and take action so that we can have a better financial system that we deserve.",

The world has an economic system that suggests the best thing to do would be going into debt to survive, they keep the world in a place where population barely has enough to survive or doesn't even have that.If majority of people have barely enough to survive, and make a small amount of debt each month, then they will keep on working and requiring more money, and that will allow the elite to keep on making profits because they have workers who are forced into labour via debt.

An economic downturn in the US will hit china's economy hard as there are no alternative markets for china to turn to in the event of severe economic crisis in their largest market.China's economy is high debt. Russia's economy is the opposite: low debt. Russia is in much better shape economically to survive a global economic crisis, than china is.
