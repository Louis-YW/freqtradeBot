  "content": "I got this mail from Ray, the CEO of paxful today. It takes one who is determined to serve the public to give a warning like this, From all indication he is willing to be contented with trading commissions. More interestingly, they provide a lightening network for cheaper and quicker Bitcoin transactions straight to their cold wallets. He did not just issue the warning sternly, he still took time to provide links explaining why his customers should hold their own coin except for day traders and an easy step to self custody, not many exchanges will do this for their customers.QuoteWhy? For far too long people have trusted others to hold money on our behalf but‚Äîlike we saw with the banks in 2008 and recently with FTX‚Äîyou‚Äôre at the mercy of these custodians and their morals üòìHowever, Bitcoin has given us the chance to finally be in control, and we must take it. Rest assured, if you do wish to keep your Bitcoin on Paxful, your funds are safe with us, but remember‚Äîonly keep what you want to trade! üôèHere are two guides on how you can self-custody your Bitcoin:Why everyone should hold their own BitcoinFive easy steps to self-custody your Bitcoin",

      "body": "Some irresponsible persons will still not respond to these warnings. How many persons will even remember to continue to be responsible for their coins when things look normal again and peaceful in cryptocurrency. It is better to not have any coin at all or change the coins you have and spend it on irrelevant things than to keep the coins thinking they are safe in an exchange. If other top CEOs of some very known exchanges can come out and make public statements encouraging people to consider self-custody as priority for their bitcoins, maybe more persons will listen.",

You do your best to inform them of the safe means to using a service and not have it all pinned down to your profit making. It's some good initiative from the Paxful CEO to get some traffic as and trust's his customers to spread the news like you just did. One thing for sure, he didn't send it out to prospective customers but patronisers and patronisers gets to spread the word as to how responsible and legitimate the site its.It's good tactics from the CEO, reducing the risk of being responsible for so much should anything go wrong and protecting what ever hdings in his charge from himself as well. I give it to him to be a wise choice. Now, its left for customers to heed warning and be responsible for there coins. You are your own best security when it comes to cryptos.",

      "body": "The whole essence of bitcoin is centered more on individual responsibility compared to the thought of having it without actually having it close. One reason why this post is essential is the fact of awareness. Individuals may not voluntarily forget their coins or do anything to safe guard it if such a statement about the importance of having them in a safe place isn't reiterated. The trends of bitcoin market is one that isn't steady all the time for minimal holdings. Even those who have large portions of the coin won't leave it in the system without ensuring a safe haven where its value doesn't diminish by theft or loss in market value. For security reasons, for ease of investment and for any other worthwhile reason, it is my responsibility as well as yours to be liable for my wealth. Only then can more be added or multiplied.",

Such processes like minimum withdrawal, swapping coins etc when remembered can dull the impression of withdrawing money often. On the other hand, in essence, I think the Paxful CEO didn't convey any information. He's still revolving around keeping what you can spare on the exchange. Telling people to store money for trading, is same thing as saving money on exchange as many will feel reluctant and claim that the whooping amount they've left on the exchange is meant for trading.",
