I can not find his original tweets or interviews, but let's see this one first.Bitcoin Magazine quoted his sayingQuoteMichael Saylor after buying over 200,000 $BTC:\"The endgame is to acquire more #Bitcoin. Whoever gets the most Bitcoin wins.\" üëèIt is another version of what you shared \"Bitcoin: there is no second best\". There is one end game, it's Bitcoin.",

I will try to search for more songs about BTC though and see how long it has been.It might not be the usual way of educating about Bitcoin, but still it's very short and we can understand it very clearly.",

Though there's no way a few minutes video can really educate one, It does highlights some important basics. A few minutes audio or video can make you research about it if it's catchy. There are things or phrases I've heard in music or movies/videos that have made me research about it and has led me to know more about it. Some historical people I know about, I heard about they first in song, but I researcher and knew more. So a few minutes of video might not give you the full details, but all it needs to do is to be catchy and the person might be interested to know about it and he'll ask questions.Ads are about 30 seconds to 1 minute long, but they have major impact. All that is needed is for the key features of the stuff to be mentioned and get the interest of the target audience.",

But it seems like people are not really interested in hearing about Bitcoin in a rap song like that, maybe people will be more convinced when they are given access to knowledge that makes it easier for them to understand Bitcoin and the use of Bitcoin directly in transactions/investments. And there are also some words in the song that need to be fixed, such as crypto investment and financial freedom - even though Bitcoin is widely used as an investment, its main function is for transactions. And also to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin, to be honest it is something that is very difficult and not everyone can do it, don't be fooled by narratives like that.",

What do you think?Just four likes on it, but the likes will certainly increase as bitcoin becomes more popular. The hip hop style of promoting Bitcoin will only appeal to those who like hip-hop as a genre of music. From the very first few beats, someone who is not a fan of hip-hop would exit the video and the entire proposal of its creation would not be met. I like the fact that there are different means that Bitcoin is being promoted through and lots of people are becoming creative about it not just depending on the normal way of promoting bitcoin. All this creativity will help.",
