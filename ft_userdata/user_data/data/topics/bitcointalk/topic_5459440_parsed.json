Some many people within the economics world thought that the gold standard was dead for good and gone forever and yet BRICS may be onto something here. However, I am still skeptical on the capacity of BRICS to globally affect the hegemony of the American Dollar around the world and all the markets, even though a gold backed currency in this decade could be a game changing move, there is still a point of failure which could be the biggest obstacle for a gold backed currency: trust.Not all of us will believe that BRICS's new currency is fully backed and there would be no easy way to know it, they could try to make the currency 100% redeemable for gold, that would solve the trust problem partially but all this would become a very tempting scenario for counterfeits.",

The best currency for the world now should be a decentralized one. Consider that \"everyone\" has a phone. Even the poor people who don't have a place to live still have a phone, somehow. Combining the algorithms that Monero uses for privacy, with the phone SMS, along with the blockchain, could produce an easy-to-use, private, yet verifiable cash ownership method. Everybody uses the phone right now to get crypto and to trade with it. Just a few more steps and gold backed currency along with security and privacy would be available.",

Among other things, it was emphasized that they wanted to create an international trading currency. Undoubtedly, this is an undertaking that could have consequences of epic proportions.After all, the BRICS countries represent about 3.2 billion people, approximately 40 percent of the world's population, with a combined economic output nearly the size of the economy of the United States of America. And there are also many other countries (such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iran, Algeria, Argentina, and Kazakhstan) that might want to join the BRICS club.The goal of the BRICS countries is to reduce their economic and political dependence on the US dollar, challenging \"US dollar imperialism.\" To this end, they want to create a new international currency for commercial and financial transactions, replacing the US dollar as the means of transaction unit.The reason is obvious.The US administration has on many occasions used the greenback as a \"geopolitical weapon\" and engaged in a kind of \"financial warfare\": Washington sanctions enemy countries by denying them access to the US dollar capital market, but above all, it shuts them off from the international US dollar-centric payment system.The freezing of Russia's currency reserves (the equivalent of almost six hundred billion US dollars is currently at stake) has set off alarm bells in many non-Western countries. It has reminded a number of them that holding US dollars comes with a political risk. This, in turn, has prompted many to restructure their international foreign reserves: holding fewer US dollars, switching to other (smaller) currencies, but above all, buying more gold....How do you get BRICS gold? Those demanding BRICS gold must either get a BRICS gold loan from the BRICS Bank or purchase gold in the market and deposit it with the BRICS Bank or a designated custodian, and the gold deposit is then credited to his account in the form of BRICS gold....",

Find a company that will trade your gold for some currency.Don't trust BRICS until they prove themselves trustworthy by those who take risks with BRICS... risks that you don't want to take. But, that's the same with any country or company. After all, once you trade your gold for the US Dollar, you are locking yourself into a guaranteed loss through inflation.",

I thought that was one propaganda that led to the war in Libya and eventual death of Muammar Gaddafi because of same gold baked currency introduction in Africa.The currency they may want to introduce could not be completely gold backed, it could be even non-backed because in the end of the day the final objective it would not be to provide the people of BRICS with a reliable currency, but to dethrone the USA dollar off its status of global medium of transmission of value.If they talk about gold backing it could be in order to increase the attention people and institutions on their incoming currency, because otherwise there would not be nothing important/different about BRICS bills. China and Russia (which are the head of the group) are probably planning to include as many countries a possible in order to pre-establish the zone of influence of that currency ans slowly introduce it in detriment of the USD. Argentina is a very good example of what they try to do, when a population does not longer trust their own currency, they seek for alternatives, Russia and China want BRICS to be that alternative, before a future president pulls the trigger on dollarization.",

(Related: Putin accuses U.K. of training Ukrainian saboteurs to disrupt Russian nuclear plants.)\"Our readiness for constructive interaction was misunderstood by some as submission, as an agreement that the new order will be built by those who proclaimed themselves the winners of the Cold War,\" said Putin. \"All these years we have repeatedly warned that this approach not only leads to a dead end but is fraught with the growing threat of military conflict.\"\"But no one was going to listen to us, no one wanted to hear us,\" he added. \"The arrogance of our so-called partners in the West was simply off the charts.\"Putin claims Russia did not start the conflict in UkraineIn his speech during the Valdai Discussion Club, Putin also pointed out that the Russian special military operation in Ukraine is all about finishing the conflict that the U.S. started back in 2014 at the beginning of the Washington-supported Ukrainian Maidan Revolution.\"We did not start the so-called war in Ukraine. On the contrary, we are trying to finish it,\" he said.
