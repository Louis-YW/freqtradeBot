  "content": "First, let's watch this short video.Bill Gates Explains the Internet to Dave (1995) | LettermanIn the interview, Bill Gates was trolled about Internet capacity to handle a podcast, just a podcast, not a video, movies or livestream like we have nowadays.QuoteIn the first six years of the WWW (1990-1996), less than 1% of the world used the internet.The internet’s adoption curve was marked by a really slow beginning when it was only interesting to tech experts. This is similar to the early days of Bitcoin. We can observe the growth of Bitcoin through its value as the number of holders increases the currency’s worth. Sixteen months after Bitcoin was created, its value was still at only $0.004.(World Bank, Wells Fargo)Born in doubt, the Internet changed the world entirely and I see some similaries and potentiallities of the Internet and Bitcoin. Now, let's read some more resourcesCan Crypto Match the Internet and Hit 5B Users?Internet vs Crypto Adoption: How Do Their Adoption Curves Compare?Internet vs. crypto adoption chart predicts 1 billion users by 2027You're still early: An objective look at Bitcoin adoptionBitcoin has potential to make bigger impacts than the Internet.Coming days will be very chaotic with SEC. and Bitcoin Spot ETFs but if you have bitcoins, spend time to read above and hold your bitcoin.

Most people never thought that man could fly in the air with an aeroplane and whoever dreamt that submarines would ever be invented. Bitcoin was strange and it is also normal for people to underrate it. I might have been one of those people who would have called the early Bitcoiners dreamers and scammers because humans naturally repel change.

Bitcoin is revolutionary in the area of finance, and I think it might still gain a lot more attention and adoption than it currently has. But there are also fundamental problems like the number of transactions the network can handle per second, and the fees that rise when too many transactions are waiting for confirmation. Also, PCs and the Internet were way more universal than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a currency, and while blockchain is a fairly universal underlying technology, it didn't become a major success in areas other than cryptos. So while there's hope and there are similarities, there are also major differences.",

If we exclude some countries with totalitarian-communist regimes, most of the free world has accepted the internet as something positive.Quote from: tranthidung on January 03, 2024, 08:24:59 AMQuote from: Gavin Andresen on December 19, 2010, 04:41:39 PMWith Satoshi's blessing, and with great reluctance, I'm going to start doing more active project management for bitcoin.It should not be forgotten that Gavin was one of those who in some way \"protested\" because of the way Satoshi made decisions and actually \"demanded\" to take over the matter. In those early days, Satoshi was not a favorite person and regardless of the reasons, he left because he no longer felt comfortable.Besides, glorifying Gavin shouldn't be a one way street, this is the same guy who believed that CW Faketoshi was the real Satoshi. For someone who is supposedly very well versed in Bitcoin matters, it's really strange that he would fall for such a cheap trick.",

Also, what evidence do you have that Bitcoin adoption has increased over say the past few years? In another thread I asked the question about how we would know this, and most agreed that Bitcoin's structure makes it impossible to know how many people are using it, and what the trend is over time. Adoption could have gone down over the last year for all we know.And Bitcoin \"adoption\" is limited to people holding it as a speculation instrument, so there's nothing inherently permanent about this adoption in any case.",

Bitcoin isn't even within 10,000x on transaction speed and cost. Some other cryptos are marginally better, but they are still 1000x off the mark. The blockchain architecture will never allow cryptocurrencies to get anywhere close to what they'd need to be to compete.The great news is that none of this matters since people love to use cryptos as speculation instruments.
