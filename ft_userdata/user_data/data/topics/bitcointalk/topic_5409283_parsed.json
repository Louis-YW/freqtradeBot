  "content": "Economy movementHere is the scheme exacly what been happeningUk falling slowly becouse no foreign currency demand to get uk currency.Years ago the foreign investors bought up the uk currency From arabia africa latin america sych us mexico and so They drove up the british pound to sell it high and to get dollar so the dollars was cheap then are high now so the dollar purache power is good on the global market now so they buy mostly wealthy buy now btc and gold once they go high guess what ? They will be selling for dollars and there is no demand for uk currency becouse its not pumped now the dollar value is pumped by whales whales means wealthy who got a lot money to move markets.So once btc goes up and gold they sell it for dollar and mostly stable coins becouse world top wealthy will choose usd pegged stable coins to hold their wealth it will go up also but rich will withdraw from uk pound so less d mand for uk currency as they move to south europe to buy property both uk and usa wealthy ones then the eu currency demand will increase but dollar stays stable becouse uk pound sellers buying usa dollars becouse pound is high now but they exit off the pound and also from uk property markets remember exit = brexit so they exvhange money in dollars and dollars to euros we will see parabolic bull run of the dollars as rich wealthy ones across the globe will buy eur currency to buy property in europe euro can bypass the uk currency and then dollar dollar will also fall once british pounds sellers are done becouse high dollar value is created from those who use dollar as buffer zone to move money further from now.Also europe will do the silk road deal with china so all the goods in to western world will go trough eu zone so its a another factor wht drives eu currency up big demand for eur currency also latin america rich cartels will choose their homes in south of europe ofg course france rivere nice area such us monte carlo and off course spain and italy also grayscale biggest crypto whale move in to europe to give even better crypto liquitity.What about uk ? Well as the foreign investors big whales take out their wealth of uk it all started witj code \" brexit \" it means wealthy people secret exit brexit was needed to give wealthy ones safe way to exit to not couse panic so the average dumb retail kind of person non educated bleb cant suspect nothing.And now its a freefall of uk currency becouse this foreign huge demand to get uk pound is over but now we all wait when uk pound to go to very low and allmost devalued so the uk currency can be bought back cheaper and then suddenly when the whales will start pump uk currency up again then dollar will fall a lot becouse then the british pound will do ATH after ATH Becouse in currency world british pound is like bitcoin in crypto world but gbp is a like btc in fiat world.Off course whales are selling their gbp bags at least one year to make price lower to grab uk pounds a lot cheaper from the down if uk currency start moving then it will make banks to start printing evem more And remember uk banks are the richest ones becouse uk is the biggest currency forex wahles playground also uk has the best online banking system to transfer biggest ammounts also uk banks have highest limits if you compare with other banks becouse uk is money country its currency and investment whales official playground no matter what source of money all the money will end up in uk london so now the whales watching to buy the uk dip.Our life and daily life is just a whales games we live in the whales world.",

      "body": "Alleged success in the UK is due to the hierarchy and structure of the EU. Which is in a constant state of bailing out greece and EU nations which receive more in benefits than they pay into the system. Cash positive nations like the UK paid more into the EU than they received. Which allowed for them to gain by leaving. Of course, the EU and others retaliated against the UK in revenge. Which significantly reduced any economic gains the UK may have made from the departure.The UK being cash flow positive and no longer needing to prop up EU negative cash flow countries, contributes towards its FOREX trading stats improving. But I think we're far from seeing the final forms of either the UK or EU. We have seen firsthand the number of drastic changes which can occur from the global pandemic in 2020 to the present. Indications are such drastic changes may only accelerate heading into the future.",

It won't hurt to upgrade your post a little.\"They will be selling for dollars and there is no demand for uk currency becouse its not pumped now the dollar value is pumped by whales whales means wealthy who got a lot money to move markets\".Â  Can you give more details how the dollar is be pumped?
