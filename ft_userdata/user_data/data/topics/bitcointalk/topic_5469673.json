But what happens when some of us try to cash out that balance through some CEX to your bank accountI've readed histories here where people get their funds stuck for weeks or months and that would be frustatransing.So again the question: Is it important to check addresses for AML before doing transactions with it?Most of the AML checks services offer only a few checks per month, why? Obviously if we don’t have any plan to cashout that balance we don’t care much about AML checks.Is there some free unlimit service to check for AML?What are your thoughts about this?Regards!",

CEX are doing AML by asking about the source of your coins. If they find your story implausible, they might freeze your account. If your coins are connected to gambling sites or darknet, that would likely trigger automated suspension.",

Yes it Carries the risk and that’s why I said if the OP has strong suspicion that the money is probably tainted then it will be better he does get it mixed and also receives in an address he will never make use of again and as you have said if it is a small amount then even if it comes from mixers it wouldn’t incur any suspicion. This could be the only way except if there is another way out of this.",

One consideration is that there is probably no industry standard, which could lead to a given address being flagged by one service provider and not by another. A year ago or so, I took at look at what General Bytes (bitcoin ATMs) does in this sense, when talking over something or other on our local forum. According to their documentation (see  here and here), their scoring comes from APIs provided by CipherTrace and/or Chainanalysis. These may therefore be good underlying service providers to search for, besides there being no seemingly standard.To this effect, at least Chainanalysis seems to have a free API that you may manage to wiggle into them providing you a key to (I think it’s meant for professionals, but I’m not sure how much they’ll dig into that). Could be worth a try: https://www.chainalysis.com/free-cryptocurrency-sanctions-screening-tools/The said API does seem to be based on sanction lists, but I haven’t seen how it deals with addresses that are N-steps away from one of such addresses.",

Take any transactions and check them from several sources and you will find that the number is completely different and very random.These explorers set such values to appear professional, but all they do is that there are standards that they follow in this classification, and you can easily adhere to these standards and make this number 100%, even if the transaction comes from illegal activities.The best thing you can do is to use mixing services or withdraw money from one CEX and deposit it to another CEX where it is easy to prove that the deposits came from them. + stop using gambling services and casinos.",

Because the bank may ask you where the money you entered from a centralized cryptocurrency exchange came from.They'll just ask you some things and you can easily provide that it's from a crypto exchange and just have to explain everything. What's a tougher situation is when the exchange questions you where your source is especially if they tracked and detected that the BTC you sent to them had come from a banned address or from these sources from the image above.
