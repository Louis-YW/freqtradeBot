  "content": "Hi all, i new here, found an interesting project, but still in the testnet, maybe you will be interested too.And we discuss the future output of the project.Now lets see how to start mining testnet new coin - QUAIAbout QUAI from site:Quai Network is the only decentralized cryptocurrency with the capacity to scale to all global commerce. Quai is a merge-mined network of blockchains. This network is able to coordinate an infinite number of blockchains (execution shards) by using the Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM) consensus mechanism, which eliminates all consensus-based contention. The ability for PoEM to coordinate a perpetually growing set of blockchains allows the network to process more than 50,000 transactions per second. The architecture is a composable multithreaded execution environment with blocks being produced approximately every 1.1 seconds.Quai addresses issues with scalability while maintaining decentralization to create an un-censorable network which can be ubiquitously used as money.Before run miner1) Run quai nodeTo run an instance of go-quai, you'll need to install these programs first:Git - A DevOps tool used for source code managementGolang - A simple, statically typed language for building secure and scalable systems.Now that you've installed the base dependencies, we can go ahead and clone the go-quai repo. We recommend making a directory to house all of your Quai related repositories for easy access.Code:cd path/to/directorymkdir quaiNow that we've made our parent directory, we can navigate to it and download the repository.Code:cd quaigit clone https://github.com/dominant-strategies/go-quaicd go-quaiThis command checks out the main branch to your local.Build the SourceTo start the node, we first need to build the source. Building go-quai requires both go and a C-compiler. You can easily install a C-compiler using your favorite package manager.After installing the dependencies, you can build via Makefile by running:Code:make go-quaiFull nodes validate all of the chains within Quai Network. To spin up a full node run:Code:make run-allRun minerWindows cpu miner: https://github.com/quai-strategies/quai-cpu-miner/releases/tag/0.9.0Linux source miner: https://github.com/quai-strategiesBuild for linux minerSimilar to the node, we'll need to build the source to run the miner. You'll again need a C-compiler which can be installed with your favorite package manager.To build the source via Makefile, run:Code:make quai-cpu-minerRun linux minerNow that we've built the source, we can prepare to run the miner.Prior to running the miner, you must connect to a fully synced node, either local or remote. Once you've connected to a synced node, you can spin up an instance of the miner. Miners always mine a subset of three chains within Quai Network. When starting the miner, you'll have to specify the subset of chains you want to mine. By default, every miner secures Prime. Miners must then choose a region chain and a corresponding zone chain to mine. Start the miner with the following commands:Code:# run in terminalmake run-mine region=R zone=Z# run in background, save log outputmake run-mine-background region=R zone=Z# R and Z can range from 0 to 2Important linksWebsite: https://qu.ai/Documentation: https://docs.quai.network/introduction/quai-networkDiscord: https://discord.gg/quai/Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuaiNetwork",

Its possible a Fake Miner Thread here!According from the Website https://qu.ai/ the Original Github is https://github.com/dominant-strategies/.The Miner download Link from this thread is : github.com/quai-strategiesThat Github Account was just created 7 Hours ago.When you look on the Original Github there is already the real cpu miner for : https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-cpu-minerIt looks like that Github from in here on the Thread is a Fake one and maybe Malware :Code:https_://github.com/quai-strategies/quai-cpu-miner",

The source code is unchanged from the original so it's just a cover for a \"new\" Windows release full of nasty surprises.",
