The domain advertised as \"the best mixer\" was created only a week ago:I checked full history of his posts and I doubt he was intentionally trying to post link for some suspicious scam.Most likely he just copy-pasted article about mixers he found on internet and made few changes.I made quick plagiarism check for one part of his post and it showed around 50% of his content was plagiarized.He should be banned for doing this, here is one of the source articles:https://dev.to/igor4btc/best-bitcoin-mixers-in-2021-55d0Quote from: LoyceV on June 08, 2022, 10:11:35 AMWell, that's useless: the Newbie Flag doesn't show up in Bitcoin Discussion.It's not completely useless because anyone can check his profile for more information, but I agree that Bitcoin Discussion (and few more boards) should have visible trust feedback for accounts.",
