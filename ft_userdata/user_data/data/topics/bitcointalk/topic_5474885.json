Case to case basisIf someone do still have access to their coins then its simply;• They do tend to hold forever whether for Profit reason or for its utility or showing the support• Target price hadnt met yet• They dont need money yet?  For those dormant accounts or doesnt have any activity since.• Lost keys?• Dead owner• Totally forgotten that they have BitcoinIf i were you, then it would be just that better if you dont mind much about those non touched coins or wallets.We dont know on what happened into their respective owners. One things for sure though that if the time comes that they would be having access or getting in touch with their coins then its neither they would be selling off for profits likely.",

Some may lose their private keys. Or maybe some of them cannot find the private keys anymore. Imagine where satoshi is now. He also has a lot of Bitcoin that did not moved for a long time now. Someone has to prove that it's transactional, and we can buy things with this. Just imagine we are all buying Bitcoin, and no one is spending, and it has no use in reality. So, what is the point of gathering more and more Bitcoin and no plan to spend it? Some people see Lazslo as an Idiot because he sold 10000 Bitcoin for two large-size pizzas.",

These are only a few reasons that I think this is all happening despite the fact that bitcoins have already reached its world-record price in 2021. I wonder if we will see some more old holders who will gonna sell their bitcoins when another ATH is recorded after 2024 bitcoin halvings.",

Some might have forgotten that they have bought the coins. Hence the coins are still intact in those addresses. While there might be cases that many owners have bought the Bitcoins earlier, but might have lost access to the wallet or in short lost the password.

That’s just my personal guess, but as others have mentioned it could be that they are just keeping it there for the right time and are hoping it gets to a certain target before they finally move it out and sell.",

Each halving was an opportunity to sell the stash and secure a nice fortune for themselves - not saying there are no OGs who are like this but it is highly unlikely that this not what most of them are doing. On the contrary, this sounds like more like something the newcomers would do.",

If you wait 10 years to sell Bitcoin, it is wise to wait one year or a year and a half and sell it for three times the current price or more. The question would be logical if we said why they did not sell at the peak of $69,000 two years ago, and it will be repeated with every ATH. variables such as the country, age, and financial situation are all considered variables that directly affect investment decisions.",
