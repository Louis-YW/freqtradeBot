The ideas cool but I haven't seen one take off. You'll likely have to build some serious reputation around here to get some motion.I have reasons and methods to offering the cheap price to get it for cheap each investors here who will invest by crypto will be legally share holder aswell by the shares of company or REIT shares. I do it all legally with proper paperwork but i need serious investors on this and no it's not going to be ico.Sure you need reputation but in order to do anything you need reputation allready but then you need someone who's got the reputation who can back you up with funds sources and marketing. Mcafee was not some guy who just got the idea the strong marketing was behind him first he was just the front men the proxy like all of them. Talking about reputation, well the biggest mortgage fraud in history how the honest working people lost their homes it was 2008. So Who's is in and whos out ? My first project will be NYC upper East area the Property price 30,000,000$ but Im sure we get bargain since the economic difficult situation we could take out as mortgage but i prefer the spot market.This why the property prices are high becouse only very few are bought on spot market most of the prices been pumped up by futures positions in simple words the mortgage If there will be straight out the cash deals so i called the spot market deals the prices will be much lower so that's why when you buy with cash you can always get bargain specially now but we need to be fast before the fed start QE again then banks start taking leverage positions and pump it up prices again.",

Few of my friends are investing there for years and so far they have been very satisfiied with it.",

Is this a joke or what? How can you be asking me such question when I do not even know what you are upto. I am wondering if you run a virtual property investment from your current location while managing it in the USA. I  would not have to deal with you directly if I am to invest but rather would prefer to choose an escrow for the deal if I am interested. I think escrow from this platform would make more sense than giving you a penny till it is fully confirmed that your investment plan is legit and recognised by the government or rather licenced as the case maybe.Lastly, this is not the issue of being learned or not some giant Investors were not learned when they got to the peak of their status while some that were learned are the spare headers of scams, Ponzi schemes and failed projects.",

People are wise these days and would not easily give in to this scope. I think you better start up something to show forth becoming calling on investors so that you would have something to present when the need arises as no one would like to sink their funds just for nothing.Allright just tell me what money you got? Right, let's say you have 100,000$ someone here have aswell something so you don't send me the money first i'll contact with seller i'll make my deal with my special conditions.Then i'll reply back to you deal is good let's move and same time i'll do the legal paperwork and you have share holder rights then probably i'll go find the people it's easy to find who got some financial issues so they will be on part of my Reality TV show and then i get based on this tv reality show the right company as partner so i make for example peolple buying some products more expensive becouse people love to follow their tv stars that's just one of the ideas i could do it i have 3 plans with properties when one doesn't work i have other plans Im a learned person in life i know when i do something i do it 100% Everybody will move and do how i say and i'll be managing all of this and give instructions how everything is done so the investors will earn and i earn and everybody who's involved in this earn profit. Is this a joke or what? How can you be asking me such question when I do not even know what you are upto. I am wondering if you run a virtual property investment from your current location while managing it in the USA. I  would not have to deal with you directly if I am to invest but rather would prefer to choose an escrow for the deal if I am interested. I think escrow from this platform would make more sense than giving you a penny till it is fully confirmed that your investment plan is legit and recognised by the government or rather licenced as the case maybe.Lastly, this is not the issue of being learned or not some giant Investors were not learned when they got to the peak of their status while some that were learned are the spare headers of scams, Ponzi schemes and failed projects.Use escrow but i still need the funds to buy it and you don't get any other opportunity to get properties like this so cheap even the share holders rights you dont get to have so cheap. Becouse what makes my project special here is the good bargain of price. I'll make them offer what they can't refuse becouse now it's the perfect situation for them to find owners and buyers i have studied the market and i know why they want to give their properties to me. So can i count on you then ?  If there is problems with trust guys i have method here... Let's do this way If you say amount you have then i'll contact with company i'll form quickly the company i'll make you the share holders and then you release money and i'll be Executing the buying deal. The way i do it i'll get on the phone right people to seal the deal in 24 hours i'll get on the phone one of my good friend who's in the real easte and we make some fast moves. When i take my phone and call then things will be done i don't talk with nobody the way that they will ignore me when i make the phone call they listen and specially NYC everybody loves business and money If they see some serious getting things done attitude is calling to them they Understood it's not time to fooling around but it's time to work hard and improve themselfes to me.",
