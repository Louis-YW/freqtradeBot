The first part is all about miners not being able to make a living if the price remains stagnant. To answer that I would say, please wait till halving and then get ready for the bull run. The second half is a combination of FOMO and weak hands, which everyone knows, does not make any sense to discuss it once again. I am sorry to say but creating such topics does not add any value to the forum. They will not help you in growing up the ranks if you are here to become a part of signature campaigns.",

Fine I mixed everything up and I didn't get it right with the post but that doesn't mean I only want to join a campaign and rank up, God. Your mindset and mine isn't the same. Enlighten me, teach me and I'd be glad to learn and not making everything look like is all about the campaign and rank up. Like who wouldn't want to rank up?

I am ready to assume that the cost of mining coins from large miners on such ASICs will not be more than 17-20 thousand dollars, and for another 4 years there is no reason to worry about it.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465088.msg62886704#msg62886704",

Buying at the top is absolutely devastating regardless of what asset you buy. I do agree that Bitcoin will bounce back but people should prepare themselves if they plan to invest and not use it as a currency.Quote from: Jessie2121 on September 27, 2023, 02:05:07 PMLike who wouldn't want to rank up?

His point is basically to improve your topics if you want to get noticed by other users and get merits to increase your rank. A topic like this usually ends up in the trash can since the discussion gets boring quickly. Besides, you make it on the Legal board which is not really the best place to post it, Do try to make it better, everyone starts from 0. Good luck.",

I feel there's so many ways to call out someone who you feel is just interested in opening threads so they'd possibly rank up and enter sig campaigns. The op has realized their mistake and instead of being so harsh, you should have just ignored them.  You may be right that the forum's not a school but it would not hurt no one if you at least pointed them in the right path.( Which you did by the way before you began your lashing)And to the op, I don't think this is the right board to have this discussion because from what I've understood, your topic is related to BTC mining and/or Economy and this is the legal board. So I'd suggest you move it there.",

At $26k, the price is already good in my opinion, as compare to last year wherein we really have a rough time at around $15,500.As for the miners, it's all business, maybe when they think that they need to sell some of their stash to continue their operation so I guess they will do that and nothing is wrong with that. Again, it's the business side of it, whether they want to stop mining and switch it off right now because they are not making money, or continue and sell some and wait for the next bull run to make profits.",

      "body": "I dont know what are you trying to say But if you want to talk about the Bitcoin Miner here is the story, basically when bitcoin get mined the difficulty will get bigger and because of this old ASIC miner would go inefficient, that when the ASIC maker like BItmain or Canaan make move by upgrading to newest version of their ASIC to keep up the demand is same like what Intel AMD and NVdia do. When the bitcoin all been mined the miner still get the money from the transaction fee. Since the halving keep the reward to find a block getting low every 4 years the scarcity of bitcoin become inevitable. Basic supply and demand when there is a ton of demand but low supply the price will up. Final Answer Yes Bitcoin will last. In my Opinion.",

He is among the few newcomers who fight against their fellow newcomers. He is barely a full member which is not that far away from your rank as a jr member. Also Bureau is wearing signature and yet discrediting your efforts in the name of signature. He go nothing that you should be afraid of him.If you do not want to see people like Bureau, you can ignore them and have your peace of mind. You are a jr member, if Bureau believes your post is substandard, he should have corrected you and not to barate you. In the worse scenario he should report to a moderator.Meanwhile, I do not think that stagnancy of the bitcoin price affects miners reward greatly, unless from the fees of day traders.",
