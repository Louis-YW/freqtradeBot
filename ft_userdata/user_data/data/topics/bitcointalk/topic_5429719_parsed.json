Most projects are now paying on a weekly and usd based so it is somehow fixed. Way back years before, payments were in the projects's token which makes the pay out or reqards bigger especially once the token they are promoting is released in the market. Quite unfortunate as well for those who has low ranks in this forum because rewards are a bit small and sometimes they do not qualify to the campaign. On the other hand, I am stillthankful for the payong projects nowadays because it gives participants something to be greatful of despite of the bad market situation.",

Till date those shitcoins are in my ethereum wallet and only one of those projects have given me decent returns, that is BCDiploma token/EvidenZ (BCDT). I was able to sell a stash of them at the all time high and have been holding to the other half of the stash for even more gains in future. The second one would be Viberate (VIB) which was an additional payment on a signature campaign, but have performed much better previously after launch and then went to dumps only to reincarnate a few months back.To be honest, these are needles in a haystack and I therefore dont recommend and neither do I myself participate in these campaigns. But I doubt any of those bounty hunters are actually going to read this and write a comment.",

I've seen enough hacks using social engineering to hack emails and clear accounts. Projects that pay with liquid altcoins like btc or eth are worth it, but when they pay with their own tokens it's a gamble. I mean i have made a lot in the past with those too (all gone now). Sometimes you can even hit the jackpot when there are for some reason not enough participants and your stake can be worth a lot. And after that you just hope that the project will get picked by a whale.Also i have seen how many bounty program just out right lies. That they have a $200k usdt budget without escrow, or that $200k usdt is actually in worth of their own token. Or even that they will pay after they get the money after ico, which obviously wouldn't happen even if they raised money.",

This was among the mistakes made by bounty managers, as they do not set a limit on the number of participants. There can be a $2,000 budget, and more than 10,000 members participate in the signature campaign and other campaigns. In the end, each participant gets project tokens and their value is not equal to a dollar. Unfortunately, the idea of participating in bounties these days is useless and a waste of time. There are even bounties that last for many weeks, and in the end, they do not pay the hunters, or the hunters get shitcoins by promoting these scams and failed projects, so before you work in one of the bounties, you must review the project first and details of the bounty and the allocated budget, because not every bounty will be profitable for those who work on it.",

I believe I was a Member rank that time. It ain't worth it. $20 might be have a bit of more value here in my country considering that I live in a 3rd world country, but I would rather just freelance than doing that. Can't imagine that there would be users going really far to break the rules like you mentioned on the first part just to pursue those while plenty of opportunity awaits outside.Instead of pursuing bounties further early 2018, I just invested my time to learn web dev. Way more fun!",

Most bounties switched to USD in paying their bounty hunters which kinda diminished the potential earnings of bounty hunters. Switching the pay to fixed rate kinda destroyed the bounty hunters' economy and gigs, and those who remained are those who do not do much for work really because the pay became awful and is no longer something worthwhile for most people.",

Bounties that are paying tokens doesn’t care that much about the rank as long as they can comply with the rules then it can be good. Quality managers will always choose the best participants to represent the project. For the past 2 years I was not able to participate on many bounties but I can still say that profit is still good and I’m hoping for more profitable years because bear market also affects the reward of the bounties.",

Didnt check if those participants are real onesor just simply those bots which im not really that surprised for those peoples dedication on hitting at least a good one, but i would  definitely say that it isnt really worth nowadays.",

But for now, I think it's rare to find a worthy campaign for bounty hunting since most of them ended up as a shit coin on their wallet that has no value at all or no exchange's listing their token.Since the scenario will always be like this: if you are an investor of this token (probably the dev) you will probably be the first one to dump everything you hold when the listing begun and all that's left in the market was for the bounty hunters waiting for their token to be sold because they can't sell it yet after receiving the token.Maybe it's different now from what I know in the past.",
