But we can see that alik111 last used this wallet number on July 18, 2020 06:17:25 UTC.That is, much earlier than the publication of BD Crypto.Also, before that, there were several posts saying that the alik111 account had alternative accounts.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5252044.msg54528210#msg54528210Quote from: coinliker on May 12, 2019, 09:58:47 AMVideos: https://youtu.be/dttIt5Qh7a0Quote from: alik111 on August 19, 2019, 03:13:56 PM1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wLxHTstS7cSimilarly, banned account coinlikerposted his link with the YouTube channel address earlier than alik111.

Also he have a few alt accounts and using them for the bounty, so basically he already aware of the forum.Quote from: The Pharmacist on April 01, 2020, 01:29:28 PMOP registered about 1.5 years ago and only has 15 posts--that might be part of the problem.

Why apply for a signature company and not check the results to see whether the manager accepted it or not? And that is, he sees everything from another account. Apart from everything else, BD Crypto's merit distribution clearly shows some preferences that are suggestive of his other alts.A strange exchange of merit in the Bengali section has been noted before, but of course, basing it on this is completely wrong.Also, the account will not be banned by the moderators (because the ban pattern is different from what the moderators are used to), so I have shown all the evidence that BD Crypto has a previously banned account in history.",

Why apply for a signature company and not check the results to see whether the manager accepted it or not? And that is, he sees everything from another account. Apart from everything else, BD Crypto's merit distribution clearly shows some preferences that are suggestive of his other alts.A strange exchange of merit in the Bengali section has been noted before, but of course, basing it on this is completely wrong.They're suggestive they aren't conclusive there's some preferences. What happens if there isn't a solid link to other accounts. Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on September 04, 2023, 06:44:47 AMAlso, the account will not be banned by the moderators (because the ban pattern is different from what the moderators are used to), so I have shown all the evidence that BD Crypto has a previously banned account in history.BD Crypto's account hasn't been banned. How much time do mods take after they're sent reports of ban evasion? These have been named as possible connected users to BD Crypto's account.BD Crypto alik111 sahadat arbi07 HmahadiSabber5937Stpsoo",

Did you know that if one of your accounts is banned, you can't register other accounts?I was quite sick and I have finished my incourse exam recently that's why I was offline for a certain period.To be truth, Coinliker or alik111 and my account are totally different because Coinliker was an YouTuber and I was an member of his telegram group. I can remember his name was Sourov. Now I am talking about alik111 who was also a member of this group. As far I can remember we had a good relation because I usually used to buy or sell Cryptocurrencies from him. Because in that time Binance P2P was unavailable. Last time I used alik111 Bitcoin address because I will send him those btc obviously to sell so I did it earlier so that I don't need the fees. But I was not conscious about if he used this address in the forum earlier.I am using this forum and trying to contribute as much as I can. And I have tried to be effective for this forum and I can't even think to violate any forum rules. I hope you guys will consider my mistake of using others Bitcoin address as alik111 submitted me. Because I usually don't Bitcoin to him and got paid in Mobile banking. And I can see alik111 have more than one altcoins and Coinliker clearly broke the forum rules but I am totally different from them but we are connected in a Telegram Group of Coinliker. So I think you should judge me properly. @lovesmayfamilis @DaveF @nutildah @Stalker22 @JollyGoodI will request to remove negative trusts and I want to be more constructive for this forum.",

But I was not conscious about if he used this address in the forum earlier.Sorry but I don't believe this at all. You completely ignored the fact that alik111 also sent BD Crypto its first ETH:and that you sent tokens to the same deposit address as other suspected alt accounts:A lot of your early posts are focused on advising others how the forum works and it suggests you've been around here for at least a few years (since at least 2018). I suspect you have several other alt accounts as well. Early on, both your and alik111's posts have the same kind of improper punctuation:Quote from: BD Crypto on June 05, 2020, 06:05:31 PMYou aren't wrong and your prediction is also important because day by day crypto hacking and scamming increasing.Most of the users loosing their coins by falling in trap from them.We also saw Cryptopia exchange shut down because of stealing crypto currency and users lost all of he had.So it's really a matter of worryQuote from: alik111 on July 26, 2020, 04:09:00 PMThis advice is only for Newbies because they aren't actually a technical analysis based trader.They just fall in the trap of Fomo buying.They even don't look at the fundamental of any project.So first be sure you are a experienced trader then invest by borrowing or anyway doesn't matter.Also, comparing the dates and times of your posts, it suggests you are the same person as you tend to write a lot of posts under one account and then switch to the next. Additionally,- both accounts took the month of Jul 2021 off from posting- both accounts took the month of Jun 2022 off from posting, with BD Crypto posting only once in July.You got greedy and then got caught. It's as simple as that.",
