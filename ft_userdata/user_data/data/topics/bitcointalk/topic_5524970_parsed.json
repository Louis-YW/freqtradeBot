For now as people think 200k can be the limit of Bitcoin there's unbelievable potential still exit over a long period, if shit coins can exponentially grow on the basis of nothing Bitcoin is still the king expect slow but steady growth and I'm calling it slow in comparison to its growth with other shit coins as they grow crazy like a bubble and then booom.",

It must be a lifelong regret.If i was one of such people, i will think about it from time to time, but i would not make it a lifelong regret, i sold at a profit and back then it was something worthwhile, i know if you compare it with BTC's current value, then it is nothing, but who would have known.However, there are people who sold like this, but bought again after sometime and they are still involved with BTC now, and so i believe that if some of us were to be early adopters, we would have bought again sometime along the line and still be in good profit today.",

On a second note, you did not lose anything selling at that price and you are still an early bird even if you buy at the current price, just don't compare the past and now time charges so is the price of Bitcoin over that time, just buy and move.",
