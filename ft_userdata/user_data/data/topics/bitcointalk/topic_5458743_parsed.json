Against this backdrop, Luminex , a launch pad for Bitcoin Ordinals , has recently introduced a modified version of the BRC-20 token standard , known as BRC-69. This new implementation promises a significant reduction in minting costs and has aroused great interest in the crypto community.https://criptoinforme.com/bitcoin/tokens-brc-69-en-bitcoin-que-son-y-para-que-sirven-descubre-la-nueva-solucion-de-luminex/",

Ordinals still seem a little taboo to most folks on here, it's gonna have to be a heck of an update to gain more adoption to the OGs on here as they see no value to these...... I however do think it's overall good for the Bitcoin Ecosystem and opens btc up to new users...",

The Ordinal has proven congested and filled the blocks with unnecessary burden of this kind of stuff. A better alternative such as implementing it not on L1 is a feasible approach(see RGB/Taro), sadly, the hype just strangely is not there.Efficiency should be significantly developed by building it on the L2 solution/side chain, instead of figuring out a better implementation natively on the Bitcoin blockchain.",

I believe we cant do newer project on bitcoin chain since its a proof of work and does not utilize any smart contract. So therefore, company cant issued their own tokens using bitcoin. Might as well proceed with alts if thats the cas elike erc20 on eth or other L1. Ordinals inscription on bitcoin is quite different from nft.",

Because it doesn't provide the same security feeling, it's just not ready yet and people are not using it, even though it's offering nearly free transactions.Same goes all these \"innovations\", at the start they will get some hype by some people for sure but as long as we do not get overwhelming amount of support for it, as in like 80%+ of the market, then it's not going to matter.

Where the ingredient must be already stored on the chain in order for the token to be deployed, in first hand. So, it seems in the `compile` parts are where the pre-reveal works.",

Not gonna lie but this doesn't differentiate from BRC-20 and it doesn't have that future in the space, they have but just likely not that great.Technically, it is distinct from BRC-20. The BRC-20 standard is a copycat of ERC-20, whereas BRC69 is a more polished one that is suited to bitcoin capability condition, specifically ordinals specifications. To be exact, they making use of the recent Ordinal Recursive feature among other changes.Quote from: jacafbiz on July 08, 2023, 06:29:55 AMbut the ordinal story makes me think they still have a long way to go before true adoption will comeOrdinal is architecturally inefficient.

There is a way more effective solution if someone or the community want to make such features that are connected to Bitcoin.",
