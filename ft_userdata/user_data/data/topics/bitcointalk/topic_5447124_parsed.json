We already experienced that when the FTX Exchange fall started last time.  So for me, Binance is far bigger compared to FTX Exchange, so expect that the cryptocurrency market will be greatly affected.But after all these collapse on some centralized entities in cryptocurrency market, I believe that Binance already know what they need to do and be careful of. FUD is FUD.",

      "body": "Well, in my opinion, Binance has been successful because of their ability to adapt and innovate in the face of challenges. Despite the FUD, Binance has continued to improve their platform and expand their services, such as launching Binance US and adding new features like staking and lending. Additionally, they have a strong community of supporters who believe in the team's vision and trust their leadership. Binance has also been transparent and responsive to the concerns raised by regulators and the public, which has helped to build trust and credibility. I think Binance's success can be attributed to their agility, innovation, and community support.",

Also the CEO is quite wise to answer every logical question the complainers provided him. I must say that CZ is really smart to outsmart some who try to wreck Binance.

Think of how an exchanger collaped and they remained with the same dreputation in this industry. For sure many people in this industry, in particular with investors know how FUDs should be absorbed and taken to benefit from and to not fall from it. I can celarly remember how many people panicked with what happened forming generalization out of this industry or technology. Binance simply remained firm to show how they return the trust from their users. This is why it is not surprising on my end to know Binance is still in the right place at the present.",

Yes this means that the entire market or community arent that something that could be shaked off with these Fuds specially if this one is really  that been attached with US which does currently have that Banking issue as we do all know.This is why it wont really be that shocking if the price hadnt really dropped nor getting affected specially with BNB. Why it do stood strong? because people on the communityor entire market is really aware of the situation on which there might be some situations and fud might be thrown off just to make this market go to have some crashes or huge declinebut they didnt succeed this time.This do proves out on how strong the trust is to Binance after all.",

It's not the first time though that Binance has been in the hot seat and has been pursued by US. Even CZ's own country, China in it's early days have been going after him and his exchange but nothing has put him down.The thing with CZ is that he is hands on with his project and probably in total control of it and so he is going to face this head on against the US government and willing to cooperate. And you can see that he is responding in his official twitter account. With that, investors see a strong leader, unlike SBF who we haven't heard so much until the collapse and exposing of FTX.",

Greed and the lack of knowledge.  Binamce is well known so once it dips a little there is perceived \"value\" at those prices if anything else didn't dip.  It will take a whole new bull run for those coins to fleet topped and eventually fade out in favor of others.  But until that new bull run comes coin position doesn't tend to move much in terms of rankings.  But do not kid yourself, greed tends to trump all rational thought.",
