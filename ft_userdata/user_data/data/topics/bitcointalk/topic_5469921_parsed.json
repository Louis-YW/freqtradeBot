There's every chance you'll get scammed with cloud mining.Maybe you should do some researches about ASIC hosting, there are serious companies offering it. But you need to understand exactly what you're doing, otherwise you risk to lose some funds.",

Just Buy Bitcoin, wait for the bull run (if you have the patience to wait for the returns from scams due cloud mining then why not wait for the bull run?)Now is the good time to buy if you haven't yet.

Just take a look at their Twitter or social media and you'll find so many users complaining that their withdrawal is blocked or something along that line. Some folks also make a thread and ask about it here IIRC, just search them if you want to convinvce yourself further. Even if you can withdraw some money, I'm pretty sure they will never give you full profits, not to mention there is a privacy risk of using them. As mentioned above, most cloud mining or renting service is just scamming you in one way or the other.",

Can anyone recommend one, even if it's a paid service?I hope you listen to people on her about this cloud mining thing, if anyone is telling you that you can earn with cloud mining today it's a scam as it's not profitable to run any cloud mining business anymore. Years ago I joined four different types of cloud mining platforms,  one is called Genesi mining and the other is called Eobot, I can't remember the other two anymore, I make some money off them, because they constantly pay out weekly but it get to a point where they said they can't keep running the business because its not profitable anymore.They closed down and announced it publicly, it shows how true these companies are until they quit, back then it's easier to mine Bitcoin and the difficultly isn't this big, CPu mining Bitcoin was very possible back then, and now outdated Asic miners are kings of Bitcoin miner back then. We have come to this point where it's impossible for any cloud mining to make money off mining Bitcoin, if you any they are going to scam you, after Genesis mining quit so many new scam cloud mining platforms came up and they scammed a hell out of people.",

If a beginner wants to mine, then he needs to master the main thing - this is a mining calculator. If he is satisfied with the profit, then he can install mining on a PC and mine on the processor himself, rather than sharing the profit with unnecessary intermediaries.",
