  "content": "Celo is a blockchain project that allows smartphone users to make payments using their phones. In 2017, it was founded by Rene Reinsburg and Marek Olszewski. CELO, its native coin, was launched in 2020. The Celo protocol is a proof-of-stake (PoS) Zero-knowledge proof layer-1 proof protocol that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). There have been more than 161 million transactions on the Celo blockchain, and the average block size is five seconds. By mapping phone numbers to public keys, Celo blockchain ensures that mobile transactions are carried out quickly since users can be authenticated. The Celo blockchain promises a new generation of users the power of crypto and DeFi through simple, light, borderless transactions. According to CoinMarketCap, CELO’s maximum supply is 1 billion CELO while its circulating supply is 462,324,704 CELO. The most popular cryptocurrency exchanges to trade Celo (CELO) are Binance, Coinbase, Huobi Global, Gate.io, Bittrex, and others. Celo (CELO) Price Prediction 2022 After touching support level of $0.77, CELO price swung from $1.16 resistance2 to $0.95 resistance1. The market has reversed at the support level of $0.77 and is now going sideways. Expected to be bullish in coming weeks. In the meantime, our long-term CELO price prediction for 2022 is bullish since it cannot break the current support level anytime soon. We can expect CELO to reach $2 in 2022.",

      "body": "Despite the fact that the token price at the ICO was very expensive, it still helped the project to give more x10 profit. CELO held support at $2 for a very long time, but the bearish trend did its work and the price fell below the selling level on coinlist. If bitcoin doesn't hold its position now and collapses below 18k, the whole industry will follow and there will hardly be any growth to $2. Not this year, though I hope the project will still show itself, as it has good support from venture capital companies.",

      "body": "The Celo protocol is a huge project and raised enough money to maintain the project token which should be above the ICO price which was last sold at 1$ each and they raised about 10million$ and with the current price it's -19.5% from the main sales. Let's watch how the prediction goes, but I don't expect anything much different it has been almost 2yrs now, the project has still not surprised me.",
