  "content": "Bitcoin Trading Cards: Orange Pill in a PackThis is an informational thread about a new set of collectible Bitcoin themed trading cards released by Bitcoin Trading Cards. Information from this thread comes directly from their Website, Twitter, Fan Wiki, and Instagram posts etc. I am in no way related to, supported by, or incentivized by the company/project. I have purchased cards for my own collection. I simply hope to provide some information for the collectors on this forum who may be interested in including them in their collection. Pictures are not mine, they are taken from the Fandom Wiki page and are only for reference and display.

The official launch took place in November 2022 at the Pacific Bitcoin Conference. The project has currently released Series 1: \"Celebrating the Pioneers\". Future series are in the works (Series 2: FUD Busters & Series 3: Warriors Vs. Villains).

Please share any thoughts about the project or pictures of any rare cards you may pull in your hunt for a full 65 card set! Completing a full set will be challenging given some numbered cards are very limited (1/21 and 1/100), but the hunt is all a part of the fun. I can't wait to see what others pull from their packs. Thanks for looking, Geophphreigh",

      "body": "They are interesting. I have opened both packs and enjoy both series. Personally I feel like the Cardsmiths are a tad bit better quality in the base cards. The Cardsmiths numbered cards are very nice hologram/gemstone finishes, but were frequently warped/curved.I only have one Numbered BTC Trading Cards numbered card (1/100) and it is very nice. Thicker, shiny, and flat. Stamped number x/100 on the back.Of note, there is always a \"rare\" (blue rare, red ultrarare, legendary, 1/999 or 1/100 etc.) card in each pack of 10 BTC trading cards. So I guess this is nice to always get some kind of a \"hit\". I definitely think it is worth picking up a pack or two, but like I said before, because of the numbering, completing a full set will be very challenging for the Orange Pill cards. The \"base set\" includes rare numbered cards. Cardsmiths has a base set and then rare/numbered cards of the base set image. Very different numbering systems. I'll post some pics of my cards once I open some more packs! I hope others post theirs too. Geo",

      "body": "I received the card packs today. I see in the OP that the Pacific Bitcoin themed card pack was only available at the conference... However, I ordered two base packs and for some reason I also received the PB themed pack as well, a nice little surprise I guess! Below I posted the rarest cards (#1, #5, #21) from the three packs I opened, but I also wanted to share some more in this album as I didn't want to messy the thread. https://postimg.cc/gallery/7qQXN25In the 30 cards, my favorites by far are the Bitcoin themed cards (obviously) and the backs of the cards have a lot of great knowledge jam packed. The BTC theme cards really hit the important points. However, I am not a fan of the advertisement cards, I understand why, but in three packs opened I received six 'resource' cards. For reference, the thickness on the base cards are half as thick as a base card from Cardsmiths. And side by side the holos on the PB cards have less sheen.I don't feel I'll invest in more packs, but all in all it's another novel collectible and another opportunity to orange pill more people!",
