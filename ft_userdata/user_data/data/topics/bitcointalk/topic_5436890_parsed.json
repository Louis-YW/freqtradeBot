If you have to code and/or build a business plan for free, for example, plus pay for different expenses like marketing, hosting, etc. it can mean a no-go in most cases, but finding a good equity partner who trusts on you and you can rely on is a blessing.I don't know how ambitious is the OP's project, but I'm happy to see that members with a good plan or idea here can find that kind of amounts to start or scale their business.",

You're good if you managed to get an investor that have trusted your project with his/her $17k. Quote from: Billyscottland on July 24, 2023, 01:03:32 AMIf you need a large amount of funding you will not find on the forum.That's right because many of us here don't trust easily with the projects that are being launched. Also, many are aware of how these projects become a scam scheme that are trying to hide in the form of a crowdfunding.Anyway, there are specific groups and websites for these funding especially if you're in the tech sector. You have to present what you're up to and be good in the proposal with those angel investors.",
