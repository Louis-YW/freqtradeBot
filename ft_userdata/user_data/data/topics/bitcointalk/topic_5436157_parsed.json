Why not? Because the average person isn't going to steal and use the proprietary product. The average person isn't really even interested in learning about the patent, or if there is one. the protection is protection from duplication by other companies of similar caliber, and for licensing to other companies for their use. It's a 'big boy' game.Covid wasn't a problem that was much bigger than the flu if even that big. A few people regularly die from the flu every year. A handful more might have died from Covid or Cornavirus in general. Most of the people died from doctors not knowing how to handle something different and killing their patients accidentally, or from clinic and hospital business management ordering doctors to use this or that faulty procedure, and from advertising that it, C and C, were dangerous so that the stupid public went out and got a shot which was a thousand times more dangerous than C or C.In fact, if there was anything that Trump should be condemned for, it is this. He pushed \"Operation Warp Speed,\" which produced a vaccine that is killing and maiming stupid sheeple who blindly trust the medical. Of course, Biden is worse for continuing it now that the public has waked up to the vaxx dangers, somewhat.EDIT: Btw, this post isn't mostly for you. It's simply info for any sheeple who might be interested. You aren't interested enough to go out and research it. You said so.",

However, there are some cures for the vaxx coming out. Search in Natural News - https://www.naturalnews.com/#.I can't provide proof, simply because there isn't any proof that viruses exist. If you are interested, peruse this site - https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/ - Quote from: https://andrewkaufmanmd.com/sovi/Isolation: The action of isolating; the fact or condition of being isolated or standing alone; separation from other things or persons; solitariness.- Oxford English DictionaryThe controversy over whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus has ever been isolated or purified continues. However, using the above definition, common sense, the laws of logic and the dictates of science, any unbiased person must come to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has never been isolated or purified. As a result, no confirmation of the virusâ€™ existence can be found. The logical, common sense, and scientific consequences of this fact are:...You can watch some of Dr. Kaufman's videos on Bitchute - https://www.bitchute.com/search/?query=andrew%20kaufman&kind=video.",

If you happen to look at the public a little, they got trapped by a big Covid lie. The public believed the lie. The public didn't check it out. The public is still believing the lie after millions have gotten sick and many of them died... and with all kinds of doctors and researchers showing them the lie.Nobody cares about a patent, certainly not the sheeple public. But if some do, what are they going to do about it? So, why not use patenting to protect your big corporation from other big corporations. Or why not patent the thing, and then license the rights to use it to all the big corporations?",
