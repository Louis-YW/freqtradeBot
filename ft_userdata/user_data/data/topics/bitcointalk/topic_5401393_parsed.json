My opinion: never borrow for gambling, never borrow. this is the riskiest thing you should ever do, think: when you make a loan you have interest and a long period to pay off the loan. when you take money for gambling, the person must get into his head that from the moment he gambles that money is lost, the purpose is always for bookmakers to win, that's why it's a big mistake to borrow to gamble, don't look casinos as a guaranteed source of income, neither in the short nor in the long term. I hope you give up on this idea of making a loan for gambling and be very careful because the moment the person starts to think about this possibility then the person may already be addicted to gambling",

This would only cause the person to continue betting and borrowing money until he/she has satisfied his bet. But given the nature of gambling being highly unpredictable, this would only result to your loans getting higher and higher overtime.Given the nature of your account, I'd say that it would be nearly impossible for you to loan money without having any collateral in exchange. Sometimes, forum ranks are given basis in order for your request to be granted. Given that you are relatively new in this space and you are already thinking of acquiring some loans to fund the most unpredictable nature of such purpose, then I highly doubt someone would provide and fund you.",

Is that information you are talking about even genuine and true in the first place or it just makes you feel desperate thinking that prediction can really happen? Soccer is not easy to predict. Even if you have information about the inside jobs, it's hard to execute those rigged games in the live match and much, especially if the league was reputable.Don't expect easy money.

If you lose, what's next? You'll blame yourself or that source you've got because you're too confident of betting with such amounts and you have to pay that loan with interest. Think again OP!",

You don't hold any assurance that your bet will definitely win, or if someone has assured you, i don't think he'll still be responsible once you lose that huge amount. Think a hundred times. You can bet but make sure to put only money that you can afford to lose. Taking loans either for investment or gambling may only make you face into future troubles once they did not turn well. Once you lose, you will surely struggle how to pay it back, even its monthly interest is still very big so i wouldn't let it happen to me in case.",

Having to take a loan to place a bet also indicates that you can't afford to lose to the money doesn't matter if you're expecting some money from salary/someone or whatnot, and the first ethical rule of gambling is, only bet with what you can afford to lose.",

Personally, I will never create a problem over a problem. Testing the waters is good but taking risks isn't an easy decision that you will just take.And prior to that betting, do you even qualify for that loan amount?",

You are taking a loan because you do not possess that amount to bet. Now if you lose that bet, you will still have to repay that loan. How will you repay when you have no money,  I have seen people going into depression and doing illegal things only to repay their debts. Do not be over optimistic that you will win the bet and that everything will be good. Things could turn out in the opposite direction as well.",

The money you are planning to risk is too huge for a loan just for placing bets.
