  "content": "BTCTKVR 3: Breaking FUD, the open source magazine which aims to debunk the most common misconceptions about Bitcoin in a way that should generate more grassroots adoption and proper understanding, is now also available in German!Thanks to the remarkable translation effort of Ray Rizzling, the 100 million+ German speakers around the world can now understand why Bitcoin is useful, it doesn't boil the oceans, and it's here to stay.Why is the Breaking FUD magazine a big deal? Because it takes the exact opposite approach: instead of telling people what is Bitcoin, it start from the assumption that the media already told them. Instead of pursuing a potentially divisive ideological approach, it presents some facts about government regulation, altcoins, scaling, security, price volatility, use cases, energy consumption, mining centralization, education, and mainstream acceptance. And instead of trying to target a specific demographic which is more likely to read the work and support the mission of the Bitcoin project, the Breaking FUD magazine takes the riskier path of using facts in an attempt to appeal to everyone.Explaining to people what Bitcoin is not is of utmost importance – especially in an environment which tends to antagonize and nihilistically question the significance and utility of such an invention. Bitcoin has been around for 14 years, billions of people are already aware of its existence, but what they know is only what their media and politicians misinformed them. Using these subjects of “FUD” as a starting point for the conversation is important, as it invites people to use the information that they know and have it challenged by facts of which they were not aware.Read more: https://bitcoin-takeover.com/breaking-fud-is-now-available-in-german/Download the English edition: https://bitcoin-takeover.com/btctkvr-3-breaking-fud/Download the German translation: https://bitcoin-takeover.com/deutsch-btctkvr-3-breaking-fud/https://i0.wp.com/bitcoin-takeover.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Breaking-FUD-Magazine-German-Deutsch-Ray-Rizzling-Table-of-Contents.png",

If we only say about advantages, good things of Bitcoin, listeners will think we are lying. Talking like this will cause more side effects that we don't want when we are trying to convince listeners.",

They can do that, everyone could do that. Instead they are just trying to help more local citizens to get benefit from this magazine and also they will get more audience too. Which is best deal for both.And i really agreed with your point that this magazine contains nothing unique instead it consists of the most common info that i think many already knew about it. Which, indicates they are just trying to target newbies. But, let me tell you when you go through each page one by one. You will get the answer of your query. Which is this is a magazine which has beautiful and eye catching images used in it. And i doubt these images are AI created. I really loved the magazine even i haven't read it completely because its hard to read it on PC even. So, i think it would be a good read if it's in hands (physical).",

Many of the arguments made against Bitcoin does come from a neutral place, and I don't think it is the objective of some academics to spread fear, uncertainty, doubt.Would like to dig into the data behind energy use -- I last read pretty solid data from some presentation but have lost my bookmark. In particular, how energy use is actually predicted to plateau, while providing the same level of security in the next 2 decades.",

And i also shared my thoughts that it would be nice to read it in hands not on screens. Because then it will give us the full feelings of reading a magazine but thanks again for verifying it.",

Magazine is more for blonds then for serious readers, it holds a lot of nicely designed  illustrations that deflect attention from the facts related to FUD  relevant to bitcoin. I have spent approximately 15 minutes turning  the pages of this magazine and reading them but after that understood that there is no sense for me  to download pdf, no value for me, sorry.",
