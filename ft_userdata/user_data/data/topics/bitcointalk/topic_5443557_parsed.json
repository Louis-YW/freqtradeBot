  "content": "Wow! That's the real inflation. Ten years ago, inflation was, maybe, 10% in the whole year. Now it's getting to be more than 10% in single months. Are you ready? Do you know why Biden's reported inflation is as low as it is? It's because Biden's people are taking into account all kinds of items that don't sell, yet are stocked in stores. They don't sell, so just to move them, store managers don't inflate the prices... maybe even lower prices.But take a look below and at the site to see just how bad inflation is with the important things.Note where the inflation is coming from. It's coming from new money that's being printed by the banks, at the order of government. Did you get any of this new money? If you are in the Ukraine government and military you did.Will You Survive The Biden Regime? Liberal Media Ignores Massive Inflation On Products All Americans Need To Survive - Food Inflation Tops 11% In January As New Shortages Announcedhttps://allnewspipeline.com/Will_You_Survive_The_Biden_Regime.phpThat 10.1% is the average though and some foods, such as eggs, are quite higher than that. • Cereal and bakery products have seen an increase of 15.6% since January 2022.• Dairy & related products have seen an increase of 14%.• Non-alcohol beverages and \"other\" foods at home, both increase by over 13%.• Meats, Poultry, fish and eggs increased by 8.1%.• Fruits and vegetables by 7.2%.So when the Biden regime and their puppets in the media tout a 6.4% inflation number year over year, remember they are deliberately leaving out the massive rise in costs for the most important product of all, one all Americans must have to survive....food.Via emails, notes and comments, one of the most appreciated topics we cover consistently is the food inflation and shortages, so we try to keep up with a data released each month that the media downplays or simply ignores. We also keep a close eye on shortages, those occurring now and those predicted to be seen in the coming months, saving the reports and links for the next food crisis updates. With that said, let's get into it....",

If you took a vaccine, sheltered in place, wore a mask, or avoided people as a result of this pandemic, then you were indeed scammed.",

Fortunately most people woke up to their lies during the pandemic but it was a little too late. Only after trillions of dollars were spent and middle class wealth transferred to the elites was when people began asking questions. The media was complicit in the coverup -- partly why nobody trusts them anymore. They still blame Russia for the inflation as if the CPI didn't exist before the invasion.",

Oh, I recall that.The Chairwoman of the Federal reserve actually said that the inflation was simply going to disappear eventually, regardless of the bad economical decision the Binden administration could take in the incoming months or years.As expected, when the inflation did not disappear by itself, she had come come again and face the public to say something many people already knew: She was wrong.

We are going to go into a deep recession, the government just won’t admit it yet..The massive debt the government has accumulated has reached the point where cost of living and quality of life can only get worse in the United States for the foreseeable future.  The Biden administration has turned to using the covid stimulus as a ruse to pretend they’re lowering deficits and dumb people just believe them. At this point it might be best to focus on saving yourself.",
