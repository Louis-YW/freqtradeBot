Snarkcoin was originally created as a joke, but now we have more ideas and ambition! To the world!What is Snarkcoin trying to solve?Through Snarkcoin, the goal is to create a useable alternative to other crypto-currencies, which is both environmentally friendly, while retaining the spirit and taking over the source code of Bitcoin, without new specificities, and to be part of a process of dilution of crypto-currencies, a process of decomposition of the current monopolies, in order to hope for a boost in popularity of this type of currency in our daily lives. Moreover, Snarkcoin is a crypto-currency aimed at \"deflating\" the dominant podium of current crypto-currencies. It's a complicated bet, but my thought is this: the more viable, community-supported, and easily accessible crypto-currencies there are to choose from, the more crypto-currencies will be used in everyone's daily lives.SpecificationsTotal supply: 10,500,000 SNARKBlock halving: Every 105,000 blocksBlock target: 5 minutesBlock reward: 50 SNARKTicker: SNARKAlgorithm: Proof of Work - Powered by ScryptPremine : 0 SNARK / NO PREMINEWebsitesMaintained by meWebsite: www.snarkcoin.net - keep wwwExplorer: NOT YETPool: ONLY SOLO FOR NOWSocial mediaFollow us!Discord: discord.gg/qjct8dQwtkTwitter: twitter.com/snarkcoin1Instagram: instagram.com/snarkcoinReddit: reddit.com/r/snarkcoinRepositoriesDon't forget to star  Snarkcoin Source Code: https://github.com/snarkcoin/snarkcoinSnarkcoin Wallets: https://github.com/snarkcoin/snarkcoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0Post-release goalsCoinMarketCap / CoinGecko listingGetting a strong communityThe maximum possible listingsNews coverage If you have any questions, I will be at your disposal as soon as possible to answereach of them, under this topic, by email, on Twitter, or on Discord.Have a nice day crypto community!",

You live in a city of a few million and you own a shop. There are a million diff coins out there. How will you be able to accept payment from everyone? There needs to be a chain that can process all these coins, auto convert the values and auto calculate the payment from customer to you. (In essence, auto-exchange to a set coin that you can use to pay your suppliers/employees) That is the future of crypto. Cross-chain processing. Not this old-ass LTC wallet Scrypt clone coin. This is mined, pumped and dumped. There is no intrinsic future to clone coins. Look at websites that currently accept crypto, which are the top5? BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE and the odd time XMR or even DASH(Toss in stable coins like USDt, but that is a given). When a cross-chain system will emerge, then all these shit coins will be usable in 'everyone's daily lives'. As for limiting to 10.5M, that doesn't automatically increase its value. LoL. How many decimal places are there? People tend to forget that. OneCoin has only 1 whole coin available though it is calculated to 24 decimal places! It means nothing. Features and marketing are what makes a coin valuable.",
