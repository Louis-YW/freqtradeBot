Itâ€™s a great idea to just settle down and learn the basics about trading rather than jumping into it. And once you learn a thing or two I would first advise you to use the Demo account provided by some exchanges. This will also guide you and then start off with your won funds but make sure you start with small amounts to minimize the risk of losing huge amount. Here is a thread of books about cryptocurrency basics and trading by Ratimov; big library of bitcoin and blockchain books Here is also a awesome trading tips on GitHub",

It's good to know that a newbie have a good mindset.

If you are Just starting your trading journey, you should first look for a reliable exchange that is favourable to you, although It depends on what exchange is allowed in your country. Then you should decide what kind of trader you want to be. There are traders that buy low and sell high; in some CEX, it's called \"Sport trading,\" and there's also leaverage trading, as CEX calls it \"Future trading.\" Depending on the CEX you are using, if you sign up for a demo account, which allows you to practise little things about volatility, leaverage, and when to enter and exit the market.",

There are a lot of trading books online that you can read and free videos on Youtube that you can watch.Understanding the basic concepts of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, risk management, and different trading strategies would be your first step when you're in trading. Considering that paper trading is the best idea to start learning to trade, this allows you to practice trading without risking real money.Â  It's a great way to test your strategies and understand how the markets work before committing to actual funds.Next, copy trading can be a useful learning tool and provide exposure to different trading strategies.Â  But remember it should not replace the development of your own trading skills and knowledge and by combining copy trading with a commitment to learning, you can enhance your trading abilities over time.Remember, trading is a skill that takes time and practice to develop, just be patient and continue to learn and adapt because learning in trading doesn't have a shortcut.",
