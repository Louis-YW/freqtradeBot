Apparently, the Court in the UK ruled in Craig's favour and so the owner of Bitcoin.org was ordered not to distribute the white paper which was on the website and can also be retried from the Bitcoin core software. So he decided to block the software from being download by the UK residents from his website.So it's not the UK that banned the wallet, and the wallet is not illegal.",

Government will always try to keep things harder that does not give them full control. Crypto is such thing for them. But since we have passed 12 long years, we can expect few more coming decades to continue and ultimately a good ecosystem to develop. Crypto Bitcoin is a currency, a virtual idea to trade goods and services. The market decides it's value unlike a group of people who have given power.Regarding mixers, blacklist addresses?When you are using your money for crime then you will be targeted and justice will be served. But you don't ban your currency just because someone used it for human trafficking.",

By the way, it's the easiest thing to avoid restrictions online, just use a good VPN and your problems are solved.

The problem is that they understand it very well and don't know what to do with it, that's why they sometimes make silly mistakes like the one we discuss here.The UK has taken steps to regulate the crypto industry in recent years and we know what is the reason behind this, it means that companies dealing in cryptocurrencies must comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing [CTF] regulations --and must also obtain a license from the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] to operate legally in the UK.I heard in the news back then about UK justice --one major issue is the problem of access to justice, particularly for those who are economically disadvantaged. So it means people are unable to obtain legal assistance when they need it and I did not surprise by how they treat the cryptocurrency industry.",

The only thing they can do is to regulate usage of bitcoin in centralized services. Well they could obviously regulate bitcoin as much as they want, but they could not enforce those regulations! They could easily ban all websites that are suspected to share bitcoin wallet programs and also they could give you some kind of punishment if you are watched with bitcoin wallets on one of your devices. Also they could ban all bitcoin apps from the appstore. Yes this would not destroy bitcoin, but it would definately stop large scale use of bitcoin, since you would loose a lot of average users.The only question would be if there is any use for the government to do that. Illegal stuff can be done with basically any currency, and it is probably more easy to fight against the actual illegal stuff, then to fight bitcoin. If you fight bitcoin, the illegal stuff will still happen, it will just not be paid with bitcoin. So for that reason I will be sure that all those sanctions on bitcoin will never happen.Quote from: pooya87 on May 07, 2023, 04:42:12 AM(which they already are) to ask for you to provide an ID if you want to pay with bitcoin!That is very interesting and I have not heard of that.

The UK government only wants to benefit from every transaction made in crypto. They tax when someone wants to exit crypto and return to fiat.Just like in my country Indonesia, the application of crypto tax is getting stricter, and every local Crypto Exchange is required to be under government regulation, so that the government can provide rules regarding crypto tax collection on crypto asset buyers and sellers and also on crypto asset miners. The only difference with the UK is that cryptocurrency regulation in Indonesia is only limited to commodities, nothing more than that.",
