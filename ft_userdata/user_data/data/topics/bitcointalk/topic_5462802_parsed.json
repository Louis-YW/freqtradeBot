  "content": "Hi all,Haven't been here for good few years and it's good to be back.I encountered some issues with buying Bitmaps where I get either of the following (using Unisat wallet on MagicEden):1: PSBT not allowed due to missing inputs2: not enough cardinal spending funds (when I have more than enough funds for the bitmap I want to buy)3: after buying two bitmaps, the third is always showing a price which is 2-5 times the listed price. When I check what the total price is made of, there are tens of additional fees of 1200 sats - not sure why. After I wait for the first one or two transactions to be fully completed I can buy at the normal price again but only one or two bitmaps and then the problem comes back.Sometimes I transfer some sats between wallets and it helps with unlocking the above, other times it does not help.I inscribe all bitmaps from 10000 UTXO to 546 to free up available funds each time I buy one to but the issue still persists.Is anyone willing to help me please?",

Review your wallet's transaction history to see if there are any pending or unconfirmed transactions. Clearing these out and allowing them to confirm might help resolve issues.",
