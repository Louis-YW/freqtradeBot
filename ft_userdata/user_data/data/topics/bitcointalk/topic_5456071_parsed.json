  "content": "In the first moment this topic is a little bit strange.To describe \"technical analysis\" in a not-so-complex-way, it is different methods of predicting traders behavior.My question is: Are traders also trading because of Astrology, special dates, storytelling and with celebrating jokes/ribbings?My example ist \"Terra Luna\". This can be a coincident, but also it could be a case for the technical analysts!Terra Luna crashed with the highly loss on a \"special date\": Friday, the 13th. It is a symbol for not having luck. On the same weekend there was a lunar eclipse. More exactly in the time where the \"bouncing of the loss\" was happening. In this time Terra Luna reached it's bottom, but jumped 40 to 100 times up (from the bottom) and after that the market position decreased again to the level now. Also the crash of FTX was on a date of a \"blood moon\" / lunar eclipse with bright red colour on the sky.Is this just a coincidence? And is somebody analysing those special dates and possible connections to astrology/astronomy?Andother indicators in this case - and this sounding more strange - are other related symbols and metaphers, like \"28\", \"going moon\" women rights, and \"birth'\". Also \"codes\" like \"ABC4twentyeight\" can be used here. It was used as a tv psychology in the time of the pandemic.",

I am seeing these videos related to astrology/astronomy and they're basing an event on what they're seeing from it. I haven't seen someone does this related to the market but it's an interesting approach to think of.Quote from: Bialke on June 11, 2023, 06:21:40 PMIs this just a coincidence?

One guessing is, that is could be not a trading purpose, it could be a teaching purpose from a group of whales or institution' executives.--I am coming out of the pro wrestling industry. Here it is known, that manipulation is a thing. (It is ficticious entertainment.) - But I know the same \"pro wrestling\"-tricks in boxing. And here a market manipulation (betting) is done without vocal communication. It meant f.E., you can SEE who is winning by a certain position the boxer is standing on a certain time in a position/the ring.",

Yes, it is. But i have encountered people doing this. Even people i thought highly about before hearing they do that. I am not really sure if they believe in astrology or believe that if enough people trade with astrology, it starts to be self fulfilling prophecy. Anyway, which ever tactic works for you, you should use it. Many see pure traditional TA similar to crystal balls and tea leaves anyway. I wouldn't trade other people's money with astrology though. That seems like irresponsible. More irresponsible then trading others money if possible.",

Until then, I would say they are just another proof that life is strange and reality can indeed surpass fiction in many ways.",

And we could publish the results then. For that we do not need to invest real money. We could write it just down, simulate, on exel sheets.But what if, now it is reversed, and we have to go long on the next solar eclipses? ^^ Solana? ^^Okay, the next solar eclipse is April 8th, 2024. I go with SOL. ^^",

You need to do a really big study to make a solid claim about this, rather than taking a few cases that might be a common coincidence as an example. Your topic could be seen as a topic for humorous speculation, but not something serious. The market does not depend on the events you describe.",

      "body": "While exploring unconventional factors can be interesting, relying solely on astrology or related phenomena for investment decisions may not be a wise approach. Yes. It is interesting indeed to relate and to observe between market events and astrological or astronomical phenomena but I think it is important here to consider the concept of correlation versus causation.Just because two events happen to coincide in time doesn't mean that one causes the other. In the case of Terra Luna and FTX, attributing a crash or recovery solely to a special date or lunar eclipse can be very difficult. applying critical thinking and examining other factors that might affect market movements, such as economic indicators, market sentiment, and regulatory changes are considered important so that there are no misinterpretations.",
