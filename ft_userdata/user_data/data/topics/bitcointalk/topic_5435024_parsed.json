  "content": "Have a good buddy looking for funded Monero stuff, mainly funded Lealana XMR coins.  In particular he’s looking to buy rolls of the lower denominations that were recently sold, but he’s also interested in singles as well as the 5 XMR coins. If you have any for sale please list below or shoot me a PM.  Please do not ask how much I’m willing to pay, as I don’t know quite yet, looking for offers. Thanks !",
