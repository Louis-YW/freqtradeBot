Current market pricesBTC= $30kUSDT =â‚¦1200Basic price analysis considering the currency's weaknesses against each other. From the above market conditions,Â  Bitcoin is the highest gainer in the market and at that, we use Bitcoin as the primary asset and use the bought price of 25k taking into account data of price as at 6 days cycle (1week). Many within the country Nigeria may be blaming the current naira value against the US dollar on bad economy or governance,Â  but then even the US dollar also is depreciating rapidly against other currencies such as bitcoin,Â  so let's take off the mindset of internal economy and make only statistical analysis taking into account all data and components,Â  that make up for the global exchange price movement and how the global currency pricing run as a chain. Taking advantage now to DCA your bitcoin looks to be the best approach right now if you are a short-term bitcoin market speculator using Nigeria's naira as your primary currency,",

Although I created it for BTC/NGN.This thread: Bitcoin price speculation (BTC/NGN)I created the thread for people to understand how naira is highly depreciating, to the extent that when bitcoin decreased in dollar, it may not or may not that decreased in naira, and later appreciate and increased more.I think the two threads is kind of related and I may find it difficult to discuss on this thread as I would have discussed something similar on that thread, but let us see how it things turn out. Likely I will also be active on this thread if possible.",

The thread mentioned is about BTC vs Naira,Â  and is speculative in nature,Â  which is somehow related to this thread but not the same in terms of statistics and forecasts.",

First, I never knew it had even gotten so bad, because the last time I checked, I think it was still around â‚¦950 or â‚¦980 to $1, but after I saw that thread, I went and checked and was shocked to see $1 -Â  â‚¦1150, which today is about â‚¦1166 thereabout, not yet â‚¦1, 200 on binance. I think that DCA Bitcoin with naira is not wise. Let's take, for instance, someone who has about â‚¦20 million and wants to gradually invest it in Bitcoin. Maybe before he even invests up to 20% of that money in Bitcoin, the exchange rate might have even gone higher than what it is, say $1-Â  â‚¦2000 by then. Well, by all means, I think keeping the dollar now is more preferable to the naira or buy Bitcoin once you get the naira.",

Due to the dramatic fall of the Naira, I now put the currency on a watchlist, the worst case is that even during the day you would be surprised after you check the price and go back a few hours later to check again, there is a significant price change, I was even shocked seeing price yesterday at $1/1168 and going back 1 hr later to see the price at $1/1220, per USD, insane right?. Quote from: Wiwo on October 20, 2023, 07:11:13 PMIs no longer news that the current Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ naira value against the United States dollar ðŸ’¸ has skyrocketed to a record high of â‚¦1200, many of those who are not well grounded in Assets management and currency pricing due to a lack of global currency statistical knowledge or information in regards to currency volatilities. The Naira is right now on a free fall as it keeps depreciating against the US dollar, if pull a chart of USD/NGN you would know why the naira is on steady bleeding, coupled with the fact that investors no longer have confidence in Nigeria (FUD) due to the present administration policies and its certificate saga and a lot of other things that also contributed to this.",

But then also have we stop to ask ourselves what are the current global currency strength and how best we can handle the situation on a global scale,Â  because it is not only the naira that is failing against other currencies,Â  if you check the various currencies. Even the US dollars also lost or value to other stronger currencies like Bitcoin and gold in the last week so the global economic scale right now is in a state of shambles which is something that is not only peculiar to NiG naira alone but how best do we benefits of from this situation even though the internal inflation is going high daily.",

If you are not a trader that often convert bitcoin to stable coins and back to bitcoin frequently, and you are receiving your salary or your wage in naira, that is called NCA, because if you want to buy bitcoin, you are buying it with naira. As for now, I will still point to the fact that bitcoin is undervalued and buying it right now is better. If anyone is receiving naira as salary or wages, NCA would be better because it is not too late to join the train of next bull run.",

Moreover, even though the dollar which value have been used to judge the strength and value of the Nigeria naira,Â  it still remains that the dollar is also weak against Bitcoin and that could be seen in the value of Bitcoin against the Dollar and the various all-time high markets that Bitcoin have experienced,Â  this makes it obvious that holding bitcoin is much more valuable in the long term compared to even holding the United States dollars as a Nigeria.",

What I think is that most of you earn in bitcoin and thinking people are not buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in naira or NCAing. As Nigerians adopt cryptocurrencies, do you not know most people are purchasing the coins using naira.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on October 24, 2023, 05:21:25 PMIf one is someone who gets a notification via email or text or any other means that fraudsters could gain access to their personal details, Â the notification of continuous BTC purchase from Naira is sure to be a hot target and where no good safety protocol is observed in keeping safe the wallet, it becomes a big problem for the investor.Scam or hack is not about buying in naira.
