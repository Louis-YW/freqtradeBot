We know that Binance is a trading platform whose priority is to get income, it's that simple.Look at the FTT of Ftx even though the Ftx Company has closed but the Ftt remained in binance, because somehow its volume is still at 3.8M (BUSD) on its platform because it is still useful and beneficial to them.",

We can‚Äôt blame binance for this also, as at least it gave a chance to the coins, but if the coins aren‚Äôt popular enough, then what will Binance do here? It‚Äôs better that these coins are cleaned now. I am sure there aren‚Äôt any people who holding these coins. So yes at last no one really cares about these coins.",

And he deleted that tweet after a while. So Binance has been doing this kind of activity for a long time. I think that Binance is doing the delisting process on the coins now, their trading volume is low, and since the trading volume is low, Binance is not generating revenue from these projects.So they are continuing this delisting process thinking about their own profits rather than thinking about their customers. Binance has no losses here, only traders will face the losses. So traders should be careful before buying any low volume coins/tokens. Such delist fears exist in every exchange.",

They would really be normally delisting out to clear up some space, there's no point on keeping up coins which it doesnt really have any trading volume or liquidity which it is really just normal on having this, as for those token owners then you should be attentive on pulling out those coins before its too late. I dont know if they would still allow users for them to withdraw those coins after on the said due date or time.",

So it rampantly lists most of the projects that come in. But eventually when the time of bear run kicks in. It cleans it's interface by delisting these coins which it listed for some hefty money because eventually the volumes for such projects go away once the dusts of bull run settles.",

Binance is very strategic when it comes to this one, and probably once these tokens got delisted on Binance that can totally affect their whole project.",

There should be some targets and how much volume they should need to have for them to be retained. But if the exchange has already decided to delist them, then they just have to accept it lightly.

They are indeed so picky when it comes to project listing. Of course the number 1 requirement is volume. If its gonna be sustainable in the end. The payment for listing is also expensive but if its Binance who did the listing its probably free. But that are rare cases, unless your project is a defi that have a huge hype capability and the best example of this is the airdrop tokens which are highly valued. See optimism, unsiwap, 1inch, dydx, and other drops.Those got delisted are probably low volume. If it means business then CZ got no choice but to do so.",
