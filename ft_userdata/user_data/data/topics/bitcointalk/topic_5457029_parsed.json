  "content": "What happened::Last week I was given restricted access to housebets.io which means I have access to nothing including withdraws. Here is what I know. Housebets.io had a bug that essentially \"due to the decimal places in BTC not being enough it rounded $0.01 & $0.02 spins to 0\". That is quoted straight from the mod in telegram (porchy). My chat is still up in the housebets/lunafi telegram chat and you can see for yourself, although it has been highly modified and dozens of comments from users were deleted. Because of this bug he says I was gambling risk free and that I should be happy that I withdrew prior to my account being frozen. Just so were clear I was making bets in between $1.00-$2.00 US. That means if I bet $2.00 and I won nothing im only losing $1.98, and because of this bug which I will admit I did notice and think it was peculiar, but in no way did that $0.02 change the outcome of what was going to happen. I know my wife was banned and she had a pretty significant withdraw that she submitted but it never processed. Saw a few others in the telegram that were quickly muted that this had happened too. I'm very upset about this because i had no intentions what so ever to exploit a bug, which quite frankly doesn't even matter because they made the mistake of opening an online casino without some kind of a third party audit or any beta testing.

I do have a transaction tx # from my initial deposit but it doesn't account for the bitcoin that I won, but I will post the tx shortly. Also, just so were clear and there is no misunderstanding, me or my wife didn't exploit any bug. As far as I'm concerned the bug wasn't exploitable unless you could generate hundreds of accounts and run some kind of automated program. I do not have the knowledge or resources to accomplish this. Thank you for bringing the link to my attention, if you happen to know a way that I could post these screen shots of my account that would be greatly appreciated.",

      "body": "From what I observed while wagering bitcoin is after the reels were done spinning is that my balance would go up by $0.01 and sometimes $0.02 cents US. Sometimes I'm wagering $2.00 on one spin. Do I think that the bug played a role on whether I was going to win. No. If my math is correct (being very generous with these numbers) 200 spins × $0.02= $4.00. Wagering a modest $1.00 × 200=$200-$4.00=$196. These were not risk free bets. Its literally 2% of my average wager. Of course I'd like mine and my wife's money back, but mostly I dont like that housebets is advertising decentralization but get to do these shady practices. Housebets.io is the epitome of everything that's wrong with crypto and why retail investors are scared to invest. Thank you for posting the images",

My deposit and bitcoin history is completely irrelevant to this accusation. Your theory is simply that because I win, that I must be exploiting the system? I could not simply get lucky?

Here is an accusation against your casino which op provided some proof and it is factual and what is expected of you to do is to present your own evidence too to counter OP accusations.Did I hear you mentioning bug?  If there was actually a bug then your casino should have actually stopped the games or possibly shot down to avoid losses. It is not the fault of gamblers that your casino experienced such. What if it happens that gamblers made huge losses then would your casino be thinking of making a refund back to he gamblers?How then is it OPs fault that you suffered a bug?",

To OP and to HousebetsIo, can you both confirm this?Further, to HousebetsIo, if you can provide the screenshot of OP's betting history containing this allegation of cheating [suppose it didn't perceived as a breach of privacy and/or both you and OP are comfortable sharing it] it'll work good to completing our puzzle.Nonetheless, if what's above is true, that OP played a game where he'll never lose funds, be it he got a losing or winning bet, then I think the best outcome for both party right now is for HouseBets to return OP's deposit [without the winning] and both of you take separate way. Sounds unfair for the platform, some might argue, but I'll say it's a well deserved path as OP indirectly point out a bug. While those who think it's unfair for the OP because OP gain some \"honest\" amount through his winning, well, OP cheated too, so the middle way is to remove everything altogether",

HousebetsIo, as OP is locked from his account and can't provide any screenshot, you got his permission as stated above to post his betting history and other info you deemed necessary for this case on both of your and his behalf. I urged you to provide this so the community can get a better understanding of the magnitude of the bug brought to you and how much OP \"stole\" from you, as well as providing proof that OP ever [or never] bet $0.01 or $0.02 thus, the risk-free allegation.For OP, my apology, I misunderstood what acroman08 tried to explain to me before. I understand correctly now that whatever outcome you have on your --and your wife's-- bet, you'll still get some \"rakeback\"? In other words, its either you got a winning and doubled your money, or you got your initial bet \"refunded\" by $0.02. So suppose you have $80.00 and wagered $2.00 [in btc], and you lose, your remaining balance will be $78.02 instead of $78.00, while if you win, your balance will be $82.00?Pure curiosity and not necessarily related to the topic above, can we actually bet $0.01-0.02?",
