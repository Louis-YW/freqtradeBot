People who don't like sig or avatars have them already disabled in their profile, and if you see spam posts report them to the moderators.",

Op, you don't have the right to talk about spammy/serious discussions when you're one of the users who needs such advise. Op has no good intentions; he was disappointed that he wasn't accepted into the signatures campaign he applied for, therefore he's now promoting the anti-signature campaign agenda.The earnings from signatures are minimal compared to what the forum gets from the enormous traffic we bring to the site on a regular basis. At the end of the day, it's a business. If you believe that the sig has no beneficial effect on the forum, you are mistaken.",

Signature campaigns keep this forum alive as much as we might not like to admit to it doing that but it creates activity and we are very low on activity atm if people were not getting paid and not earning btc then btc would probably be less used to because a lot of signature campaign participants cannot offer their services for payment in btc but can offer advertising services by posting good posts.",

I fully understand your concerns that with sig campaigns discussions often isn't real, people post just to get paid. It brings many spammers here, but at the same time it gives motivatiin for smartest people here to be more active - you probably noticed that most of best posters here wearing paid signatures. You been here for long, and you should remember that before merit system situation here was much worse, or I would say terrible. Now it's much better, though still far from perfect. And it can't be perfect when people have initiative to get paid for for posting.If you can't stand these paid signatures, you always can look for alternative platforms, but I doubt that you will find something better.Quote from: Macadonian on February 19, 2023, 12:50:08 PMPost in serious discussion where signatures are not displayed? Some people do that because they are annoyed of the signature spam. You could make a local rule where you stop people with advertising signatures from posting in the topic and then report them when they do. Serious discussion is great place, but there isn't much activity. In past there was more action.And there is no need to make local rules, better just make self-moderated topics.
