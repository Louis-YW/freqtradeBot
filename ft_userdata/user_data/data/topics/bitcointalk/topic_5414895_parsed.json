  "content": "ok here me out. im in the country with hydro pegged at 0.11$ perkwh(when i had it locked in) i was paying 2500$ per month on power with 130amp on my home single phase power. i noticed we some how have 3phase power at the road. im thinking of putting 600v in my shop to power tools anyways. so if i was to put a 400amp 600v feed in my shop then step down my voltage to 240v 3ph. and keep using 130amps of 240V would my amp draw (assuming no other loads) still be 2500$ per month or would the theoretical amp draw be less at my 600V side would lets way use use half the amps to make the 240V? if my math/guess lines up. ive seen 3ph 600v 80 amp breakers feed a step down transformer over 130 amp on 208v... what do you guys think. i was looking at doing a grid tie but our electrical grid will not let me tie more the 18k kwh per year... i used that in one month.",

      "body": "Power is volts times amps. 130A 240V makes 31.2KW and at 208V that means 150 amps. From 600V it's 52 amps.Any step-down transformer stage will lose a bit of power. If your 600V three-phase is significantly cheaper than your single phase (probably split phase 240?) you could probably come out ahead. When I ran a small DC, we switched into a \"small industrial\" rate schedule when we crossed 100KW draw on a 3-phase 400V feed and it dropped the average rate from 8.9c to 6.5c per KWh.Since power is billed by KWh, raising your voltage to drop the current won't necessarily save on your bill. It'll depend on if they bill 600V 3ph at a lower rate than residential single phase.",

My knowledge is largely academic.No, you pretty much nailed it. The efficiency of any decent large power transformer ranges from at least 97% and for premium ones is over 99%. That leaves only the rate plan as a variable when it comes to incoming voltage & power.Oh, and of course the 1-time cost of the transformer if you have to pay for it  If you are the one supplying the transformer this is certainly a case for spending more to get a premium high-efficiency one vs the cheapest you can get. Considering that all of the power will be going through it, when pulling say 100kva through it every 1% difference is 1kva saved or lost. Using a 30 day month that = 720kWh/month so that cost adds up fast.",

But this new one humms just as bad when I put 140amps to het 247 lolAre you talking about the transformer off the feeder circuit? Air cooled high voltage transformers are not common.Low voltage like 600 to 230 are almost all air cooled. Humming is normal (cool fact, since the the cycle breaks zero twice the sound you hear is actually 120hz) if it makes a buzz thats laminated core coming apart.",

Let me tell you the oil on the pole was boilling pretty good haha.  When I called the utility I said make sure the boys bring a transformer former the dispatcher said how do you know what's the transformer...  Well the sizzling popping boiling sound inside the canisters telling me that's probably what's going on. The buzzing makes sense. Same with the hum!

[/quote]Utility side would see the same (minuscule difference). Ideally you would have your load balanced across the phases. Bringing in 600 and stepping it down economics depend on many factors. The transformer cost and 3ph 600v panels/load boards and breakers are considerably more expensive. But have a lower copper cost so long runs could be a factor.  If your not getting a break on the kwh cost it may be better to bring it in at 230 and use commodity gear. You can also find 230v switchgear pretty cheap used / craigslist /ebay.",

Switching to 3ph, let's say it steps down to 208V l-l, the equipment will still be asking for 31.2KW which means 150 amps total, 50 amps per leg. At the 600V side the total draw is around 52 amps (plus transformer losses), around 17 amps per leg. The 1.73 rule doesn't make power magically appear, just changes how it gets there.",
