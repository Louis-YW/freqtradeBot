The exchange has halted all deposits and withdrawals and is performing emergency server maintenance in response to the attack, according to an April 10 announcement from GDAC CEO Han Seunghwan.I hope wise people that care for their coins that can yield 10x will have their coins on a noncustodial wallet to avoid the inconveniences or probably total loss of money.Not you key not your coin, there is nothing better than noncustodial wallet. Cold noncustodial wallets are safer.",

More than US$10 million of the losses were in WemixSo, assuming they've stolen all those tokens, seems like close to 20% of the total assets on that exchange were made up of a token that is ranked in the 200+ by market cap and one that lost about 95% of its value to date, nothing shady at all.I thought SK went on a rampage with regulations, scaring most of the exchanges away, how did these guys manage to stay afloat?QuoteWe are requesting cooperation from asset issuers (foundations), exchanges, and DeFi managers to freeze assets.I always find it ironic how people ask for admins of decentralized exchanges to block and freeze coins, in just one split second forgetting all the key points they were bragging about when promoting such solutions.",

Mind you that ETH isn't decentralized, and since Tether can freeze your coins it is a reason to be 'uncomfortable' hodling it and for you to use Bitcoin, the crypto you're pretty sure nobody is freezing from you if you have it in your noncustodial wallet and not in a centralized exchange.Having said that, the problem with this exchange isn't even the assets they were hodling, it is the way they held it with poor security, of course in a hot wallet, even a newbie should know that funds kept in any hot wallet are vulnerable to be stolen at any given time.QuoteAccording to the announcement, the attacker gained control of some of the exchangeâ€™s hot wallets on the morning of April 9 and, at 7 am",

I'm afraid all the major players in the industry cannot aid in the freezing of stolen funds, not all crypto platforms request KYC from their customers, and so many are built for privacy and anonymity purpose, the only way all the major players in the industry can aid in chasing down stolen funds is if there is zero privacy or decentralized oriented platforms or cryptocurrency, and at that stage the industry becomes more like the traditional financial system.",

However, it turned out that these countries have become something that is mostly written about in a bad context, from Mt.Gox to Kwon, not to mention how many times the South Korean CEX Bithumb was hacked (at least 3 times as far as I know).I really don't know what these people are doing there, but either they are absolutely incompetent or they are the biggest experts in internal theft, which they then present as hacking.
