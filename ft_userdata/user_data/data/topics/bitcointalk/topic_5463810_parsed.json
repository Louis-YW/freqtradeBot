If you are a lover of privacy and decentralization your choice will always be bitcoin. Gold can be tracked easily and highly regulated. If you are a risk taker that doesn't give a damn about volatility, Bitcoin will also be your first point of call. But if you like stability and less risk, you should go for gold. Bitcoin also has high liquidity than gold, you can always get buyers compared to gold. Bitcoin can be easily stored and hard to steal compared to gold. Unlike gold Bitcoin can be moved easily.",

If it's a bank, you might worry about a robbery or the centralization of storage. If it's in your flat, someone can notice/you can forget where you put it, there's also a robbery risk, etc. Also, if you need some cash, selling BTC for fiat can be done pretty fast and easily online, but selling gold is again a whole thing.To me, these are the top concerns and why I choose Bitcoin over gold.",

People who lived in ancient times would probably choose gold because their brains were fully indoctrinated by saving money in gold. Now the Revolution has happened since the presence of Bitcoin, people prefer Bitcoin over Gold because of all the conveniences offered by Bitcoin. With Bitcoin you can withdraw money at any time without having to use other parties, Bitcoin can also be used as a very profitable investment asset even though at certain times the price can drop, in general Bitcoin can offer greater profits than gold.",

Ever seen CDR with gold top and green bottom? That's the original Taiyo Yuden formula, it is gold and cyanide. Also CPUs often use gold for the feet, especially the older ones like Pentium etc.Granted, the amount of gold in the CDRs is minuscule and modern CPUs reduced the gold use for cost reasons. You can also enter a jewelry and see some rings, so at least you have seen the thing. It is a bit more interesting to hear the sound of a gold coin IRL. but yeah, gold had become fantasy currency. Sadly, there are people extracting a few grams by deforesting acres of rain forest jungle in South America in countries where the state is a socialist joke and gangs with corrupt military rules the place.I find it seriously ironic that some people dare point at Bitcoin with the environmental FUD when the elephant in the room is right there stomping their noses. Where are their protest against the destruction of jungle that took thousands of years for nature to make? Did you know the north of Africa used to be a jungle just like the Amazon? It is now a desert. Why are those fools not protesting against those govs that allow this with impunity?And yet Bitcoin has a limit, and its \"extraction\" rate is programmed to become rapidly more scarce without any chance of finding \"new veins\" and hurting new ecosystems. If you want to save the Earth, use Bitcoin and drop fiat or precious metals as a means of exchanging wealth.",

That is called diversification and since bitcoin is the most independent market and is not affected by other markets (it is affected by the economy as a whole though) it makes it an excellent \"extra\" option to have.Quote from: Agbe on August 19, 2023, 03:06:29 PMSince when I was born, I have not seen a raw Gold with my naked eyes.A lot of the jewelry that women wear is made of gold, so you may have seen them but haven't paid attention.",

That is what I said, I have seen the material things use by gold but I have not seen the raw material of Gold. And in that case I can't just choose Gold like that. And gold is not easy to assess like bitcoin that one can use $1 to have it through p2p. The way the businessmen make gold to be over high that the poor man can not have access to it raw material is very bad. Though the process of acquiring it from the ground is hard. But bitcoin mining is also hard yet bitcoin is free for everyone to have and use.",

I'm sure people will tell you that they choose bitcoin because bitcoin's proprietary decentralization gives them privacy, financial freedom, and avoidance of government control...lots of benefits that gold can never bring us. But all those features will never be attractive enough if bitcoin is not profitable. So to answer your question, why do I choose bitcoin over gold? It is for profit.",

So, Why Bitcoin Instead of Gold for you?Some people prepare both but I personally prefer Bitcoin instead of gold because of the following reasons.1. Reality: People do sell fake gold while it can not be possible to sell a fake bitcoin because there is nothing like a fake Bitcoin.2. Decentralization: Bitcoin is decentralized and cannot be controlled by single entity like government and others, and the price cannot also be controlled, unlike Gold that government is under its control.3. Accessibility: Bitcoin can be easily accessible anywhere you are with just your private key, while it is not the same as Gold.Furthermore, unlike gold, if you have Bitcoin and travel without concern, if you have it with you, you must be extremely cautious because it can be stolen if people see you with it.",

So, Why Bitcoin Instead of Gold for you?Because Bitcoin is more different from Gold and in terms of profit potential, Bitcoin can be profitable faster on a larger scale than Gold, which tends to have little profit. Bitcoin is chosen by many people who know it well enough for the reason that it is in very limited supply so there is an expectation of having a greater potential for a price increase when there are lots of people who own it and hold it for a long time.While Gold is not like that because Gold is still very much in this world even though those who have it are also not small. But when the gold content is still in the ground and can still be mined by residents in every country, then the price of gold will not increase as sharply as ever happened to Bitcoin. So it's certainly very different and I think you've also picked up on that with some insight from other writers on the internet.",
