      "body": "Yes. UPnP just takes care of mapping ports back 'automatically' you don't need it to run a node. You should still be able to forward port 8333 back manually. Check the manual for your exact router.If you don't forward it will still work, people will just not be able to download blocks from you*-Dave*Not exactly 100% accurate but the point is close enough without a long network discussion.",

There are not any that I know, because this feature extends only from the program (and computer running it) to its router. It doesn' incur any additional bandwidth costs.",

      "body": "The issue with UPnP with equipment provided by your cable / internet company is that they control it.Some security person wakes up Tuesday and decides that they want to disable it on all the consumer equipment because of security issues. Then they do it when they get into work. All of a sudden there are a lot of people trying to figure out why something is not working.Verizon did this a while ago. Yes they sent out many emails and perhaps a real mail but still only gave people about 45 days notice.Which for non tech people who don't know what it is and that they had software that was using it caused a ton of issues.-Dave",
