  "content": "Let's be realistic for once and at least accept the truth that the idea of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will infact out live many of us now with as many more as 29 more halvings from the 32 Bitcoin halving estimated to happen every four years till 2140 when the 21 million BTC is expected to be in maximum supply.  BTC will be fully in existence and all mining activities will have to cease at the time. QuoteThe Bitcoin Halving is when Bitcoin's mining reward is split in half. It takes the blockchain network about four years to open 210,000 more blocks, a standard set by the blockchain's creators to continuously reduce the rate at which the cryptocurrency is introduced.Source: https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769So many FUD and FOMO has been created in order to poke holes at the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin and to scare potential investors from investing in cryptocurrency, but one thing for sure is that all these cases only stands to test the authenticity and credibility of Bitcoin as a decentralized crypto currency with good store value and with potential of giving good profit. I don't need to beat around the bush further because what I want you to know that perhaps you haven't thought to sit and give a careful consideration about, before being bothered about any FUD and FOMO Or the mere thoughts of investing in BTC is this; * how old would you be by 2140?* What's your excuse for not investing in owning Bitcoin now?",

I also think with this reminder of how much time is left, it would be wise to key in and follow a plan to profit from BTC despite any FUD or FOMO. We should do well to start teaching the younger ones or our offsprings or those we care for, about BTC and cryptocurrencies in general so that they can be fully equipped and engaged in it before we get old, tired and die with the knowledge and a wallet of coins.",

You are correct about that. 115 he assumes is just for a new born baby who will start counting from this day because those who might be 30+ or 40+ or 50+ may never even leave to see 2070 talk more of 2140 actually no one is thinking of such. I'm as much as people believe so much in Bitcoin doe not mean every one must leave to see the end of it but many will leave to see it. Just like most people may have prophesied about Bitcoin, but where not able to see the results of the prophesy probably because they are no more, but we are a living witness to it today. So shall we also goin' to prophesy about bitcoin and another generation will see it. Bitcoin is remain forever but man have limited days.",

As much as I agree with your sentiment, I can't help but be an optimist that it's never going to happen and the world ending weapons that superpower nations have are going to create a stalemate that would make it so that we live in an artificial kind of peace. I think that humanity would be able to survive until that time and even though the current politics is so heated, it's probably in our best interest to know that they're all empty threats and the media just wants us to get scared so we can't have meaningful thinking, all paranoia no dialogues. Regards to how old I'm going to be, I'd rather not answer that because it seems to me like it's on the side of personal information and I don't think I'll ever be revealing any of that but I'm definitely a dead man by that time and the only way that I can witness that is if along the way, we got rid of death or old age. I'm curious as to what's going to happen to this forum after those years, that's going to be something worth looking out for if you ask me, rather than the age of the people in the bitcoin space, it's the second most that I'm curious about.To you @oktana, stop the doomscrolling on your social media, get out of the house, ask your friends or loved ones to go out with you, it's better if you enjoy each day and not be worried too much about what you can't control over the other countries, sometimes ignorance is a bliss.",

It's called a \"block subsidy\" for a reason - the issuance of new coins is only meant to help bootstrap the system while the transaction volume is low. As Bitcoin adoption increases, so does demand for (limited) block space and thus so do transaction fees.",

      "body": "It is not necessary to know if one will be alive or dead when the last bitcoin would be halved. The process is already programmed or automated for that time, if I am not mistaken. So therefore, it would definitely take place when the time comes for bitcoin to halve. Currently, we are just a few weeks away from halving, and we are all anticipating a good turnout as a result of the forthcoming halving. So therefore, age should not be a hindrance to being an investor or  a bitcoin hodler. It would even be better because your children would inherit your bitcoin investment if you were no more, and it goes from generation to generation.With the above, I see no reason why one can not have the zeal and passion to get bitcoin for themselves as a long term investment plan. Even though one can not buy bitcoin, one can render services to earn bitcoin in payment for the services rendered. Skills, freelancing, etc. are just some of the things that can earn one bitcoin if they choose to do so.  However, other business ventures can decide to accept bitcoin if they deem it fit to do so.Nevertheless, I believe the fuds and fomos are just a strategy by some group of few individuals who are always at their convenience to cause pannick while manipulating the market in their own favor so  that the faint-hearted would be fast to sell in order not to get trapped in the market  while making huge profit from the market. Recently, this was the case in bitcoin market and as usual, there was a drop in the price of bitcoin, leaving room for them to invest, ie buy more bitcoin to add to their already existing portfolio and allow the price to rise so they could take more profit",
