  "content": "EZZY Game — the simplest Move-to-Earn game powered by BNB Smart ChainEZZY Game Whitelist registration is going on right now. You can get access to early mint, unique NFTs, and other bonuses. Read more on EZZY Game social media channels.EZZY Game is an M2E (Move-to-Earn, \"Move and get rewarded\") game with Web3 elements which allows you to generate and get EZY tokens by walking or jogging in the open air. No need to worry about levels, repairs and other parameters. The game has no complicated and unnecessary GameFi mechanics, and a training session only lasts 10 minutes.1. Select the appropriate Sneakers and click Start.2. Move in the open air for just 10 minutes at a low speed.3. Get EZY tokens on the BNB Smart Chain network and use them as you see fit, for example, to exchange for USDT.Thanks to this approach, training not only has a positive effect on your health but you also get EZY tokens as a reward and become part of the developing M2E world. Most importantly, you can test the app in Free-to-Play mode using the test Sneakers. You can also get NFT Sneakers as a gift by inviting friends and acquaintances as part of the Invite-to-Earn program.To celebrate the launch of EZZY until November 30, you can get free test Sneakers for signing up for the app. These Sneakers are valid for 30 days (instead of 1 day) and will earn you 30 EZY!How does it work?1️⃣ Download the app to your smartphone and register an account. Be sure to allow access to GPS — this is required to track your activity during training. 2️⃣ Then mint NFT Sneakers. Create a Metamask wallet and connect it on the EZZY Game website in your account. Send EZY tokens to your wallet (you can exchange them for USDT on PancakeSwap decentralized exchange) and use them to mint NFT Sneakers. 3️⃣ Then launch the training in the EZZY Game app and start moving at 3–9 km/hour in the fresh air to mine EZY tokens. The app will monitor your activity and automatically credit the award in EZY tokens once a minute using the Proof-of-Walk algorithm and Fitness Mining concept. NFT Sneakers that you need for EZY mining are different in terms of the Mint Amount (how much EZY you need for mining) and Durability (how many days you can use them to mine tokens). NFTs are released in series that differ in Mint Amounts and Durability. The game has five classes of NFT Sneakers + Test Sneakers (that are not NFT) — each class with its own parameters.  For example, the first series of Sneakers will have the following parameters:Test Sneakers (available as a gift):●     Amount to get – 0 EZY.●     Durability — 1 day.●     Mining Power – 1 EZY.Common Sneakers:●     Mint Amount – 2,000 EZY.●     Mining Power – 220 EZY per day.●     Durability — 10 days. Uncommon Sneakers:●     Mint Amount – 6,000 EZY.●     Mining Power – 448 EZY per day.●     Durability — 15 days.  Rare Sneakers:●     Mint Amount – 10,000 EZY.●     Mining Power – 575 EZY per day.●     Durability — 20 days.  Epic Sneakers:●     Mint Amount – 20,000 EZY.●     Mining Power – 944 EZY per day.●     Durability — 25 days. Legendary Sneakers:●     Mint Amount – 40,000 EZY.●     Mining Power – 1,600 EZY per day.●     Durability — 30 days.How is EZZY Game different from other M2E projects?Simple mechanics. No level or parameter maxing out, repairs, Sneakers hydbridization, extra attributes and other excessive and complex GameFi mechanics. Sneakers differ in Durability and Mining Power. In all Sneakers, you need to move at the same speed in the range of 3–9 km/hour — which is the most comfortable speed for humans. You only need to train 10 minutes a day in each pair of NFT Sneakers to get the maximum reward. Tournaments. The EZZY Game has various tournaments that allow you to compete with other users for prizes. Tournaments are as simple as possible while also fair for everyone. Invite-to-Earn Program. You can invite your friends and acquaintances to train with you and get new NFT Sneakers as a gift. Free-to-Play mechanics. Immediately after registration, you will receive test Sneakers as a gift and you can first test the game and only then decide whether to mint NFT Sneakers or not. DAO mechanism. In EZZY Game, active users will be able to participate in the app development. To ensure it, special votes will be held among the holders of NFT Sneakers for all key decisions.Well-developed tokenomics which includes: Complete wear-out of Sneakers. When Durability drops to zero, Sneakers become inactive. This protects the system against an oversupply of EZY tokens on DEX which could happen in the case of accumulation and continuous use of the same NFT Sneakers. Burning. 90% of EZY tokens used for minting NFT Sneakers are burned. This forms a healthy economy that will contribute to the long-term EZZY Game development and prevent oversupply of tokens on DEX. Limited series of NFT Sneakers. Sneakers are generated at certain time intervals in limited series, each of which has a limited number of NFTs. Whoever is the first to mint NFTs gets the Sneakers and the opportunity to walk and get a reward. This is another unique mechanism for healthy tokenomics regulation which accounts for demand from the community and is designed to prevent oversupply of EZY tokens. Thus, EZZY Game combines the best solutions of the M2E market, has its own unique mechanisms and no excessive features that would distract you from the main thing — training and getting EZY tokens for walking or jogging in the fresh air.Road map ☑️ Done!Start of EZZY Game developmentWebsite and White Paper creationApp development and testingRegistration of social media accountsLaunch of marketing activitiesLaunch of EZZY Game appEmission of EZY tokenAdding liquidity to DEXRelease application in Apple, Google, Huawei Q4 2022Launch of the first NFT Sneakers collectionSpecial bot for PancakeSwap (private)Tournaments and contests among players and teamsPlayer rating with leaderboardCapability to select a favorite in the contest Q1–Q4 2023Adding new blockchain networks (Solana and others)Sneakers rental functionalityAdding various sports for trainingTraining in a gym with fitness tracker supportEZY mining for steps functionalityEZY mining for burning calories functionalityIn-game multi-chain walletM2E projects platformM2E projects launchpadLaunch of in-game multi-DEX with cross-chain exchange supportSpecial bot for multi-DEX platform (public)Building EZZY Game multi-chain ecosystemAnd a lot more... Join in!Useful links White Paper on GitBook – https://ezzygame.gitbook.io/whitepaper-en/  EZZY Game website – https://ezzy.gameEZZY Game Academy with useful info – https://helpen.ezzy.game/Download EZZY Game on AppStore – https://apps.apple.com/app/ezzy-game/id6443774363Download EZZY Game on Play Market –  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nakamoto.ezzyDownload EZZY Game on App Gallery – https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C107188435Download APK – https://ezzy.game/app-release.apkTelegram – https://t.me/ezzy_game_official_news_enTelegram chat – https://t.me/ezzy_game_official_en  Medium – https://medium.com/@ezzy_game  Twitter – https://twitter.com/ezzy_game    Discord – https://discord.gg/yRA73hbt",

      "body": "What makes EZZY Game uniqueEzzy Game unique features: How is the game different from other M2E?When creating the app, our main goal was to combine the best solutions of M2E projects in one app while also removing all excessive features that could complicate the game and distract players from the main thing — getting rewards for walking and running. Let's look at the key unique differences between our game and other M2E projects:Gameplay:- No level or parameter maxing out, repairs, Sneakers hybridization, extra attributes and other excessive and complex mechanics. - In all Sneakers, you need to move at the same speed in the range of 3–9 km/hour — which is the most comfortable speed for humans.  - No need to run a marathon and adjust to the type of Sneakers. - You only need to train 10 minutes a day in each pair of NFT Sneakers to get the maximum reward.Gifts to users:- Immediately after registration, you will receive test Sneakers as a gift and you can first test the game and only then decide whether to mint NFT Sneakers or not.- In our game you can invite your friends and acquaintances to train with you and get new NFT Sneakers as a gift.Convenience:- Sneakers differ in Durability (how many days they can be used for training) and Mining Power (how many tokens they generate a day). No more complicated parameters or math.- From the very start, you know the Durability of your Sneakers, and you can easily predict how many EZY tokens you can get for training before the Sneakers become inactive.Tokenomics:- Sneakers are not infinite and protect tokenomics When Durability drops to zero, Sneakers become inactive. This protects the system against an oversupply of tokens  which could happen in the case of accumulation and continuous use of the same Sneakers.- 90% of EZY tokens used for minting NFT Sneakers are burned. This forms a healthy economy that will contribute to the long-term  development and prevent oversupply of tokens.- Sneakers are generated at certain time intervals in limited series, each of which has a limited number. Whoever is the first to mint — gets the Sneakers and the opportunity to walk and get a reward. This is another unique mechanism for healthy tokenomics regulation which accounts for demand from the community and is designed to prevent oversupply of tokens.Moreover, as the application grows, we will add other interesting and unique mechanics: from tournaments to new types of training sessions. With all the updates, we will always focus on simplicity and ease of use as key features of the EZZY game. Even now you can take advantage of the game by walking in test Sneakers and prepare for the mint which is scheduled for November 23-25.",

      "body": "A closed mint of Uncommon Sneakers has just started on our website. If you are on Level 1 Whitelist, you can mint Sneakers from the first unique collection right now. View whitelisted users here. We remind that everyone included in Level 2 Whitelist automatically received spots in Level 1. The closed mint will last 1 hour — until 15:00 UTC+0. Important: you need to have EZY tokens on your in-game wallet for the mint. An hour after the closed mint, it will be followed by an open mint which will make minting Sneakers available for all users, even not whitelisted ones. The number of the first series Sneakers is limited. Each user can mint only 3 pairs of Uncommon Sneakers.However, all Sneakers in the first collection will have increased Mining Power and decreased Durability which will allow the users to get their mint amount back faster and get additional EZY tokens. Parameters of Uncommon Sneakers in the first series:Mint Amount: 3,000 EZY.Durability: 5 days.Mining Power: 625,5 EZY.   Amount in collection: 25.Max mint amount for 1 address: up to 3.As a reminder, the mint of Rare Sneakers from the first collection will take place tomorrow and will work the same way (at first it will be available for one hour for Level 2 Whitelisted users, then followed by an open mint for everyone).Go to EZZY Game website to mint Sneakers: https://ezzy.gameUsers included in Level 1 Whitelist: https://t.me/ezzy_game_official_news_en/64Instructions on how to mint Sneakers on PC: https://helpen.ezzy.game/everything-about-ezzy-game/how-to-mint-nft-sneakers-at-the-factory-on-pcInstructions on how to mint Sneakers on smartphones: https://helpen.ezzy.game/everything-about-ezzy-game/how-to-mint-nft-sneakers-at-the-factory-on-mobileInstructions on USDT/EZY swap:How to swap USDT to EZY through PancakeSwap on PC - https://helpen.ezzy.game/token-exchange-deposit-and-withdrawal/how-to-swap-usdt-to-ezy-through-pancakeswap-on-pcHow to swap USDT to EZY through PancakeSwap on mobile - https://helpen.ezzy.game/token-exchange-deposit-and-withdrawal/how-to-swap-usdt-to-ezy-on-pancakeswap-on-mobileHow to swap USDT to EZY directly in MetaMask on PC - https://helpen.ezzy.game/token-exchange-deposit-and-withdrawal/how-to-swap-usdt-to-ezy-directly-in-metamask-on-pcHow to swap USDT to EZY directly in MetaMask on mobile - https://helpen.ezzy.game/token-exchange-deposit-and-withdrawal/how-to-exchange-usdt-for-ezy-directly-in-the-metamask-mobile-app",

      "body": "How do Durability and Energy work?Important news: we have modified the Durability and Energy system to make it more universal.- Durability is a parameter that shows you how many days you can walk in specific Sneakers and get EZY tokens. If Durability drops to 0, the Sneakers become inactive and you cannot train in them. All non-spent Energy gets burnt.- 1 Energy equals 10 minutes of active walking when tokens are generated. 1 Energy is awarded every day for each pair of active Sneakers. If you don't train on this day for any reason, Energy is transferred to another day. Maximum Energy you can accumulate for a single pair of Sneakers is 10. After this, Energy stops accumulating and is burnt.Starting today, at precisely 00:00 UTC+0, 1 durability will be written off and 1 energy will be awarded. This will happen with each pair of Sneakers for all users with no exceptions.Example 1:On December 10, at 11:30 pm UTC+0, the user mints Common Sneakers. The Sneakers have a 3-day Durability. On December 13, at 00:00, they will become inactive. In other words, on December 12, after 11:59 pm, you cannot train in these Sneakers any more and all non-spent Energy is burnt.Example 2:On December 11, the user mints Legendary Sneakers. They have 20-day Durability. The user trains for 3 days, then leaves for the mountains for 9 days and doesn't use the app. Once the user returns, he has 9 Energy accumulated over these days and 1 Energy for the new day, that is 10 Energy in total. Now the user needs to spend at least 1 Energy since Energy is transferred to the next day, but maximum Energy for 1 pair of Sneakers is 10. If the user has non-spent Energy before December 31, 00:00 UTC+0, all this Energy is burnt since the Sneakers become inactive and the user won't be able to train in them. We hope that the new system will be easier and more understandable for all our users. We recommend that you choose Sneakers of required Durability so that Energy does not get burnt and you can get maximum EZY tokens. Just to remind you, the mint of Epic Sneakers has already started, and the mint of Legendary Sneakers is due tomorrow. So we suggest that you lose no time while Sneakers are still available.",

      "body": "⚡️ Ezzy Game vs Walken!Walken is somewhat similar to Stepn and Ezzy Game (you also need to walk in the fresh air), but it also uses its own unique mechanics. Thus, in this project, you need to max out your CAThlete using crystals and in-game tokens earned while walking, in order to then compete in tournaments and win to receive a reward. So, let's compare Walken and Ezzy Game. Let's go!- Free-to-play mode. In Walken, just like in Ezzy Game, you can start without having to mint NFT. Immediately after registration, you are given a free CAThlete that you will need to max out. However, in Walken, in order to be able to withdraw tokens, you need to reach level 6. It takes 3–6 months if you do not contribute your own cryptocurrencies or tokens into the game. In Ezzy Game, it's a lot simpler — you get the test Sneakers as a gift and generate 1 EZY token per day for training. You can immediately withdraw them to an external wallet and exchange for USDT or save up in anticipation of an exchange rate increase. The test Sneakers expire in one month and can earn 30 EZY over this period. Of course, you can mint NFT Sneakers in Ezzy Game and get a lot more for training, if you want. - Easy start. It's not too difficult to start playing in Walken — register, get a CAThlete, then walk outside, get in-game tokens and then use them to max out your CAThlete. You also need to click the tournament button a few times a day. However, as the game develops, it becomes much more complicated — you now need to align with the energy restoration time, buy accessories and boosters, participate in events, and so on. In Ezzy Game, simplicity is one of the key advantages. The key mechanics of getting a reward is always the same and does not become more complicated — the user mints NFT Sneakers, walks in them outside, gets EZY tokens as a reward, then mints new NFT Sneakers and so on and so forth.  - Reward. This is the main point for many users who are on the lookout for promising M2E projects. In Walken, the reward is small and unpredictable. In other words, when you buy some in-game NFTs, you do not know when you can get back the amount spent — according to many participants, it takes quite a long time. The problem is that when competing in tournaments, you always waste energy; however, you will not necessarily win — you could also lose and get nothing. The situation with the Solana cryptocurrency also has an impact as it is used to mint the loot boxes and trade in almost all CAThletes and accessories on the Walken marketplace. With the collapse of FTX/Alameda, the SOL coin has also been affected adversely. In Ezzy Game, all users know the remuneration at the time of the NFT Sneakers mint. Each user immediately sees how many EZY tokens they need to mint NFT Sneakers and how many tokens they will receive as a reward for walking. Thus, you will get back the tokens spent on Common EZY Sneakers in just a few days. - Choose when to play. In Walken, energy is restored every two hours, and the maximum limit is reached after three restorations. In other words, you have to play in tournaments every six hours if you want to get the maximum reward. In Ezzy Game, everything is much simpler — you can use energy whenever you want. Energy is restored once a day at midnight and, moreover, accumulates for 10 days. If you are sick or the weather is bad, you can postpone your training by a couple of days and still get the maximum and predictable reward. - Gameplay quality. Although Walken relies on GameFi mechanics, many players complain that it gets boring over time: every day, you have to do the same thing several times — enter the game, click tournaments and exit. You don't need to do anything in the tournaments. You just click the fight button, the game picks up an opponent with characteristics similar to your CAThlete — and in a couple of seconds the winner is announced. Whoever has the best stats wins. It's boring, and the reward for winning is also small. Moreover, in order for your steps to play a role in Walken tournaments, you need to walk a lot (20,000–30,000 steps or even more). Otherwise, your steps will be of no help in the tournament. That's right, you don't even need to walk outside or you can walk a little and still take part in tournaments — in this case, you'll just lose more often. In Ezzy Game, you only need to walk for 10 minutes in some NFT Sneakers to get a reward — this encourages you to go outside and lead an active and healthy lifestyle, but it does not make you overexert yourself. In other words, it's the golden mean. The reward is also a lot more attractive. If you want more, you can always mint a few pairs of NFT Sneakers.More Sneakers = longer trainings = bigger reward.Walken is undoubtedly an interesting project with cool features, but if you are looking for a simple M2E solution with a predictable and big reward, Ezzy Game is more suitable for you. You can see for yourself.App: https://onelink.to/8p6zv9Website for minting the Sneakers: https://ezzy.game/",

      "body": "EZZY vs Step AppUnlike Walken, yet being similar to STEPN but having some unique mechanics integrated, Step App is an exact copy of STEPN, but with some minor changes, such as staking and competitions. However, a lot of users don’t consider this copy successful and complain about its terrible design.The project was in closed beta test stage for a long time and only users with the promo code had access to it. Now, it has been undergoing open beta testing. After having been released, the app suffered from some bugs (for instance, users complained that it didn’t want to open), while the biggest drawback became a dramatic drop of FITFI price. But first things first.So, why is EZZY Game better? Let’s take it point by point:1. Simplicity. Since Step App is an identical version of STEPN, it has adopted its complicated GameFi mechanics that will be a challenge not only for a beginner in the crypto industry. Level max-outs, gems, mint, different speed modes for different types for Sneakers, loot boxes, stats, mandatory repair of Sneakers or drop in rewards, etc. — a user has to figure out all these mechanics from the very first moment. There’s more. Step App team decided to grow their own crypto ecosystem and created their own blockchain, decentralized exchange and other tools. Even though it must be considered as an advantage, in fact, it increases the complexity of the game several fold — users have to transfer tokens from one network to another using bridges.EZZY Game, as you might know, is a lot easier-to-use. The process of choosing Sneakers is very simple — you just need to decide on how much EZY you want to spend on minting new NFTs. There is absolutely no complexity — open the app, start the training and get rewarded. It works without stats, loot boxes, bridges, Sneakers repairs and other difficulties. When Sneakers’ Durability drops to 0, you can simply “throw the Sneakers away” and take a new pair.2. Transparency. As is the case with STEPEN, it isn’t clear what reward a user gets for the training as it depends on a number of parameters (such as walking speed, the class and type of Sneakers, and their stats). Moreover, you never know how long it will take you to get back the tokens spent on minting Sneakers and the amount of rewards you will receive per day.In EZZY Game, you know everything in advance. NFT Sneakers have three parameters:A) Mint Amount is the amount of EZY tokens you need to mint NFT Sneakers.B) Mining Power is how many EZY tokens NFT Sneakers generate in a day.C) Durability shows how many days your NFT Sneakers are active.Based on this data, you can easily calculate how long it will take you to get back the EZY you spent and how much you will earn.It’s worth noting that EZZY Game offers its users much higher rewards than Step App. Judging by the reviews, it takes users about 4 months to recoup the tokens spent on NFT Sneakers. In EZZY Game it usually takes 7–10 days. Moreover, Step App users complain about a dramatic drop in the price the FITFI token, which didn’t grow even after the app had been officially released. Users, who paid 0.3–0.7 USDT for a token, have lost a lot in USDT equivalent. The FITFI price plunged from 0.7 USDT to 0.02 USDT (by more than 20 times).3. Tokenomics of the project. Since Step App is a clone of STEPN, its tokenomics must be based on minting. Users are rewarded with KCAL tokens which they use to mint new Sneakers. However, based on STEPN’s experience, we can say that this model is unreliable. If the flow of new users, who will buy NFT Sneakers or in-game tokens, slows down, the value of all in-game items, as well as rewards for training reduce. Users might end up with earning less than they deposit.In EZZY Game, as we told you in the article about STEPN, tokenomics is better-balanced. In theory, it will be able to cope with different emergencies. If you have read the article about STEPN, you must know that we have provided EZY token with several protection mechanisms:Burning mechanism — 90% of EZY tokens users use to mint Sneakers is irretrievably destroyed. This is done to protect the project against the oversupply of the EZY tokens. The remaining 10% is spent on the game development.NFT limitations — Sneakers are produced in series in limited quantities so as not to provoke excessive demand/pressure on EZY and sharp withdrawal of tokens from the liquidity pool.Regular change in the EZY Mint Amount required for minting Sneakers. In each new series the amount is adjusted depending on the ratio of EZY and USDT in the liquidity pool on PancakeSwap so that all users of the game (old and new) could be on equal terms and didn’t act against the game’s tokenomics.Durability — after a while, Sneakers wear out and become inactive which prevents cumulative pressure on tokenomics. No one can endlessly “milk” their old Sneakers in EZZY, thus killing the game’s tokenomics.Zero influence from the “whales” — to get maximum reward, a user needs to train 10 minutes a day in each pair of Sneakers so even if the user wants to mint a lot of NFT, they will not be physically able to train 1,000 hours a day.No “invertor wish list”. We did not raise funds to launch the app and we have no second token whose growth we have to stimulate.Liquidity support via commissions collected for minting Sneakers.We are also planning to launch a decentralized bot that runs trading operations on PancakeSwap for maximum stability of the EZY token.All the mechanics described above are designed to stimulate stable and sustainable demand for EZY and neutralize the likelihood of excessive instability on DEX. In the long term, they can stimulate a gradual rise in demand over supply which can also have a positive effect on tokenomics.So, let’s summarize. The key difference between EZZY and Step App tokenomics is that we offer protection against an excessive supply of Sneakers and against endless addition of EZY tokens into the order book. Our entire tokenomics is tied to collections with a limited number of Sneakers with finite Durability. Based on our tokenomics, even if users massively start to get rid of EZY tokens, at some point they will run out of them, and Sneakers will wear out. To continue receiving rewards for walking, users will need to buy EZY again and mint Sneakers in the new collections. Thus, EZZY tokenomics is balanced out for the long term.We are sure that now you are aware of the advantages EZZY Game has over other M2E projects. Stay with us, walk in NFT Sneakers and get rewarded.EZZY Game website: https://ezzy.gameMint TAE Sneakers here: https://ezzy.game/sneakers-factory",

      "body": "EZZY Game vs AMAZYLike Step App, which we talked about earlier, Calo Run, and some other M2E projects, AMAZY is an exact copy of STEPN. It uses the same mechanics (energy, two tokens, upgrading sneakers with in-game items, breeding sneakers, etc).AMAZY’s tokenomics works like that of STEPN — it’s based on breeding sneakers and depends on new users:- Old users need to buy in-game tokens to breed sneakers and maintain the token rate on DEX;- New users buy sneakers, thus maintaining the price.As long as there are new users coming in, the amount of rewards will be high. However, when the crisis hit the M2E sector, AMAZY failed to prove to be a stable project. Prices for in-game items dropped, which resulted in a great reduction in training rewards. For that reason, users, who invested heavily in the game, still cannot return the invested amount, let alone earn a profit.EZZY Game is based on a better-developed tokenomics with burning mechanism and focus on preventing extreme price swings on DEX. The tokenomics is based on:- Burning mechanism — 90% of EZY tokens users use to mint Sneakers is irretrievably destroyed. This is done to protect the project against the oversupply of the EZY tokens. The remaining 10% is spent on the game development.- NFT limitations — Sneakers are produced in series in limited quantities so as not to provoke excessive demand/pressure on EZY and sharp withdrawal of tokens from the liquidity pool.- Regular change in the EZY Mint Amount required for minting Sneakers. In each new series the amount is adjusted depending on the ratio of EZY and USDT in the liquidity pool on PancakeSwap so that all users of the game (old and new) could be on equal terms and didn’t act against the game’s tokenomics.- Durability — after a while, Sneakers wear out and become inactive which prevents cumulative pressure on tokenomics.

In the long term, they can stimulate a gradual rise in demand over supply which can also have a positive effect on tokenomics.On the negative side, not only has AMAZY copied STEPN, but it uses aggressive marketing. The developers promoted their project with the help of a great number of bloggers and influencers. AMAZY’s developers officially say, “Our influencers of a total audience exceeding 700 million people are the core of our advertising campaign.” Is that really an advantage? We doubt it. AMAZY used aggressive marketing to grab users’ attention, however, today we see the prices for in-game items, rewards for training and community’s involvement dropping.Moreover, their resources have already been exhausted — they won’t find a new audience as everyone has already promoted their project.But it’s not the case with EZZY Game. We don’t chase the hype and wide publicity, this is why we haven’t promoted the project on a massive scale yet. Our main task is to create a product that will last — it will remain sustainable and usable for years. We have a small community of pioneers who are now enjoying the best perks and will enjoy them in the future. We have already started and will make efforts to make as many people as possible aware of our application. But what we really need is a smooth growth, not only active one.So, unlike other M2E applications that have already triumphed and collapsed, we are just beginning our path.EZZY Game website: https://ezzy.gameMint NFT Sneakers here: https://ezzy.game/sneakers-factory",
