Tron is just a hype blockchain same with Terra Blockchain that recently collapsed. You should choose blockchain that is not centralized if you want your stablecoin to become successful.",

They invest and if coin siccessful they get fiat airdrop...not bad right?The idea itself can sound amazing but I don't think it's that simple. Have you noticed before that to distribute \"fiat\" (based on the nationality of the participant) it is necessary to fill in an AML (Anti money laundering) questionnaire? Plus any investor before putting money on it want receive all kind of explanations and clarification about the real nature of this kind of investment....Take a look at the main stable coins that mimic FIAT currencies (Tethere USDc XDAI etc)Behind there are financial \"giants\" and real companies that deal with all legal and economic aspects. it is not enough to simply create a decentralized database where you say that a value is also present in the real world, but you need a whole legal mechanism behind this value ...",

You are talking about a stablecoin. I think on dex thats fine cause they really not into identity to someone creatinf any coin.If youll make a stabelcoin you should have liquidity and reserved backed for that stablecoin. Its not simple as you think and even harder when trying to list it on centralized exchange like binance. There will be tons of verification and audit on hows your project doing and its technical aspects and most especially its security.",

There are so many higher and stable marketcap coins out there, why would they use your stablecoin? I don't think this is a smart idea at all.

Im not really sure if it's also you who creates none sense threads here sometimes, unless maybe if you are serious this time and decided to change your life for the better.Creating a stablecoin might be a good business right now to venture due to how volatile the cryptos are acting lately but the only problem is that we already have lots of stable coins in this market and when someone needs a stable coins, they will always pick those who are on top and are famous already. Why not create a normal crypto instead? You will have a better chance on this one.",
