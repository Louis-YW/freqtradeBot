  "content": "[This thread credit goes to TheBeardedBaby for making the list of merit applications compilation from his old thread]So after 3 years and some months of the last thread about the list of merit source applications, I think it's time to get Theymos attention again to do a little reconfiguration to the active members that have not given up on becoming merit source since they submitted their applications. After going through TheBeardedBaby thread, there are users that have remained active and haven't given up, some are inactive for a while, some were last active a year ago and even more, and some reputation has washed down the drain due to one or two things they did to have violated rules of the forum with evidence on their trusted feedback. I will leave that for Theymos to decide their judgment but I believe a good leadership need a clean résumé even if they are active.What is this thread all about? There has been some thread bumping from the old and new applications as a merit source and I think compiling the list of the old pending threads and new pending threads for Theymos to review again in a single thread will fasten the process instead of searching up for the threads, which in the process, some application may be skipped or forgotten. However, I did a little itemization and prioritized user applications that are still active that can convince Theymos of been worthy of the Job but distrust users are starred with *In the list of the applications, I sort it out with name(user), local board location, Application, and date. This way, where applications are coming from and zoning merit source jobs to users will be visible to everyone and Theymos to decide who to pick and who to discard is left to him. I hope he sees it. The reason why included their respective local board was that there are some applications that were specific to be a local board merit source, it will be easier to review the applications if they know their respective local boards, and if they needed more sources or not.User|Applications|Local board|Date|crwth|Application| Pilipinas|3/Jul/18|coinlocket$|Application| Italian|10/Mar/19|TheWolf666|Application| French|20/Jul/19|Kalemder*|Application| Turkish| 19/Sep/19|Wolwoo**|Application| Turkish|30/Nov/19|TheBeardedBaby |Application| Bulgarian| 03/Jan/20|AakZaki|Application| Indonesian|10/Mar/20 |trendcoin|Application| Turkish|31/May/20|Lachrymose|Application| Turkish|06/June/20|BitcoinDream|Application| Bengali|20/Sep/20|irfan_pak10|Application| Pakistan|06/Nov/20|I'm not sure if all the previous application has been reviewed by Theymos, the new applications after the previous ones will be listed differently below.

I am wondering about the perseverance of these applicants, I mean looking from another perspective, imagine you offer your dedication and help for free to someone a few times, after that what is the reason to keep insisting on helping when the other guy doesn't need the help right now?Ok, when I say suspicious, because it's obvious this is for self benefit and not helping the community, come on which one of the factories stopped working, is there shortage of food supply? babies have no milk powder? And that's all because we have less merits going around?Applicant's reasons as to why they need to be a source is not convincing enough,  think about it what value will they add to the community as a whole? Will there be no contribution if they get no merits?Show us a few examples of some of the best contributors with not enough received merits, which will allow other sources to send some merits to them and there will be no need for new sources.If you really want to help, report deserving posts to merit sources, that is the definition of help with no expectation in return.",

Yes, I agree with you on this point. There are a lot of good topics that did not get any merit, but the sources of merit cannot see all the good topics in the forum, so it would be good to make a list of these good topics for the sources of merit to see and get merit if they are deserved.Merit sources are also making such attempts there at least I know @hugeblack created a thread to give merit to topics on local boards that didn't get merit:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465195.0This is a good initiative and I believe that other sources of merit do not skimp on merit.",

Another problem is that themos usually doesn't approve merit applications individualy, but he tends to do in bulk when he does merit readjusting which makes it even a longer wait.",
