HG has assembled a team of 11 former employees from Revolut, Spotify and the Coinbase exchange to create an innovative cryptocurrency wallet. the team has announced that the wallet will launch as early as q1/2024. will Zeal be good enough to compete with other cryptocurrency wallets currently on the market?the main goal of the Zeal platform is to solve problems such as lack of security, poor user experience and transaction fees. the project aims to be a digital cryptocurrency wallet with advanced security controls and free bank transfers. according to the press release, Zeal wants to set new standards in the wallet user experience when managing cryptocurrencies, using web3 applications and decentralized finance (dapps).https://www.theblock.co/post/263969/former-revolut-employees-launch-new-crypto-wallet-called-zeal",

The problem with such wallets is that they will focus on accepting more tokens and adding traditional verification methods such as 2FA, which will be very bad for privacy and more likely to be hacked.",

Here’s how to connect to websites/applications using ZealQuoted from https://docs.zeal.app/getting-started-with-zeal/connecting-to-websitesAccording to what I read there, it seems like Zeal is trying to outshine MetaMask and snatch its users. It's highly likely they're targeting the altcoin user market, as that's what both MetaMask and TrustWallet have been doing. Even though this wallet can store BTC, I'm a bit skeptical about BTC users keeping their assets here.",

HG has assembled a team of 11 former employees from Revolut, Spotify and the Coinbase exchange to create an innovative cryptocurrency wallet.This is already bullshit. Former employees of Revolut, Spotify and Coinbase (three of them centralized platforms that aim to become the central power of their industries) are never going to create a honest, decentralized wallet that will be the competitor of Electrum and Sparrw.Quote from: cygan on November 21, 2023, 06:48:23 PMthe main goal of the Zeal platform is to solve problems such as lack of security, poor user experience and transaction fees. the project aims to be a digital cryptocurrency wallet with advanced security controls and free bank transfers. according to the press release, Zeal wants to set new standards in the wallet user experience when managing cryptocurrencies, using web3 applications and decentralized finance (dapps).I read this part right now, guess what? The above is truth. They are going to create competitor of blockchain.com wallet but no one should use them because digital bitcoin wallets are not secure and destroy the core principles of bitcoin. There is no difference between using a centralized exchange and digital bitcoin wallet, they both have the ownership of your coins. It's better to use Electrum and Sparrow, both tried and tested multiple times, they are the best choice right now next to Hardware wallets. If I learnt anything from 2016, it's that 3rd party platforms should never be used if someone prioritizes privacy and security of their assets.",

From what they said, their new offer is. basically a phishing/scam list check if I get it correcly. Not really groundbreaking since most of them are available in many apps today. Other than probably a better blocking list, or the so-called advanced AI-powered list, I don't see how it will be different compared to what we have today. Even if they offer something new, it will likely be a closed source as mentioned above. CMIIW.",

This would only mean the user will have no keys to this wallet. Not the ideal type.
