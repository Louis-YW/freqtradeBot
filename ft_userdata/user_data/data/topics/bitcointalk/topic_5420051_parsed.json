You are correct; the image of gambling is very negative to others, as if you are a criminal, and they believe you have a lot of debt and will do anything to play in a casino. This is the first impression of gambling, but it isn't true. I think this is just some people that are really addicted to it, but most of the gamblers are just playing for fun or to earn money, but I think they can control themselves now. The possibility of quitting gambling if you've already won big is too low because you'll want to experience that feeling again; when you lose, I think the gambler just needs to rest, and later on, after a few months or years, he'll end up getting back to the casino to gamble.",

If you're good at sportsbooks and have a lot of wins, don't you think it's better to stick to that one rather than engaging in multiple games and sportsbooks that may leave you with a huge slip of losses? Take a break and remember that it's all for fun and little motivation for money if you want to have inner peace with gambling.",

I know he is having a bad day, no matter how comfortable he is, 2000 dollars it's a big money to lose within a twinkle of an eye.As he said that it was not his savings, is the money that he could make within seven working days that is good for him. Every gamboler need to know their limits and also know what they are able to lose, if you check through  his winnings you understand that he has made more wins than losses",

It is good to avoid greed and addiction while we gamble, this is responsible enough to give us the needed psychology. We should affirm that it is a game of chance and luck, we should be balanced in our mental faculties. I see no reason why one should not take a break after a successful winning that is more than $1. This should be done with senses (mental strength), not with vigour (physical strength).",

It can even be the beginning of problem as someone thinks gambling is easy. But factually, gambling is not easy, it is a means someone can lose money than gain. If you win big, you can celebrate, no one cares, but what matters most is for you to be wise in life. Some celebrations are not just worth it. I could think like this probably because I have not not won so big before, but I prefer it that way as I do not risk big while gambling.Quote from: Fishy001 on November 09, 2022, 06:15:58 AMWhen you play witj self doubts and when you are pessimsitic you more likely to lose.

In life, there are sometimes it is better to think twice, because thinking ones and going for it with optimism and overconfidence can lead to losses. A good example is gambling.But you are right that people should not gamble frequently, not only roulette but gambling generally. It is also true that gamblers should not depend on gambling for income, such people have bad mindset and highly likely to lose is an understatement because such people always do lose.",

I agree that you can make money from any gambling games, but after that, you should leave it at once and not play any games. It helps you reduce the tension and emotion after playing some rounds and can help you win money and enjoy the money. You can come back again a few days later, which will also refresh your mind.",
