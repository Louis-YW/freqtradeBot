  "content": "In our today world, where technology has taken over everywhere, people in marketing fields are benefiting from the digital world: Marketers before had no means of marketing there goods and sales were limited, demand got limited. But now in a digital world marketers now have the opportunity to market there goods around the globe, with the help of advertisement using the television, radio programmes, newspaper, magazines,billboards.     And with the emergence of block chain technology different platforms are created to enhance the digital marketing. With the help of the modern television we now see different kinds of product being marketed online. With the help of modern technologies today online vendors deliver nation wide. Back in the analog era marketers find it very difficult to market there goods. Marketers made used of the outdoor advertising, where marketers walk from door to door advertising their goods and product but the technology world has made things easy for marketers. Tokinomo interactive robots: the marketing robot, brands now use robot to advertise their products. The purpose of this tokinomo robot is to communicate with customers, informing customers about the product, instead of the competitor doing the talking just let tokinimo do the talking.http://sharevideo1.com/v/WlAxakEtSDZBa28=?t=ytb&f=co  the digital world has made things easy for customers also. I believe there was no money transfer at that time, people made use of their legs (walking) for payment after buying a product. But now customers use digital forms of payment such as flutterwaves, paypal, Bitcoin for international payment. Now the world have a digital currency which can be transfer globally (bitcoin)   Finally: with the new technology, you pay goods on delivery, and the company carrier will deliver to you on your door step. With the pay on delivery, the scamming rate will reduce, because people have been scammed by the fake sellers online in the payment before delivery system. [/list]",

And the most recent ones for technology advertisement are the Robot, Social Media marketplaces and this forum. But one thing I discovered in Social Media and this forum is that, Social Media are not advertising for gambling site but they allow to advertise food products and wears. And this forum advertise casinos, mixers and I have not seen any food and clothes companies came here to advertise their goods. As others has said in other threads, technology has helped people to sell their goods very fast and making customers to get things in an easy way..",

      "body": "In terms of marketing in this digital era, although there are many applications specifically for shopping, in terms of marketing a product or business, social media seems to be a quite promising place to use as a marketing tool compared to TV stations. At this time, almost the entire population has shifted from initially only watching TV as a means of information and entertainment, but it seems that now people have switched to social media. And when I visited my neighbor's or friend's house, I saw that it seemed like their TV was useless because it was never turned on and was only used as a display because almost every family member was focused on their respective cellphones. Social media users are currently continuing to increase and everyone is joining in. in social media both young and old, rich and poor and both, government and society.It's just that when we do marketing in the form of advertisements on social media, as much as possible and as creative as possible we have to create advertisements that are interesting enough to watch or look at.",

But, if I've got some balance on my e-wallets or bank, that's how I pay them because it's hassle when the delivery guy comes to my house and I'm out, they'll not leave the parcel or goods because it is unpaid. Unlike if I pay in advance, they'll just leave it and take a picture and will be sent to the app and that's more convenient for both of us. And just like the traditional marketing, internet marketing or digital marketing has become one of the best career these days. Because there are a lot of platforms where companies can advertise their products and they need marketers to do it. This is what technology does and gives more platform and choices to advertisers.",

Btw, I don't see how blockchain is changing the digital marketing landscape. The technology or method you mentioned doesn't rely on blockchain to function properly. Even if you can argue that it can improve how they work, I fail to see how it is done. As far as I know, the only thing that companies have done with blockchain is improve their loyalty program, even if that is arguable since they basically use it to launch their own token instead of improving their workflow. The robot tech that you mentioned also doesn't rely on blockchain to answer customers' questions right? CMIIW.",

But now in a digital world marketers now have the opportunity to market there goods around the globe, with the help of advertisement using the television, radio programmes, newspaper, magazines,billboards. The point of view you are talking about has actually been implemented by marketers long before the internet developed. Promotion through television, radio programs, newspapers, magazines and billboards has been going on for a long time in my country. This facility has been used by skilled marketers or those who are just starting their business. Now it is even easier because technology has provided services on online platforms to market products and market segments are also easier to reach. Technological sophistication will make it easier for people to market their products, but marketing that still uses traditional promotions will be increasingly left behind if they do not keep up with the times.Quote from: Miles2006 on October 12, 2023, 04:14:03 PMFinally: with the new technology, you pay goods on delivery, and the company carrier will deliver to you on your door step. With the pay on delivery, the scamming rate will reduce, because people have been scammed by the fake sellers online in the payment before delivery system.  Don't be mistaken if buyers are not astute at seeing the quality of the goods they order via internet services, instead the goods that arrive are different. Although in the end you may refuse not to pay because it doesn't match what was ordered. New technology can indeed help people save time when shopping, but it also requires carefulness so as not to be deceived. Every sophistication definitely has a level of weakness and that is where users need to be careful so as not to get caught in fraud.",

In every government formation or related authority there must be an expert who has the ability to analyze every policy who will then be able to provide screening for detrimental activities. However, if I observe that due to very rapid technological progress and the era of uncontrolled free trade, there are several parties who are still able to take advantage of loopholes to harm other parties. So perhaps this is the first task of marketing which must be fair in assessing a product before disseminating or advertise the product.",

It's transformed the way businesses reach their audiences and boosted global accessibility.Not just for marketers, but the digital age has made life easier for consumers, too. Digital marketing is not only about selling, but about the process starting from introducing products widely using digital media to providing service to buyers after the sale occurs. On the other hand, when talking about digital marketing, talk about the system. Because you have to think about the goals and strategies that must be carried out. And it's not just about getting sales.However digital development is growing, email marketing in the world of investment is like property in my opinion. Not eroded by the times, even though many social media have emerged, people still use email and even today large companies still collect email databases.",

However, even though the digital era has become increasingly sophisticated, there are still some people who feel disadvantaged by this digital era. For example, what happened in the city center in the country where I live. Traders in one of the shopping centers/markets in the city feel that their merchandise has become quiet because of the digital buying and selling platform.QuoteMinister of Trade Zulkiflui Hasan (Zulhas) gave a statement to the media during a visit to Tanah Abang Market, Jakarta, Thursday, September 28 2023. During his visit, the Minister of Trade listened to traders' complaints and had a dialogue about the lack of buyers at the largest textile market in Southeast Asia. the impact of the onslaught of e-commerce and social commerceSource: https://bisnis.tempo.co/amp/1782366/viral-pedagang-tanah-abang-minta-shopee-dan-lazada-ditutup-usai-tiktok-shop-netizen-ngelunjakSo, for example, if this era of digitalization is not evenly distributed across all levels of society, in the end there will be people who feel disadvantaged because of this digital era. Because to be honest, the market near my house currently has fewer visitors because there is an online buying and selling platform that is easier and cheaper.But even so, basically we all can't blame this era of digitalization. Because it cannot be denied that when the era of digitalization has reached the stage it is now, I personally don't need to leave the house to shop for necessities (the point is, it's easier).So in conclusion, people who feel left behind because of this digitalization era, should also be able to upgrade themselves and keep up with existing developments. Because as OP discussed, the marketing system has become more effective and extensive due to the current era of digitalization.",
