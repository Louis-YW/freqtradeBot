  "content": "Giving Bitcoin awareness and teaching its basic concept to the youths voluntarily in my locality has been my desired so that they can follow up with this new era I'm other to be financial free from centralized system and third party. Yesterday was my second time to teach about Bitcoin in a school, I was invited by Mr Sleek Nwambata  the principal of Treasure Jireh High School he was among the people I introduced Bitcoin to at my place of work but never knew he had a school. When I asked him why Bitcoin he said he loves the initiative and needs to prepare his students towards the digital market system in our world so that after school this will not affect them.The class started at exactly 8.30am with the theory aspect of Bitcoin this made the students to ask to many questions for proper understanding which I took my time to explain to them one by one. The theory class lasted for three hours and after that we went on break,during break I asked Mr Sleek if the school have a computer lab for pratical,he said yes but only one of the computer is working perfectly so I used my laptop to make it two computers and also provided internet access with my phone to make the class interesting with easy understanding. I could remember this first school I taught Bitcoin concept,Mrs Susan pleaded with me to come back for the practical class to avoid the same opinion here I decided to go with my laptop.After connected to the internet I shared them into four groups so that everybody can participate and the practical class lasted for two hours. This is the most interesting class I have ever taught Bitcoin due to their contributions and seriousness of students to learn something new but so hectic because I have never taught for 5hrs. After the class I gave them assignment which Mr Sleek said he will bring them to me at the office.ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS1. Define Bitcoin2. Write three importance of bitcoin3.In your own word briefly explain      decentralization4. Draw BitcoinMr Sleek said he will appreciate it if I can come once in a term to come and teach his students so that they can learn more. I have a plan on those schools I have taught Bitcoin awareness to carry out, when it is done I will update this community with it.. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 9. 10. 11.",

      "body": "This is an encouragement for us to learn from by creating an avenue for us to impact on others the opportunity we enjoy with a decentralized network of bitcoin and the blockchain technology, teaching about bitcoin could also come with ease just to the intended recipients to learn fast when both the theoretical and practical aspect of bitcoin is been taught, this is also a good target with the aim on educating the teenagers in schools who could have been thinking on what next to pursue for career in life after high school than underaged children who couldn't get the main idea to what the teaching is all about.",

      "body": "Very interesting, and your efforts really deserve appreciation. because not many people do good things like you do. in fact, I was only able to teach my family about bitcoin. although in the end my brother became more proficient and more knowledgeable than me. but to teach it to children in my area, I don't think it's possible yet. but I was quite surprised about the people in my area who turned out to be quite familiar with bitcoin. Even many people I just met and I accidentally glanced at their cell phones had a crypto wallet application. my appreciation for you buddy.",

Congratulations for the good job. But since you said part 2, you would have add the first thread to this one. And also the assignment questions would have been evaluation whereby you asked the students in the class and received the answers instant because those questions are too simple for them to take home. As you finished teaching them, you asked them at once.",

      "body": "Good work. It’s good to learn bitcoin from your teens when you have a lot of spare time in your hands. The students can research on their own and explore bitcoin ecosystem. Those that find the class interesting will definitely do their homework and make the best out of the lectures. It’s a good initiative, Keep it up!",

      "body": "This kind of work has been done by so many people in the forum, but that doesn't mean that anyone can't teach people about cryptocurrency again. It's good to teach people what's cryptocurrency from the early stage so that when they grow they will not depart from ot, i believe that people have welcomed Bitcoin since the grassroots campaign of cryptocurrency has gotten to the villagers to the extend of teaching secondary school students what's cryptocurrency. It's nice of spreading the news of cryptocurrency across people.",
