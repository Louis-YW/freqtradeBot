  "content": "They are four kinds of trading according to Pareto; An immortalized name in the economics mathematical science. 1. A win win trade; one that the both parties win, hence the number of people into such trade keeps booming2. Trade in which a party gains, but no one loses, and again welfare will definitely go up; more users and investors3. Trade in which no one gains, but someone loses4. Trade in which some party win and some loses, and increases the amount of profits of those who won. People are wise, they'll go for one and two, but will trade on it until a point where people can't trade without getting worsen off.  But, in 3 and 4, where I placed bitcoin, especially 4. The trade cannot be profitable if people don't lose for others to win. Yet it has some qualities of the results of number 1, finite supply. When the supply of bitcoin ends. Wouldn't people look for other things that'll serve them, other than bitcoin? People's interest can change in the market. Which is what balances the market. Difference in utilities. No fud! just reasoning like an economists. Using their mathematical science. You can contribute or share you insights on Pareto principles; Pareto optimal and Pareto superior trades. Thanks.",

      "body": "I believe Pareto is dragging this too much, there are and there will ever be three sets of traders in the market;1. Those who lose their money.2. Those who gain.3. And those who lose and gain with nothing tangible to show for it.In either of these, you lose to the market/market makers and gain from the market/market makers.Now about the context, these combinations have existed in the traditional market for so long and it has not died till today, so the Bitcoin market can't be any different. It will continue to flourish as there will always be losers and winners in the market at different time and trading conditions.",

However, the movement is limited and profits are only achieved by using leverage or waiting for several months. However, we find that more people are speculating in this asset.Bitcoin is still far from its true value, which we can simply know if Bitcoin stabilized around it for 8 years, which has not happened. Therefore, the price will remain highly volatile, which means profits for some and losses for others, with profits for all in a certain period until we reach a period in which the price of Bitcoin is so high that Weekly trading will be able to move the price by 1% in the best of cases and we will reach a state similar to gold. Until that condition occurs, speculation will continue, and after it occurs, it will continue.",

Take gold, for example, its price still fluctuates and people have been trading it forever. The only way Bitcoin stops being tradable is if the price remains static at a point. A limited supply of Bitcoin increases the scarcity thereby driving up the price. With the price going up, some would want it and therefore buy it because they'll speculate that they can buy it and sell it for a profit just as it is today. Same way the price will drop when people start selling and people would buy it to sell at higher prices.",

People could get tired of the above because it’s a recipe for disaster & likely to incur losses.However, what people will not get tired of is buying & holding bitcoin long term because it’s close to a guarantee to make big profits. Nobody gets tired of watching their purchasing power grow, taking control of their own wealth, not relying on third parties. It’s enlightening to own bitcoin & say a big F U to the government.",

In the case where people stop trading BTC because they have enough, BTC will remain as mining continues and new blocks are formed.BTC is money so if no trading, the coins is yours in the long run and the compounding effect of the coins left untouched could amount to millions once liquidated.I will pick options one and four in your composition of  Pareto principles because it has been what is most common in the gambling and betting world for me and I recognize this trade in which both parties win and that of which the winner gets more and the loser loses all .People will never get tired of trading BTC because it is what it is today by the principle of supply and demand among P2p.",

It wouldn't be right to answer no to this question because transactions are not carried out only with spot balances in financial markets. In addition to spot transactions, it is possible to trade in financial markets with futures, contracts and similar types of trading styles. In other words, in such transactions since the contract is actually purchased it is possible to trade more than the current or maximum supply of the traded financial product which we can see in gold. In other words, it isn't necessary for the Bitcoin supply to reach the maximum level or for there to be enough supply in the market for people to get bored of Bitcoin trading.In summary, I wanted to explain that financial markets are not limited to spot transactions only and therefore a person can trade any amount he/she wishes. In other words, the fact that the supply in circulation has decreased or that any financial product has reached its maximum supply doesn't mean that people will prefer this financial instrument less or will get bored of trading it.",

If he likes to trade short term then he will and for long term it takes a long time to wait many people don't have that much patience then they can get tired. But long term trading is more profitable as they hope that its value will increase making them profit. If demand for bitcoin increases the interplay of supply and demand may increase its value if you are interested in trading and investing you cannot avoid looking at cryptocurrency trading. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ethereum litecoin have attracted investors with substantial profit potential and a whole new way of thinking about how it works.",

Everyone would want to be in No1 and 2 market.Two things will happen in the traditional market, either you win or lose, which is the category that Bitcoin falls into, When you are buying someone is selling to you and when you are selling someone is buying from you, so it is either that you profit or you lose kind of game and It now balls down to you playing to be on the winning side. If the system were set to be number 1 and 2 everyone would flood into the market and do the same thing the system could crash and may no longer exist as of today, But what keeps the system interesting and going is because of No 3 and 4 the traditional market pattern that gave birth to the Bitcoin -crypto market.",

The reason, as I mentioned before, is that Bitcoin is still in its infancy and people have a strong belief that Bitcoin will achieve very large numbers in the future, so they will continue to buy even at the peak.If people lose faith in this theory and become convinced that Bitcoin will not continue to rise forever, then volatility could decrease and we will see relative stability in the price of Bitcoin.",

It'll surely get to equilibrium, to balance the market.  People will never get tired of using money. If a person is working on a business that requires E gold as the payment method. The person will hurry to know how he'll be able to trade e Gold. Despite e Gold being overshadowed by bitcoin as a payment method. The stay of bitcoin as a commodity with the most utility; money. The market will always move, maybe more difficult. Due to its finite nature. Many wouldn't want to lose for others to win. They'll fall back to the main purpose of bitcoin; as a payment method. Saving some bitcoin on their wallet. Regardless of the decision of people on bitcoin. They're lots of lost bitcoins. With no means of accessing them. Thereby putting a balance in between buyers and sellers. Now I understand why Satoshi tagged lost bitcoins as the helper of the market. Depending on what would make the buyer happy. A new coin or tech, if any, can overshadow the ideas of Satoshi, like his did to Adam back's Hashcash. The situation of bitcoin in such a market, may not be completely reduced. Rather, the news and methods of bitcoin marketing, will also fetch profitable outputs in future. Able to maintain the market. It all depends on the number of people that'll keep using bitcoin when that happens. For instance, de-valuating dollar to an extent people switches to something tangible. Maybe a different country's currency. Yet it wouldn't take away the usage of dollar. Because it's money. People must trade with money. And bitcoin has been serving the purpose of money non stop for over 11 years. It's indeed the future. There are many other generations that'll watch the performance of bitcoin in the financial market, which we may not predict today.",

But with bitcoin there is no such central authority to manipulate it, many top bodies have tried it but to no avail. The volatility of bitcoin also is just base on the fact that bitcoin is still at an early stage if you notice the volatility of bitcoin in the past years compare to this year you will notice a significant reduction in the volatility rate, this shows that as bitcoin grows more it’s volatility will reduce. Also bitcoin adoption is on rapid growth, and even the mere number of people that registered on the forum although it can be use to justify it properly will show you how it is growing. The number of countries also relaxing their laws to accommodate bitcoin shows it’s adoption growth",
