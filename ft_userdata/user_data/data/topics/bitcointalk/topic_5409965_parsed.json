If not then, it's just worthless. I doubt the wealthy guys from WEF take the importance of paper money anymore. If they print Trillions of it to giveaway then its not a healthy inflation. Its why there is a need for the production of goods on US soil. Or our option to overcome I guess investing in BTC and keeping earning money to overcome inflation.",

If other countries want to have a deal with you, it should be for the benefit of both parties and not just for the benefit of bigger countries. It is to what you have explained here. I don't believe that a base currency or counter currency doesn't really determine the strength of the currency but what determines it is the factor of economics in the country like  you have explained. The economic factors are very important to affect the currency or not. If you are spending so much on current project like paying of salaries and frivolities than spending on capital projects and manufacturing, you are likely to have a fallen currency.",

Then why does the US have inflation?  Quote from: el kaka22 on August 15, 2022, 09:15:40 PMThat's not how it works at all. Inflation happens because you print more money, that's it, there is really nothing else. If you do not print more money then you won't have inflation.There are tons of other things!Inflation doesn't happen magically just because you print money, for example, you could print 100 million $1000 checks, and distribute them to each family but if nobody spends one penny of those, will there be inflation?Japan has been printing money for decades yet it was still unable to generate inflation and even with covid and global inflation happening almost everywhere, they are desperately trying to get inflation to sit above 2% and not really making it happen, not even with higher energy prices.In order to have inflation, you need the price of goods to increase, simple as that, there is no money printing involved, all you need is higher demand and lower output and there you have it inflation. Money printing just helps it by driving up demand as more people want to buy those goods and afford to pay more but otherwise no, it's not a singular cause.",
