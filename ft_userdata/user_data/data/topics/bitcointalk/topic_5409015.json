Bitcoin is highly volatile, while creating their own fiat currency would allow them to continue doing what all central banks are doing - stabilizing the currency against market volatility.I think  crypto community shouldn't pay as much attention to CBDC as they do right now. CBDC is not cryptocurrency. It's not affecting existing cryptocurrencies. It's not a competitor to cryptocurrencies. It's just a government-owned payment network.",

They are simply IOU papers, central bank promise papers.However, countries keep gold in vaults, to prove some sort of solvability. And that can be replaced by Bitcoin. Why? Because private keys are much easier to safely store (if one knows what he's doing) and, unlike for gold, they would not have to pay for huge vaults for storage. Also proof of funds is easy to get.Even more, it starts becoming visible that gold may not be as scarce as initially thought and this may become tricky (pricewise).Back to the question: indeed, since fiat is not backed at all, I don't see why would they be backing CBDCs with bitcoin, when they can back with fiat or, directly nothing.",

As said, countries save up gold in vaults, because they need assets. Furthermore, they might portray it as a similar to gold standard at first, and later alter it same as in 1971, although this argument doesn't hold a lot of water, because bitcoin is easier to transfer in contrast with gold. Trading digital currencies with digital scarcity, that is bitcoin, does sound a probable scenario. It's down to the governments' interest to be first.",

For governments lacking precious metals reserves to back what they print. \"Create money out of thin air.\" Was originally a criticism for paper money in eras when a gold standard was abandoned. Naturally proponents of fiat feel a certain irony and satisfaction at redirecting these classical criticisms at cryptocurrency. They had been in a position of defending against these arguments for so long. They took perverse type of pleasure in seeing others struggle with it.I wonder if it could be fair to say that bitcoin is backed by the electrical consumption of its mining sector.

Unbacked is a fair assessment really and is open to a small bit of interpretation of the reader, it's unlikely that any sort of wording would be totally satisfactory to all people. I read unbacked as in, it has no central banking authority that is able to guide it's future (unless you talk about the developers in this manner) and it doesn't have the economy of any country to fall back on to assess a true productive value behind it like standard fiat currencies. That can also be seen in a good light, not necessarily negative, because a decentralized currency is supported by citizens of all countries and you might argue is the first truly globalized independent currency in existence.",

Quote the ECB has chosen to define crypto-assets as “a new type of asset recorded in digital form and enabled by the use of cryptography that is not and does not represent a financial claim on, or a liability of, any identifiable entity.””So they are all assets, shitty assets but still assets.Just as cryptocurrency doesn't mean being decentralized, a centralized coin still qualifies for the definition.Quote from: cryptosize on August 08, 2022, 01:21:30 PMIt will happen when the whole West collapses and people will literally beg to return to something stable (Gold Standard 2.0 - Digital Transformation edition).Sometime between 2026 and 2030: https://www.brandonquittem.com/bitcoin-rhythms-of-history/But this time for sure?Because I've heard it in the 60s, in the 7s0, in the 80s capitalism was on its last legs, 2000 it was clear the west will burn and it will not get another decade, in 2008 we all knew it was doomed, in 2013 again doom, so seeing now it's 2022, this time is for sure?For real, this is the last time when I pack my bags and wait for the apocalypse!Quote from: cryptosize on August 08, 2022, 01:35:12 PMWhat's funny is that people think Eurozone is a wholly \"new\" experiment.Spoiler alert: it's not new at all: https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/when-greece-exited-from-latin-american-union-in-1908/Yeah, quite funny, an article about how the Union is for sure going to be destroyed because Greece joined in a year that multiplied by 2 divided by 7 and multiplied again by the square root of the population of ancient troy reads 666, and 10 years since the article was written, again nothing.The whole article misses on a crucial thing, Europe hasn't been at war for close to a century, Europe and no country with its border want war anymore, and wars and territorial ambitions were the ones that destroyed alliances and unions, trade, and economies.",

I'm against fascism, including the woke version of it.Stop doing this shit, it doesn't work on me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projectionI'm not going to bother anymore with rude internet strangers that had a bad day at work. Get a life.The only arrogant person here is the one who expects the West to never fall (like Rome did), not someone like me who remains humble and knows that nothing will last forever, not even the human species. You're not a God, accept your fate.ps1: I'm not going to have any discussion with anyone who hasn't read this article, especially on BitcoinTalk:https://brandonquittem.com/bitcoin-rhythms-of-history/Forum discussions are meant to exchange knowledge. I'm not going to post it again, just because the majority uses smartphones and is too lazy to read.The forum layout doesn't help either, it's very cumbersome, since there's no mobile theme...ps2: If someone doesn't appreciate the knowledge I'm giving them for free and starts being ironic/rude for no apparent reason, I stop discussing with them.There are 8 billion people on the planet and the majority isn't even worth the oxygen they're breathing... be valuable, appreciate the knowledge you're getting for free (while others have to pay for it) and then we can have a discussion.",
