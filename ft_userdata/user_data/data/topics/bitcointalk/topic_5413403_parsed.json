Parker, whose mission was to manufacture a better pen. The Parker Pen Company's tradition epitomizes the highest standards of craftsmanship, technology, and aesthetics. In 1921, the company introduced the iconic Parker Duofold pen. Yet by the early 1930s, Parker launched replacement for Duofold, the Vacumatic. In 1941, the company developed the most widely used model of fountain pen in history (over $400 million worth of sales in its 30-year history), the Parker 51. It is also referred as 'the most wanted pen'.
