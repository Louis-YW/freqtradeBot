Trusted by 5 million users yet when I google Bityx, the only result I get is this (company based in London, as you claim to be). The only problem is that company is incorporated in September 2022, while you claim to already have millions of users so I guess that can't be you, tight?

Thanks for confirming that you are running a shady exchange and no one should trust you with even a single dollar.Creating alt accounts to make some fake reviews on your thread isn't going to help you at all and we are not some stupid people here to believe such bullshit.",

Only junk exchanges would use such promotion methods, bumping the topic with bots with a single post praising the exchange. You should definitely stay away from such exchanges, because there is nothing good from them if they don’t even have money for the normal promotion of their service. Reminiscent of the methods of promoting the next shitcoin on the forum, which will turn into a scam in the foreseeable future.Weird part about all this is that exchange they have been shilling has been down ever since OP created this topic week ago. I've been checking it every single day and no luck accessing that website so what's the point of their shilling? Even if you Google Bityx you won't get any results expect the very same shilling on other sites. Anyway, gonna report all those posts so hopefully shill accounts get nuked as well since they were created for one reason only",

They said I need to upgrade account to institutional as they don’t allow this trading on individual account ( here comes the scam) so to upgrade I have to deposit 5000$ and agree to new terms, I deposited 5000$ then the upgrade requirement changed to 10,000$. I contacted them they said you have to deposit, I said I did and it increases then they said we will check but there is no way you can access without 10k$ deposit now. I told them and asked why it changed from 5k to 10k$ now if I deposit 10k$ it will move upto 20k$ what will I do? They said no, now I have locked the requirement to 10k$ it will not increase. So yeah I got scammed. Then he said your funds will be frozen forever. I asked about company details all are fake.Following are the details they provided:BITYX DIGITAL SOLUTIONS LIMITEDCOMPANY NUMBER 14383536Company type: Private limited with share capitalBusiness activity (SIC) 64301 - Activities of investment trustsSo please big big mistake lesson learned 5100$ lost and I hope this scammer and his kids & family will suffer from worst of diseases in the life.

Sure I will create a new thread today with all screenshots, 5100$ gone and when I did chat with the support there's only one guy there random times of online and replies that you should think before you do such trade as buy low from one exchange and sell high on our, now the only way to get back your money is your account assets equity should be atleast 10,000$ to apply for upgrade of an account to Institutional account then you will again have access to your money or it will stuck forever, then he said or wait until the coins you added, if their value goes upto 10,000$ then you can apply. But the main trick is, when my account was restricted it asked me to upgrade and the requirement for upgrade was Assets equity = 5000$ min and when I deposit more money it went upto 10,000$ and that's for sure when someone deposit 10,000$ it will go to 20,000$ and so on. Well I have never got scammed but this time I got scammed it is very simple and smart scam at the same time, they let you withdraw for once or twice to get the trust then blocks the access.
