If you are using a mobile phone and installed a Binance app you should be able to find the P2P option under trade tab but you won't be able to trade there without transferring your crypto to funding and also change the currency to GBP I checked just now there are many offers on GBP currency.",

Does anyone know which platform I can use to convert BTC to GBP and withdraw to a UK bank account or credit/debit card?As mentioned above, P2P is one way to do it but then it depends on which bank you're using. If you have an account with Revolut for example, then I probably wouldn't suggest doing so. There is a high chance that they'll freeze your account. This is a post I was reading earlier: https://www.reddit.com/r/Revolut/comments/179yquk/can_i_get_banned_for_binance_p2p/Alternatively, you can also try and find a good debit card for the U.K from here. See here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5280997.0That way, you can just deposit your BTC and withdraw from an ATM.",

In this method, you send your cryptocurrency to an actual user, and they, in turn, transfer GBP to your bank account or another available payment method.Binance P2P Newbie Guide",

      "body": "Well if yout bank isnt on the list on GBP p2p on Binance then might open a bank account that supports mostly the one being used there. Since they no longer allowed withdrawals to Uk via currency then P2P is still your best option like what Bitmax said. Im sure you have other choices like remitanance app or supported finance company and not just the bank account.",

But if you use p2P then you will get many options to receive your payment there is also option to withdraw money in Bank.Payment methods with a star symbol are commonly used and are commonly used for transactions on Binance p2p for GBP. Â Which you can do too",
