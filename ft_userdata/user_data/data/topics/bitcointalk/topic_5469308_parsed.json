  "content": "Hello,I recently purchased a control board that said it would work with my R4, It's a  ZYNQ C41   IT has the S9  firmware installed.   When I go to flash it with the R4 TAR.GZ files, it gives me an error.  I am not sure if there is a different file I can use to flash it or make a file for a bootable SD card.   The files on Bitmain don't seem to be files I can use to boot from the sd card.  Any help is greatly appreciated!   I don't think this should be this complicated.  Thank you in advance.  Rob",

      "body": "Who said that it would work in r4 units?Pretty bad you bought a c5 control board I never heard that c5 control will work in R4.The control board that you should buy is the Xilinx control board because it's universal.Also, I checked Bitmain's download page they don't have SD card firmware for r4 units so the firmware you download can only be flashed on the dashboard GUI. You can try to flash it through the browser let see if it would work.",
