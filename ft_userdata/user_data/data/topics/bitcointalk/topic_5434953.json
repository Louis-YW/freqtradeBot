  "content": "Sam Bankman Fried was recently arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the US government. He may soon be extradited and face the biggest legal challenge of his life as a result of the numerous violations he committed at FTX and Alameda Research. He has a significant probability of going to jail, which might be beneficial for everyone in the cryptocurrency sector by delivering the message that we must all abide by the law and refrain from doing foolishly.  It's encouraging to see that Bitcoin has experienced some solid increases following his arrest. This shows that many people are endorsing it and may indicate that the King of Cryptos' reputation can now slowly regain its former glory. We can only hope that BTC can close the year with some strength rather than some red waves.",

If there's any connection between FTX and bitcoin pump it's that the liquidators claim to have found most of the money that used to be considered \"lost\" by FTX. It appears they still had over $5B in various assets lying around but due to their bad management they didn't know what is where. I'm just waiting for them to announce that FTX really wasn't insolvent and Sam the idiot forgot where he kept the money P.S. The real reason for the pump was a short squeeze on exchanges.",

Several years ago, Bitcoin has climbed from 18k to 40k in about 45 days and there we no price drops more than several percent. Not like 10-15% as you say it is going to retest bottom. So why think this time it would be different? Imho, it looks more that we are going to stuck on that 20-21k level for quite a time, and then... Nobody can predict what will be then. Chinese New Year, 1 year Russia-Ukraine war, new sanctions, scams. Anything can happen dude.",

Something fresh did happen, though, as according to CNN, he spoke out for the first time since arrest just 4 days ago, and the price has been on the rise since then. That being said, it's merely a correlation, and there's no good reason to believe there's a causal relation here. Whether this guy is going to prison or not remains to be seen, but it's good that this situation is being investigated, and I really hope that the victims will get at least some of their money back.",

They are many criterion starting from the market makers, whales and individuals in the market who can impact positively to the market price. I think we should be more concerned about how far it'll go and worry about if it'll go back bearish. Guessing over the reason we are making profits shouldn't be a problem as we may be predicting wrongly. As for SBF's arrest being the reason to an increase in price it's wrong, if he has been tried and accepts to refund affected customers their money then it could help the market go back in place. Since the crash of his company affected the market price, fixing his mistake can help the correction of bitcoin price. I think at the moment, bitcoin price has not moved so bullish to call it a bull run we are still bearish. Wait for 30k",

Very suspicious about why he was always promoting his scam tokens while talking bad about bitcoin.Why were the major media always praising and promoting this guy as the face and leader of the crypto space when he has no track record to speak of? He just came out of nowhere and no one ever heard of him before but the media were already calling him the next Warren Buffet. This always gave me pause and luckily my instincts were correct. The way he dresses and looks like a homeless person with disheveled appearance was a turn off for me as well. The media should be prosecuted for aiding and abetting this criminal imo.Bankster-Fraud probably bribed them to write such a good things about him just as he bribed the American politicians, who are mostly crooks themselves.",

I read about how he doled out cash like a very wealthy philanthropist to politicians, especially the Biden campaign. Show me anyone who doles out cash to politicians and wouldn't do same to the media. Is there any? None. The ilks of Sam Fried (BTW, your new coinage for his name is hilarious and seems to fit well) is the reason this industry continues to get a bad name. Greed won't allow most of the devs and teams do the right thing by keeping it straight and honest.",

This something like a coincidence than the real factor behind the market movement. As said by the above user, it is predicted to have a bullish start due to the market getting prepared for the upcoming year's halving.
