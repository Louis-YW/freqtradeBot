  "content": "I'm trying to use Btcrecover to find my passphrase. I entered it on a Ledger Nano S and I thought I was sure of the words, but obviously I'm wrong. I do have the correct 24 word seed.My passphrase is relatively long; possibly 15-20 words all put together. Â I've tried multiple custom token lists to no avail, and wondering if I'm doing something wrong.When using --listpass, I've noticed that if -typos-capslock is enabled, it tries combinations of lowercaseUPPERCASElowercase. 1. My passphrase is all lowercase or all uppercase. If it's all lowercase, then possibly, the first letter of the passphrase OR first letter of each word is proper case. It would have been a pain to do that on the Ledger though so I am hoping it's all lower or upper case. Is there any way to run only those combinations, or do I need to try each casetype as a separate run?2. I'm relatively confident there are certain words, and even the order, and use + in front of those. The other words are in the middle but I'm not certain how the \"relative anchor\" works. 3. Complicating things more, I may have replaced a's with @, s with $ etc. I have the custom-typos map but that becomes way too many combinations. I think I did it only for the first a or s in a word and not all. I.e., Emb@rra$sAny thoughts/suggestions/scripts/other tools than btcrecover you can suggest?Thank you for joining me on this recovery journey.",

I did try this previously however I couldn't quite understand the alphabet use case. I tried it anyway and it had crashed when I woke up, lol.I couldn't get it working on a Macbook unfortunately which would have been way faster vs. my Windows laptop.Where would I add the words that I believe the passphrase is made up of?",

If ledger Live can show the address' derivation path, the first address should have \"/0\" at the end of the path, the 2nd address has \"/1\" and so on.But if there's no way to show it, the xpub should do.Use an offline machine for privacy reasons and load/import it in any tool/wallet that supports xpub.E.g.: in Electrum, restore it in \"new/restore\" menu or \"Install Wizard\" by selecting \"Standard wallet->Use a master key\".for xpub, Electrum will derive addresses that starts with '1'. If your addresss starts with 'bc1q',convert the xpub first in the console (View->Show Console) into zpub via command: convert_xkey(xkey=\"xpub...\",xtype=\"p2wpkh\")Finish creating the wallet, enable the 'Addresses' tab (Show->View Addresses) and open it.Then the addresses with green highlight are your receiving addresses and it should be in the correct arrangement by address_index.To make sure, right click on the address and select \"Details\", the derivation path for the first address from the extended pubKey should be m/0/0.",

Is the \"fresh address path\" (shown in the step 3 image from the link above) the same as the derivation path?Quote from: despo4helpo on March 22, 2023, 04:50:17 PMDo you suggest any other commands to use to reduce the number of variables?If you can give us much information as you know about your passphrase (obviously without revealing the actual words), then we can try to optimize things as much as possible. It's either one of these lists, or a combination of both. If separate, I'm confident of the order but yet it didn't work so something is off.I think all caps but could be wrong. It was done on the Ledger Nano S so I don't think I would have gone and changed caps and spaces between words...Fruit1fruit2fruit3fruit4ORVeg1veg2veg3veg4ORFruit1veg1veg2fruit2There are probably some known number combinations, at the end. So I know to put all those in 1 line and use $ after each one.To make matters worse, I may have replaced a with @ and s with $ and o with 0. I'm a moron! (Clearly I don't know how to use the quotes properly, so I've put my responses in bold, sorry!)",

Is the \"fresh address path\" (shown in the step 3 image from the link above) the same as the derivation path?Almost. Take the fresh address it path it shows you under your xpub and knock the last two sets of digits off it to get the derivation path for your xpub. So if it shows m/84'/0'/0'/0/5, your xpub's path will be m/84'/0'/0'. Make sure to include the ' symbols, these are very important and will generate entirely different keys if you miss them out.The last thing to be sure is that this xpub is definitely coming from the account protected by the passphrase, and not from the base account with no passphrase.Quote from: despo4helpo on March 24, 2023, 03:14:20 AMIt's either one of these lists, or a combination of both. If separate, I'm confident of the order but yet it didn't work so something is off.If the order is off, then you are really going to struggle. Based on your initial post of 15-20 words, and the fact that I can descramble 12 words in a little under an hour, then 15 words would come out at around 100 days and 20 words will be in the region of hundreds of thousands of years, even assuming you were 100% correct with all your words and symbols.So, assuming you know the order, then I would try something like this initially:Code:^1^Code ^1^code ^1^C0de ^1^c0de^2^test ^2^te$t^3^mayor ^3^m@yor ^3^may0r ^3^m@y0rAnd so on.The ^x^ before each word fixes the position of that word. btcrecover will then take one entry from each line and assemble that in to a passphrase in that order to try. So on each line, you put every possible permutation of that word. This is also assuming no spaces between the words.If that fails, then change your tokens file to all caps.If that fails, then take your second wordlist (e.g. veg instead of fruit) and follow the same process.If that fails, then combine your wordlists and follow the same process.Note that if $ is the last character of a token, you will need to replace it with %S otherwise btcrecover will interpret it as an end anchor.In terms of the numbers at the end, you can do what you are doing and put every possibility on a single line with $ at the end, or you can use a wildcard if you are unsure about the numbers. For example, %3,4d will try every 3 and 4 digit combination. Note that this will significantly increase your search space, however.",
