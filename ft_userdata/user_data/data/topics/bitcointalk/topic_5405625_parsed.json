  "content": "After the whole Voyager debacle I decided to buy a Nano X(connected through Ledger Live) and transfer all my Crypto over. Started this process a few days ago and was very easy from sending from Coinbase, Gemini and Uphold. Everything went through. I believe I messed up sending Mana from Crypto.com. I def put the right address but on Crypto.com when you transfer they ask for network type and I put Cronos by mistake (after the fact) I understand now I was supposed to select ERC20. So it has been 2 days and don't have on wallet nor back on Crypto.com. Am I completely beat? I had the correct wallet address but what can I do, any way I can recover my Mana? I am still somewhat a novice to Crypto world and would appreciate any feedback at all to direct me if there is any steps I can take to recover this Mana? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, Crypto.com really can't do nothing and I can't get any support on Ledger Live.Thanks",

And you have to check on what network was the transfer done. Each blockchain is different, you can see it like a different universe.If your coins were still sent on ETH blockchain (ethplorer.io, etherscan.io), you may have a chance. If it's on a different blockchain I don't know.Disclaimer: I'm not in shitcoins either (at least not for years), nor crypto.com. I've used Ledger Nano S with some tokens long time ago though.",

Greatly appreciated I was able to locate it on that link you gave mehttps://cronoscan.com/So at least I found it (it is the exact amount) Just need to see if I can get it backI hear i can get back through Meta Mask, but I never used (again I am a novice) I have a Nano X Ledger , so I can still use my recovery on Meta ?",

Im guessing here now too, never used metamask or cronos.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Or maybe try this first first: Maybe they generate the same seeds and you can already simply access them from your ledger by downloading the chronos app on it.And then just go on ledger live and create a cronos account, then they should be there, if the seed is correct.

No third party software needed. All original ledger processes. Then just send the chronos back to the exchange and send your ethereum back to the ledger(this time as erc20 and a new correct address from an ethereum account on your ledger live), after this you can uninstall the chronos app again.",
