G20 houses one of the highly developing/developed countries and with classic economic status. So what they discuss and what they propose does matter to the world in some way or the other.

For example, in the country where we live, we are part of the G20 members and have even built partnerships with investors to facilitate crypto assets into the category of protected commodity assets.In 2023 India is hosting the Summit and they have the right to pass laws because the cases they have had with crypto have been deemed quite severe. It would be very natural with India's population size, unstable economy, encouraging every individual not to depend on state finances or facilities that they cannot enjoy. As a result, the people of India are looking to sectors that are broader, more productive and at the same time challenging the government's economy. Let's say they make millions of Dollars from crypto then cash it out in fiat which forces huge amount of money to be printed, resulting in inflation but Indian government can't cut taxes from crypto proceeds.In essence, at the G20 event later, India needs to make decisions and the support of other countries does not mean that they can be ratified and implemented in their respective countries. Each country will present its problems which are definitely different from what India is facing.",

Except if the minister meant only the countries that belong to the G20. I mean, if an international legal framework is legislated that regulates the uses of crypto, then it must include all countries, and therefore the framing of this field brings together representatives from all countries, such as if this is done through the United Nations or the World Bank, because it will never be feasible for the G20 countries to establish largest economies in the world) to create it alone, since it will be for its interests in the first place.",

Your points are valid @Hispo but I think the government is also concerned with other problem. Bitcoin might not be able to hinder the government from engaging in its economic policies to control the economy because the currency has a limited supply and it is global which means that only a few citizens of a particular country might own it. Secondly, the government has not been able to control the influx of other currencies in my country. Currencies like dollars have always been in circulation side by side with our local currency. The government can also limit the circulation of their currency and adjust interest rates because Bitcoin will have little or no impact on their policy. I think their concern is mainly the failure of centralized exchanges and crypto-related firms, tax invasion, and control of the financial transaction of citizens.",

Everyone in the world can own Bitcoin because the liquidity will be always be high enough, of course, that scenario would imply a massive increase of the prize.On your second point about FIAT vs FIAT, what do you think your local government felt when people started to use USA dollars instead your national currency? Most of the times local governments are not happy about it, because they indeed lose control over the macro economics. It is a fairly similar scenario when we talk about globally recognized assets competing against each other. If a bank wants to increase the interests to decrease inflation but they only have local currency instead Dollars, then people could still opt to borrow in USD elsewhere. That is why in Argentina the interest in Pesos are huge, but they are low in USD. And there is not much the banks can't do about it.",
