  "content": "It seems that scammers develop new methods to perpetrate their act every new day. There's a new scam method going on across many social media platforms and if you use telegram very often, it must have come across your screen in many of the telegram group you belong.The scammers pretend to be some sort of newbie to crypto and having an issue with sending out funds from their wallet. So they share their secret phrase to a public group where a lot of people can see it including a picture of some USDT(TRC20) to utilize the natural greed instinct of people.As shown in this picture ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡The purpose of the scam is to make people send some Tron to the wallet hoping they would be able to send out the USDT in the wallet. But the wallet is a multi-signatory wallet meaning all funds sent to it will be automatically transferred to another wallet.When you come across such post avoid it at all cost, don't ever think you can outsmart the scammer or that you can be fast enough to send out the funds.",

      "body": "As said, it's not an old scamming trick. Maybe you've seen it for the first time but they've been doing that a long time ago and the same goes for those wallets that have tokens in ERC20 and they'll attract people to send ETH on it. For which, they have it on a smart contract and will also automatically send those sent Ethereum on that wallet to their own addresses. That's a trick that will victimize newbies that are greedy, remember that even if we're in the crypto market and there are airdrops and giveaways, do not fall for much for free money.",

The scammer would simply just use scripts/bots to be able to frontrun the victim(which will most likely try to take the funds manually).And yea, this ain't new either.",

Because my private key is known to others. So I know that my wallet is not safe and I try to move my balance but it always loses fast. I think they are using a robot to do the transaction. So our hands lose fast with human-made robots. Until now I have always ignored any notifications in my chat when it comes to assets, offers, or requests for help. Newbies may need to emulate my ignorance so as not to get caught by a thief.",

Probably scammer will use bot or simply fast hand it when theres a coin or token deposited on the wallet he is using. He can be notified by using some bots notifier when a token or coin drops on his wallet. Then goodbye, to that tokens. Only newbie would fall on this obvious trick actually.",
