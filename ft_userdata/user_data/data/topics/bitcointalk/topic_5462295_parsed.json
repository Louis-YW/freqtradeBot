On one hand, brick and mortar casinos and resorts have existed much time before internet was invented, so they have specialized on serving people in a variety of ways: hotel services, drinks, entertainment, restaurants, etc. It is a big investment, but it is profitable. On the other hand, we have services which focus on providing gambling without having such a huge infrastructure and are relatively new in comparison to traditional casinos.While anyone can play on a casino online, most of people have known about the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, not for it's webpage or the possible online service they can provide, but for the resort and the luxury associated to it and the experience of visiting in person.",

That you could gamble table games online like in some net casinos you can play on live tables?I guess that's an idea, but that's technically a whole different area than dealing with physical casino. You would think that it would be easier, and in many ways it would be, but it would be so much different that i am not sure if casinos are even prepare to handle online casinos.I have a feeling that they would have tried it if they managed to enter successfully to the market that has so much competition already. But it's a whole different game to handle physical casino, hotel, bars etc, than a server being able to handle so much traffic. If it would be cost efficient, i am sure that they would have those more.",

      "body": "Why would they if they are already getting more than enough money from their patrons that visit their physical casinos? It would just be something that will take resources from them. Plus, usually these physical casino owners have other businesses that are tied to their casinos like hotels and restaurants, so they are hitting a lot of birds in just one stone. Their online presence would be limited to just their advertisements and promotions, and that's basically it. Taking a lot of energy, resources, and time to develop an online copy of what is already physically existing is just a waste of everything.Besides, why would they want to limit the experience and feel of their physical casino if that's the one thing that people are traveling and visiting them for?",

We know that building a casino whether online or offline isnt really that cheap on which means that it would really be speaking about some extra cost on which it would really be just that normal that they would be skeptical on building one but rather they would be putting up focus on physical. Some might be having no interest or does mind themselves on having expansion. Why would really be needing to touch up other space if they do find out themselves making revenue on offline? Well, its not a bad idea though even lets assume that im an owner or investor then i would definitely be going into different spaces which having that chances on catching up revenue on both spaces or sources.",

Perhaps they do not want to mix the image of an internet casino with that of their physical casinos? I really don't know. But I understand there is a world of difference between the physical casino experience and the online casino experience. A internet casino feels a bit cheaper and antisocial, therefore the physical version is preferred, as the image of what kind of experience they are trying to sell to their customers.",

There are only a certain number of gamblers and if they aren't frequenting the casinos, then casino will start closing the doors. Basically, you would see alot more bankruptcy suits in the casino industry because people will sit at home and gamble vs going to the casino and enjoying time out of their houses.",

Why don't they maximize their service in online platforms? I think that is the big question here. That's because they also want to maximize their profits in hotel and resort which is a big part of the business. The casino is most likely just for entertainment and leisure. Businesses who only focuses on casinos are most likely to not recreate their business thru online because it will require more documents and I believe another additional tax.",

Just recently we have seen unfortunate cases where online casinos have scammed users and disappeared with their deposits, often due to unknown teams and creators behind these platforms In my opinion I feel, maybe the owners prefer a kind of casino business where people come together and interact in physical while they stake on different games, most times it's very entertaining than the virtual casinos, also based on the more entertaining Benefits this system offers it's very beneficial in the attraction of tourists to come have fun and most times these casinos own a night club and hotels that people could have more fun with thereby making more profi. However since the introduction of technology into gambling there came the introduction of online casinos where people could stake comfortably with their device at point in time, so few land casinos have also included online casinos in their company to follow the new trend and attract customers that are not opportuned to visit the casino due to some circumstances.",

Moreover the land based casino are enjoying their business because they are making profits from different source like drinks,hotels,strippers and many more. It is not just gambling alone but you can interact with people and have fun by enjoying the atmosphere of the casino which will make you want to go back as a gambler. Online casino needs much resources to set up and if you don't accept cryptocurrency,it might be a big challenge for the casino. Land base can accept any currency as long as they are cool with your payment method because you privilege to talk to the management face to face. Land base casino can be used as a tourist center.",

In Spain it is very famous the Gran Madrid Casino which has not only several buildings in the capital city but also online gambling (mobile, desktop and even television, at dawn, in one of the main tv channels in the country).I guess that for many legacy casinos whose business is still profitable it is simply much trouble to open different channels, but I think that there is no doubt that future generations will demand more and more online services.",
