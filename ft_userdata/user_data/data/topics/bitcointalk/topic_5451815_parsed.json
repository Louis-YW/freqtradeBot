If you have failing trading system, the confidence is not there anymore. This is why at any time you begin to make profit, the confidence level increases. However, building a profitable system is a task that is very difficult to achieve.Quote from: Kara3 on May 07, 2023, 10:51:15 AM- you can't be disciplined without a profitable system.How do you mean by this maybe you need to explain on this  Being disciplined IMO is not about having a profitable system because you can be loosing while being discipline as losing can also be temporary.",

Trading is not 90% psychology it is 100% real and have rules. I agree that control over ones emotions is a necessity for traders but calling it a 90% psychological game isn't a fair statement regarding trading.Your confidence automatically builds up when you trade for more than a year. You will learn that trading requires understanding of the market during that year and your mistakes will guide you as a teacher. Even if you have a profitable system you won't have consistent gains. Trading isn't an easy thing and having constant gains with it is almost impossible unless you own a supernatural power.You are wrong because a trader can be disciplined without gaining profits most of the time. It's the losses that help you to be disciplined. If you lose more you chances will increase because you will have learnt big lessons from the losses.Now the final statement makes sense as it's required to have a profitable system set with proper plans, good strategies and timing. If all those are with you then your chances for having good profits is a confirm thing. You should also keep in mind that trading isn't a get rich quick scheme and that's why a proper trading system is required with have good gains from it.",

And it will be great to see your reply on what system you were talking about because that will give us more understanding for more discussion. There is no doubt in the fact that trading is accustomed to risk but how the trader manages such risk is what matter whether he remains in profit or loses.",

To succeed in trading over the long run, a good trading strategy is also essential. A successful trading strategy lays the groundwork for acquiring self-assurance, achieving steady profits, and maintaining a disciplined attitude.
