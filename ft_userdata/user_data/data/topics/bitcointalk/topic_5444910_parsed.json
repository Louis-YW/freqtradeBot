Based from my perspective, while you need to register & have wallet in the site is not really on-chain gambling.Because, If you register your fund still can be hold (you can be ask KYC). Meanwhile on-chain gambling should be without any human/site touch and everything is automatically based on the smart-contract for the bet.",

Even after clarifying the question to the list of gambling games on blockchain technology, I still get just a list of games without any mentions of sites.QuoteHere are some examples of on-chain gambling games:Dice: A simple game where players bet on the outcome of a roll of a virtual dice.Lottery: A game where players purchase tickets for a chance to win a jackpot. The winner is chosen randomly through a smart contract.Blackjack: A card game where players aim to have a higher hand than the dealer without going over 21.Roulette: A game where players bet on where a ball will land on a spinning wheel.Slot machines: A game where players bet on the outcome of a random spin of virtual reels.Sports betting: A game where players bet on the outcome of a sports event.Poker: A card game where players bet on the strength of their hand and the ability to bluff their opponents.These games are typically powered by blockchain technology, which ensures the fairness and transparency of the game results.",

At this point it's pretty clear that ChatGPT is still learning and gathering data, so it can't provide accurate answers on most questions. Do you people think that these forum threads about ChatGPT add any value to the discussions in the Gambling forum? I don't think so. Basically anyone could create an OpenAI account and play around with ChatGPT. I'm not interested in doing such thing, because I'm buzzy with more important work right now.   Is it really that interesting to read a bunch of plagiarized info gathered from the internet by a bot?",

They are simple, easy to play, and offer a fast-paced betting experience. The rules of the game are straightforward: the player chooses a number between 1 and 100, and if the dice roll matches the chosen number, the player wins.2.Lottery games: On-chain lottery games allow users to participate in a lottery draw using cryptocurrency. The game is based on the same principles as traditional lotteries, where players purchase tickets and hope to win a prize in the draw.3.Casino games: On-chain casino games offer a wide range of classic casino games, such as blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. These games are designed to simulate the experience of playing in a real casino, with the added benefit of provable fairness through blockchain technology.4.Sports betting: On-chain sports betting platforms allow users to bet on the outcome of various sports events, including football, basketball, and horse racing. The bets are placed using cryptocurrency, and the outcomes are determined using smart contracts.5.Poker: On-chain poker games are multiplayer games that allow players to participate in Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and other popular variants of the game. These games offer a fair and transparent gaming experience, with the use of smart contracts to ensure that the game is played fairly.Some popular on-chain gambling games include FunFair, CryptoGames, and Edgeless, among others. It is important to note that the legality of on-chain gambling games varies from country to country, so users should check their local regulations before participating in these games.",

However, some sites, such as Bitvest, are not based on blockchain or smart contracts. So, I believe Bitvest is not an on-chain gambling site.Exactly,  these above listed Casinos are  strange to me as well except SatoshiDice https://satoshidice.com/ , the SatoshiDice you have to deposit bitcoin before playing and the amount to deposit is stated on the horizontal line on a bar. You roll the bar to select the minimum or the maximum amount to play. The BitKong the bonus package is very high, I think people that are gambling have not seen it, they have paid $30 millions wins, that is a huge amount of money to have paid. One of the good this I discovered in the casino is that, it accept all Cryptocurrencies. I wish this casino has Representative here in the forum with a running signature campaign. The casino is good. https://bitkong.com/Bustabit https://www.bustabit.com/ is a crash game whereby multiple players are needed to play the game. Not everyone understands this kind of games. Well it will be a well try casino.Bitvest, this casino is complicating to understand, it just looks like Lotto site https://bitvest.io/. I didn't understand anything there.Chain-Bet, there is no Chain-Bet but it is ChainBet, the hyphen is not found in the domain. https://chainbet.gg/. BitRun , it has domain as a casino https://bitrun.ir/, https://devpost.com/software/bitrunLuckyBit is a familiar site but not known. Wow!! What a nice site. It is a good trying. https://luckybit.io/",
