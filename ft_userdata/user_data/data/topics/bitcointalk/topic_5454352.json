  "content": "Zephyr ProtocolThe Untraceable Over-Collateralized Stablecoin ProtocolZephyr is a revolutionary digital currency that combines the principles of privacy and stability. Grounded firmly on the proven Minimal Djed protocol, Zephyr embodies the first over-collateralized, private stablecoin, seamlessly incorporating the privacy features of Monero into a stablecoin system. The Djed protocol, which draws inspiration from AgeUSD, is a collaborative brainchild of Emurgo, IOHK, and the Ergo Foundation.STABLECOIN MECHANISMIn simple terms, Zephyr Protocol works as follows. Users can mint or redeem stable (ZEPHUSD) and reserve (ZEPHRSV) coins in exchange for the base coin (ZEPH). The price for stable coins is determined by a pricing oracle, the price for reserve coins is determined using a formula based on the current reserve data. When minting new stable/reserve coins the base coins that are exchanged (+ fee) get added to the Zephyr reserve. This reserve is the collateral backing for the stablecoin holders and is ensured to be above 400% collateral at all times. In the event that collateralization falls below 400% due to price decrease, new stable coins are unable to be minted, however the reserve coin price will drop giving incentive for users to buy reserve coins at a reduced rate. Reserve coin holders are entitled to redeem their reserve coins for the amount of equity in the reserve based on their proportion of reserve coin holdings. This means that as stablecoins are minted and redeemed, the accumulated fees will build up in the reserve as profit for holders of the reserve coin. There is a maximum reserve ratio of 800% to prevent dilution for the reserve coin holders.A more detailed explanation is present in the Zephyr whitepaper here: https://www.zephyrprotocol.com/s/Zephyr_Whitepaper_v1.pdfThe DJED whitepaper can be found here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1069.pdfTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONSTotal Supply: 18.4 MillionBlock Time: 120 secondsAssets: ZEPH (Base Currency) | ZEPHUSD (USD Stablecoin) | ZEPHRSV (Reserve Currency) Mining Algorithm: RandomX proof-of-work (PoW) optimized for general-purpose CPUs to promote decentralization and egalitarian mining.Emission Curve: Zephyr has been designed with a slightly slower emission curve compared to Monero. This design choice is aimed at rewarding early adopters by reducing their dilution over time. By slowing the initial emission, the potential inflationary impact on the price of ZEPH is lessened, benefitting the stability of the algorithmic stablecoin system.FEATURESMinimal Djed-Based Stablecoin: Zephyr Protocol implements the Minimal Djed protocol, an innovative design that avoids the risk of liquidation typically found in CDP-based stablecoins. By ensuring the stablecoin supply is always substantially collateralized, Zephyr provides users with a reliable and stable asset.Privacy: Inheriting from the Monero codebase (v18), Zephyr ensures untraceable, private transactions. By using advanced cryptographic techniques such as Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, and RingCT, Zephyr guarantees your transactions remain private and secure. Crucially, this privacy feature is present in the base, reserve and stablecoin currencies.Decentralization: Zephyr remains true to the ethos of decentralization, fostering a system where integrity and security are upheld through a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network.ROADMAPQ2 2023 - Mainnet launch- Exchange Listings (for oracle)Q3 2023 - Testnet for Minimal Djed Implementation- Marketing and brandingQ3/Q4 2023 - Launch Minimal Djed Implementation on MainnetLate Q4 2023 - Extended DJED researchQ1-Q2 2024 - Extended DJED implementationFUNDING AND SUSTAINABILITYAdequate funding is of paramount importance for the success and longevity of a project like Zephyr. This is why Zephyr has a robust treasury fund of 500,000 ZEPH, which not only covers operational costs but primarily serves as a strong reserve. This reserve is designed to bolster the protocol during adverse market conditions and provide liquidity when required, thus ensuring the protocol's stability and resilience.In addition, Zephyr incorporates a 5% governance fee to guarantee ongoing development, marketing, and other operational activities. This fee facilitates the continuous enhancement of the Zephyr ecosystem, improving its features, user experience, and overall functionality. It also allows Zephyr to keep pace with technological advances and market trends.These funding mechanisms are crucial for the project's longevity and robustness. By ensuring not only the protocol's launch but also its continuous growth and adaptation to the evolving needs of its users and the wider crypto market, Zephyr stands as a testament to a self-sustaining, resilient, and evolving protocol that is prepared for success in the long run.MININGSimple instructions:Download or build a Zephyr wallet from github to generate an address.Download or build mining softer (e.g. xmrig - https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases)Choose a mining pool from the list belowEdit config files or run with args e.g: ./xmrig -o pool.zephyrprotocol.com:3333 -u YOUR_ADDRESS -p x -k -a rx/0MINING POOLSOfficial Pool: https://pool.zephyrprotocol.com/TBAPlease spread hashrate over all pools as they are added to avoid mining centralization!SPECIFIC MINING POOL INFOIf you want to support Zephyr on your existing pool this info is important! Zephyr requires a custom “cnBlobType” defined in cryptoforknote-util.Please visit the pool and custom zephyr-cryptoforknote-util reposhttps://github.com/ZephyrProtocol/zephyr-pool https://github.com/ZephyrProtocol/zephyr-cryptoforknote-util Alternatively, we have now submitted a PR for node-cryptoforknote-util that will allow you to add Zephyr to your pool here: https://github.com/MoneroOcean/node-cryptoforknote-util/pull/21Please contact the team on discord if you need more information.LINKSWebsite: https://www.zephyrprotocol.com/Explorer: https://explorer.zephyrprotocol.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/zephyr_orgDiscord: https://discord.gg/y4mzbDYSqQ Github: https://github.com/ZephyrProtocol/ZephyrWhitepaper: https://www.zephyrprotocol.com/s/Zephyr_Whitepaper_v1.pdfCLI/GUI DOWNLOADSv0.2.0: https://github.com/ZephyrProtocol/zephyr/releases/tag/v0.2.0ExchangesSeven Seas - https://www.sevenseas.exchange/market/ZEPH-USDTNonKYC- https://nonkyc.io/market/ZEPH_USDT- https://nonkyc.io/market/ZEPH_BTC- https://nonkyc.io/market/ZEPH_XMR",

Please follow these steps if you are having trouble with your wallet.If you are still stuck feel free to message in the ⁠wallet-help channel but please try your best to follow along here first.Important understandingzephyrd is the Zephyr Daemon. This is what syncs with the blockchain.The wallet needs to be connected to a synced daemon in order to display balances correctly.if your daemon is not synced, your wallet will NOT work!-----Zephyr Daemon-----Step 1:Close all instances of zephyr-wallet-gui and zephyrdthe wallet can open zephyrd in the background, be sure to close it in task manager!Step 2:Open zephyrdyou can type status in order to ensure it is 100% synced.If you don't get this, its likely a firewall issue.Open ports 17766 and 17767 and/or allow zephyrd in your firewall settings.-----Zephyr Wallet (GUI)-----i.e. Balance is 0 or incorrectNOTE: ENSURE ZEPHYRD IS WORKING FIRST^^^if you have had trouble with your zephyrd, its likely that the wallet will need to be rescanned.Step 1:Navigate to Settings -> infoset your wallet restore height to 0 Step 2:Navigate to Settings -> Wallet.Click rescan wallet balance-----Zephyr Wallet (CLI)-----If you use the cli, or still have too much trouble with the gui you can opt to use the cli.ensure you run zephyrd first.if you are migrating from GUI:parse in the wallet locations or simply copy over the wallet files to the same directory as zephyr-wallet-cli - file path is stated in Settings -> info.Default path is <User>\\Documents\\Zephyr\\wallets\\<wallet_name>rescan_bc will rescan the blockchain.you may have wallet creation height issues, you can set it to 0 with this commandset refresh-from-block-height 0then rescan againrescan_bcHope this helps!",
