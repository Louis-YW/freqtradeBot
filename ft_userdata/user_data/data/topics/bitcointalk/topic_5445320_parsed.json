What did you mean?  Obyte has wallet sofwares for Windows, MacOs, Android, iOS. You can download them from download and can receive or send Obyte directly in wallet. If you want privacy, you can use their privacy currency Blackbytes in chat by pairing two wallets of receiver and sender.Blackbytes",

It was neat but i could never actually send the blackbtyes anywhere, I kept getting an error.It’s good that it’s still alive, I will check it out.",

      "body": "One of the main benefits that blackbytes offers is that it allows users to transact without leaving their own customizable transaction records. I think this is its main magnet so it can be very useful for individuals who wish to keep their financial activities private or who live in places where government surveillance and censorship is a concern.I think blackbytes is an innovative, privacy-focused alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, and its popularity will likely continue to grow as more users realize the benefits it offers.",

I remember it being called Gigabyte and I remember getting the free airdrops just by having a Bitcoin balance.Initially it is Byteball project which later was rebranded to Obyte.Coinmarkecap does have a note that project was rebranded. I guess they only add such notes for rebranded projects after a day they deployed that note on their website. Byteball rebranded years ago, not in the last bull run.However if you come to their wallet download page, you will see their wallet description as \"Download your Obyte (Byteball) wallet\"",
