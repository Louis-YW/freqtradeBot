I'm surprised.To be very honest I also thought copy trading is already exist in Binance. As I am seeing the option of copy trading from a long ago. But I as many members are discussing and from there discussions I can conclude that those copy trading features which Binance was providing before was via 3rd party platforms but now they introduced there own in future trading. One thing more, there was a option of leaderboard where all the trading results are shared I think I am mixing the option of copy trading with that. Well I do not know for sure because I did not performed copy trading in my life. But let's see how it turns out to be. PS: I saw you made two consecutive posts, which is not allowed. But I think you are newbie here so please avoid it next time.",

Other wise there are also many other factors present but copy trading has its own benefits too. And to be honest I think Binance will attract more people and might pave the way of adoption too.",

Personally if you ask even though I haven't seen any question asked about it, Copy trading on Binance which should be done with utmost care is more advisable than copy trading done on ByBit. The third party service which Binance uses is Traderwagon and they are a direct partner with Binance.  You can trade using  the funds in your Binance account so you could  just leave your money in your spot account and  then it will transfer to Traderwagon when you use  your account on the website but here is what I love, the money doesn't actually leave Binance. You are sure that your money is safe because of the security of your funds provided by Binance.",
