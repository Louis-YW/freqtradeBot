Major reasons why AI development has not really made any headway in major discussions are which is more important than not having some real effect on the success of this development.",

You know 3 out of 10 is below average, 5 at least is fair but in this case it was not a fair performance. I would have suggested if the AI could identify for him the exact 3 games that will be correct so that he can focus on betting on them with an increased stake since he likes bet multiple for the purpose of winning big. But in the absence of that, he can't be relying on AI for gambling winning. AI is also like using animals to predict like octopus Paul was made to do that but we also know it failed at different instances.",

But AI can analyze lots of sports data to guess which team might win but it's not perfect. You should still use your own judgment and think about things like teamwork and other factors before making bets. In short DYOR.",

      "body": "When I read your thread, I immediately thought: why does this friend of yours keep making multibet bets? According to what you wrote, he keeps making multibet bets because he wants to win a lot, but this idea of winning a lot is relative, in the sense that if he spent 1 month making simple bets and placing, for example, the amount won on the next bet, something like today he makes 3 bets in which he puts 5$ on each bet and on each bet he has 2.00 odds and gets all 3 bets right, so he will have 30$, tomorrow he repeats the same process, but puts 10$ on each bet, so when he gets it right he will be left with 60$, if he does this for a month then he could start winning a lot, I'm assuming he was able to get the games right using the AI.now if he is putting money into the multi bets and constantly loses, then he will be spending money that he could use in the real world to buy other things and by doing this, he will start to get frustrated and will not accept defeat and will continue playing until he is bankrupt, this problem of gambling and losing a lot is something very unpleasant that causes pain and nonconformity on the part of many people, in many places that talk about sports betting and there is a consensus that making sports bets is something that the person, despite the person being obliged to, Looking at it as fun, the person also needs to be careful with multibet bets, because multibet bets are like lottery tickets, in multibet bets the person depends on luck",

AI can't make any sports betting predictions for you, you will end up wasting precious time that you should have used in doing your own research and analysis before placing a bet. And you will even lose more if you use AI's prediction to place a bet than if you did if were to place a bet based on the result of your analysis.
