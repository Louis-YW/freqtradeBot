  "content": "A significant milestone for Bitcoin from 2009 to date. And many mining companies mined it. AntPool received $275,500 for mining it. source This is another milestone for the Bitcoin ecosystem for Bitcoin hitting block 888,888. The adoption of Bitcoin rising day and night and with that the mining also increase and today it has hit it thousands and now it is going to the millions. And it is very closed to the million and before the next halving Bitcoin will be mined 1,000,000 plus. This shows the progressive nature of bitcoin and it decentralized nature.",

This is a real milestone Bitcoin has come far and it is still continues. This day should not be forgotten and the day when the blocks will hit 1000000 will be an another milestone to achieve. As the Op Said, now that Bitcoin has hit 888888 blocks, then 2028 halving, Bitcoin will be 1 million plus because the number is very close now.",

If you aren't sure which one I pointed out is that it's this one which I have checked before checking the other link on op.
