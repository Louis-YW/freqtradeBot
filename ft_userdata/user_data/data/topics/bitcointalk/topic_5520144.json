And as we all know, Trump's political agenda and I will say that it's a big factor for him winning is because of his commitment to Bitcoin and crypto in general.And after winning the election, he had started to make news about how he will make crypto great in America and probably this is a very welcoming news for us specially once he officially sworn as the next President next year and creating this pro-crypto role.",

Alongside the news that several senators have proposed making bitcoin a strategic reserve, there are also reports that Trump is planning to meet with the CEO of Coinbase to fill a new position in his administration. Does this have anything to do with your news? Or the news that he is also considering Teresa Goody Guillén to replace Gary as SEC chair...Overall, there are a lot of positives about the Trump 2.0 administration for crypto and that could be why bitcoin keeps hitting all-time highs every day.https://x.com/RadarHits/status/1859003622144831742But I think the bigger news contributing to today's bitcoin rally is that Chinese court has ruled that owning bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is legal. This would open up the possibility that China will lift its cryptocurrency ban in the future, possibly even as early as this year. Bitcoin crossed the $98k after the news was released.https://x.com/BTC_Archive/status/1859548499706073230",

But things will definitely shift once he’s in office and the real work begins. For now, no complaints, let’s keep this kind of news coming since it only fuels the bullish momentum.Recently, they announced plans to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin for their strategic reserve. That alone speaks volumes, they’ll need crypto experts to manage this, ensuring they maximize profits while minimizing risks.",

This is just Senator Lummis' idea, not a plan or proposal that has been presented to the president for consideration or Congress for approval, so it's too early to say whether this will ever become a reality. Politicians can say whatever they think, we shouldn't take it too seriously. It only becomes noteworthy and worthy of our attention when they turn the idea into a real proposal and present it to parliament. I think we shouldn't make too many predictions and put too much hope just because of random words from politicians. We need to wait until Trump officially becomes president and takes power, then what happens next. Because if he doesn't keep his promise and doesn't act bitcoin friendly then no one will dare to think about this idea anymore.",

Maybe SEC has proven to be an enemy of the scam crypto industry, but he certainly hasn't proven to be an enemy of BTC - because what is happening now is largely the result of positive decisions by that same SEC. Some will say that the lawsuits forced them to do it, but if we are honest, I think that they waited for a reason until the futures&spot BTC ETFs were approved - because everything bad that could happen with it is somehow their responsibility.I think people are their own worst enemies in the world of cryptocurrency - and if they want the Wild West, it looks like they'll get it.",

Or it can be said that the world economy is in the hands of these two countries so it is not surprising that everyone is interested in anything related to them. China is a formidable rival of the United States and as far as I know, they have never given up on their goal of taking the world number 1 position from the United States. So they will try not to fall behind the United States in any field. They may not like bitcoin but if Trump creates a race for bitcoin demand and the whole world has to follow, China cannot stay out of it.",

China banned cryptocurrency trading a few years ago, while on the other hand, India is not very friendly when it comes to cryptocurrencies - so where does this data on adaptation come from? Those who were around when BTC was still \"legal\" in China know that everything that happened there was always in some way a threat to BTC - and in fact the best thing that happened was that they banned it.If BTC were legal in China and the same country still held a monopoly on mining, does anyone think that spot ETFs would be approved in the US and that Mr. Donald would have the attitude he has today?",
