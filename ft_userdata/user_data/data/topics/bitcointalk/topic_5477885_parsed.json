I was to late. didn't you just get rid of all your kialaras? or were those all duplicate/extras? I just sold 3 of these 2021 pieces over the last 3 weeks and they all went for over $1200.00. Thats how I know it was a steal. I buy whole collections \"treasures\" from people and then sell them off or people give me their collection and i sell it off for them, so they don't have to deal with it.Â  I don't just sell cold storage wallets, I sell gold, silver bullion, coins, paintings, antiques, gems, experiences, rentals, cars, rare fruits, rare seeds and literally anything that could be considered a Caribbean Treasure. These gold pieces are made from the broken rings and chains acquired in the Caribbean and turned into rare CT gold cold storage. I believe 10-12 pieces will be available by years end.",
