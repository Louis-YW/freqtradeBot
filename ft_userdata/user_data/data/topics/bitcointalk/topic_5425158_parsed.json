If you really believe in bitcoin and believe bitcoin will rise again in future then continue DCA don't worry too much about bitcoin bottom. If you want to wait for the lowest price, sometimes you will miss the opportunity to own cheap bitcoin because bitcoin can rise again at any time. Go ahead DCA is the best solution.",

Would be interesting to hear everyone's prediction when it comes to how low Bitcoin will go before the next bull run?0.07BTC is already fair amount assuming Bitcoin will hit new ATH or the old peak around 65K because that will you already x4 of your initial investment that currently around 1100$. There’s no guarantee that price will that much because the only way for Bitcoin to suffer that huge price loss is when there’s a serious negative events on crypto that involves money loss in huge amount.DCA on many price point using smaller amount is better to have an average investment. The price swing of Bitcoin is too often while DCA on longer time frames will miss this good opportunity to enter. I suggest that you should DCA many times if you have a stable source of income. Any Bitcoin the purchased below ATH is considered as discounted price.",

Maybe the bottom that we saw when FTX did the biggest ponzi scheme in the whole crypto might be the bottom and we might see Bitcoin go up starting from now. Papa Powell decreased the increase of federal funds rate from 75 basis points to now 50 basis points and that might be a good sign. $12,000 is still possible knowing that we are still in a bear market but highly unlikely for me. DCA is still the best thing to do, and it's proven already that it can give you profit in the long term.",

But if you can get away with it and learn to be resilient and look for the longer term, then it will be worth when you see your portfolio growing. So just continue what you do and you will be good.",

Let's hope this doesn't happen and it turns into a Bull Run.I think continuing DCA is better because we realize that no matter how good the prediction is, it's just an opinion, it doesn't mean we already know what will happen next.",

We have bottomed out for the year and if you are patient enough to invest long term I trust you you will get a big ROI down the road.We must learn from people who have achieved great success in investing in BTC where they are able to hold back their emotions not to sell at low prices, which at the previous ATH they were able to become billionaires and that has become history for us to follow in the upcoming ATH  .",

Difficult to imagine that price will crash to $12,000. The possible reason for another crash should be a \"big thing\" to consider before it can trigger the pull. However, there's nothing wrong if that's what you think since everyone has their own factors in forming an analysis.Conclusion: Follow your own analysis whether properly and technically analyzed or just a product of your instinct based on your own factors.",
