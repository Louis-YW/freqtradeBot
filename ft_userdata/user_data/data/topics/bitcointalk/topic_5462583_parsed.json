Quote from: Danydee on August 09, 2023, 08:08:12 PM2. about 2nd rule.. what about campaigns that are not (per post) paying ??You can do the math and calculate how much they actually pay per post.Some campaign could pay $300 per week in total and ask for 200 posts, so that is obviously not highest paying campaign.That is why I am also asking for maximum number of posts Quote from: Woodie on August 09, 2023, 07:47:08 AM1. icopress2. MixTum, $6, $210 max, 35 max.3. icopress, Carollzinha , Hhampuz & Royse7774. NoWoodie.Please make another post and include only 3 managers in third question.You cant have both Hhampuz and Royse777 in the same place, and I will do total amount they pay to all participants to calculate higher paying campaign.",

      "body": "Right now it looks too easy and obvious answers. You need something that is not always in public and at the end of the round you will ask the campaign manager to validate the prediction. Use calendar week. Like right now we are in week # 32 so this prediction game will stay x weeks long and the week starts from calendar week # 33 or week #34. The questions can be like: - Which manager will send highest total payout and the campaign name.- Name three manager who will pay total highest payout in a week in the given calendar time frame from highest to lower.- Which manager will pay highest number of participants in a week and the campaign name- Which manager will pay lowest number of participants and the campaign nameThese are just some idea, feel free to improve yourself :-) I think this will make the game more interesting as the participants really needs to do their analysis and post their prediction.Edit, just giving some direct opinion of the questions right now you have:Quote1. Predict ONE Bitcointalk Campaign Manager with Highest Paying Campaign in bitcointalk forum.Highest paying in what? weekly individual total or weekly total payment of the campaign. If you are meaning the weekly total payment for a week then it's interesting but weekly individual total is easy to predict.Quote2. Predict exact name of campaign, amount of money users will be paid per post, per week, and max number of posts per week.Again if this is for individual then I think easy to predict.Quote3. Predict first three campaign managers in exact order of highest paying campaigns.I guess you are meaning total weekly payment in a campaign then again it sounds like very similar to #1",
