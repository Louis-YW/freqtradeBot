He only succeeded in proving to the world how less knowledgeable he is about the bitcoin technology. Admittedly, with his drivel claims, any cryptocurrency enthusiast knows Bitcoin better than him. He was actually chasing clout and needed validations to appear meaningful in the eyes of the law. Don't know about his assets, but, not specific, could recall reading a blog that mentioned his seized money amounting to a million dollar. For running, he's a joke and is adding to his pains and failure. Amazingly, with his vile thoughts and ideas he may have assumed running would get the charges on him quashed.",

So he deserves all amount of lawsuits thrown towards him and also deserves a prison time for his wrongdoings. Have you guys checked his website? I have copied the below text from his website - https://craigwright.net/QuoteLEGAL NOTICE:DR CRAIG STEVEN WRIGHT IS NOT SATOSHI NAKAMOTOOn 20 May 2024, Dr Craig Steven Wright was found by the High Court of England and Wales to have been dishonest in his claims to have been the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin).The Court found that Dr Wright “lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly” in his evidence and that he attempted to create a false narrative by forging documents “on a grand scale” and presenting them in evidence. Overall, “all his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.” In advancing his false claim to be Satoshi through multiple legal actions, Dr Wright committed “a most serious abuse” of the process of the courts of the UK, Norway and the USA. The High Court formally declared as follows:First, that Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.Second, Dr Wright is not the owner of the copyright in the Bitcoin White Paper.Third, Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period between 2008 and 2011.Fourth, Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system.Fifth, Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin Software.The full judgment, and its appendix detailing various forged documents created by Dr Wright, is accessible at the following URL: https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/copa-v-wright/.Dr Wright has been ordered not to commence any legal proceedings based on his false claims (by claim or counterclaim) or procure any other person to do so. He has also been ordered not to threaten any such proceedings (explicitly or implicitly) or procure any other person to do so. Justice served!",

He could face Arrest or extradition, depending on his location. He deserves to be tried for impersonation, forgery, and lying before a court. All the documents he presented before the court were forged. His oral statement contradicted itself and the judge called him a man with a low IQ, hence he cannot be equated to the Bitcoin inventor. I think the UK government should go ahead with the trial and let him go to jail. The government should used Interpol to track his current location and extradite him to face his sins.

The judge ruled that his assets that is worth €6 Million be frozen to stop Faketoshi from moving these funds offshore thereby evading costs filled by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). There was suspicion that he wanted to move some of these assets to a Singaporean firm.",

But people should be very careful in believing what's out in the cyberspace. Don't screw up your funds for some strangers telling you that they know about an investment you can reap high profits. Also, I am thinking that CW may have realized that he can't escape in the eyes of law this time as they are the ones proving that he is indeed committing perjury. He can say all he wants but the law is stating otherwise. So which one will dictate where his life will be?",

Also asnutilda pointed out there is money owed to his backers now as they see it,things could get very ugly for faketoshi!He wont stand and face the consequences because he knows its futile, he hasbeen found out, the house of cards has toppled and they are in mid air on their wayto the ground.Only a matter of time before the house of cards got too big for CSW and thatthey would come crashing down, justice is on its way to being served.",
