  "content": "**** OPENING 16th September **** Hey, Not sure where best to post this really but I am working to open a Bitcoin Hub in the UK which will be based in Bury, Greater Manchester.Our goal is to Educate and onboard users into the Bitcoin space, of course we will be an actual business so will also be taking dirty fiat to pay the bills and suppliers! We’ll have weekly workshops, a lightning bar, a lightning arcade, art space (Yes NFTs!), a custom lightning drinks menu (Including Brave Bull, Minetini, Gold rush etc) and plenty more on the planning! Currently funding will cover us to open 3 days a week, probably 16:30/17:00 to 22:30 Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The workshop and event schedule will be added to our site (and updated here) once we are open. I’ve been screwed many times by the banks and expect to be again but my thought is that we’ll need this eventually so why not now! This is the website: https://satoshisplace.co.uk/This is the twitter: https://twitter.com/satoshisplaceukThe final parts to take place & complete before we can set an opening date: - Interviews, essential is Bar staff but we’d ideally hiring a chef aswell- Funding to buy some final equip, projector/screen & laptops are essential but TVs, custom beers & outdoor signage are ideal- Fibre install (Up to 28 day install time) Ideally we’d like the Fibre setup before opening as this is a USP for hot-desking, for visitors and we think a must for workshops.",

LN msats are not bitcoinsthe pegging of the 1sat:1000msats are not locked into code law to never break. be clear about the risks and warnings of using other networksdont gimmick it as 'bitcoin 2.0'",

LN is a different network (the hint is in the N of LN)2. different network = bitcoins are not on that network.. 3. why.. because bitcoins dont leave the bitcoin network.. logic. simplei got no problem with people advertising that they accept some pegged/backed sub-net/side chain/custodial Mysql balance/giftcard/niche service.. but they need to be clear about what it does and doesnt do and what it actually is and isntif they pretend they are educators. they need to show they know the differences between using/learning the real bitcoin network. vs the subnets that peg/bridge between blockchainsEGimagine someone else opened up a satoshi shop. and was saying he was going to educate people about bitcoin network and get people onboard the bitcoin network.. then offered out binance chain WBTC.. would you think thats the same thing. or would you highlight the different networks and how a WBTC is not the same as a real btc. and how the different networks actualy differ and why hoarding on the actual bitcoin network means more than temporarily using another network for its niche service of faster payments. and suggesting the different risks can can be applied to the differencesi say all this because its been shown many many times that people get introduced to some fast subnet/sidechain with all the salespitch buzzwords of promise of bitcoin (security, reliability, immutability and guarantee of transaction confirmation, store of value assurance, deflation etc) by saying the subnet is (wrongly) 'bitcoin but better'.where they are promoted into being told to hold those subnet units of measure long term for months and never settle out into the bitcoin blockchain(due to fee's and other excuses not to touch the actual bitcoin network...)and later their pegged value breaks(numerous sidechains have failed, LN liquidity failures, unbacked funding commitments disappear and cant be used etc) or some other problem where payments on the subnet/sidechain are not successful and they start to think the promoter lied to them about the magic of what they were told... then they see the actual bitcoin network and see the 10min confirms(they were not told about because they only got told about instant LN) where bitcoin is not the super fast instant promise they were told about and so they call the entire bitcoin promotion they heard of, as a scam.. even though what they were promoted was a subnet pretending to be bitcoin(its the over promising overselling of utopia and then people not receiving that same actual experience)rather then being explained what the actual bitcoin network is in the first place and the other network offering is just a side service for niche SHORT TERM utility.(underseling and not over promising is actually the better and most honest way to pitch something)",

We started renting the site back in 2018 and I had a Coffee Shop accepting BTC and hosting a few Bitcoin meetups, we then converted to a Pizzeria  (Yes selling Pizza for BTC and having awesome BTC Pizza Days!) but illness, COVID and decent pizza chef closed all that!  Nice idea!

Here's a video we uploaded to Twitter, not sure it'll come through on here: https://twitter.com/i/status/1555847742748086272For our cocktail list we had Minetini, Negroni Nakamoto, Gold Rush, Brave Bull, Surviving the Bear and Lightning Fast. Great feedback all round really on all of them! We took payments (Just small payments for these) on the two main terminals we have: FastBitcoins: CoinCorner: NOTE : These aren't the actual prices of the drinks, it is just a mockup with temp prices we have been running! I have been working on the feedback and reviewing notes as I'd like to set an opening date soon! The main delays have been waiting on 3rd parties (Mainly Virgin to install the fibre) to do their job and funds. As many know Satoshi's Place is self-funded by CryptoBates Group so when we received a donation to the BTC address yesterday it was absolutely awesome! Amazing to have someone put that faith in us and the project! This makes our path to opening & achieving our goals a lot easier to see & achieve! We'll be creating a Wall of Fame for donations and even if this is our only donation it'll sit proud at our hub! Lastly we are hoping to finalise our plans for our charity formation soon, the charity will be driven with the goals of Educating & Onboarding folk into Bitcoin.The website has been updated slitghly with some more information on our legal setup and tasks!

Either-way and for transparency we’ll be adding a summary of the proposal to our website.- We have been running through the process of Sats Redeem payment on our till.
