  "content": "Translated Topic in Pidgin Language: Governs try to limit de public to access of information and freedom long long time agoOriginal Topic: Governs try to limit access of public to information and freedom since agesAuthor: GazetaBitcoinToday piece of history information come as a sequel to my other posts 1, 2, and 3.Governs no wan make de public fit get information and dem don do everything wey dem fit do kpata-kpata to stop am long long time ago. The popular example na de invention of de printing press for 1884, as e come give big progress for information to dey easy to access and to make people dey free. After Gutenberg invention come enter public eye, de govern no fit hold again de way people fit get information as dem fit translate writings, books and manuscripts for different languages and spread am for different cultures. Na since dat year wey decentralization start. In 1517, de 95 theses wey Martin Luther write dem bin print am for thousands of copies and dem translate am for different languages and wetin him talk about de whole continent come know. As a result of him actions, de church come exclude am as their member. But without him and without de printing press, e dey sure say de protestant reform movement for fail. Na person wey get information na him get power, and in general na de elites - governs, agencies, law enforcement na dem hold information. Or de church as e take be for Martin Luther case, and dem no wan make the public get am because e go mean say dem don lose power.As we come dey enter modern times, but still in de olden days. De time of Cyberpunks, John Gilmore wey be one of dem bin get issue with de NSA. Or maybe I for write say de NSA bin get issue with am? One of de okponge victory of information against oppression na Gilmore wey lead am for 1989, wey him expose to de public secret document. De author of de document bin dey work for Xerox, and NSA bin specifically ask Xerox to destroy de document. John Gilmore bin no gree make dem suppress de information and come post de document for internet. Naso, people come sharply download am in thousands, and de kata-kata between Gilmore and NSA come start. In 1992, another big kata-kata bin take place between John Gilmore and NSA. For obvious reasons (as e relate to suppression of free information), de manuscripts of William Friedman - as people regard am to be de grandfather of cryptography in USA - dem been classify the document, though na de time of WWII him write am. Gilmore no gree dis time, say Friedman work suppose dey available to any person wey dey interested. So him carry NSA go court and him come talk say de reason him request for dem to declassify the book na because of de Freedom of Information Act. Naso, NSA no gree respond to him request, las las na for court of law dem settle de mata. After dat, him come manage to find Friedman book for public library. During the court case dem bin tell am say if him no give de book to de govern, dem go accuse am of espionage wey go fit lead to 10 years in jail, as him bin dey in possession of classified materials. NSA no end there. Dem try to find any other \"sensible\" materials wey dey for public spaces. Gilmore tell de judge say wetin him find already dey public since de book dey for public library and na de same time wey him tell de press about the whole case. After small time, Aegean Park Press come print de book.Gilmore case come become public de moment de govern back-off. Dem drop de charges and dem declassify de manuscripts. John Gilmore win, de people win, as public information remain for public hands, de way e suppose always be.De fight for freedom of speech, for privacy and to make governs irrelevant start long long time ago. Now e dey our hands.",

So everybody needs to wise up.Honestly, you did Justice to this topic that you translated. What annoys me most about all this kind of discussion is that it is human beings like us that are in the government and before they got to those positions, they probably think the way we think now.The question is what usually changes in them that makes them behave the way they do when they have that power that they now have.Is it a systemic issue and if it is a systemic issue then what is the cause and how can we profile solutions to this cuz I believe leaders are like our brothers but when they get there they become Rogue Lions, why can't we make a change how will the change come about.When we talk about all these things I am always curious to ask many questions because it's a huge issue that is trickles down to one thing which is CORRUPTION. I know human nature can make us corrupt because of personal interests but when you hold the public office you so cherished before you got there, what suddenly changes in you that you become a worst version of those bad characters and habits that you so much detest before you got there?",
