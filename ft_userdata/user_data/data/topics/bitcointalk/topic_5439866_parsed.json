They could, you know, because they are buddies at least in part.The other side of the coin is, think of all the nukes the US could stick into a SpaceX Super Heavy.And we all get a ringside seat to watch the fireworks.Russian, Chinese nuclear arsenals have been upgraded in race to dominance over outdated U.S. ICBMshttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-14-russian-chinese-nuclear-arsenals-upgraded-concern-reliability-us-missiles.htmlThe United States could soon find itself fighting a major two-front war with both Russia and China, considering the way things have been going for the past several weeks.It was one thing when Russia invaded its neighbor, the corrupt country of Ukraine, almost a year ago, but for some reason known only to our power-mad elites, American taxpayers are supporting Kyiv with showers of money, American military hardware, and weapon systems that we cannot easily replace.Now, just days ago, a weak, frail Joe Biden finally ordered the U.S. military to shoot down a Chinese spy balloon after it traversed the country but not before it gathered signals intelligence and flew over several highly sensitive bases and nuclear weapons locations.In short, it appears as though we are the closest we have been to an all-out world war in 80 years, and worse, this next one could turn nuclear in a hurry. With that in mind, it is worth taking a look at each country’s nuclear arsenals and the shape they are in.“In recent days, Republicans in Congress have been buzzing about a new report ‘from the top commander of U.S. nuclear forces‘ that says that China now has more launchers for land-based nuclear missiles than the U.S. does,” notes The Economic Collapse Blog, which then goes on to cite from a Politico report:Top Republicans on Capitol Hill are raising alarms over news that China has surpassed the U.S. in its number of launchers for land-based nuclear missiles — and arguing for the U.S. to expand its own arsenal to keep pace.Four GOP leaders on the House and Senate Armed Services committees said the revelation about China’s nuclear capability, made in a Jan. 26 letter from the top commander of U.S. nuclear forces, is a warning that Beijing’s arsenal is expanding faster than anticipated, though the U.S. still has more warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles....",

If they do, what will the excuse be?... that the ships were really military vessels that were moving armaments?Milestone for Russia's Zarubino Port as Ship with 10,000 Tons of Corn Leaves for Chinahttps://infobrics.org/post/37728/The first ship loaded with 10,000 tons of Russian corn left Russia's Zarubino Port and will arrive in the Port of Qingdao in East China's Shandong Province within days, the Global Times learned.The cargo volume is a historic breakthrough, as grain vessels from Zarubino Port can typically carry 3,000 to 5,000 tons. The change could facilitate the transport of grain from the Russian Far East, where a bottleneck has formed at local ports amid a surge in bilateral grain trade.Workers with Legendagro Logistics, after several trials, completed the transport of the grain amid extreme cold, according to the WeChat account of Joyvio, a Chinese firm. Legendagro is its subsidiary based in Vladivostok.The loading was completed under an average temperature of -33 C [-27.4 F] and took five days.A company executive surnamed Cao told the Global Times that the loading, completed last week, is experimental in nature as the port currently does not have the capacity to handle the loading and offloading of 10,000-ton grain vessels....",

      "body": "Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Mike Rogers of Alabama's concerns that China has more nuclear warheads than the US might be untrue. How did they get the information from China? China is generally known for its secrecy and propaganda. These legislatures may be acting based on fake news. According to the Pentagon America still has more intercontinental Ballistic missiles than China. It claims that China has 300 ICBMs, while the US can boast of 400.China is deliberately provocating the US. Flying a data-gathering balloon over the US is provocative and the US' action of bringing it down is right. But I think Russia, China, and the US are been careful because the world might not recover from a nuclear war between these powerful countries. The US will not obstruct the Russian cargo except it sails through the territorial waters of countries that are part of the sanctions against Russia.",

The impact of a hypothetical conflict between major world powers like China, Russia, and the US and NATO would likely have a profound and far-reaching impact on the entire world. It's important for all nations to engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully and avoid the devastating consequences of war.",

At least for now… More likely in my opinion would be China using Iran and Russia to fight a proxy war with the United States the way the United States is currently using Ukraine to fight a proxy war with Russia. God help us the day the China decides to attack the United States directly. It will likely lead to the end of civilization the way we know it.",

There’s no escaping on a Nuclear warfare because those missile will intercontinental while intercepting the will surely affect the country that missile will explode.I’m sure China will fight US once US-Russia war begun because they knew that they can already rival US in power and this is the perfect opportunity to be on the top together with there allied country Russia. This war might end US supremacy if this happened because their residents will surely request for surrender while Russia and China residents is fully controlled by their government.",

They could, you know, because they are buddies at least in part.I believe everyone around the world knows the strong relationship between Russia and China. However, if it happen that the Chinese join forces with Russia against US and Nato we would see another World war and I believe this is not what both parties want. This is the reason why the US doesn't want to intervene in the Russian and Ukraine invasions.Quote from: BADecker on February 14, 2023, 07:25:49 PMThe other side of the coin is, think of all the nukes the US could stick into a SpaceX Super Heavy.And we all get a ringside seat to watch the fireworks.It will be something that's far more than just watching because all countries worldwide will be literally affected.",

In fact, it would be against Chinese interests to see Russia completely collapse from a nuclear war because that's just another cheap energy source gone along with a potential military partner.Relax, no nuclear wars any time soon.",

      "body": "What if China joins Russia in a nuclear war against the US and Nato?The answer is very easy. The two sides will destroy each other and eventually destroy the entire world.There is a difference between normal war and nuclear war. On this basis, I do not think that a nuclear war needs allies. As the destructive energy of any of the parties to the conflict is capable of blowing up everything, including itself.I doubt that a war would break out with such enormous destructive power. And if it was, it might have happened in the past during the Cold War. I also suspect that China would want to involve itself in an adventure of this kind.",

The end of civilization will likely occur and people will likely return to the old era where they gonna fight with swords and horses again because that time no one will know what guns and grenades they nor someone know how to create them back. If that happens, then the prophecy is gonna happen where the last battle will likely happen in the future. At first, I don't really think it to happen because of the current things we have right now where technologies where never been advanced like this before but if all of these things will be destroyed and all the people behind them perished, I guess there will be no point to be amazed because, at the end of the day, they will all become scrap in the future.",
