  "content": "Yesterday, I went to watch a Ukrainian movie and was pleasantly surprised that it casually mentioned Bitcoin. I know that it's pretty common these days for American TV shows and movies to have some crypto references, but it's really nice when something local follows the trend. Ukrainian movies are generally far from being good, but they're slowly getting there, trying to find their style and place. The movie is Luxembourg, Luxembourg, and it is definitely one of the best Ukrainian movies so far (but again, the bar is very low), and Bitcoin was casually mentioned in a dialogue. A guy asked his wealthy son-in-law what kind of currency would be a good investment nowadays, and the son-in-law replies that it's Bitcoin because nowadays, Bitcoin rules the world. I was pleased to see such a casual and positive mention in a movie that's not about technologies or finances at all (it's a social tragicomedy or something like a slice of life).Do you know of local movies that mention Bitcoin? By 'local' I mean those that aren't American or British, not something that people widely watch all over the world.",

The media has a lot written about BTC and crypto, they say it is a scam, tool for money laundering, ponzi, a means to fast wealth, etc, this is why i don't really get excited when we talk about BTC being mentioned in a movie or in other programs. BTC is talked about globally, but the percentage of people who truly know its purpose as a censorship resistant currency is still low.",

It is always appreciated if they mention bitcoin in a positive way, since this is often not the case. Mostly bitcoin is talked about as the currency of illegal deals.",

I will look into Luxembourg, thanks for the information.",

This might be because the movie industry in my country is still developing and the restriction placed on the use of Bitcoin. It is nice to hear that a movie in Ukraine mentions this uncommon currency. I hope the movie is translated into English language because I will like to take a look at it in my spare time. The movie didn't just mention Bitcoin but spoke about it in a friendly manner. It even advertised the currency, indirectly advising people to invest in Bitcoin. If I have the financial power, it would not be bad to sponsor a film that will promote Bitcoin in my location. Maybe, the government might ban the film because of its negative approach toward Bitcoin but before then many people would have viewed it.",

But however, I have not seen any local movie which Bitcoin is randomly mentioned, but there is one which I downloaded last week Black Lotus 2023, which tells the story about \"how an ex-special forces operative wages a one-man war against a drug lord who kidnapped his late friend's daughter, after her stepdad who is the CEO of Bitcoin trading company lost the fund of the leader of the gang of over 50million euros in Bitcoin as a payback for his lost funds\".  and I love it since I'm a big fan of action movies.",

Honestly that was the first time I ever heard about bitcoin but it was way way casual for me. The mention was only in one of the context where the friends discuss about some Physics theory and end up talking about advancement in the technology. That is the speech where Sheldon the lead guy in the series mentions about Bitcoin. That was definitely happening for many people around the worlds and fans of it. After that various series started doing it all the time. Mostly criminal based series and series who has FBA involvement.",

I believe some movie producers are yet to talk about bitcoin in their movies because my country is not yet in support of bitcoin even though the country is one of the most users of bitcoin in Africa.",

But actually, when it comes to bitcoin, there's often a negative portrayal of it in the media, which is often influenced by the particular plot and story being told. This negative depiction stems from the early adoption of Bitcoin by several online marketplaces that facilitated the sale of illicit goods and services. Although Bitcoin has grown far beyond its original reputation, its connection to criminal activities persists in popular culture. Hence the acts of money laundering and illegal transactions related to bitcoin contained in many works of fiction.",

Reason being is that bitcoin is very open in our country and adoption is slowly growing and the government doesn't have any problems with crypto as long as they are being regulated and exchanges are getting their requirements.So it's good to hear that in your local movie industry, it's also slipping in and maybe who knows, the director or the producer is also a bitcoiner and subliminally sending messages to the movie goers about bitcoin and the potential of it to disrupt everything.",
