      "body": "Fresh scam websites are created regularly. They will close and days later then will open another one using a different website. Scammers are everywhere and there are more of them in these hard times. Telegram, discord and social media platforms are nothing different from emails spammed with suspicious links. We are safer if we ignore and do not click on direct messages from unknown sources. You may encounter links in a form of a website but it will lead you to download some type of malware.The dm is a clear attempt to scam you. No one is going to dm someone they didn't know and will offer money. I am receiving countless of dm too on my discord and I keep ignoring them.",
