If the military could return the people back to democracy with an election, that will be fine. However, that is another difficult task to do as they say it is not easy to give up power when you have it .",

Perhaps, I could do an exception if those coups were to get rid of an anti democratic or corrupt regime and they called for free and fair elections to take place within a limited window of time, but does not seem to be the case.This rather something which is taking place to replace some regimes with more openly authoritarian rulers which are pretty much in favor of Russian an Chinese intervention in the continent and against the west.",

All the democratic government that has been overthrown by the military have been accused of one corruption or the other. Corruption is the umbrella covering every other activities that doesn't allow the masses enjoy the natural gifts in African soil. Military intervention is not always better but the African leaders set such incident up by themselves because they are never fair to the people they are leading. I hope these countries that are now led by military would set a good pace for true democracy when they conduct and hand over power to the next democratic government.",

If we go back, we will all see how apartheid politics spread and civil wars happened. This all shows that the system of government in some countries on the African continent has failed, I imagine how great the potential of the countries on the African continent is when it is managed properly, it will definitely beat other continents because of the wealth of natural mineral resources there, there is no need to doubt it anymore.",

The military has been better Administrators than these so-called democratically elected thieves. The military has managed the economy of my country better than most of these politicians. The debt my country owes to some international banks and organizations went very high during the civilian government because the military were better managers. Today our country is suffering from terrorist attacks because civilian politicians are treating them with kid's gloves. But the military would have dealt with them squarely. The military was created for the protection of the citizens and not for governance. During their reign, there was always an abuse of citizen's fundamental human rights. But when we suffer the same fate during democratically elected government tenure, it will be better to be under the military. When elections are rigged to favor an unpopular candidate, it will be better to have a coup. When civilian governments have formed partnerships within and outside the country to steal our commonwealth and push us to abject poverty, it will be far better to be under the military. When the courts and the Constitution have been pocketed and stamped upon by these politicians, it will be better to be ruled through decree and orders. Where the national assembly is a mere rubber stamp of the President and governors, it will be better for powers to be centralized.",

In fact, the rulers of African countries are practicing corruption because they see nothing in the state except their family.There are many reasons for this because Africa is rich in natural resources and this has attracted many toxic states as the western world states try to control them Incentives, special management for better livelihoods, and more, African states are practicing corruption.I personally think that the main reason why African leaders practice corruption is the ignorance of the citizens of that country and the fact that this system has been created artificially for some countries in the western world.It was not built in a day, it took centuries of different foreign policies to language them and take advantage of their weaknesses because most African states are admittedly poor Accepting poverty and taking advantage of this, some countries in the developed world.We all know that in 1989 the World Bank conducted a study there and found that there was a lack of good governance for their condition, so they made some recommendations and if they were to get a loan from the World Bank The democracy of the country must be protected and independence must be given to every structure of the state and the military regime must be strengthened but not as the head of the military but as an organ of the state to run the state There is no need for military success, but as a part of the state, it is possible to leave the military in the hands of the military and do infrastructural development etc. slowly and quickly.First of all citizens should be made aware to participate in the work of the state and perform their duties and the state leaders should be made to perform their duties in a democratic way.Only if we take action against how to create qualified leaders, corruption practices can be stopped and corrupt churches will be reduced in the days to come.",

I believe every country had it's peculiarities in terms of the events that led to the ousting of the erstwhile democratic governments. Like in the case of Niger, what led to the military takeover wss driving by three factors. Firstly, even though Niger has several foreign (USA, France) military forces and bases situated in the country, yet Niger is faced with the invasion of insurgent groups such as the Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc which has resulted to thousands of deaths and displaced homes which has been seemingly neglected by the government. Secondly, the ECOWAS, like in most west African countries, haven't made as much efforts as it should as a body in terms of intervention programmes yet they go about bossing to restore Bazoum. Lastly, which is the least of all is that the former president Bazoum had an identity crisis in the last election where he was labeled to have foreign interests above the national interest due to his Arab origin.When you compared that to what happened to Ali Bongo of Gabon, it's quite a different scenario, in Gabon, it was more of electoral malpractices and imposition. They president was widely rejected by the citizens yet had it's way through to win at the polls. That brought about several agitations that led to the coup. Also realize that the economic downturn in the country amidst the natural endowment in the small country has led it to several outcries. And the list goes on.It's just a case of the world power tussle between the UN Permanent Security Council Members.",

The system you are talking about for those African countries is called \"separation of power\". The United States is a good example of how separation of power works, back during the first presidency of Trump he got several of his executive orders blocked by federal judges, and when he wanted to overturn the election results in Georgia they tried to pressure the Secretary of State (the only one with the direct power to recall those results). That is a system where one single person cannot do whatever they desire with their position. However, separation of power can become ineffective if many of those officials which are supposed to be neutral and only obey the constitution fail to their oath and obey lawless orders from a central authority.",

I call this the fear of the Westerners of what African can do to topple the globe.However, the things that has falling apart on this scenario would had been fixed if only the judiciary is active snd reliable of it's laws and constitution but yet they are all messed with the interest of biased justice for the interest of politics and to defend the percentage interests of the Westerners else there would be a better governance in Africa.Africa is a central for justice of connection and justice of corruptions yet they do not want to realize itself. Africa is a pool of daylight robbery and justice riggings backed up by the judiciary who imposes laws and still breaks it's laws because they have classes of citizens and foreigners above the laws. What a mess? 😏So I would suggest to give the military a try since the democracies has failed else the situation would either remain stagnant or backwarded because when you make profits out of your BTC investment without enhancing your to establish more of your capitals in other to earn more profits is as an Investor of an idle where there is no increments.",

In a country a which is 'working', the common man should have a say. Military take over will only breed more tyrants, dictators and worse still cause mass political apathy. International trade and borrowing will be affected too. Which country will want to lend funds to a politically and economically unstable country?It is quite unfortunate that we Africans are richly blessed with natural resources yet are suffering in the midst of plenty due to negligence and selfish interests from our political leaders.  At this point, what we need is mass participation in politics. Public opinion should be taken seriously and the military cannot give us this.Let us continue to lend our voices for the growth of our country, one day, we shall get what we seek.",

Yes indeed the points that you point out are all the root causes of of corruption and one of the major factors that that corrupt leader have manipulated for a long is the area of institutions,  no doubt weak institutions have become the major problem and foundations of corruption in Africa because the leaders already know how week and incomplete our laws are and this same laws is what the institutions are established on so it becomes a free tool in the hand of the politicians to manipulate and bend the law to whichever way he thinks fit into has corrupt desires. A practical example of the level of weak institutions in Africa is in the electoral process where the electoral officials are appointed by the politicians instead of being career civil servants with such a system in place there can never be a free and fair election in such a state.",
