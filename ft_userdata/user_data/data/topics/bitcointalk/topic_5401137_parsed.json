Based on the experience from Axie, people are aware the problem of P2E is the token always getting generated and have a hard burn mechanism to maintain the price.To much oversold for P2E project, because people always selling instantly no matter how much the price since we want the ROI % back first for our investment.",

If so, then the money you will be spending for tools in order to mine those useless token aren't even worth your machine's processing power. It's just that the profit you'll get in the game(if there is one) won't be enough to fix your hardware issues due to the game's requirement of running your computer on the side, that even you will not enjoy.",

It's already down 99%.Yeah that's another garbage token for sure. You can even compare it with axie or sandbox. You will see how garbage that token is. Become a mostly played game didn't mean good in the price as well. This project fully diluted with very high inflation. It keeps increasing even higher. You shall aware how garbage this token and it was going down instantly from $7 to the 3 cents. what a shame. That may be a place for people to grinding and then dumping.",

I heard the earnings is quite good considering its free and youll only need to spend little investment at first while it increases as your spending goes bigger depends on the items and stuff you need on the game. Didnt play it so I really dont know the game mechanics but with the price depreciation, I could see that nft play to earn have some pattern even its legit project. You should rush getting your initial to be safe on current p2e cause eventually it will fall down later on.",

It's already down 99%.are you mention TLM token by Alien world ? if yes then i can say i am also TLM holders. i was bought TLM token as the price of $0.18 each TLM . not the price of Alien world token is 0.03 but i am still holding it and i believe TLM price will pump again with bitcoin price . for the high dumped btc price . all coins are dumped . i expect TLM price will again reach $1 in the future",
