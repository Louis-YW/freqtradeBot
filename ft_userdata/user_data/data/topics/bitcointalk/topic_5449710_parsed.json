Yes, i really appreciate those wey put effort to make am happen so easily, but i go wan asked why those our oga them no put efforts kukuma apply for mod, like for example e get some post them here way dem suppose control or delete to make here cleaner and purer as we want because i know say na this thing dey cause why we dey see shitposters full for this we board. maybe if una apply and them finally give 2 to 3 persons mod to dey take care of this our board e go really make sense and e go help us wella, i don see for meta section wey some people dey apply for this things in other to keep their board regulated clear from spammer and shitposters without overall admin visiting that board to delete post.Abeg make we put hands together work this one out for we localboard as well, at least e go make sense wella.I just talk my mind but i believe say people wey senior us here go also raise their reason as well make we put am together take facilitate this precious board.",

Today is 21st of April, this forum was created on 21st of December. Which means it is just four months old now.You can use the report at the lower right side of any post to report the particular post to a moderator. I understand what you meant, that we need a local moderator which would be better. If need be, with valid evidence that most posts reported are not deleted while they supposed to be deleted, someone can come up with it on meta board and other needs we want a local moderator. After election, I do not see many posts as unnecessary, but all I am thinking is that as this single board gets more topics, we are going to need sub-boards. If we have sub-boards, the main board and many important board would be clean of low quality topics and posts.I think it is not moderator that we need for now, we need this board to have sub-boards. Maybe not yet the time, but the time is coming.",

I believe that the current mods and patrollers are doing well, which is why he hasn't considered increasing the numbers even when some of the mods became inactive and left the forum, the mod of B&H MiningBuddy left the forum in 2018 and hasn't been replaced yet. TBH, having a mod here is unrealistic for the time being; our activity are far too low and its something that a patroller can handle; nonetheless, I have noticed that most of my reports on this board have been handled quickly, in contrast to a few months back.  I believe the moderator assigned to this board has been active recently, although he may have difficulty moderating pidgin posts, which is where we come in. BTW our board is 50% English, 50% Pidgin so its quite manageable. Our main target now is how to get child boards for easy navigation of topics. just keep reporting shit posts editCharles-Tim beat me to it.",

The answer na still the same thing way Charles-Tim and Igebotz don already talk, this board never pass 6 months although we don dey active for the local hangout threads way CryptopreneurBrainboss create years back and also the African proverbs in pigin thread by Mpamaegbu, I dey surprised the way new accounts way no know the history of how the board take be dey immediately dey compare our board with other people own. Rome was not built in a day. The main thing na for the discussions for our board to make sense, mods and merit source go surely happen but if the board na spam nothing go dey for merit source to merit and na big work for moderator becos na only delete and lock thread he go dey do.",

We need sub-forum first before those things first dey possible just as Igebotz and Charle-Tim don already talk na so e suppose be but as a good member you be so, if e get some things you witness or notice say e no good you go report them quickly and i believe within 24hrs or 48hrs interval them go clean am up.So when the main time reach we go still get our mods and by then e go sweet pass i know say them go dey active dey work to know things we dey happen within we board.",
