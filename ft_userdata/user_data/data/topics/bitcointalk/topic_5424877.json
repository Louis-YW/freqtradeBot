Yes, this is the same mumbling that has been going on for years, but this article suprised only in the way they combined almost all negative prejudices for Bitcoin while at the same time completely failing to acknowledge what it achived over the last few years.Like I said not suprising coming from a central bank.However I'd still be interested to hear what people think about how relevant this position of the ECB would be for Bitcoin longterm, regarding its legal situation.",

Today, you can no longer say \"money that did not exist 10 years ago\", now can you?",

Exactly. ECB is a..  bank. And while some commercial banks have started loving the taste of the profits that come from crypto, they are still few. And the central banks (where I'd include ECB too) simply feel more and more threatened by bitcoin. They don't understand it, they cannot control it and it has the potential to make them lose their jobs on the really long term.Even more: they are walking on a thin ice. They are pushing CBDCs, which in the average Joe's head is not that much different than Bitcoin (so CBDCs somewhat advertise bitcoin too), still, they are telling that Bitcoin is bad. I would not be surprised if even the average Joe will soon notice that something stinks badly in this kind of \"reports\" of ECB (and the similar central banks). Yes, it's the smell of fear...",

      "body": "they are very selective about their wording. to avoid many aspects that actually are involvedtake this paragraphQuoteIn the mid-2010s, the hope that Bitcoin's value would inevitably rise to ever new heights began to dominate the narrative. But Bitcoin is also not suitable as an investment. It does not generate cash flow (like real estate) or dividends (like equities), cannot be used productively (like commodities) or provide social benefits (like gold). The market valuation of Bitcoin is therefore based purely on speculation. funny how bankers that meant to be economic trained professionals cant tell the difference between 'value' and 'price'the value. is not the market price or the market capeven hal finney in 2010 knew that price was based on an understanding of underlying value set by the mining costs that need to be recouped ( part of the value proposition), where the \"price\" then markets above valuethe value is derived below the market price. based on the cost of acquisition at a base rate no one wants to sell below or no one can buy below.  thus forming a wall/support where the value becomes non-zerothe most efficient mining on the planet is near that base number. (the lowest acquisition cost of coins)mining has a real world cost. and requires real world spending to recoup costs. yes the market price above that is speculative. but VALUE is not at the market price speculative layerits below thatEG bitcoins price from summer 2022 wiggled around the $24k-$16k areabut the underlying VALUE is about $13k-$15k where the value does not move as frantically as the marketthey want to pretend the market of $0-$69k is just 100% hype/hope/speculation. lets take goldgolds value is not the market price. the market price is the premium people agree to pay above valuethe value is about $900.. the premium(price) is currently ~$1.8k today..bitcoins PRICE speculates at a premium above value too. where the value is NON-ZERO.and this year its value is about $13k-$15k and the premium(price) has speculated $16k-$69k in the last yearthis base value of bitcoin is not a daily wiggle speculation change. its a more smooth transition that is tested periodically over a 6month-4year cycle, where it increases over those periodsthe funny part isthey try to say bitcoin does not do x/y/z for common man citizenyet common man citizen can use bitcoinyet the ECB have many products like derivatives and behind the scenes 'darkpool' markets of banker produced product that common man citizen cannot useits as if they are trying to say all bank activity is open and free to use and transparent.. yet THEY say bitcoin is closed and not accessible to common man to make money(profit) on. where transactions do not occur and value does not transfer between users(flow)",

You know this article is biased and trying to trash crypto currencies because they are threatened by bitcoin. Cute how they ended up saying promoting bitcoin puts the reputation of the banks at risk. Like how? What has bank to do with bitcoin? If people prefer bitcoins, then they probably do because it is far superior than using banks and fiat currency. They are saying bitcoin is \"rarely\" used for legal transaction, then what about the millions of dollars that has been donated to countries that are in need. Are those all transactions illegal? What about people buying stuffs online with bitcoin by following at the regulatory rules. I doubt those are illegal transactions. This is nothing but an attempt to spread FUD.",

Bitcoin has also repeatedly benefited from waves of new investors. The manipulations by individual exchanges or stablecoin providers etc. during the first waves are well documented, but less so the stabilising factors after the supposed bursting of the bubble in spring.actually if they bothered to do a economic research investigation of the market of say 2012-2022they would see that the price difference of $6-$16k is not because large whales are buying whole coins by spending 2666x more moneyits actually where average joe in 2012 was spending $400 a time to get 66btc and now spending $400 to get 0.025btcthe markets are not filled with majority orders of 1btc requests.. but instead thousands(majority) of 0.0xbtcits simple mathif you spend $1.60 for 0.0001 it converts the \"price\" to be $16k for 1btc without having to buy a whole coinif you spend $320 for 0.02 it converts to a PRICE of $16kbitcoin is not like shares where you have to buy a whole share for a share market to show a new price point on the share market...also (mentioned in previous post) the banks tried to assume real value is measured in market capyet even they should know real hard value is not a market cap or a company share capwhen someone enters an investment deal. (watch shark tank or dragons den as examples)where they have a business and they are asking for $100k for 10% of a company..real hard money of only $100k swaps.. yet the company cap becomes $1m. everyone knows a company does not have the hard cash of a company cap to back up the cap amounteveryone knows not to value a company at those caps. its just a multiplier number based on current price vs shares/tokens/coins in circulation.. nothing moreeven a bank should know this basic economics 101 pointmarket cap is a meaningless statistic. and does not show real value.market cap is not only meaningless in crypto.. but also a meaningless statistic for company shares toothey call company market caps \"valuation\" but real economic minded people know thats a lieif an accounted was to raid a company and read the accounts of a company they would not find a hard cash value amount in the company that matches a companies cap(valuation)and banks that employ(or should be employing economics majors) should know this stuff",
