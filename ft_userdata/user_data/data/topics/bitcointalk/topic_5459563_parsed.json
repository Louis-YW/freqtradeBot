  "content": "Some players, you might be one, are hesitant to play with bitcoin. Even if they understand what bitcoin is and why they should consider making wagers via BTC, they don’t understand enough about it to take the plunge.Because of misunderstandings regarding bitcoin betting, we decided to come up with this handy guide that, hopefully, puts your bitcoin betting fears to rest.A Closer Look on How to Gamble with BitcoinUnderstanding the difference between BTC and mBTCYou don’t bet in BTC. The price of a single bitcoin on May 11, 2023 was around $26,900. Instead, you bet in mBTC.An mBTC is 1/1000th of a BTC. So a single mBTC on May 11, 2023, was $26.90. It’s important to understand this before moving to the guide.Create a crypto send and receive account on Coinbase or some other facilitatorYou must create an account with a company like Coinbase for you to store your crypto. Consider creating a Coinbase or CashApp account because those two are most friendly to bitcoin novices.Once you create your Coinbase, or other account, you will see that you can trade a multitude of cryptos. You can go as far down the rabbit hole as you’d like. For our purposes we’re going to stick with BTC.Add BTC to your send/receive crypto accountCompanies like Coinbase allow you to purchase bitcoin with a debit card. Purchase as much bitcoin as you’d like.One thing to remember is that most organizations like Coinbase will require you to verify your identity. Even then, they may place a hold on your BTC purchase. So it’s best to create your send/receive crypto account well before you plan on gambling.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/184fafb",

Most people here see gambling as their way into the profit earning sector of the industry not knowing that they are actually looking for investing instead. But whatever, I see this post as nothing but a way for these people to advertise their site, read the article and it's just nothing but useless information about how bitcoins are mined and transacted upon which every year 2 bitcoin user already knows. What people fail to consider is for one, your argument which is the fact that just because bitcoin is volatile, doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to jump between hundreds of dollars in mere days, especially if you didn't invest that much anyway. Another would be the notion that people are afraid of using bitcoin because they don't want to lose profits, which is simply untrue. While a good percentage of people who holds bitcoin think that way, the majority just sees better alternatives and cryptocurrencies to use for gambling instead of bitcoin.",

This is kind of outdated though with how casinos usually convert whatever crypto you have to its USD/Local Fiat currency, so this knowledge isn't really a necessity for the most part, unless ofc you're stuck with a casino like that. And to add, I don't think this is even a fear really? I mean most (if not all) casinos don't require you to bet a minimum of \"1\" BTC, they'd go out of business real quick if so. Not to mention that I don't think most people even put that much in their gambling accounts.",

Refunding your gambling wallet is as easy as anything and you don't need all that you stated in your thread. Remember that bitcoin is volatile and nobody knows when the price will dump or pump.

They will ban accounts that send directly to crypto casinos. I haven't used any of these platforms in ages, but they won't just KYC you. They'll lock your account and give you a short time frame to withdraw any funds.If you're gambling using an exchange, always send to an intermediate wallet and then deposit. It may take a while, but eventually your accounts on these exchanges will get shutdown if not. Plus, sending out of exchanges might incur some delays in the transaction being created. The deposit address might expire creating unnecessary complications.",

In addition, we will also be safe in using the funds in the wallet because they are not stored on the exchange. Whenever we want to gamble, we always use an intermediary wallet which we can freely use for many casinos. And our exchange account will also be safe and will not be suspected of being used for gambling or other things because the exchange team is very alert to transactions that they think are suspicious or can violate the exchange rules.",
