      "body": "Through the pictures, it is clear that the GPU is from the XFX company. I assume that the technical condition of the GPU is good since you used it for only one month for games, but it would be better if you put other specifications such as how much memory size, how many fans...etc.Another important point also, you did not mention the location because the shipping costs may be high, given that you ask for 180$ if we add only 100$ shipping costs to it, this equals 280$, this is slightly less than the new price.So you'd better find someone nearby in order to reduce shipping costs.",
