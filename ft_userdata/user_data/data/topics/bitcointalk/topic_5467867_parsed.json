  "content": "The transition into an adult comes with a whole lot of reality and sometimes it takes a lot of time and effort before we even accept these realities.Firstly,  your ideas about life, good, bad, moral, and religious start changing because, at some point, you discover that most of the high moral and religious beliefs you read and were taught as a child don't apply in real life situations and that the people who so much emphasis this moral belief will drop them so easily whenever it comes in the way of there businesses or personal gain.You later realize that you have to earn every little thing you need in life all by yourself and that when you even seek help, 70% of the time, no one will even reason your matter as they are all struggling to fix their problems - this also opens up your mind to know that you are \"own your own\"It even gets worse when you finally realize that people don't care much about how you get your wealth and that as long as you bring the money on the table, they don't seem bothered again - this in itself hardens your heart towards some things and might make you consider option you will never imagine you taking on normal circumstances.This has led our girls to hookups and our guys into internet fraud because it seems everything is about the money and no one even considers you relevant if you don't have the money. And now you have the dirty mentality that \"if it brings food to your table and your conscience doesn't condemn you, do it\" This in itself is bad and is the reason for the moral decadence in our society.The idea that no one is coming to help you is not false but you should let it guide you in the right way Because when you make the wrong decision and karma or the authorities catch up with you, it's then you will know that \"you are on your own\"Let's share our adulthood experiences, this might be a source of inspiration to someone out there. How has your journey into adulthood been so far and what morals have you held on to in the past that the reality of the present has changed?",

There is nothing so hard but use simple and modern English techniques",
