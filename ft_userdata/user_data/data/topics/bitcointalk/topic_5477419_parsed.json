  "content": "If you want to signal your intelligence, a college degree just means that you are like everyone else. Colleges have very low standards these days. They are dropping standardized testing requirements. Colleges have been promoting violence. Colleges have been promoting anti-semitism. The community colleges suck. The elite universities are just as horrible. A B.S. degree is not worth anything at all. A Ph.D. in the hard sciences is still worth a little bit. M.D.s are not worth much because biological laboratories still have not implemented all sensible safety protocols. All the medical doctors in the USA have not prevented Americans from becoming really fat. Here are some ways that you can signal your intelligence besides getting a college degree.0. Most people are really dumb.1. Investing in a cryptocurrency where the mining algorithm that is designed to advance science while still establishing decentralized consensus is a signal to those around you that you are intelligent enough to understand that senselessly wasting resources is a really bad idea. And investing in garbage like NFTs is a signal of your lack of intelligence. Oh? You disagree with me? That is only because you have a low level of intelligence.2. Be pretty. Good look people tend to be more intelligent than non-good looking people.3. There is a strong correlation between race and IQ. The Jews are the smartest. TSMC is the company that makes most of the semiconductors so that your computers actually work. This means that the people of Taiwan have a high level of intelligence. A lot of countries are poor because their people do not have a very high level of intelligence.4. Communicate intelligently. This means that need to say things that actually make sense. And you should communicate using proper grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. It may be helpful if you are capable of communicating in multiple languages.5. Are your schools filled with bullies? I hate to break it to you, but if your kids are too fucking afraid of going to school because they are going to get bullied, then bloody NOBODY is getting an education at that school. There is an easy way to tell if a school has a major problem with bullying. If the school had a mass shooting, that means that the shooter has been bullied relentlessly and has no options for peace. You should therefore consider anyone who ever went to a school with a mass shooting to be an unintelligent moron who is absolutely worthless to society.6. Don't be fat. There is a correlation between obesity and intelligence. If I see a fat person, I will automatically assume with good accuracy that that fat person is also dumb. There are some exceptions. There are some smart fat people who still need to lose the weight.If we combine these standards, we have a good way of determining who is smart and who is dumb. -Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

It seems like the main issue these days is the lack of professionalism at colleges. As long as these deplorable institutions refuse to apologize for promoting violence against me, I will take a strong stand against stem. The only reason why people would opt for college degrees as the main method of demonstrating intelligence, work ethic, and moral goodness etc, is because they lack the intelligence, work ethic, and moral goodness to judge people on what they truly know and what they can truly do.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

And I am not going to let this one go until colleges apologize for promoting violence. If you search for \"universities promote violence\", you will get links back to me because I am not going to back down from this until universities apologize for being so asinine and terrible.

You can't trust people with college degrees. You just can't. Only the Ph.D. is trustworthy.There is absolutely nothing stupider than people who fork out 100,000 a year to go to some stupid ass college when the colleges pander to students who make threats of violence against their professors.

It's understandable that you appreciate genuine discussions rather than flattery. Regarding Bitcoin's mining algorithm, it's important to remember that its primary purpose was to secure transactions and provide a decentralized monetary system. However, I believe intelligence encompasses different fields of knowledge, and although not everyone may fully grasp the intricacies of Bitcoin's algorithm, it doesn't necessarily imply a lack of intelligence within the community. Open dialogue and sharing insights can help bridge gaps in understanding. What are your thoughts on potential intersections between Bitcoin and scientific advancements?",

Open dialogue and sharing insights can help bridge gaps in understanding. What are your thoughts on potential intersections between Bitcoin and scientific advancements?It is easy to use computation for a scientific purpose. It is also easy to create a cryptocurrency mining algorithm that secures the cryptocurrency, and this task is so easy that it is kind of boring and routine; I am not interested in this at all. It is more difficult to create a cryptocurrency mining algorithm that secures the cryptocurrency and also uses that computation to solve some other important problem. Since this task is more difficult, this is where all the innovation lies (and it is even more difficult to measure the cryptographic security of the new mining algorithm; one needs mathematicians and/or cryptographers to measure the security of mining algorithms and select a secure mining algorithm). But since the Bitcoin community has such a low level of intelligence, they cannot see any use in solving any scientific problem and they lack the imagination to realize that it is possible to both secure the network and also solve a scientific problem at the same time without compromising on either security or scientific advancement.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

These garbage institutions refuse to apologize for promoting violence against me, and they do not even recognize their own Nazism. This is a quote from a Hitler worshipping Nazi professor who has failed to realize that I am calling out universities for being full of idiots who act like Nazis.QuoteFrankly, your manner of calling people to your cause leaves much to be desired. I can't believe it is effective for you. I don't know of anyone who would be attracted to support you by receiving a giant image of Hitler in their inbox. Most people would immediately block someone who sent a giant image of Hitler to them, and indeed, the only reason I didn't do so is because I have known you a while and we've had some interesting mathematical interactions, and so I think you deserve some leeway. But I don't care ever to receive such a message again. I support your right to cancel class if you are threatened, and I have told you as much in the past. But as far as I am concerned, your current behavior on the matter puts me completely off.Kind regards,JoelI showed this professor a picture of Hitler because he was a professor at a Nazi institution. The correct response to this would be to denounce the violence and threats of violence against me. This professor refused to denounce the threats of violence because this professor promotes violence. But I am glad that this professor responded so that I can post this message all across the internet so that we can all mock universities for the s@#$holes that they really are. This professor cannot even do any research that has any practical value whatsoever. Or maybe it will in the deep future, but ain't nobody got time for that. I sincerely apologize for using a double negative.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
