Or that it will be publically known who spends how much on what? Or that it will be known to the government and/or corporations? I think it's the third option, but it still leaves the question of who has access to the data.I certainly don't like the idea of full control of the banks, frozen assets etc. So no, we should not embrace anything like it. There must be a balance between privacy and fighting crimes, otherwise we end up in a terrible totalitarian state where control is on the level that wasn't possible in totalitarian regimes of the previous centuries.",

Cashless society should embrace, not the government to force people. Quote from: Majestic-milf on May 29, 2022, 10:52:12 AM1. Reduces crime rates as there is no tangible money to steal.New form of crime may surface. Some crime will become old and obsolete while new crimes are arising.Quote from: Majestic-milf on May 29, 2022, 10:52:12 AM2. Decrease in money launderingIf you go into details about money laundering, reputed people and public figures with legit business can launder. Do not be deceived by this. Also same to terrorism.Quote from: Majestic-milf on May 29, 2022, 10:52:12 AM4. The government will decide what you can and cannot purchaseThey are doing that even already now and country like my country even have monthly international spending limit of $200 for credit cards which means we should not buy anything above $200 with credit card every month.Quote from: Alisha-k on May 29, 2022, 11:18:36 AMThe government can't give out what they can't control. This is one reason Bitcoin remains a threat to government policies and regulations If we analyze critically we can come to a conclusion that CEX is not enough to monitor bitcoin transaction as many investors have their coin tied to their keys. But most government in the world are embracing bitcoin while many that their central bank hates bitcoin just have implicit ban in a way individuals still use p2p for bitcoin transaction.I am so glad with the cross border transaction which made easier and less costly.Quote from: Alisha-k on May 29, 2022, 11:18:36 AMCashless policy in a completely centralized setting is another form of modern slavery but who can object to the decision of this dictators. in most economy if you complain you die and if you keep mute you still die.

But it might be a huge possibility to happen on the near future as everything will need to advance and that also include on how payment and transaction works whether it will be thru crypto, blockchain or other alternatives.

There is more cons to it and perhaps the government will do it that way after all they own us. At first I actually doubt that government will have a fair look in developing this sort of technology like the CBDC since its best to just chase what other countries are doing. But after watching what they have been developing like tracking individual's carbon print like what they are talking about in this video, it might really be true that they'd be no  freedom to anyone. And It turns out China's CBDC is actually provides more liberty to its people.So it wouldn't be surprising if people will fight back and will prefer to use cryptocurrency.",

Cashless in fact made adoption of digital economy easier, that is it has been heard before digital currency and this made way for it and also gave more people the leverage to easily accessible and understand cryptocurrency. Now, talking on the advantages to that, in Nigeria I do believe that going cashless has reduced burglary. Back in the days of going on cash there was high rate of house breaking , burglary because the thieves know that they would meet the victim in cash in the house as it was the tradition to bring huge money to the house. This incidents have reduced in that aspect but of course scammers and robbers are smart people. They have device means to still continue that, when they attack they pick up your ATM card and ask for the code or pin, the rest is history.",

For me it sounds like imposing cashless  money under a plausible pretext. Taken as a whole, the downward trend in the use of cash in recent years has been steadily increasing. Therefore, I dare to assume that most likely after some time all countries will one way or another refuse to use them. Perhaps this will happen within 5-10 years, as some forecasts suggest. It seems to me that this is already a clearly visible trend, which can't be avoided for the reasons you indicated (Cons you indicated). These disadvantages are not beneficial to ordinary users, but are very tempting to governments. Therefore, they will promote it and impose it on users, whether they like it or not. But most likely, this will be accepted under the plausible pretexts of caring for their citizens. As usual.",

Crime rates may fall because there is no physical money, but more advanced hacks like at an exchange can effect many more people and they have so far not been as secure as banks. Money laundering through Bitcoin has become a big issue and transactions through banks are much more traceable to individual owners, so that is another lie. You say in the cons section that banks have control, but for the average joe on the street to shift to cryptocurrency they are going to stick to exchanges as the most convenient form of centralized funds, so it doesn't really solve that problem. One major con that is often overlooked is how the less fortunate or technologically literate will have a much harder time, the homeless will be left with much less support from cash donations which needs to be addressed.",
