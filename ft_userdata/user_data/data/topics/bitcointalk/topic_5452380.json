The block size in Bitcoin is 1MB. So can I assume how many blocks are approximately left to be mined? Would that be 65MB / 1MB = 65 blocks?",

As the transaction in your mempool start to get added to blocks and your memory usage drops, your node will start to accept and store these transactions from other nodes with larger mempools.",
