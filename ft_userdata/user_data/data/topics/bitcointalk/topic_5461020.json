That pleasure is bigger than any possible pleasure that gambling can give me. 5 bitcoins is a lot, I will even never try gambling if I am offered something less like 2btc, even 1btc. Some gamblers in their entire life will never make up to that amount from gambling even if they have two lifetimes to try.",

I would rather \"gamble\" on other markets like crypto and real estate with that amount of money to get whatever thrill I experience from sportsbetting. I'm pretty sure high rollers will have a different answer to this. They will probably find that too small.",

Most of the people will choose to get the bitcoins and leave gambling.It's a life changing amount for many people. But it would be interesting to see if a gambling addict would really be able to quit gambling after receiving such a reward.I personally think he wouldn't be able to quit gambling and will eventually start gambling more now that he has a huge amount of money.",

I believe that is what other people will do too if they are not very rich and unable to afford 5 BTC easily.5 bitcoin is definitely a jackpot that would be hard for one to win through gambling so it could be an easy Choice to pick it. But with the way most people are addicted to gambling I doubt they will genuinely give up. Some of them have will just pretend to give and take that money but due to addiction they will come back. Moreover we have heard gamblers either win a large amount of money either bigger than 5 bitcoin or closer to it and they return back to that gambling live style again. Also there financial stable people that take gambling as a sport, so it would be an easy decision for me but I wouldn’t generalize it",

The condition is like taking your freedom to spend the coins the way you want it. Even if someone really is crazy enough to give 5BTC to someone for him to stop gambling, it might not be enough for him to stop. He may promise not to gamble again but 5BTC is not so much for a gambler who already incorporates the life of a gambler.",

Some would say holding 5 btc is considered as gambling as crypto is so volatile so i am assuming that rules for this would include that i could leverage trade with that bitcoin. Which should be called gambling but isn't. So i would probably take the money. It isn't that much after taxes but i could use it to make more.",

It will be weird to find those kind of people. The requirement was that they cease gambling, not that they stop having fun. They can engage in a variety of other forms of entertainment besides gambling.",

I've seen people consider trading as a form of gambling cause risks are involved and there's a tendency for you to lose your money in the process, if what you mean is I can't gamble as in play games that offer monetary benefits when I win, then for sure!. I don't see any reason why I should not stop with gambling especially if given that ludicrous of an amount in the first place, and with the only caveat being I can't gamble anymore too lol. I've seen people gamble their lives away for as little as 10 bucks, with this amount you're basically set for life in some countries if you were to liquidate it. If you wouldn't and decide to venture into other ways for you to create more money you could basically try real estate and increase your wealth in the process! The whole world's your oyster when you have enough money, so that in exchange for not being able to gamble? Lol that's an easy choice.",
