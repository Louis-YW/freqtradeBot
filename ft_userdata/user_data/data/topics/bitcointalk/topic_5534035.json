Is my observation valid, or am I just overthinking it? Right now, it's simply impossible to trust Trump's words. Well, look at what he says and does. He has seven Fridays in a week. A populist who came to power in order to avoid prison time and criminal prosecution. All of America is already on its ears from his antics. Not that he suddenly decided to create a bitcoin reserve. Well, yes, maybe something will work out, but that's not certain. I will emphasize once again that he may be impeached in the near future, and this will lead to the entire crypto world shaking from side to side.I just read the news that at an Eminem concert, the artist chanted \"Fuck Trump\" along with the audience. In the short period of his reign, this character has pissed everyone off to the maximum. There is a high probability that the states will be overwhelmed by large-scale protests, which will ultimately lead to the resignation of the current president.",

Is my observation valid, or am I just overthinking it? Trump's influence is real and amplified by his presidency and policy teases, but it’s not total control, broader economic vibes and crypto’s own trends still shape the bigger picture. It’s probably a mix of his loud voice and a hyped-up post-election phase, just not the whole story yet.",

We can see it in his famous \"The Apprentice\" Television show years ago. We can recognize it through his first President term 8 years ago when his statements created considerable changes in stock markets and oil market. What he has been doing recent weeks after taking over the White House don't surprise me too much.QuoteIf this trend continues, it seems like the market is reacting directly to whatever Trump says which could mean his influence is stronger than we thought when it comes to crypto.What do you guys think? Is my observation valid, or am I just overthinking it? In short term, his statements will have big effects on the market, but in long term, the market and the crowd will become more familiar with it, and effects will be smaller. His statements are kind of news and FUD and we know that with similar either positive or negative news, fud, their effects will not be the same forever.",

      "body": "seriously the OP's observations are limitedthe initial dump was due to reactions of a hack from bybit exchange... not trump tariffs(i think OP has some love idol obsession of watching trump and wanting trump to be the cause of everything)yes this pump in the last 24 hours was reaction to trump mentioning bitcoin reserve. but thats just trumpette fangirls getting excited... as you can see within hours the pump is slowly calming down and resettingtrue market events have more substantial changes to market that then lock-in (EG the halving changed price and we havnt gone below $70k again)however, social media reactions happen quick then die down and reset(EG trump talk/something on social media goes viral: cause a 10% change that then resets back to norm)if trump was dictating the market then it would be a continual thing that lasts more then a few hoursthese temporary events purely show we have alot of emotional traders currently(newbies) that cant control themselves. very reactionary and dont know better.usually those types of traders dont last long, lose out quick. and markets then doesnt react to social media as much for longer periods(they learn the hardway the word 'patience' and they turn off their notifications after seeing their doctor for anxiety meds)..trump is not the one sat at some exchange terminal throwing money at some price shouting \"burn baby burn\"its his emotional fan girls who will eventually have a hernia, lose their stash and then silently slip away into a pit of anxiety med addiction(much like traders of years past who are emotional and havnt heard of \"switch off notifications\")",

News from US can cause something like this also. I hope the man is not using it for his own advantage.From this recent development it is clear that a powerful figure can influence Bitcoin price, we all saw what happened, Trump, made a comment and it rallied Bitcoin price. We can choose to call it manipulation or anything else but realty is that the impact on price is more than mere coincidence. The good thing however is that any manipulation is always on the short term because Bitcoin is decentralized, no single event can influence it for a long time. People have been speculating that if Trump, lives up to his promise of Bitcoin reserve that it'll cause price to skyrocket and that means that Trump can influence price on the short term",

What happens when he is having a bad day and makes a comment about bitcoin. You get it now. It's not the person but the position. If Trump weren't president, his words wouldn't hold much weight because there's nothing he can do. If any president of America says something like having a Bitcoin reserve, the market will react accordingly. The difference between Trump and other leaders of America is that the other realise that their words have weight and meaning so they don't say whatever it is they feel like saying. Trump says whatever, whenever, wherever without even thinking about the consequences and this has caused more problems than solutions but it's something his fans and supporters always make excuses for. I believe the actions or statements of one person can have an effect on bitcoin, but not a huge effect. If Michael Salor announces that he's selling off a huge part of his bitcoin, that will most likely affect the price, but the good thing about the bitcoin market is that it always corrects itself. When there is a price dip or pump based on a rumur, it corrects itself in no time",
