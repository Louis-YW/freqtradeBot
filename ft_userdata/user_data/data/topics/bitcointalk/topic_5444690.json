Accounts and trading are not forbidden by the rules.Really?But account trading is highly discouraged and can attract tags from DT members because they very well know that people buy and sell accounts for unethical reasons. The practice also encourages account theft. But you just decided to ignore the tags and send the money anyway.Now I guess you know why the practice is high frowned upon by the communityFlag against the user: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3131",

Repent. I really wanted an avatar.The topic of this scammer is self-moderated, so he can delete any negative posts that he does not like, and leave the positive ones, as he has already deleted 13 posts by 13 users, also the rank of his account is Newbie, which is the lowest rank in the forum, in addition to that he already has a lot of negative trusts, the thing which also raises the suspicion of any person that he sells the Legendary account, which is the highest rank in the forum, and this account has +6 positive trusts, for only 299 dollars, and this is a very weak price compared to the rank of this account and its feedback, as he can earn a lot from it if he works on it, so why does he sell it at this price? All of these are sufficient proofs to make any person not waste their money in dealing with a suspicious member like this.Quote from: SirAndre on July 20, 2022, 09:32:43 PMThis is a self-moderated topic.

If the legendary account has all these features with the ability to recover money within a short period, why is it being sold at such a cheap price?On the other hand, I have faith that whatever comes easy goes easily, a member who does not put in the effort and patient work to get his account upgraded will not gain anything from buying an old account even if there are no negative flags on the purchased account. Because such a lazy person will not make good use of the account and will certainly not gain anything from it.",

Escrow is made for this exact reason, so you won't get scammed by people who ask to pay first and get the item later. My friend had an encounter with an old beggar once who said she'd tell him his fortune. She asked him to lay a bill on his palm and show her the palm with the bill so she can read it. When he did that she took the bill, said it's for prayers to the almighty, pointed to heavens, he looked up and while he was doing it she put the bill in her bra and walked away  I guess you've just experienced a similar thing. May you learn from it.",

Escrow is used to avoid scams but buying/selling accounts or trading merit is part of scams. So, there is no reason for the escrow provider to provide escrow service for buying/selling accounts or trading merit.",
