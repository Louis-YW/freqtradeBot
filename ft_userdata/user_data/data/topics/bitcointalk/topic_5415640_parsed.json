I dont know how women did cope with all that but, am sure it's some of the models that built the strong women in our world today.Still a good thing these rules are mostly extinct or modified to its minimum but am sure they served there purpose for the time and now, we've got better to replace them. So much for 1914.",

White Men obviously didn’t have a rules book to dictate what they can and can’t do and civilization didn’t do a thing to make these oppressive rules go away. Women had to fight and protest themselves for these man made oppressive rules could go away. With the Supreme Court ruling on abortion months back, men are again trying to take away the rights and freedom of a woman.",

Having said that, i think the feminist movement from all over the world has come a long way in providing awareness and ensuring that women are treated somewhat equally, right now women are leaders in different departments in schools and even in government, thus these days i don't hear or see too many complaints from women being unfairly treated at work or social gatherings.",

That's what to be grateful for.  Imagine this kind of rule against female teachers in 1914 still existing. What would have been your reaction? There's nothing wrong with these rules. Everybody at that time understood that these were the rules. If the woman didn't want to follow the rules, she didn't have to be a teacher. Find another job, and many did.Right now, today, anybody who is an employer has rules. If you don't like the rules, don't work there.Many of the rules are regulations formulated by government. If an employer doesn't like the rules government makes for his business, he has three choices:1. Lobby government to get the rules changed;2. Find a different business that doesn't have such obnoxious government rules;3. Make the business into a Private Membership Association (PMA) so that it is outside of most government regulation and authority.After all, it was the lobbying and protesting that got the rules changed ion the first place. And it is the PMA-type rules (religion) that keep the Amish from having to obey a lot of things that government says. Individual Amish people don't have to remain Amish if they don't want. And the Amish will accept others into their clans if those people agree to follow their rules.It's called freedom. To force anyone to not obey their own rules is to take freedom away from them.",

Some of these unfair rules may no longer be written down, but they still exist in some peoples mind and are practiced in different aspects of life and not just the workplace teaching job. There is need for an increased campaign for women rights and equality to abolish any crude thinking still adopted by some men.",

Right now there are schools across the US that are private schools. They make their own rules for their teachers. If a teacher doesn't want to follow the rules, the teacher can withdraw her application for employment.Private schools don't fall under the same requirements that public schools do, and a lot of people don't like public school requirements. You can tell by the number of home schooling there is throughout the US.",

Some where not even allowed to go to school as it was believed that it was seen as a wasted investment.",

The development of religious practices has also contributed to a noticeable decrease in the number of immodest women, in my opinion. However, before then, it was common for men to abuse women in general, not just female teachers, by treating them like slaves and giving them unrestrained orders. These initiatives led to gender equality today. While progress has been made, I believe some women continue to abuse the privilege of being treated leniently.",

Religion is just a tool used to maintain the power and keep it for men only. Some men would like very much to do it without regilion but religion is the easiest way to accomplish that. Just because these \"discriminations belong to the past\" in the western world, doesn't mean that they wouldn't echo today. Just because we change the laws, doesn't mean the attitude would change. They only changes slowly and needs laws to keep in check. Otherwise they could change in a heartbeat and and it might seem absurd to us but women already lost their right for their own body in US.",
