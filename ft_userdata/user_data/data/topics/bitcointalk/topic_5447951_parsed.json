An epic fail would be if the rocket explodes and \"burns\" those 62 BTC, of course, unless the private key is \"documented\" somewhere safe.",

I can't say how that mission ended and whether it came true at all, but as it started, it seems that this is not the last attempt to send BTC to the Moon, although I personally expect that someone will send it a little further, maybe to Mars",

Maybe it is some kind of easter egg or something? Aside from that I am also concern whether that rocket will explode or not and who would even risk treasure hunting in space even in the future? Who knows how large the space is and where will they even start looking for clues regarding the rocket if it happens it'll explode somewhere and let's just say the priv keys are stored safely on that aircraft.His view towards things is really bizarre. Maybe this is just him feeding his inner childhood fulfilling his dreams or just something due to his inconsistent behavior. We really don't know what's on his mind.",

Probably because at the time of the decision it was worth around $1.5 million and that's the amount of money they were supposed to be getting from their NFT sale.So, it was a publicity stunt to gain some more sales as only 25% of the value of the NFTs will go to the moon!Now, the interesting part will be to watch Elon's reaction!Since this is not something he oversees directly as the rover is the property of another company that just sells space for the trip for whoever wants to buy some, and probably he has found out over Twitter I wouldn't be surprised if he decides to paint the whole rocket with a Shiba picture or demand that at least the rover would need to get a paint job.Quote from: electronicash on April 11, 2023, 04:44:44 PMcurious to know your view. with such plan in going to the moon, what is it for LunarCrush and Elon ?LunarCrush just sold a few million worth of NFTs and SpaceX is getting paid by Lunar Outpost (a different company) to get their rover to the moon!",
