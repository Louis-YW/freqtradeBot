  "content": "So I was reading this article where a recent study showed that 71% of online gambling merchants have reported an increase in promotion abuse over the past year. QuoteAfter surveying 1,700 fraud and payment professionals based at online gambling platforms, the study found that 62% of all types of online merchants had suffered an increase in fraud over the past 12 months. These operators detailed significant impacts on revenue as a result of online fraud.Promotional offers are a common tactic employed by online gambling platforms to attract customers; such offers include loyalty rewards, sign-up bonuses and free bets.Savvy players make use of multiple accounts and different IP addresses to exploit these promotions, finding loopholes that result in heavy financial losses for the companies targeted.Another form of fraud that has seen an increase is online payment fraud, with 67% of merchants reporting a rise in payment details being taken from customer accounts. The high traffic of the websites involved can make it difficult for companies to clamp down on fraudulent activity.I was sitting and wondering, there will always be bad actors in online gambling but who is to blame, the customers/fraudsters or the gambling merchants? Are the customers/fraudsters getting tech-savvy or are the gambling merchants getting complacent in checking and testing their website for loopholes? Don't these online gambling operators anticipate these frauds while building their websites? Why don't they invest in a robust fraud detection system before the fraud happens and not after?I ask again who is to blame for the increase in bonus abuse, the customers/fraudsters or the online gambling operators?",

Some people will open an account and later open another account to be taking advantage of the bonuses, but many still can lead to losses from the punter after receiving the bonus if gambling in an inexperienced way. But if truly some gamblers are taking advantage of this, having more than one account which I believe would violate the terms and conditions of the gambling site. Gambling sites themselves needs to employ teams that their work is based on detecting frauds, online crimes and users having more than one accounts which is against their terms and conditions to reduced all these illegal activities.",

If casinos give bonuses to new customers, it is also a normal way to attract people to come and play at their casinos. But unfortunately, many of them then abuse the bonus by creating another account just to get more. Somehow, the casino will know the abusers and block them immediately.",

Of course that the scammers are to blame.Now let's see about the online casinos. Here it's a bit more complicated.They have to offer bonuses and promotions to stay in sync with the competition. Else they can easily rush into oblivion.But...1. Most of them don't have enough technical knowledge to avoid security holes.2. Most of them don't have enough budget to heavily test and review the casino software, hence they won't see the holes.3. Most of them don't have enough personnel in the first year, when more of the withdrawals should be reviewed, when more users may need support too.So there are significant loses? Sure. But, I don't know the numbers, but some of that loses should have been in the development/test/operational budget and they're not.Yeah, it's also the fault of the operators.",

In my country, the gambling site do not request for ID documents or facial recognition, just few steps to register, I remember the first betting site I used in my country, I had three betting accounts on the betting site before I later checked the gambling site ToS some months I have registered, I later had to leave two accounts alone and disused and continue to use just only one. Some people are very smart and can make this abuse possible. But I was not after bonus, I did not even got any bonus anyway from any of the accounts when I registered.Quote from: Gianluca95 on June 15, 2022, 07:24:33 AMAnyway, a bonus abusing is also a legal practice, so, casino can only assumes initiatives by itself, without the help of anyone.If it is in ToS, then it is an abuse, it is in the ToS of most of the gambling sites I have used before, so it should be seen not legal.",

They didn't do any harm to anyone, while the fraudsters are hack the casino or find a loopholes to stole the money, do you think stole a money is correct? I don't have any idea why you're asking this stupid question.Most of big casinos always hire someone to check all the codes and make sure it doesn't have any vulnerability at that time, some casinos even run a bug bounty program to make their security better. But, there's no completely 100% safe in this digital world and there's a chance it can got hacked e.g. centralized exchanges.",

This is a very subjective question and varies depending on the actual facts given in the situation. Some casino is indeed telling the truth while some of them are using the benefit of the doubt to trap/not paid user that wins their bonus. The blame should be pointed to the one who committed mistakes in that particular scenario. We can't blame the technology since even the security of the casino tighten to filter these cheaters, There's always a way to find a hole in this to still exploit their bonus. I think KYC is the only way to finally stop this abuse but I doubt that players will still play so give or take, Casino is risking their bonus to still get customers and hoping they will lose before they can claim it.",

Honest people don't take advantage when they run into bugs, they report it! If the casino team is smart they will reward the person who reported a bug! Abusers will abuse! They are looking for ways to do it! The only reason why they gamble is to abuse casino promotions! So they are going around looking where and how to do it! Nobody likes abusers, it's not nice what they are doing! But casino security is the casino team's responsibility!

All the customers making multiple accounts, once the sportsbooks find out about it and close their account.
