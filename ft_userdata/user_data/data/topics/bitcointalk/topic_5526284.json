And all the cash from Meta is supposed to be invested in bitcoin to avoid inflation and increase assets. I think the chance is much higher than that of microsoft, but whether that really happens... we'll see. The fact that it is being discussed in public is good publicity for bitcoin.",

It just takes one big player to start, and the rest will likely follow. However, it would be even better if the US government made the first move, having the regulators themselves involved would definitely boost confidence for companies considering it.But let’s see how that proposal unfolds. It’s still early, so there’s a lot to watch for this year.",

Maybe they also think that their decision has been justified especially when they see current bearish situation happened on Bitcoin. But hopefully they realize that they made a wrong assumption on Bitcoin and open this topic again then make this plan come into reality.Also base on this article their shareholders really like to participate on Bitcoin investment https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/shareholders-urge-mark-zuckerberg-to-buy-bitcoin-for-meta-3808005 So I guess that everything will depend now on the decision of Mark Zuckerberg now. Let see if they announce something amazing and will not follow what Microsoft did.",

Just because they are not rushing to invest in bitcoin, we should not judge them and assume they are making a mistake. If they were people who kept making wrong decisions, they would not be able to become rich, own billions of dollars and become shareholders of a corporation with a capitalization of up to trillions of dollars. I believe they have their reasons for not rushing to invest in bitcoin and just because they haven't invested in bitcoin doesn't mean they won't invest in it in the future. The rich have their own way of playing, they can invest after us, buy at a higher price than us but they will get better returns than us.",

Well, in this case I am more hopeful than in the case of Microsoft, because everything will depend on what Mark Zuckerberg wants, it is not like in the other cases that it depends on the vote. The vote will take place because it is a formality, but if Zuckerberg wants to buy bitcoin and if he doesn't, he doesn't. This makes me optimistic, though:Mark Zuckerberg Has a Goat Called Bitcoin. What Does This Mean? And even if the article says that he once killed one of his goats to eat it, which is entirely logical, the fact that he chooses that name is indicative. I believe he owns some bitcoin personally.",

Not everybody will invest in Bitcoin; in the same way, not everybody will invest in gold or real estate or buy the shares of a particular company. There is no need to call people who don't want to invest in bitcoin names, they all have the reason whether it's fear or any other reason.When you put yourself in other people's shoes, you'll better understand their decisions. Imagine you're part of the team that's responsible for investments in a company and you're faced with a decision to invest customers' or shareholder's money in bitcoin knowing the risks involved. If it goes well everybody is happy, but if it doesn't, the company takes a hit and that's on you, not the people that advice you to go into the investment. There are other ways to maximize profit and they have followed those route and taking the risk, if they decide against bitcoin, they have committed no crime against bitcoin.",

It's not as radical as it once was, but it's still risky. BUT, I believe most future or tech-focused company should hold some, if even simply as an inflation hedge.",

With more and more corporate money flowing into Bitcoin, it will eventually become very difficult for the retail investors to navigate the market. These corporates will hold the power to control the market because of their deep pocket and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin will be compromised.

Many big organizations including banks didn't like Bitcoin at first but now they are starting to like this idea. Microsoft and Meta shareholders might also start to like Bitcoin in future. No matter what they decide more and more people are starting to use Bitcoin and it is exciting to see it become more popular and widely accepted.",

But if someone insists of expecting that something good might happen, just think of what happened with Microsoft. There's a failed project related to crypto from Meta before and that's the project Libra and it didn't materialized. So, if there will be suggestions for their boards or higher positions to consider buying Bitcoin to create a Bitcoin reserve, there is little to having no chance at all. But let's wait if Trump's word will create a domino impact as what he's said about in creation of a Bitcoin reserve.",

Bitcoin has no value without utility; the closest company that has helped its cause was Tesla when they started to accept Bitcoin, but took a step back after.Meta is not a company that focuses on risky investments or speculative assets. The board is right to vote against it, no reason for Meta to adopt Bitcoin as part of their reserve when the objective of their cash reserve is to promote growth with reasonable risk.",

He knew that the incoming administrations might be against some of his policies, so he might be aligning with them and their stance on bitcoin might also be because Donald Trump is perceived as pro bitcoin, so he don't want to be left out.",
