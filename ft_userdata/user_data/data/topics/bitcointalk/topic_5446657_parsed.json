  "content": "Hello everyone! I'm not a coder personally, but in my opinion, doing a research on Bitcoin's fundamentals is very important for everyone because of many aspects: - understanding how Bitcoin works and what makes it better compared to Altcoins- preventing costly mistakes resulting from a lack of knowledge about BitcoinI'm currently searching for interesting blog posts about Bitcoin's fundamentals written by coders but written in an understandable way for average people (who are not coders). So far, in my list is for example: - MURCH and his website: https://murch.one/ (but he's not very active)- JAMESON LOPP and his website: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html (he's very atice but it's very technical sometimes for coders)I also know about Bitcoin Stack Exchange and Bitcointalk of course, but I don't know if it's always a good source because everyone can reply (I don't know if some people are not educated enough). I'm looking forward to your contributions. I just want to look for Bitcoin's fundamentals for now, what is important for average people to know.",

Nice to have so many suggestions from you. Â You're very welcome! As a programmer I sometimes stupidly assume everyone else is a programmer, or even if they are that they know what I know already. Nevertheless, maybe not immediately, but over time given enough interest you might really want to know exactly how Bitcoin works. If that time comes the door is wide open,Â  but understanding what is really going on is majorly complicated. It can be fun if you make it fun.",
