  "content": "I know and understood we live in strange world and everthing dont make any sense at all.We know who are our political leaders...all we know.But Even this one looking very strange...why would the russia want to play with fire ? The NATO countries UK Norway france germany finland and Baltics can crush russia very fast.Russia knows there is no way that russia can Even to fight against NATO.The current situation making every smart person to ask whats going on in this world ?? Also If russia did this it means russians don't think at all ...If nato crush the russia ...who will be the new bad guy then ? AS we been teached from the movies russia vs west and russia the bad guy.USA not the Angel either but atleast now nobody don't point finger on usa never becouse the world got their BAD guy now we have that bad guy.Russia look like Tony Montana from the movie scarface...this is the bad guy.But everybody knows there is no way that russia can do anything much against NATO the NATO numbers are just bigger.So If this Rocket strike to poland was russian then who ever did this cant be very smart person maybe russian generals did drinking too much and rocket went little wrong Direction.Becouse everybody knows russia cant beat the NATO never Even russians knows NATO have just bigger numbers and more countries in this.",

      "body": "I now see something rotten everywhere from the first day this war began. That Russia would commit such a crazy act seems to me rather unlikely, given the already quite critical situation for them.I don't think we can talk about a missile with a wrong aim given that we are in 2022 and with all the technological systems that exist especially in the military field, we can miss the target by several km. Sensationalists will say that Russian missiles are from the 60s but I find it hard to believe.I hope that the situation will be resolved in the best possible way without falling even further into violence. It seems that Ukraine wants this as some sort of revenge in my view.I'm not a conspiracy theorist but too many things don't add up in this conflict.",
