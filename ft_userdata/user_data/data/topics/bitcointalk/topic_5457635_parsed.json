  "content": "As many of you know, I reship for many collectors on and off this forum.When I ship a package, I transmit the tracking numbers to the buyer/owner.... but I have been getting many questions on international/outside US tracking numbers and why there are 2 codes and why 1 code always seems to not workAny international package that is shipped using USPS (US national post), receives 2 tracking codesThe first code will always start with a 9This is the tracking code for within the US. The package will \"always\" end up at a place in New York or New Jersey.This is the international processing/customs center for US international packagesThe second code will not \"be active\" yet as it travels within the USOnce customs has cleared the package, the second tracking code will become activeThe tracking code will begin with 2 letters such as CY, LV, UM Â have 9 numbers in the middle and then end with 2 more letters \"US\" indicating it is coming from the USExample: 9400123401341234123411Example: CY461347555US / LV461347555US / UM613475551USOther services like UPS and Fedex use a singular number tracking system",
