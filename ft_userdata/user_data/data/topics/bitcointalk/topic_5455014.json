Becouse they trade btc and eth side by side with OIL contracts, and gold contracts and it's on commodities Market not sp500 and not Forex either.That's why Im saying it's very important to know what they do it becouse rest of the people tend to be living in different world time and space thank god i don't be like the rest of the people.But yes btc is commoditie it's classfied as commoditie in the financial world and treated as commoditie wich making sense becouse they say btc Are digital gold and gold is not money gold is commoditie.If you familiar with big guys actions then you understood excacly what Im talking about and from where i get this info exacly.",
