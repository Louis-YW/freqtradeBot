  "content": "One or the Most significant reasons for the creation of Bitcoin was,to create a currency easy and suitable to be used for peer-to-peer transactions.During the first eight to nine years of its launch, Bitcoin actually achieved this goal, With fees considerably low as just a few cents. However things began to change at about early 2016 when fees began to increase noticably, and during late 2017 when the mempool started having congestions, which influenced transaction fees directly.Of course, One can say the reason for the very low fees during its earliest stages was a result of low adoption and a less congested mempool. We can also confirm that due to the problems of competition for block spaces which led to high fees, Bitcoin's block size was increased on August 24, 2017 by the application of the SEGWIT protocol upgrade known as \"Segregated witness\" in full. This definitely helped in malleability of transactions by separating the signature data (withness data) from the transaction data to free up block space. Other solutions like the layer 2 that became popular during 2018,also helped reduce congestions and fees by conducting majority of transactions off the Blockchain making transactions more scalable and faster.However, upon these upgrades and solutions, as Bitcoin grew the congestion problem has  become more and more prominent especially due to the effects of ordinals in recent times.These congestion and fee problems are gradually exempting the need to make simple day to day transactions with Bitcoin thereby bring the need for people to make small transactions with other stable altcoins like Tron and Doge.Take for example  this post made by Hhampuz who is one of the most reputable campaign managers on Bitcoin talk.In that post Hhampuz made mention of spending roughly $200 /week on fees for each campaign. Now assuming Hhampuz managess 5 campaigns for 15 weeks, taking the math he would have spent an enormous amount of about $15,000 (~0.34BTC) on fees only. Considering these enormous fees P2P transactions would become  uneconomical.",

Who would really be on their right minds on paying up 20 bucks worthof Bitcoin and having a fee of the same amount?No one on their right minds would really be definitely doing that. This is why its not really that shocking into seeing things such as thisthat there's a lessen p2p efficiency and there's nothing we can do about it but to deal up on the things on what are really that happening.So its better to go with the flow.",

As it stands now we can all blame ordinals because it is them that consist mainly of this transaction and most started paying higher transaction fees to try beat every other transaction to the next block. The question is should devs be looking at finding a specific solution to only this Ordinals to avoid filling the blockchain? Wouldn’t that be a censorship which is against bitcoin decentralization protocol?Also shouldn’t we be looking beyond ordinals and assume they are like the much expected adoption we have been clamoring for? Should it come wouldn’t the mempool be congested as this?",

Considering these enormous fees P2P transactions would become  uneconomical. Quite true. I think it's time we talk about how we want bitcoin to be regarded of once again, even if it brings about another blocksize war. The fact of the matter is that, even if bitcoin were to be successful in being a store of value and being an investment tool you can use to make yourself wealthy, people will still talk about the good old days and how it was once a great way for you to transfer money to another person without paying too much as a few cents. Furthermore, it also hampers with the tradability of bitcoin as you're either forced to wait until bitcoin's network's not congested (which happens like never nowadays) or you have to shoulder the 10-50 dollar transaction fee just so you can transfer money to and fro different networks. It's quite distressing and in some cases it even makes fiat money remittance more appealing cause at the very least when you send money to Western Union you don't get charged 100 bucks in a single transaction. Scalability is going to be a problem if we don't do anything right now. Layer 2 is great but is there really anyone in here who'd willingly go out of their own way to use the Lightning Network which mind you isn't as efficient as they make it out to be?",

Like in May when fees spiked to like $20-$30 for a few days so many people were freaking out thinking that was the new norm, and fees quickly went back down to like $1-$3.Yeah it sucks useless ordinals are clogging up the blockchain, and ideally those wouldn't exist. But the future of Bitcoin use is obviously L2 and it always has been because the Bitcoin blockchain is the base security layer for the Bitcoin payment ecosystem. In the future most people will never or hardly ever interact with it because as in any payment protocol, the average person only touches the higher more efficient layers.No need to freak out every time fees temporarily spike. Fees are already falling from wherever they peaked at recently. Bitcoin works same as always, and we've still got a number of years before fees will actually drive us all to have to use L2.",
