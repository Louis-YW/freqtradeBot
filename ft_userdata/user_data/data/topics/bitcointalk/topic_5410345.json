      "body": "100 watts is not going to happen unless you want to use USB stick miners. But by the time you add in a few watts for the controller and other overhead for the powered USB hub you are probably going to be over 100WUnder 200W can be done with the futurebit:https://shop.futurebit.io/products/pre-order-apollo-btc-a-bitcoin-asic-miner-and-desktop-class-computer-running-a-full-node-and-much-more-batch-1-ships-in-late-april-to-may?variant=33404796928099Keep in mind none of these are ever going to generate any profit once you factor in equipment costs, but they are fun to play with.-Dave",

So if you have 4 of them the total power is around 100w with 1-2th/s. This miner is a bit pricey compared to futurebit as suggested above.",

They pull 120w just for the sticks and fan, you will need a raspi4 or similar to control them though so add some more watts for that. I had a Futurebit Apollo BTC aswell but prefer the Compac F’s.",

Poke around the various RasPi Maker sites for the display boards and the code to have an app periodically query the cgminer API (that Kano wrote) to get the data you want to display.btw: Kano is now the sole active developer for cgminer since -ck long ago closed his cgminer thread and locked his cgminer git. The most current repository is Kano's. Along with writing the CompacF driver and adding it he also cleaned up a lot of other code and drivers while he did it",

I ask this question because I think I will use the miner to run all 3 boards at 100 Watts each if this is possible with basically no noise.No, you can't replace it with an incompatible fan you should only replace it with the compatible fan but if you want to test it in Braiins OS maybe the fan will always run at full speed by enabling immersion mode. Why don't you just adjust the fan speed at a very low speed(The stock fan) just make sure to monitor the temp but since you set the power limit to 100w I think it won't get hot too much.",

I ask this question because I think I will use the miner to run all 3 boards at 100 Watts each if this is possible with basically no noise.More or less CFM = 3.25 x Watts / allowed temp rise deg F So figure out room temp and how hot you want your miner to run an you can do the math of how much air you have to move.This is not perfect but should give you a good idea of how fast / slow you have to run the fans. It's also a worst case scenario of heat transfer.-Dave",

Also the Apollo was very expensive and therefore I choose to buy an S9i. The S9i runs perfectly and also if the prices increase or I have free electricity I can bump it up to earn more.
