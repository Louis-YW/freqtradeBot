  "content": "I wanna speak to Razer privately about my situation ^Important, if you ever see this Razer, please I beg you to fix my situation. I needed this money to pay back a friend. Since I value my Rollbit account just as much as my money, I already feel hurt well enough that my Rollbit account is banned but I'm aware that the moderation is my fault so it is what it is. But to have my money basically lost for no reason hurts so much. Rollbit was the starting foundation  of how I earned money online by buying and selling NFTs and later advanced to more buying and selling online and I was happy to be a loyal member of the community for 2 years and I'm still grateful that I found your site. Even then, my hard earned cash was basically lost for no reason, I didn't do anything wrong to deserve losing it and I genuinely feel awful about it thinking about it constantly as it could've really improved my life at this moment. I've been trying to get my mind off this as of now but it hasn't been working well. Please understand the importance of why I needed to get my money back. If I can’t get it back my life will be a lot more difficult and stressed for literally no reason. Please help me! I don’t want to call Rollbit “scammers” as that’s the wrong word. They are amazing people and calling them scammers is wrong. However though, the owner of the website has sent my money to the “depositing address” which was an FTX address that can no longer be accessed by anyone I believe. This was my hard work and it’s lost now. I was KYC locked for 1 year and 3 months so I verified and then all this happens. I never told him to send it there, we had no discussion about where my Rollbit funds would be sent to, and considering it was over a year since the deposit he should’ve talked to me before doing this. Why did this not at least happen? It just all randomly happened after an investigation into my account was completed, but considering how old the last deposit was(1 year, 3 months) and the amount ($5,200+) considering all this, We should’ve had a discussion about which address to send the money to instead of just doing this completely randomly. I feel fucked over and sad since I was completely loyal to Rollbit from 2021 - 2023, two years. I’ve literally done nothing wrong to deserve losing my money and it’s just fucking tossed away like this.  Just why? I feel so fucking heartbroken and sad just why all this pain man. I have to worry about this like whyyy.",

      "body": "Please be sure to read the full thing before replying or else you may get lost reading it.Apologies for being unclear. I deposited $2.5k using a companies hot wallet, and they were partnering with FTX. I was KYC locked when withdrawing after during July 2022 and during October 2023 (1 year and 3 months later) I verified KYC and went through a Google Meeting with SmokeyLisa to ensure that It was me who was verifying and then the Rollbit Team did a deep investigation on my account and my money to ensure that I wasn’t laundering any money or breaking the rules of the websiteI was proven that I didn’t launder any money or exchange crypto or other rule breaking stuff. However, I was banned from Rollbits Website for previously logging in using rollbit.com instead of rollbot.com from over a year and a half ago which was something I’ve admitted to first thing. However, I did NOT earn my money from gambling, I’ve earned a lot of money back then and Rollbit was the foundation of it. I started buying and selling NFTs(which is allowed for USA) and later came to trade and buy and sell on other websites. This was why I was allowed to receive my money, we just had to prove that I wasn’t a launderer or thief or crypto exchanger, etcAlso please keep in mind I had an additional almost $1.7k on Rollbit prior to this. The issue lies here. After their investigation was completed, Razer just randomly sent the money back to the depositing address. We had no discussion, No talk or confirmation to send it to this address. It just randomly happened. It’s just completely fucked up considering how long ago my last deposit was (1 year and 3 months) and the amount of money ($5,300 USD due to inflation. We should’ve had a discussion on where the money should’ve been sent to considering all of these factors. Also, I already proved to the Community Manager how this money was deposited days prior back in our google meeting session, so this should’ve been noted that I had no control of this address and that it was a companies address. In this same google meeting as well as when I answered one of their questions I’ve stated that my exodus wallet was my main address, and Ive stated within my answer that my main address was from exodus showing the address multiple too once via google meeting and once via chat. so this should’ve also been noted that thisI’ve contacted the company thinking I’d get my money back from there but they confirmed to me that they used FTX and that they can no longer access this wallet. I really hope that everyone reading understands the same feelings as this is just completely unfair for me. I was going to use this money to pay back a friend, focus on life but it’s now lost for literally no reason and it sucks that it happened like thisRollbit has always been a great company. Despite what alot of people say here, NO they are not scammers. Rollbit is not a fraud site they are not evil. I’ve been with them for years and despite my recent experience I can still verify that they are great people. It just fucking sucks that I have to lose so much of my hard earned money for literally no reason randomly and I’m hoping that Razer can realize how fucked up this is and fix this situation.If Razer responds, I’ll send him a private message with the proof that this can’t be accessed by anyone. I will make sure to record and refresh the  proof since screenshots can be faked.",

I trusted them and now I'm basically banished over a small mistake and my hard earned money is now gone because of the genuine unfairness of this situation hereI'm not sure if this helps but here is some extra information for the situationRollbit hasn’t stated any reason for their investigation but based upon the situation and their specific questions they asked me I believe those reasons as to why it happened. The $1.7k that wasn't sent from that FTX wallet address was also sent there back to that address. This money was also completely unrelated to the $2,498 that was deposited from that address onto Rollbits website, so I'm wondering even if this was the case, what about this money that was unrelated to the FTX wallet? Why did it have to be sent there too?The company that used this address can verify that no money was stolen or anything either, I assume that they are willing to do a meeting with Razer as well to verify this. The exodus address that I kept mentioning that was my main wallet () has been used since the start of the account on Rollbit during late 2021 and I still use it to this day in 2023. There are many past transactions both on my Rollbit account and the other website that I used to deposit to Rollbit where money is sent to my exodus address many times prior to the start of July 2022. I still have the history of this same transaction during July 2022 as well under this account which can be provided again. This alone should prove that I am the original owner of both the Rollbit and the company account from which the money was coming from to deposit at Rollbit. This should also prove that this exodus wallet address is an acceptable address to send and I'm willing to provide the proof as well to reshow.Its just really messed up since I worked hard to earn this cash. I've literally done nothing wrong to deserve losing it and now this is a time where I need the money to pay back a friend and I literally feel like im treated like a garbage bin from Rollbit after all this and honestly idk what to say anymore. I just truly hope that Razer is willing to realize that. It's already very stressful enough to be banned off their website and then banned off their discord(Benji said so, I just left the server after because I wasn't allowed to come back) after telling me that I was allowed to use their Discord but not their site since I cared about Rollbit but so far I feel like I'm being treated no better than someone who actually did laundering or gambled to earn their money illegally. I feel like I was robbed out of all the hard work and effort I made in not only earning the $5k+ but I also feel robbed out of the time I spent caring for the community and websites progression overall. When I was being investigated I thought I would be allowed to come back, so I was hyped to start investing in their NFTs as well but because of this I can't even do that either anymore without using a third party with \"gas fees\" (OpenSea or whatever). Before this whole experience I thought of Rollbit far better, whenever being reminded of Rollbit all I had was good times and memories with the website and community but after this whole incident I feel the exact opposite, it just feels so unreal like a nightmare man. And I was loyal here for years too and this happens to me of all people.Dude bitcoin is literally raising so much right now I feel so fucking sad about this. I beg for this situation to be fixed man",

Sorry for your loss, but you must accept that.  QuoteIts just really messed up since I worked hard to earn this cash.btw. Is gambling really hard-working?How come the \"very beginning\" mistake is wrong? I am confused here. Is it against the rules of all gambling sites or something? I also didn't know the company was using FTX wallets at the time, the company put my money that I earned in BTC and I deposited using their wallet to rollbit (I shouldve just used my exodus, but I didn't think much at all I just trusted both wallets and I made the decision to use rollbits)Until now I assumed based upon reading the explanation that only the money sent that I deposited from the company to Rollbit ($2,498)  should've been sent back even though the other 1.7k which wasn't involved with that address was also sent back. I understand now I guessAs for the last quote, I didn't gamble to win any of this cash. I worked hard through buying and selling rollbot nfts as well as buying and selling on other websites. I don't like taking risks it's not something I like to do. It took a couple of months to actually get that far(I had more but I gave it to a friend to help his rent debt in late 2021) I started with my initial investment of around $2k on Rollbot NFTs.This is probably the worst way i've ever lost money and it's just unfair to me. I can understand why I'm not allowed to come back to their site even though it's still extremely dumb in the end that I stopped breaking a long while before the kyc lock when I realized, (but however still a serious rule that should have been taken seriously) but the way I lost my hard earned money here is just extremely stupid my life is literally becoming more ruined by this with not only the time spent stressing here but now I have to tell my friend to wait even longer before I can repay him which is sad man.",

But again I will like to say when next you are making deposit to a casino or gambling sites always withdraw your funds from exchange to a personal wallets before sending them to your gambling address otherwise if similar issues arises again this same could likely happened with you if you aren't careful on how you acts.I never owned the FTX account, the company of a website I was using partnered with FTX up until their expose in late 2022 and unfortunately they were the victim of their fraud and as a result lost tons of cash and they are unable to access their FTX wallets since FTX is closed for being one of the biggest crypto frauds in history. However though, I did deposit the money from the websites hot wallet address (which they used FTX) to rollbit. Yesterday, Razer sent the money back to this same address.Whenever I did crypto transactions, especially p2p I always knew it was a common sense rule to double or triple check the address you were sending to before sending the money, and I thought the same would be done at Rollbit. From my new understanding from this thread I wasn't fully aware of Rollbits AML Policy, especially thise one. So Razer just sent in my money back to the old address from 1 year and 3 months ago without talking to me or confirming that it was fine to do this. I now understand that in the company standpoint it is fair especially when a user agrees to their policies. But in the users standpoint it is completely unjustified and just saddening, especially seeing that it was sent without any agreement from both sides on where to send the money to. I can easily prove that it's me who owns my Rollbit account and can verify that the money was not stolen or laundered or anything evil. It's still extremely messed up and It actually hurts seeing crypto raise while I can't really do anything but hope and pray that Razer realizes how messed up this is and helps me. I was a loyal user at Rollbit for years and it already hurts enough being banned from their website (no arguments on that, as the website ban was on me and my past action of using \"rollbit.com\" and gambling bits of cash every once in a while until I became aware of the seriousness and not just sticking to \"rollbot.com\") but as for the money, it's still just messed man as I worked hard for it, wasn't illegitimately gained and I was always thinking of using it as some \"emergency\" fund and now we're at a time where I need it and cannot access it unfortunately because of the unexpected events. It hurts even more seeing it raise almost $1k today, now it's at almost $6k the last time I checked..I found Razer's account here and I'm going to send him a message of how I feel about this and everything and just hope that he realizes how wrong this is and helps in some way, it's all I can really do sadly.In regards to my last message, ah great. My luck \"User 'Rollbit Razer' has not chosen to allow messages from newbies. You should post in their relevant thread to remind them to enable this setting.\"How to not become a newbie? Could someone send the message to him if thats allowed?",

He should have informed the person in charge of the issue to allow him to choose where he wants to be paid, but I doubt if such requests could have even been accepted.From a company view they are right, but from a moral standpoint this is completely wrong. To literally everyone it is basically common sense to double or triple check where you are sending money to ensure it’s not lost or sent to the wrong person. Unfortunately from what I'm reading here from this thread, their policies apparently overrule this common sense rule, which although is extremely stupid, rules are still rules and when you sign up to sites you gotta agree with their stuff. Just sucks though. If they really cared about money returning safely to the owner they would’ve discussed it with me knowing it’s been over a year and not set up another prevention of AML. They are only correct from their company viewpoint, as rules are rules. Overall it’s still extremely fucked up that something like this happened, especially at a time where I needed to get money.This is my first time ever getting into serious trouble with any gambling casino. In the past I’ve moved funds from the third party company hot wallet to Rollbit and my Exodus wallet. I really did trust them both equally and it didn’t matter to me at the time. I would’ve never expected some situation like this to happen. I didn't know when their investigation was going to end either. I asked for an update saying that I'm willing to participate in any further KYC, questions or interviews to help complete their investigation. They just ended it completely randomly returning my money to that address without talking to me or anything. I wasn't even told that I was suspended until I logged in myself, so for a moment I thought everything was fully completed. I also did not know that they used FTX either. They moved to their own private wallet or whatever way worked for their website where a third party can’t fuck them over in December 2022 Just an unfortunate serious of events that couldve been prevented in multiple different ways, if I thought about some event like this happening, or if SBF didn’t exit scam fraud people or if the company partnered using a different exchange company or if Rollbit didn’t have this extra layer of AML and discussed to me. There were so many possibilities but sadly this is we’re i’m at I got the worst one of all. My luck.The entire time I was expecting to come back to Rollbit with my money in my Rollbit wallet after their investigation was completed and for a moment I even thought they were done (and didn’t inform me about my suspension) so I posted on their discord chat out of happiness only to log in and see that I was banned from their site with at the time with no context. Had I known that Rollbit would’ve sent it back to my depositing address I would’ve been telling them immediately the whole time. I had no clue this was going to happen and I wish that I knew the possibility of this prior.Quote from: holydarkness on October 24, 2023, 03:34:33 PMQuote from: rohang on October 24, 2023, 01:06:48 PMThis shouldnt have happened to you OP,  how can they just send such a large amount like that without confirm with you that you had access to the address ??These days alot of people use exchanges whose addresses are not controlled  by  us, even if you had used your own wallet they should confirm with you first that you still have access to the walletRollbit refunding you the money is great, but its irresponsible to just send it like that.I see holydarkness has sent a PM to Razor, i hope he will rectify thisBecause...

And I don't think they have to rectify it, they've done their part by sending the money they owed to OP.OP, one thing that has been bugging my mind since yesterday, I guess this is the first time I heard about an account got KYC-locked, for 15 months. What is it and why?They never directly stated that it was AML but I assume it to be based upon their questions and interviews. The interview was person specific, meaning it could only be me who knew how to login to certain accounts and etc. After, they reviewed the interview and started an investigation and asked me questions, I remember one that was like \"Why did you deposit from the company to Rollbit\" or something. They never told me why they started their investigation, nor the interview. But based upon the situation and what they asked I narrowed it down to because it was over a year since the KYC, so they wanted to ensure it was me and the bit of suspicion from sending from there to Rollbit, which is also understandable.Although I was locked since July 2022, I only verified KYC recently which is why it took 15 months. I always thought one day I could return to Rollbit as soon as I KYC verified and receive my money back. I also always thought the locked money could be used as part of \"emergency funds\" and now is the time where I need it and I can't access it because of this horrible situation. I was doing a deal with someone for an in-game item and not realizing how stupid or risky it was at the time sent the money from the companies hot wallet address to Rollbit and then withdrew almost the same amount to the person who was using a CashApp wallet which apparently gambling casinos hate. I normally sent my money from the company's hot wallet address to my own personal Exodus wallet that I have been using for years or to Rollbit since I equally trusted them both. I understand now how suspicious that can look on Rollbits side as well as how stupid it is but Rollbit NFTs were a major factor to how I was successful online so I obviously trusted them wholeheartedly with my money. I never knew something like this would've possibly happened in the end and since I'm not a thief and I was still new to gambling sites I had no idea about how suspicious it looked at the time especially the depositing and withdrawing immediately after. Combined with their questions is why I believe that they were investigating me for money laundering or theft. At the time I remember being told by a Rollbit Staff member that even if I KYC verified the funds would've been sent to him and not reverted to my Rollbit wallet. It made no sense to me, how could Rollbit stop the transaction at Pending but not return my money? So after hearing this, I didn't even want to make any attempt to KYC verify until I received an answer stating that I could get it back. I continued asking every once in a while if theres anything that could be done as well as checking up on the Rollbit community since they were still my friends. I thought about the situation fully and understood why they did all this extra stuff, even though they never directly stated to me about why the investigation happened or anything. They just wanted to confirm that I'm the original owner and they also wanted to confirm that it was gained legitimately and they wanted to ensure that I wasn't laundering, stealing, exchanging cryptocurrencies, etc. Since they now know I earned my money in a legitimate fashion, (which Rollbit NFTs buying and reselling were also a major starting foundation as to how I started earning money online) and since they knew the situation they wanted to return it to me but unfortunately even with their good intention the bad outcome happened to me still.Quote from: holydarkness on October 24, 2023, 05:55:28 PMQuote from: ineedhelpplease on October 24, 2023, 05:32:04 PM[Fix this quote on post you made, please]I believe you're meaning to wrote this below?Quote from: ineedhelpplease on October 24, 2023, 05:32:04 PMQuote from: ineedhelpplease on October 24, 2023, 04:38:21 AMIn regards to my last message, ah great.

The address is correct.2. If the address is in their control. That is entirely stupid and therefore this loss is 100% at the fault of Rollbit for not communicating or confirming properly. If Rollbit said\"We will send the coins to the address it came from, please confirm before we go ahead\"That one sentence would have prevented this whole thread and situation. If they did say that and OP approved, then it is his fault. From what I am reading that is not the case.I already agreed with the KYC/AML etc. part. The only part I disagreed with was sending coins to an address after a year without confirming the ownership of address. THAT, is stupid.",
