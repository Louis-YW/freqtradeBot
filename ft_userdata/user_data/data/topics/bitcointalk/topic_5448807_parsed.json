  "content": "Hello guys,Today I came here in hopes to find an answer to a very IMPORTANT question.I have been helping businesses for the last 6 years with the implementation of blockchain and cryptocurrency in their business. It works fine for the people who know how things work in crypto.But when it comes to the general public (non-tech-savvy), I can see that people still can't use it, and they are afraid of the technology. They don't know how to use it.Also, they fear losing money. If they miss the private key their funds will be lost forever. No one is there to help them recover. See this news.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/tens-of-billions-worth-of-bitcoin-have-been-locked-by-people-who-forgot-their-key.htmlIs anyone here thought how can we help our children and elders in our family so they can use crypto without hesitation just like they use fiat money? Because I don't blame those who don't have the knowledge, I consider this our responsibility how we can make a solution so that those people can also use it as a day-to-day payment method without a second thought.Does anyone know if any best user-friendly solutions already exist in the marketplace to overcome these challenges? Let's discuss this topic.",

You register for a online wallet service and you link your bank account to that service.. so that you can deposit fiat currency to buy crypto currencies. I have local online wallet services, but I use a hardware wallet and Electrum for every day use. Yes, there is an initial learning curb, but nothing more difficult than setting up a facebook or Twitter account.",

And some on some occasions older people paying some things in a tech store with crypto as well. The clerk even explained to them what to do . In some shops you got % off when you pay with crypto, I guess these shops see the potential in it possibly earning more in the long run.There is a site running a scam at the moment ( I made a thread about it, classic ponzi ) and they target Japanese as well. The deposits are all in USDT and in some cases bitcoin. A friend worked (until he figured out it's a scam, even though I told him from the beginning that its obvious) as a translator for the scammers. He told me in the meeting and presentations they were all eager to learn about crypto. Most of these people are 50 and older and they had no problem adjusting to something new.Too bad that in the end they lose.",

Where do you install a payment gateway into their business site for easy acceptance of crypto?Or you were helping them generate an address with a phrase and a private key that can be used to accept payment?  If keeping the private key safe is their issue , then they might actually not be able to safe guard their funds. I guess they might actually not be that exposed to the internet. I suggest they buy a a hardware wallet and be safe guiding it the way they safe guard their fiat at hand, but still they will need to backup the phrase. If they want where they can't be thinking about phrase and private key then they should be using centralized platform that's handing their security protection over to the hand of others which will really not be a wise idea, but if they actually want to be accepting crypto and don't want to be use private key and phrase they should go for centralized service providers like, exchanges.",

So to be safe, the only role you need to take is to spread awareness and educate them, and let them decide what they want after that.

Even after using it for 6 years in their businesses how aren't they still not good at handling it? IUsing of Bitcoin or Blockchain tech is not that difficult, and there's nothing to be afraid of from this technology. If they really don't know how to use it, then teach them the Bitcoin and blockchain by conducting physical seminars and personally clearing their concepts about Bitcoin. Guide them online via video call that will help them to learn this technology faster.They shouldn't have the fear of losing their money because Bitcoin is highly safe, and if handled carefully then their funds are highly secure. Just teach them the ways to save their private keys. Teach them to save their private keys on SSDs or write those keys on paper and keep those in a safe. Once they start using it they will be used to it and their fear will disappear over time.It's easy to teach children that how to use cryptocurrencies just like fiat, but it's hard to teach elder ones. Children are advanced these days and they know tech far better than our generation, and they can easily learn Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within short time, but elders on other hand are not good at tech so it can be a difficult task to teach them that how to use Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies just like fiat.",

A wallet like Electrum is very easy to use, you just have to write out your seed phrase backup and keep it safe as you do with your secret bank account info. Then if you wanna receive funds from someone, you copy and send them one of your BTC addresses, and if you want to send BTC to someone, you just click on 'send', input the recipient address, input the amount, adjust the fee rate as you like and send, that is not more difficult that sending money through your bank's mobile app.",

It's just a matter of them being taught how. Fiat was really easy to use since people use it all around us, so even without being taught directly, we can still learn it somewhat. Crypto on the other hand may require more tech to use, but considering how wallet apps are growing already, I don't think having a QR code for your crypto wallet would be that much of a hurdle to learn. Additionally, it's not something to be forced really, that's why the idea of fiat and crypto coexisting has never left my mind. One is the governments wouldn't let crypto have its dominance and two, some people just don't bother wanting to have the advantages crypto has. It's dangerous maybe, but since it's a service being offered by the government (which most probably trust) I don't see anything wrong with forcing them to transition.",
