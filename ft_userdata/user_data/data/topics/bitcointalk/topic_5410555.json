Technology strongly supports the development of bitcoin in a better direction, currently the largest income in Singapore is through the industrial sector, where many foreign companies are growing and developing there, it is not impossible that industries related to crypto and bitcoin development will dominate the country, because there guarantees, regulations and taxes are much easier compared to other countries. Quote from: Oshosondy on August 20, 2022, 06:24:39 AMEl Salvador made bitcoin a legal tender, Singapore has not made bitcoin a legal tender, the second country that makes bitcoin a legal tender is Central African Republic. At least they are starting to talk about legal payments using bitcoin, although it has not been fully implemented in the country's journey, when viewed from the readiness to face technology, the opportunities for Singapore are much easier and fasterQuote from: Oshosondy on August 20, 2022, 06:24:39 AMThere are many crypto friendly countries that do not make bitcoin a legal tender, but still accepting it as a means of payment and for investment.Accepting is definitely starting to open up, with some considerations that cannot be implemented in the near future. Such a developed country does not rule out the possibility to change the previous income pattern by implementing a new system, so that the country becomes stronger in terms of economy, industry and technology.Quote from: Poker Player on August 20, 2022, 06:35:21 AMThe country is crypto-friendly but now, as a result of the Terra Luna and other catastrophes, plans new regulations to prevent such things from happening again:On the basis of the previous chaos caused by Terra Luna and other disasters, Singapore began to make new rules on this issue.Quote from: Poker Player on August 20, 2022, 06:35:21 AMBut no, they do not consider Bitcoin a legal tender.Of course bitcoin is not yet considered a legal payment, but interestingly Singapore is starting to talk about this seriously, meaning they are starting to see the great potential in bitcoin, by accommodating all their needs.Technology and Industry will be able to collaborate simultaneously, so that the State's income can increase and become stronger.My personal analysis, by following the current development of Singapore, is of course not entirely correct.

El Salvador has clearly accepted bitcoin in its entirety in his country, even offerings related to taxes and citizenship are a company dream.The question is whether everyone who works in the company will be granted citizenship, or only a few people?Because as I know, it's difficult to get citizenship, because every country has its own rules governing the matter, or this rule doesn't apply to El Salvador, Please correct me if I'm wrong",

I know it because I was part of the exodus that time. Some of my co-employees decided to stay and continue to work there but I decided to go back to our country.So I wouldn't be surprised that up to this day, the government of Singapore is very incline to new technologies like crypto or bitcoin in general.

A stay in the country of 5 years is really valid for citizenship, but the exception is the citizens of Spain and Latin American countries with a period of 1 year of stay in the country. Of course, there are still some exceptions when it comes to obtaining citizenship.Quote from: https://globalrcg.com/el-salvador/Permanent residency status in El Salvador can also lead to citizenship through naturalization, on a time-frame of 1-5 years. Those eligible include: Persons who are nationals of Spain or Latin American countries, who have established a one-year residency;Foreigners from anywhere who have established a five-year residence in the territory;Foreigners who are married to Salvadoran spouses and have established a two-year residency; or Persons who have rendered exceptional service to the nation.

In this context, it makes no sense to compare Singapore with El Salvador, which are two completely different worlds, especially when it comes to welfare and economy.",
