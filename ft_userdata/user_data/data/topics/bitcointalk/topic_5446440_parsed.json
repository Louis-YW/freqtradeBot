And even among the cryptocurrencies, it's the most private and secure, so the safety of your funds might be highly guaranteed if you are not careless on your path.It has solved the problem of infestation by financial services employees where fund holders are their victims and has put an end to the overbearing practices of some fiats payment systems where they will unjustly block one account.Paypal does this often, but Bitcoin protects you against such tyrannical companies.",

Yes, security is a key driver of using certain payment gateways. However, the security side that the OP is talking about is in fact immeasurable even when you have been using a related application for years. It only relies on the trust of the people behind the scenes that they will one day never betray to start selling user data to other parties.",

I go to an online store and put something in my cart and check out. The only thing the store should transmit to the payment provider is the amount of the sale and a token that links back to that invoice. The gateway should then pop up a crypto address and amount once it gets the coins the payment processor then sends the 'yes he paid' data back to the merchant. The payment gateway / provider should never know who I am or what I bought. Past that the only thing the merchant should care about is getting their crypto / fiat. But that should also be 100% separate from the payment processing. If there is any link between the money in and money out systems you are doing it wrong in terms of security.-Dave",

The back end is everything when it comes to security, you should not be in a payment gateway business if you do not have top-level security and you do not have a team of experts in security, there are standard protocols on security and it should be updated on a regular basis, payment gateway business is a stiff business because this is a multi-billion dollar business they only need one hack to get them out of business for good.So you ask is security a prime feature to consider in payment getaways?

I have been using coinremitter for almost 1 year. This gateway has best security feature.I don't think you can be a source of third-party feedback[1] if you're running and developing the platform yourself. It is like seeing an FTX employee saying FTX is the best exchange that is impossible to hack. No one would believe you regardless of how you convince them. You can try to run a review campaign if you want to market your product here. I'm sure you know one or two things about marketing on this forum from how old your account is.Also, what you listed above are just protection measures that are more or less common on other platforms with different names. It is definitely not an exclusive feature that you can sell and sway potential business from using your gateway IMO. But yeah, you should also consider security measures available to protect the sellers/business too, as others have mentioned many times.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5205257.msg53202200#msg53202200",

I guess for people that don't want to use some of the off the shelf PHP coding to send coins to their own wallets it's probably no better or worse then any of the other services out there. Their website has a bunch of grammar & contextual errors. Things like that just make me wonder if they don't keep their front end clean how does the back end look.And the 1 thing that drives me personally nuts is the lack of BTC <-> fiat rates on the front page. As I have said giving me a really good rate on the transaction is fine but if BTC is at $28,000 and you are quoting a rate of $27,500 I am not going to sell anything as soon as people check the rates.-Dave",
