Assume that you have two UTXOs. One is worth 0.1 BTC and the other one is worth 0.2 BTC. You want to send 0.25 BTC to someone. Your transaction will include two outputs. One of them will be worth 0.25 BTC and will be sent to recipient. The other one will be worth 0.05 BTC minus transaction fee and will be sent back to yourself as change.",

This is why most basic types of bitcoin transactions have two output: one for the recipient and one for your change address.Imagine you have a $100 bill and you want to buy something that costs $50. You can't tear the bill in half and expect its value to be $50. Instead, you would hand over the entire $100 and wait for $50 in change. And similar to what bitcoin transaction does, $50 is the amount you are going to send while the remaining half will be given back to your \"change address\", hence having 2 outputs.If by batch you mean \"pay-to-many\", it is just single payment transaction having many output to reduce time, effort and fees when sending to multiple recipients.",

You can either not spend all the outputs (batches) at once, and leave out the ones which are not needed.

Let's say your wallet has five unspent outputs or batches of coins in it. These are called UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs). Each of your five UTXOs contain 1 BTC each. You want to send 2.5 BTC to someone.To be able to send 2.5 BTC, you must spend at least that amount. The smallest amount you can spend is 3 BTC, since you can only include an entire UTXO. So you include three of your UTXOs, which spends 3 BTC. Your wallet software will send 2.5 BTC to the other party, and will return 0.5 BTC (minus your transaction fee) to a fresh change address in your wallet. Your wallet will now have 2.5 BTC across three UTXOs - two of the original UTXOs which you haven't spent worth 1 BTC each, and a new UTXO worth 0.5 BTC.Alternatively, you could spend 5 BTC by including all five of your UTXOs worth 1 BTC each. Your wallet would still send 2.5 BTC to other party, but this time would return the other 2.5 BTC (minus your transaction fee) to a fresh change address in your wallet as a single UTXO. You would still have 2.5 BTC left in your wallet, but it would be in a single UTXO rather than split across several UTXOs.Think of each UTXO or batch like a physical bill or bank note. You can't cut a $10 bill in half in order to pay $5. You must hand over the full $10 bill and then receive a $5 bill back as change. If you wanted to give someone $30, you could give them three $10 bills and keep your other two $10 bills in your wallet, or you could hand them all five $10 bills and ask for a single $20 bill back as change.",

I appreciate OELEO that gave me a link that guide me I now understand that batches can also called output Are you sure that you mean outputs when you talk about batches?Any chance you actually mean blocks (that are processed / mined roughly every 10 minutes)? Because that's what your original post sounds like to me.To put it simply, when you send a payment, it lands in the 'mempool' (a pool of unconfirmed transactions, i.e. they have not been added to the blockchain). Once a miner picks up your transaction, he puts it into a block with a nonce value. This value is repeatedly modified and the whole block hashed, until the difficulty target is met (don't worry about this too much right now).Once he manages to do so, the block is effectively 'added' to the tip of the blockchain and includes your transaction along with a lot of others. This is what may appear as a 'batch' of processed transactions.If you were to send out too many transactions to all fit in one block, miners would just process them in the next block or the one after that, since they are just sitting in the mempool waiting.This [1] learnmeabitcoin page roughly explains mining and this [2] about candidate blocks.[1] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/mining[2] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/candidate-block",

Because I've noticed that bitcoin is sent and received in batches, my current question is about this.You can read Change address.What is the \"Change\" address on bitcoin wallet ? read to know !In most transactions, you won't spend all your inputs as outputs and the leftovers will be returned to your original address or to a change address. Change address is recommended to for better privacy. It is in general but more meaningful if you use self custody wallets, not custody wallets like accounts on centralized exchanges.On centralized exchanges, they always do batch transactions for user withdrawals. First, it saves transaction fees for them. Second it helps them to earn income from fee they over charge on their customers. Generally they care more about their income from processing customer withdrawals.You can usehttps://bitcoindata.science/plot-your-transaction-in-mempool.htmlhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-size-calculator/to learn about input, output effects on transaction size then transaction fee.",

And actually, if you were to never reuse an address, then it does not really matter from a security nor a privacy point of view (when it comes to someone stealing your private key or linking your transactions) if you were to use an account model or an output model. The difference is that an account model actively encourages address reuse, which is obviously bad for privacy but also for fungibility, as I mentioned above, and there are network level security implications, such as replaying previous transactions.",
