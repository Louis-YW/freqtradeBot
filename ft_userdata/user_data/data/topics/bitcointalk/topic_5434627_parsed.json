She leaves behind 4 children, Riley, Benjamin, Finley and Harper.I don’t think it’s nice for anybody to start mocking the dead so even if she was suffering from addiction, let’s allow her to RIP.May her family grieve without people disrespecting her on the internet. Far too young, tragic & needless loss of life.RIP Lisa Marie, have a ball up there with your legendary Father.",

      "body": "It's really sad to hear that Lisa Marie has left us and of course very sad for her mother Priscilla. I saw her father Elvis live a couple of times at the early 70s and met her grandfather Vernon summer 1979 just a couple of months before he died. Now the billon $ imperium Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) will be runned by her three daughters after her son Benjamin killed himself 2020. I don't know anything about her drug abuse but i found this page today: Mail One: Drug abuse and rehab - Lisa Marie admitted abusing cocaine, had FIVE stints in rehab (during fourth failed marriage) and became addicted to opioids after birth of her twin daughters",

      "body": "Lisa Marie’s death is so sudden due to cardiac arrest, I am suspecting there are underlying causes that are not released to the public. She made it twelve more years than her father Elvis Presley. Her mother Pricilla Presley must be devastated, her daughter has passed away, she has always tried to keep the family together in my opinion. Her mother can only do so much, and I can only speculate, based on experience, if someone must realize themselves that they need help. Lisa Marie so young and being born in the spotlight of the entertainment world can only give so much pressure. She will be remembered for being true artists and all the charitable work and humanitarian work she has done throughout the years will be remembered. May her soul rest in peace and may her children see the light through this dark tunnel.",
