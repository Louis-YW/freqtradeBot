  "content": "Scott Redler, chief strategist officer at T3 Trading Group, argues that the price of Ethereum (ETH) is on course to hit the $2,100 level. If Redler is correct, his bullish price target means that the second largest cryptocurrency is on track to spike by another 10%.The technical analyst is confident that the second largest cryptocurrency may march higher after it recently cleared the $1,792 level. Holding above that pivotal price point could subsequently open the door to the $2,100 level. In addition, Redler believes that Bitcoin is on its way to reclaiming the $26,000 level. Ethereum recently experienced a significant relief rally in the run-up to the highly anticipated Merge event. Goerli, the last of the three testnets, successfully transitioned to proof of stake earlier today, which was the final test before the Ethereum mainnet finally merges with the Beacon Chain in September. Leading cryptocurrencies also benefited from cooler-than-expected inflation data, together with U.S. stock and bond prices.Read more on U.Today https://u.today/ethereum-eth-on-its-way-to-2100-top-trader-says",

Ignore being up 20 percent then having it dip 20. Eventually it will rise to 3k very soon . there will be massive selling in POW and many users will buy at start . I think whale will make big profit here There are two options for us: either we can buy now or we can wait until after the merge has ended to buy. I believe the merge event will create a strong Fomo wave pushing ETH price up and then the sharks will take profits causing eth price to correct and this is the right time to continue buying ETH and holding until the next bull season.",

But $2100 is a price that ethereum can hit in the short terms, I believe it because also currently hovering around $1900, after all in the article does't mention for long term.",

It seems like that 24500 has become the strongest resistance for bitcoin even bitcoin broke it yesterday but the support is not strong enough to keep the price above such rate. A small correction is occurring right now but im sure that if bitcoin can bounce back again even higher. Let's wait and see what's gonna happen with it.",

When we invest according to someone else's opinion without doing our own research and seeing the potential for profit as well as risk, As for ETH, I think it is a good return investment, but, of course, it is not or is not a preferred choice for small investors who want quick profits. Personally, I feel like I bought it early when the price was only about $80, so I think the process of learning and believing in your own decisions is one of the things that brings happiness. Speculation can be very high in this space, so be comfortable with all the information others bring.",

With what's going on with ETH, I don't think much analysis is needed, it is easy to see that there will be a Fomo wave for this merge and now ETH price is trading at $1.9k and the $200 gap will not be too hard for ETH. But after completing the transition to POS, whether ETH can maintain its upward momentum is a more important question.",

My attention is focused on the final merge update scheduled for September 19.Risk takers are willing to go right now since they are speculating for the price to rise by that time and when you are willing to invest, the time is right because it's not yet raising up to the price where it gonna collapse soon but you need to consider not to be exaggerated because this is just mere speculations and anything can possibly happen just before or after the merge whether it gonna rise even more or the price might fall dramatically. That's why it's better not to get hype and stop yourself from getting carried away to invest everything you have.",

So I wouldn't be surprised if by in the next couple of weeks $1900 will be reach and then sustained.",
