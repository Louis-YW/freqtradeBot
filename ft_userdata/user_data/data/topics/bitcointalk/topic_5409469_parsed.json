      "body": "I am interested in what you are asking because I see a paradox here. I understand that bitcoin being open source, no one could have the copyright on the whitepaper. At least it would go against Satoshi's idea of it, but this judgment seems to recognise Wright's rights. However Craight Wright is known as Faketoshi. He claims to be Satoshi, which he has never been able to prove, and which he could easily do by signing a message from Satoshi's known addresses, as Apocollapse says.So I don't quite understand Whitepaper rights either. As the article says:QuoteWright won by default after the website’s pseudonymous owner, “Cøbra,” chose not to mount a defense.I don't know if he didn't go to the trial because of an anti-establishment stance, but I think that if he had defended himself a little, he wouldn't have been forced to remove the article. Quote from: Apocollapse on August 11, 2022, 09:13:06 AMThe Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) are sues Craig Wright of Bitcoin Whitepaper copyright, but it seems there's no final decision and still an ongoing process. I guess Cobra got cold feet after the fact that he didn't go to the first trial.",

This is what I've understood from the matter.And the whitepaper was \"removed\" only from bitcoin.org and only for Brits. it's still available in a lot of other places.

Is it not a guaranteed win I thought it was?If you don't turn up or ask for representation from another party then why do you expect to win (I'd assume cobra might've been eligible for legal aid too to have a solicitor sit on the case - probably at no expense to cobra).Satoshi holds the rights to the whitepaper, always has. It's possible in most places to withdraw articles from the public domain afaik but I doubt they'll give up on their anonymity over a whitepaper.",

      "body": "Thanks pooya87, I'll have to quote it in case anyone else is looking for similar information.QuoteHey guys,As judgement has now been entered against me for \"copyright infringement\", I'll soon receive a UK court order to stop broadcasting the Bitcoin whitepaper to the UK. The court order will be published on the usual UK judgements site (https://www.bailii.org/). I've been shown a draft, and the heading of the order reads:IF ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A DEFENDANT DISOBEYS THIS ORDER THAT INDIVIDUALMAY BE HELD TO BE IN CONTEMPT OF COURT AND MAY BE PUNISHED BY A FINE,IMPRISONMENT, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS OR OTHER PUNISHMENT UNDER THE LAWIF ANY A COMPANY OR OTHER ORGANISATION WHICH IS A DEFENDANT DISOBEYSTHIS ORDER THAT COMPANY OR ORGANISATION MAY BE HELD TO BE IN CONTEMPTOF COURT AND MAY BE PUNISHED BY A FINE, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS OR OTHERPUNISHMENT UNDER THE LAW. ANY DIRECTOR OR OFFICER OF THAT COMPANY ORORGANISATION MAY ALSO BE PUNISHED BY A FINE, IMPRISONMENT, CONFISCATIONOF ASSETS OR OTHER PUNISHMENT UNDER THE LAWObviously, Bitcoin.org has to follow the laws of the land in the jurisdictions it serves. The UK makes up a noticeable amount of our traffic, and the UK ISPs will block us if we don't comply. Undoing such a block would come at great expense and would take some time, as all things legal tend to do. On balance of \"how can we maximize the good we do?\" I think complying with the order and continuing to serve UK visitors other valuable Bitcoin educational material is important. The Bitcoin whitepaper doesn't get tons of traffic each day (there's obviously some days with lots of traffic like a prominent person tweets out the link to it), and even then, this order is only limited to just UK visitors.Also, I don't want anyone associated with the company behind Bitcoin.org, if ever identified, and if even temporarily in the UK, to be at risk of potentially 2 years in jail. Indeed, as one judge in relevant UK case law put it:\"In circumstances where directors of the defendants may wish to come to this country on business or for pleasure, the prospect that their next visit may be for a more extended duration and in less comfortable accommodation than anticipated should provide a real incentive to comply with an order.\"It goes without saying that I don't want to put myself and others at risk of some serious time in a UK jail.Shortly after I receive the order the following changes will be made to the website:The Bitcoin whitepaper located at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf won't be accessible to UK based visitors.All derived works of the Bitcoin whitepaper such as translations located here: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper will not be accessible to UK based visitors.The court requires that we publish information about the infringement, to deter future infringers (there's very specific provisions of the wording and where to place this notice), for a 6 month period. UK based visitors will see a small banner near the top of the site, with a short sentence about the the case, that default judgement was entered, and that Wright was the winner. It's more like a short summary of what happened, and not really a promotion of Wright. The judge was particular to add the wording of \"default judgement\", and also \"the claim was undefended\".I believe at some point the COPA case will prove Wright perjured himself in obtaining this judgement and order. Hopefully in the next few years he'll be brought to justice. We live in a stupid world where people can get locked away for years for relatively minor offences like drug possession, however people like Wright can just continue on abusing the courts with no real consequences. It sucks that me, hodlonaut, McCormack, and various Bitcoin developers have to deal with this nonsense, but truth will prevail in the end and liars like him can never succeed in trying to stop Bitcoin's success no matter how hard they try.Source of the quote: https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/Bitcoin.org/issues/3698It appears from what I read that the bitcoin whitepaper is inaccessible in UK! On the other hand i spot this: https://craigwright.net/bitcoin-white-paper.pdfDidn't he break the law like that?",

I hold GMT Token instead of it, you can hold it and get a certain part of mining power and it mines btc directly from the pool. You can connect a wallet and get btc daily with 24% APR.The thread is about bitcoin whitepaper not about mining stuff so would advise you to read the content of the thread before you post anything.You are newbie on the forum and there are some mistakes we make but reading is that we should be doing in the first instance so be on topic only man.",

If someone had ownership of WP, that would be a contradiction. I believe that WP belongs to everyone (everyone has the right to access this information) and at the same time to no one (there are no specific personalized rights holders).
