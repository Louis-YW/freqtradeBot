  "content": "Silicon valley bank is good example.Fed IMF ecb boe...all of them have failed with their centralozid system.The next bull run coins like btc the decentralized coins will be favoritie coins of investors. People worry about alot and many people now learn about btc and crypto be your own bank and.Cash , btc ,usdt are king brazil is good example how it should be there is opportunity to transfer just USDT and cash out.In this case whole world Will follow to brazil brazil atm and crypto system is world best one.It's unlikely people talk about CBDC-s anymore more people Will be into btc and crypto freedom way.Many people are disapointed, and crypto is trusted now they connect crypto with cash then central banks neither commetcial Banks not Even needed.Crypto p2p exchangers are not needed either near future becouse If you can cash out your crypto from ATM cash machine then you got all you need and with many crypto visa debit cards or mastercards you can pay at stores.Also there are many commercial banks who are high leveraged with clientds money ( basicly they gamble) many commercial banks Will be deleveraged soon.People need to understood it's a end of the commercial Banks as we know it time to move on who don't get into crypto they will risk with losses of using third parties banking services. I trust more crypto exchangers then banks becouse crypto exchangers are connected with global faster capital of btc eth or USDT USDC or busd the main liquity and off course the TRX and xrp xlm.Banks are still slow and not connected globally with so much instant capital.So crypto exchangers are much more safer and with better liquity then many banks. Crypto exchangers allready working with debit cards like binance debit card and who really needs a Banks anymore ??",

Crypto exchangers allready working with debit cards like binance debit card and who really needs a Banks anymore ??Crypto exchangers area able to implement debit cards because they had been given licensed to implement by the financial institution.  If the financial institution deny them of the right, the binance will be charged of fraud if they issue such kind of service without proper license.  In addition, cryptocurrency adoption is not as wide as you think, only a small percentage of the global population is using cryptocurrency and most are still using banks.  So basically, the use of bank is still in-demand.  I also contest the idea of crypto exchanges are much safer than banks.  I wonder if you missed the news of FTX, and many other exchanges that goes bankrupt making their users to lose 100% of their investment.",

At the moment, it appears crypto can never replace banks, unless more progress is made in those sectors. There are simply no alternatives.",
