He got really lucky with his picks and I do believe he analyzed the game quite well. Also, there's a bit of luck included in that. That game is where James Harden and Paul George are both off night and that's not normal. I mean, that is not their average number and it could've been a waste of $18 if that didn't happen. He is good, I can tell. The picks are spot on and he probably used the stats history of the Clippers players since they have been playing in bad shape for most of their games. I doubt he can repeat this, like I said, a part of this is a lucky thing because he bet against stars that make stats in a daily basis. I am kind of jealous though, I hope I hit that same betbuilder someday.Â   Nice share OP.",

I can't imagine myself getting lucky, especially in sports betting. I would likely hesitate and regret it if I ended up losing. But it's also really nice to try something new from time to time.",

Believed me, he will comeback and play again and again and until that money is back to $18.Seen worst, winner jackpot in the casinos, $100,000 but in matter of months, he \"donated\" it back to the casino that he won that big money.",

I don't want to spoil the fun or badmouth gambling, as I do gambling too, but I don't give everyone the idea that winning such huge amounts of money will be very easy. \"You don't win if you don't try.\" That phrase could lead hoping gamblers to their misery, I'm not against gambling its just I don't want someone hyping the gambling and making sounds like pushing others to gamble more until they reach their goal, what if it never happens? will you keep on playing even if you don't have the means?",

He worked for 5 years and came back home to start a business. It was a good business. One day, he saw a friend and they become close again and talked about gambling. After his friend introduced him to gambling, his business stopped to be going on as it was because he used all the money to gambling and lost all and his business died.The one that happened recently just like three months ago happened in my street to someone that I know.

Although one of the things I like about gambling is that when you win sometimes you win big so i believe that's one of the reasons why most people prefer to risk high so if eventually they win it becomes very huge. So for me I don't think I can risk that big in gambling because in as much I may feel that the bet is very certain i will win but reversal could be the case so I don't think I can risk that high but however if I have a lot of money that removing that amount will not affect me of course I can decide to try it out.",

When people become so desperate to win or keep trying to win back their losses, they end up being addicted to gambling and that is a bad place to be.When we say gambling portfolio and the percentage of using the gambling portfolio, we never check the total amount invested in each game but only the percentage is taken into account.Usually, i will go with a rule of risking 1% of my gambling portfolio in each game and bet. So if I have 100$ in my gambling account, i will gamble each game with 1 dollar. Similarly, if i have 1000$ in my gambling portfolio, I will gamble every game with 10$. So in both cases, even if I lose a game, I will lose one percent of my gambling money.",

We can't use only one story to conclude that you can become a millionaire. If the same story is happening frequently then we can conclude. When gambling, the house is always at an advantage meaning more players will lose to the house so gambling isn't as profitable as this story is making it to look like, readers shouldn't be deceived.Gamblers can make profits when they play games but they shouldn't depend fully on gambling as you can win some games and lose some other games. It's very rare to win millions and also more rare to use small wagers to win life changing money as the example is trying to justify. When gambling try to make sure you're winning more games than you're losing and staying in profits, winning millions in any currency isn't always possible but you should be making profits.",
