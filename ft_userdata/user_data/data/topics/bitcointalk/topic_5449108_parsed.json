What is the secret to ARB's success ?It's a free market with a zero-sum game so even if it is a successful project, it does not mean all people engage with $ARB can have profit. There are buyers buy it at top and panic sell at bottom or in correction. There are smarter people who wait for correction to buy and sell at bounce or next peak.I think it is too soon to consider Arbitrum as a successful project as it must be tested more by hackers and next bear market.QuoteOr simply, why its price keeps steadily climbing ? Please let me know. Nothing can rise forever and Arbitrum has to stop its climb at some point. Currently people get hyped with Arbitrum and new cash flow pours into Arbitrum but you can not find new cash flows forever. It has to stop and when there is no new cash flow into Arbitrum, its price will drop.",

Then after that, the price slowly increases.Arbitrum got a huge TVL right now and it's still increasing despite of a lot of FUD happening. I can say Arbitrum still got more room above!",

Or simply, why its price keeps steadily climbing ? Please let me know. The price increase of ARB after listing is completely normal compared to other altcoins. We all know that its problem-solving ability in the market, and especially it has also created a great buzz when it brings an airdrop to users, when the people who receive the airdrop sell them, the price will go up. decrease and at the time of accumulation long enough the price will be increased the way MM does. Overall, the success of ARB is a combination of many factors, including technology, development team, partners and actual applications, as well as an effective marketing strategy. However, as with any investment, investors need to make their own decisions and base their detailed investment decisions based on careful research and analysis.Quote from: FireDAOJackie_Z on April 17, 2023, 02:23:32 AMBy the way, I am with FireDAO team, in charge of the global community.

I still remember when their airdrops was going it was such massive news that even many platform got down because they've got too much traffic from the airdrops, initially it was valued above $8 and slowly and steadily decreasing overtime.right now this platform is among one of the most used blockchain since they are quite good at becoming second layer for ethereum, but there has been something not right going with their consensus in the allocation of the token.",

Please let me know.The reason is its usage metrics. Arbitrum is the de facto top DeFi chain. It consistently outperforms other L2 chains like Polygon and Optimism in terms of TVL and 24h DEX volume. It's currently sitting at a $2.4B market cap while Polygon, which has lower TVL and activity, is at $10B. That's why people think $ARB is still undervalued and will keep climbing.Quote from: adaseb on April 17, 2023, 03:45:33 AMIt never went to $0.50.

I know that Arbitrum is a potentially good project and can go a long way, but if it can actually retain its position and make a name for itself within the community then we might see its token surge even higher in price, but if things don't go well for them, we might see something opposite of that.There is basically a lot of competition among protocols these days, you can find a lot of newly launched blockchain protocols and some are still coming up, so it's probably going to be a tough one for a lot of them to survive.",

This will certainly have an impact on increasing the adoption of Arbitrum but on a small scale.Another reason is that currently Arbitrum has begun to stabilize in terms of price because the beneficiary communities have almost sold their ownership and just left.

IMO, the Arbritum team was able to build a solid community and loyal users before releasing their tokens, some people went to the chain because of Airdrops but most people used the blockchain and were pleased with what results they got. Just look at the success of $OP and $ARB the difference is huge, $OP is more of a VC chain while $ARB has a huge number of retail users using the chain. It is better to build a solid community and use incentives to tie them down. Also, $ARB is well funded project and their runway will last many years IMO",
