So what's your toughts on this ? Share your insights and experinces about good vibe locations and bad ones let's find those good vibe places.If you want to get positive vibes get close to nature. I don't get the vibes I need in big cities where the air, sound, and almost everything are polluted. I prefer hearing the bird sing and the trees dance. Seeing the fish swim and the squirrel jump from tree to tree is cool. Humans can pretend to be nice but inside, they are filled with jealousy, pride, and all forms of evil. But nature is real and ever true. I am more comfortable in the presence of nature than all these man-made and artificial creations of men that give superficial pleasure. You can also find positive vibes around children. Their innocence will teach you forgiveness. Children can never betray you. If you want positive vibes, you don't necessarily need to get them from others or in big cities, you can also create them. Just be positive and selfless and you will attract the vibes.",

But If it is the church that makes you feel you have eternal life in Christ, then that is not too good sir. That means without the church you don't have such consciousness of life after death. The church is just a building but our body isÂ  the real temple. Even without the church, we should always be with the Holy Spirit that constantly reminds us that this mortal body is grass and dust. We must frequently go to the Bible and not the church building because it is personal studies that build our spiritual life more than congregational gatherings.",

The thought of not seeing anyone you know anymore is scary, but there is life after death.",

I prefer hearing the bird sing and the trees dance.You're on point with your view and choice of preference, having the state of things in their natural occurrence is the best, having the entire environment being calm and well saturated with peace is enough to derive once satisfaction needed to think and release stress about life entirely, we sometimes needed a calm environment that could help us get concentrated on particular aspect we need no distractions on.Quote from: Die_empty on February 19, 2023, 11:18:50 AMYou can also find positive vibes around children.Because children has no grudge or worries in their mind, they think about nothing and act directly as things are or appears to them, everyone want to be like the little children without blemish, they know all their needs were taken care of without bothering to know how.",

The thought of not seeing anyone you know anymore is scary, but there is life after death. Good idea, since you really don't have any choice. Might as well make the best of it with good vibes. It's kinda like knowing that there is a God. James (in the Bible) says that even demons know this, and tremble in fear.",
