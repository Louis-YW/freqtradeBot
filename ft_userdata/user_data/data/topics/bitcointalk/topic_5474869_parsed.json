Buying of accounts was allowed in the past, but it’s currently highly discouraged due to the high use of the account for spamming. The restriction that could follow with such an account is that those earned glory in the past by the account owner, i.e., the trust built based on the old owner's reputation, are likely to be revoked. If people notice that the account was bought, a few members will tag the account, warning people to disregard their old trust rating. Question 2; QuoteDoes this mean that if I have always had two accounts and for any mistake whatsoever like plagiarism. And one of my account is banned, am I not allowed to own any other active accounts??? Let's not forget that it is not illegal or against the rules to own multiple accounts. Are these rules contradicting themselves or are there other hidden criteria to such effects???  If your account has been banned before according to the forum rules, you either need to appeal for it to be unbanned or you leave the forum and don’t register any new account again. If you have two active accounts already before the ban, you can either appeal for the banned one to be unbanned or, if caught, the active one will also be banned. What’s banned is you as the owner of the account and not the account, so operating another account is band-invading. Question 3: Quote Does this mean all other of my old accounts remains relevant and active despite my initial ban on my other accounts???You are only allowed to post with your new account for the ban appeal on meta if you post aside meta and send PMs to people you are ban invading. This is just the same as your question 2. The rules are self explained to some point.",

Established users may have multiple accounts for different purposes, like side projects or testing or crawling. However, creating multiple accounts for signature campaigns won't result in a ban but will get you tagged.",

Accounts that are not bought can also be used to spam, but bought account can lead to scam and other bad... Not only that, the buyer can be scammed, the account can later been known for bad deed like plagiarism and be banned. That is why account sellers are given red trust. It is also not just good not to have the experience but just buy an account and post like a newbie and later be banned.",

What is even the need of having multiple accounts when their is no better growth in all or show a better contribution all the accounts have contributed.  It is a big stress and waste of time having all this and still known of these accounts can engage in good contribution in the forum.  It is better to concentrate in one, let their be consistent growth and not many accounts with stagnant growth, it is total waste of time for having multiple accounts when the accounts are not productive to the forum .",

This is not the type of question that a newbie should ask. But since there is a question, there must be an answer and someone correct me if I am wrong.There are two scenarios  If you have two accounts from onset and one of the accounts let's say commits plagerism and got banned. This does not affect the other account of yours which predates the banned account. It means the other account is not ban evading  But when an account is banned, any other account from same user that is created after the account ban is considered ban evasion I didn't see this rule anywhere and I haven't come across it. But that is what my common sense says it should be.",

But if you get a permanent ban and try to avoid that by creating another account, that's considered ban evasion. If you get caught with your other accounts or somehow get connected with your previously banned account, you'll get banned again on your new account. The only way to fix this is to make an appeal in the meta or reputation board and explain everything about why you should be unbanned.Check the reputation board, and you'll understand how this works. You'll see many cases where multiple users tried to ban evasion and ended up getting banned again.Selling an account is discouraged. Short and simple.Again, all these rules are unofficial.
