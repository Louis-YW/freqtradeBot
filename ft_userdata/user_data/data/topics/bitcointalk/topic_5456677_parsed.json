  "content": "Just like I said in the topic, do not trust Binance Smart Chain. I withdraw 33 TUSD on BSC network on the Binance exchange to an address on Unstoppable wallet. I did not see the coin. I am very sure that I sent it to the correct address.I thought the fault is from Unstoppable wallet and j wanted to ask question about it on this forum before if I have done anytime wrong, but it came up on my mind to withdraw to Trustwallet and see what would happen. I withdraw 5 TUSD on BSC network on Binance exchange to Trustwallet and I did not see the TUSD too.    On their blockchain explorer, it said the transaction were successful     I sent it to the correct address on my wallet but I did not see it. Unstoppable wallet address (left), Trustwallet address (right)     Unstoppable wallet:0x89119c50f6ECA4ff9b80b1d55943292f69703792.Trustwallet: 0x3325Dd2e499bdc8743B3ddBeB34623D27178922aI did not receive any coin on both Unstoppable wallet and Trustwallet, but saying successful on their explorer.TUSD on smart chain transaction on Binance has zero fee. If you click on receive on Trustwallet, you will be able to see deposit from Binance directly, for TUSD BSC, it is no more there. Try and avoid BSC for withdraw. It can be going for other coins, but not getting successful for TUSD. Avoid Binance Smart Chain. There are other chains that are available for altcoins. This is the first time this happened to me and I know the fault is not from me but rather from Binance Smart Chain.",

I know you are not a newbie when it comes to operating wallets but did you by any chance forget to import the token to your wallet?It might not be a nice idea but do you mind importing your wallet to metamask and then import the token there if ther will be any change cos is kinda confusing your post and blockchain result. This is the contract address of the token Op trt to import it and see what happens.0x40af3827F39D0EAcBF4A168f8D4ee67c121D11c9",

However, although BSc and the alike chains are centralized, it's almost impossible to cancel a ~30 dollar transaction after it has ben confirmed. If you see that the transaction has been confirmed on one or few blockexplrores then the coins/tokens are supposed to be in your wallet. If you don't see them on your wallet then the problem us mist likely on your end (sync issues, wrong receiving address..).Glad to see that this case has been resolved, though.",
