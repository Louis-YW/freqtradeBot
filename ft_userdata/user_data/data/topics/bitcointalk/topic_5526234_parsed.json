      "body": "Careful everyone, If you're here then your looking for answers and the truth is that James Vertisan is NOT Satoshi Nakamoto :- he use a fake PGP key backdated to 2008, it's his third scam already with Nebula and Vertisan Coin. - his true name is James Browning, he became rich simply selling his shitty golf app to the widows phone and now he's showing-off like he's satoshi- he claim to have 25000h and 12 years of work but he will never show a single line of code (because it's not real outside his fake HTML website)- when selling was still available admin had full acces to your \"fake wallet\" and could send or close it as they wanted- he claim to have made a full autonomous AI bot to protect the \"fractal network\" but cant even put in place a chatbot- the VTSN price is just a bad joke, he enter the price randomly and selling or buying wont change it ( \"i'm working on an uppdate soon\" )- the telegram group with 500 user are mostly fake bot and people that are muted or his alt accounts - the honeypot is real, he locked up the trade possibility, it was suposed to go live on 3rd January then 2nd Feb then \"ready in 2/3 days max\" and now radio silenceif you had invested in this scam or want more info feel free to contact me at Twitter @LookinanswerStay safe#Vertisan #VTSN#James Vertisan#Cryptocase#swapVTSN",
