Nothing of value was stolen or otherwise scammed as far as I can see and the OP should just go gamble elsewhere if the owner/admin of the site doesn't want them there.Quote from: https://www.bustabit.com/help/chat-rulesWhat are the chat rules?Â  Â  1. Don't ask for money anywhere including in private messages and the spam channel. Asking for loans or investments and implying that other players should give you money is equivalent.Â  Â  2. Don't advertise. This includes trade and job offers as well as referral and affiliate links. Advertising in the spam channel is tolerated as long as you don't automate posting your ads.Â  Â  3. Don't use multiple accounts to chat at the same time or to evade mutes. Using an account to chat while muted on another account may lead to it being muted as well.Â  Â  4. Don't share accounts with other players, even temporarily. If they become muted or banned for breaking the chat rules, your accounts might end up being muted or banned as well.Â  Â  5. Beware of scammers! bustabit is not a trading site and won't get involved in disputes between players under any circumstances. We highly recommend not trading here.",
