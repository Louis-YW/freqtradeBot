  "content": "I have very nice idea for admin/forum members in their free time, who are very experienced in everything. Try to install Qubes OS ( Fedora Linux ) http://www.qubes-os.org/ in your computer, and then your hard wallet. Here is also one good example link for this: https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/ultimate-guide-on-using-trezor-on-qubes/18310.Or just install Qubes OS (Â  + can be also Windows OS or another Linux ) for testing and Bitcoin/altcoin wallet using.I did not use Qubes OS yet, so will be nice to hear their experience.Additional info about Qubes here from developer - https://blog.invisiblethings.org/index.html",
