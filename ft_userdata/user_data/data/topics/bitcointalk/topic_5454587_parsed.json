What are the benefits of using bitcointalk? Is this only for Bitcoin investment persons only? As I know bitcoin and Digital currency are the Future. So how do I invest in Bitcoin and how to earn from it? First, welcome to the forum. This forum is officially a Bitcoin forum. Everything you need to know about Bitcoin, the new update, security issues, the best wallets to use, how to buy and sell, and how to protect your Bitcoin from being stolen can be learned by scrolling around the forum.Check through:  Bitcoin Discussion  Read through various topics regarding Bitcoin.

Wallet software   When you are done familiarizing yourself with a few things about Bitcoin, knowing the risk involved and that it's not a get-rich-quick scheme, and yet you finally decide to invest, the best thing I will advise you to do is to choose the best wallet that you will use to store your Bitcoin. Reading through that board, you will find lots of topics regarding different wallets and which is highly recommended. For a start, the electrum wallet is highly recommended here in this forum; it's open source and a self-custodial wallet. Read  [Newbie question] How to keep my Electrum wallet and BTC safe When you have chosen the wallet you need, I guess the next option is how to buy it and where to buy it from. If you are the privacy kind of person who doesn't want to share his or her identity with an unknown platform, I will suggest you go for a non-centralized means of buying, which is P2P. There are a lot of P2P options out there that you could possibly choose from . Agoradesk  is one of the best.  Kycnot.me,  Bisq",

If thats what you are looking for then you are in a wrong place.

Regarding buying on your own currency, you need to find a market that supports your fiat money or yet do a p2p(peer to peer) service there in your place to convert your fiat to bitcoin.",

Although popular among Bitcoin investors, Bitcointalk is not only for them but Everyone can join to learn, share and engage in useful discussions and develop successful investment strategies based on actual information and experiences from Bitcoin users.To make money from Bitcoin, there are several approaches. You can adopt a long term strategy of holding your Bitcoins and expecting their value to increase over time. I might answer 2 versions here first with active trading, where you buy Bitcoins at the right time and sell them when the price goes up or keep them for the long term. For other options you can generate extra income by following some of the campaigns provided in the Bounties (Altcoins) thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0 but be selective.",

This is one of the first things I will never forget about bitcoin and i learnt it from this forum on how it is expected of us to have or get bitcoin. Quote from: pooya87 on February 02, 2023, 05:22:30 AMIndividuals shouldn't have to buy or sell bitcoin, instead they should be able to earn bitcoin and spend it like they do any other fiat currency. After all they don't \"buy fiat\" Pooya87 made it clear and point blank that bitcoin should be earned and not to be bought, not that you cannot buy it or exchange your fiat with bitcoin but providing a service or values that got you paid in bitcoin is one of the best ways you can have or get bitcoin, just as you're not expected to buy fiat currency, you work to earn it, and so is bitcoin, it should be encouraged most to be earned especially for those newly coming on board to the digital network.Also you can earn by holding your bitcoin in a decentralized cold storage wallet and target the halving or when the bullrun begins after which you must have invested when the market goes dip and you sell when it rises, you can also learn about trading bitcoin.",

A non-custodial dex means you can connect a wallet in there and buy crypto like Bitcoin. Well, I am sure you will learn about why it is recommended to use dex when buying crypto and that's because of this saying \"not your keys not your Bitcoin.

The benefits of using the platform is that, it helps you stay in discussion with like-minded people that helps you navigate the industry because if you're not been guided you'll be distracted by the numerous scams disguising as legit project but they're only available on the market to scam you of your money. The forum is for everyone but started as just a Bitcoin forum although as the industry has extended to including various things like Altcoins so has the forum expended and now we have other issues that can be discussed through the economy, politics & society and other boards on the forum.If you want to earn from investing in the industry, don't even think you can do that by investing in those shinning cryptocurency that makes you all the promises that you want to hear like giving you a specific return if you stake your tokens with them or hold in their own wallets. Just buy your Bitcoin and transfer them form the exchange to your own wallets that are usually censored. You earn when you hold and give the market time to recover. Nobody has regretted holding their Bitcoin and when you join that train you'll get same feeling.",

And what is Custodial dex and how do I buy Bitcoin in my local currency?Yes bitcoin do increases in price due to its volatility which makes it a very good ROI but this doesn’t make bitcoin a get rich quick scheme. If you’re in for that then you are easily prone to make mistakes. For you to gain you need to choose between holding or trading, the latter is more riskier than the former and it needs you to build on its knowledge. So my advice is if you are a total newbie stick only to holding first. The forum doesn’t by any chance approves signals, although there people that actually post some signals on the forum but do not trust any of it because it is on the forum. The more reason why people disregard this signals is because it is widely accepted that bitcoin isn’t predictable and the signals are just mere speculations based on past trends of bitcoin or the economic situation of the world. So believing the signals and investing base on there predictions is not advisable, rather you should do your research by gaining knowledge. Custodial means having everything in your own hands and not trusting anyone. The Dex means decentralized exchanges; these exchanges are those that do not require your details (KYC) when signing up on the platform and regarded the safest option if you’re into bitcoin or cryptocurrency for its privacy sake. You can actually buy from different exchanges but your country will depend on the most suitable exchange for you, so go through the local boards and look for that of your country and ask there or you can just mention your country here and someone will help you with lists of the exchanges",
