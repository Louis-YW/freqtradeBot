I highly doubt that this account is being controlled by a genuine newbie, most likely an alt, but that’s no issue here in the forum.All you said in your post were centered around merits. As a newbie you main should be “how to acquired the right knowledge” and with time you’ll see the merit flowing in. You really don’t have to start digging into merit history. If you direct your time into learning bitcoin rather than merit history it will be more productive than what you just did. I really don’t know how you got into the forum or what made you sign up an account here in the forum but with what I saw on this thread I think you have a wrong idea about what the forum is all about. Yeah, it’s true that you can earn little from the forum but that does not mean that you should neglect the main aim of the forum which is “discussion” and I can assure you that once you start showing signs of a desperate merit fisher instead of you to receive the merit you seek you’ll instead end up in the ignore list of forum members.Btw, welcome to Bitcointalk.",

Why does it feel like the OP is an alt of someone who has been a forum veteran as he found out about all of these legendary members in just one day? It took me a few days just to understand different boards and child boards when I was a newbie. Having an alt account is allowed in the forum but behaving as if you are new and trying to get some merits with such a topic does not look good.",

Am not sure you're indeed a newbie, did you even know that not every newbies on the forum are newbies, some were nothing than alt accounts, a true newbie will be more interested in learning the forum and not extracting the forum merits data to encourage how fellow newbies, you can also reason this along with me.",

Many high rank users are able to create a dummy account or newbie when they wanted to speak against or related issue.

Does it mean that they are not interested in learning about the forum and its merit system? What you did now is life bashing into someone's house newly and be telling the person what's in the person's apartment and that seems to be correct. Will it be possible for the person to believe you if you tell him this is the first time of coming to his apartment? He won't ever believe that, than saying that you have once come into his apartment without his knowledge. What it means is that you have been in this forum for long with another account, not with this newly created account that you are acting up like a newbie.
