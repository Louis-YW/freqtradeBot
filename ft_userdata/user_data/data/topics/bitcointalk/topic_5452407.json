  "content": "Hello all,I have found an old Windows disk backup, on which there is the 0.3.0 version of the bitcoin client which I played around with for maybe a day or two in 2010. The wallet.dat and associated %appdata% files are all there. I’ve made a few off-line copies of everything.I have some knowledge of GnuPG and Linux (Debian mainly) but I have not used Bitcoin since 2010 so trying to get up to speed with things.In case there is anything of value in the wallet, I want to be careful. Here is my plan – what do you think?:1. Download latest Ubuntu ISO using a Linux laptop I have rarely used. Check SHA256 on the ISO.2. Disconnect all drives from my usual PC (Ryzen 3).3. Use the ISO to install Ubuntu on a SSD on the PC4. Install current version of Bitcoin Core using Ubuntu’s own software installation tool.5. Wait for Bitcoin Core to sync to the blockchain.6. Import the old wallet.dat, rescan and hope for riches!?If the old wallet contains anything of value, what should I do next? I gather a cold wallet like Ledger would be sensible, including carefully stored handwritten keyword backups.Thanks for reading.",

I've ordered a larger drive as I only had a couple of small SSDs handy.Will report back once I have any news or queries.Will you report back even if you successfully found 1000 BTC in the wallet? I would be really nice to hear such thing and would be a new example set in the world of Bitcoin. However, curiosity aside, you should first follow the steps that @nc50lc @LoyceV has suggested you. And, do anything with care because it's something really of priority and should be given as much time as possible.I wish you best of luck with your operations, and it will be really amazing if we can hear some good news from you. If in the process you get stuck or face errors than in that case you will get the best advice through the reputed members of this forum. Keep reporting the progress as that will be helpful for you, and it might be helpful for others as well.A few simple suggestions that might be helpful for you. If you successfully managed to import the wallet and it somehow contains many bitcoins in it than in that case you should prefer to transfer your bitcoins to a hardware wallet. If that's not possible then you should try to be in offline mode as that will be very helpful for the security of the coins. You should also consider to create some new backups of the imported wallet as that would be a good step for the safety purposes.",

I've ordered a Ledger Nano.While it's interesting to read such a nice success story, you should be more discrete with showing off your stash. Consider to edit your disclosed wallet amount, though the cats are already out of the bag.I once had to recover an old Bitcoin Core wallet from 2014 which I nearly lost due to a dying harddisk (I wasn't very backup savvy back then). But I knew that there were far less coins in it. Anyway, so sats deserve to be lost. Once my harddrive showed signs of failure and surface read errors, I quickly saved a ddrescue image of it and saved it for later recovery. For reasons that I won't disclose, this recovery started years later (I don't complain...).Contrary to your experience I had more trouble to load my wallet.dat in more recent versions of Bitcoin Core. My route was to gradually update my Bitcoin Core step by step starting from the Bitcoin Gui version which I last ran in 2014 to more recent ones until I arrived to the then current version a few years ago. My path was probably more tedious than yours, maybe not necessary at all, but in the end me too arrived at a current wallet file version which I was able to transfer to a HD wallet with mnemonic recovery words as backup.Be carefull with your coins and don't talk about it!
