Depending on how you configure it you can make it send 1 share per minute per machine and it’ll use almost no bandwidth.But you need a reliable connection. I tried before with a cell signal and it was awful, way too many dropped connections. Have a good quality switch and you shouldn’t have too many issues.",

If we are to follow the thumb rule, the bandwidth required for (lets say 100 machines could be 0.67 Mbps).Please advise. As for the bandwidth needed for a Bitcoin mining farm, well, everyone has their own unique thoughts that differ from one another. This is because the bandwidth needed depends on the precise software you use to mine Bitcoins. And concerning the thumb rule is only a rough approximation. It's also crucial to remember that the actual bandwidth needed will depend on a number of variables, including the farm's precise location, the strength of the internet, and its size.",

Do you mean extra reward for the nodes who make the query faster than the rest (due to internet speed)? Regardsno its not extra reward..its about the way asics change the data of a hash to find a unique \"difficult hash\". by changing a few bytes within a blocks data, which changes the blockheaders hash.. so if an asic can change data to add more rounds/sessions of hashing, without requesting new entropy from a server. it reduces bandwidth and delay between new rounds of hashing",

Due to its low latency and high speeds, fiber optic internet is the greatest alternative for mining.I am pretty sure you can get away with running over 20 rigs on a 2-5 Mbps connection. All the rig is doing is submitting shares which is basically a small hash only a few bytes in length, and every few second the pool sends you new work. Whether your rig has 1 GPU or 5 GPU, the bandwidth won't change because the pool will send you the proper difficulty of work so you are not overworking the pool by submitting too many or too little shares. The issue is for the connection to be stable, you need a decent ping and you can't have a connection that is unstable such as a cell data signal. With those your rigs will keep hashing old work and when you submit the share it will be rejected because it was labelled as stale.",

I would like to know more from you DaveF.Yes even for 100 miners 5 MB would be fine. ButThere are 3 things to consider.1) Bandwidth. As shown you really do not need a lot. So for 100 miners a 512 Kbps connection would be saturated 24/7 a 1Mbps would be at 50% 24/7 and so on. To allow for the fact that it's not constant bandwidth i.e. you are going to need more when a block hits and new work is sent to your miner a 4 or 5 Mbps connection should be fine. Once again we are talking 100 miners here. With the amount of power they are using getting faster internet is not a big deal.2) Latency. A.K.A ping time, or the amount of time it takes for a packet of data to leave your miner and get to the pool or leave the pool and get to your miner. This is also important and why using services like satellite not recommended.  Cable / fiber / DSL something that is ground based. Also, 4/5G can do some funky routing things. If you are spending real money on a miner spend a bit on the internet service for it.3) Your internal network / router. And once again this means more with more miners. 1 miner plugged into a cheap home router is fine. 25 plugged into a cheap network switch along with some security cameras and somebody streaming Netflix  behind that same home router is going to cause data drops and speed drops as it tries to keep up. Better equipment is not that much more money and will just make for a better setup.-Dave",
