I will follow the project and see if the team can deliver The token is already well developed but hasn't launch in the market yet. It's actually 5% of taxation on token sales. For meme coin, it's usually charged the 5% tax as their own profit. But for FireDAO, the 5% is use to support the whole ecosystem of FireDAO. (whitepaper page23). We have built a complete super-economic ecosystem. It might be a little complex at the beginning, but once you understand the whole ecosystem, trust me, you won't find it complicated anymore.Thanks for paying attention to us.Website: www.firedao.co (newer version will be upgraded very soon)Whitepaper: https://firedao.co/WhitepaperTwitter: https://twitter.com/FireDAOlabGithub: www.github.com/FireDAOlab (currently we already have more than 40 developed contracts, and in future will have more than 100 contracts to support the ecosystem)",

      "body": "I saw that a 5% tax is levied during the sale of tokens, most of which will go to the finance department of the project party. I also carefully looked at the revenue distribution of the finance ministry, which is an infinite looper. There is no doubt that the complexity does make me feel a little bit lost, and I am also looking forward to the complete product being launched to experience it. Since I don't know the code, I can't review the code quality. Overall, I feel that it is a very large complex. I want to know what kind of community is needed to support the entire ecology if it is functioning normally? How does the impetuous currency circle form a strong consensus? I'm interested to keep following. I hope that the official website will update the latest news and product experience area as soon as possible.",

You need to grow a lot during the anticipation era, you can't just do a launch and expect people to fund you, you need to keep the anticipation period long and you need to make deals with a lot of people who have their own communities they listen to. The cheapest way is to partner with other projects, you could call it \"community partnership\" and just share each other on twitter together, that way both of your community will be aware of each other.Secondly you could start off with giveaways, that would bring in undesirable people but at least look like you got numbers. You also need some money because that way you would be able to do marketing properly. These should be fine, if you are actually good, rest will come, if they don't after all these, then it wasn't really good.",
