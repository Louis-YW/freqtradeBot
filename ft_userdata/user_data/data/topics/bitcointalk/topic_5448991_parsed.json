  "content": "I recently moving back to my late grandpa house, and set up all my Pc. After few days I'm notice some strange happen in my UPS battery backup it not work properly, the electricity inside very quickly wear out. Ofcourse I thought this is may have some issue with old part compartment (even tho I buy it 7 month ago), so I decide buy new one with more capacity voltage. But the problem still appear so I just ignore it because in few day I will back to my house, after back to my house all thing work properly even my old one UPS.So what is inside this underground soil? is it possible that maybe metal (Gold, silver or tin) have something to do with all of this.",

      "body": "My guess is bad electricity at your Grandpa's house so the UPS was struggling to stabilize power to your PC (can't charge properly). Also perhaps the temperature is too hot for your PC so it draws more power than required to dissipate the heat.So if you happen to go back to your Grandpa's house, you should check the AC voltage reading and see whether it fluctuates or not. Then check your PC temperature.",

The more likely scenario if lightning often strikes in the area is that many of the electronics/electricity infrastructure will break if not properly protected. There are many higher possibility scenarios other than your theory about the \"underground soil\" that is easily overlooked:* The more remote the location, the quality of electricity usually goes down.* It can be at some point, your electricity went down so it drains your UPS battery without you knowing.* etcOne theory about mineral composition is about proper/improper grounding for electricity. Maybe you should check it out.",

Those metals could potentially cause interference with the UPS battery backup. However, it's hard to say for sure without more information. For me, it might be worth testing the soil to see if there are any metals present and if they could potentially be causing the issue with the UPS.",
