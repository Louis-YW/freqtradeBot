He simply digs in deeper.'On The Verge Of The Abyss' - No US Presidential Election In 2024?https://www.zerohedge.com/political/verge-abyss-no-us-presidential-election-2024Note: the subpoena came long after Trump left Twitter. And no, it wasn't X then, and therefore it is not now. He wrote it when it was Twitter. Important. Trump left Twitter (was cancelled) on Jan 8 2021, Elon Musk bought it on October 27 2022, and renamed it \"X\" in late July 2023. Just so we get our horses and dogs in line.Special counsel Jack Smith received his Twitter/Trump subpoena with the added provision that it had to be entirely secret, not even Twitter or Trump could know. US District Court Judge Beryll Howell gave Smith what he wanted, agreeing that if Trump's years-old Twitter past was known, he would become a flight risk. But both Smith and Howell knew this was absolute nonsense. Not only is Twitter the last place you turn to when you have nefarious secrets to hide (it's the opposite!), but the man is running for President, for God's sake! And because of some 5 year old -or so- tweets he would pack in the family and disappear to an -underground- bungalow on Vanatua, never to be heard from again?...",

      "body": "The title is far too misleading and the vague attempt to equalize Trump and Biden is sad and comical. Trump does not have \"skeletons in the closet\", Trump has more than 40 charges and 4 indictments currently filed and going for trial , so it is just vain to even try to compare.I hope you have listened to the conversation by phone with the governor or Georgia. Very illuminating.Now, elections there will be, candidates there will be, so zero chance of anything like what you describe happening.",

      "body": "^^^ But if you look at the charges and indictments, you will see that loads of other presidents of the past have done way more in the same areas as Trump is being charged with. But none of them except Clinton was ever charged with wrongdoing for them.The point is that the Deep State is working as hard as it can to prosecute Trump into a position where he doesn't make it into the presidency.If they can't prosecute Trump out of the presidency, they just might have to declare an emergency of some kind, to shut down elections.",
