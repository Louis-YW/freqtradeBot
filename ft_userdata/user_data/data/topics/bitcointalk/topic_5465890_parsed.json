Every time you post your bitcoin address, or email it, mass surveillance associates it with you and records how much money you have received. That's why ZCash went to so much trouble to hide the identity of the sender of crypto. By sharing a Bitcoin address via Crosspass, you become essentially anonymous.

But it reminds me of the Silent Payments idea.

About deleting data: when note is transferred from sender to recipient, then the sender deletes records in local database on the device. (First dictionary value is set to empty string, then the dictionary key is deleted).  On the recipient's phone data remains for one day, then gets deleted. When the app starts up it deletes all records older than 2 weeks.  On the server, any stored state older than 2 weeks is deleted.",

I was hoping the site itself would be enough, but it asks me to install software on my phone. I'm not going to do that, basic OPSEC is installing as few apps as possible.Quote from: Example from your websiteAlice wants to send the password Qwerty123 to Bob. She creates a password share in Crosspass and receives a Lookup ID of YNMK and a PIN of 9038.(The password has not been sent to a server but remains on Alice’s phone only. She must keep her phone online for Bob to retrieve the password.)She emails YNMK 9038 to Bob and he enters it into his Crosspass app. His phone retrieves the password Qwerty123 from her phone, encrypted end to end.The password gets deleted from Alice’s phone and remains on Bob’s phone for a day.This is a lot more complicated than using Protonmail to send an password to another Protonmail user. Protonmail uses end-to-end encryption by default without sending codes and passwords, and can also set an expiration time.QuoteYou can send both the Lookup ID and PIN together. However, note that the Lookup ID is not secret, so you can make it public without any loss of privacy.On the other hand, the one-time PIN is secret, so whoever uses it first will retrieve the shared password. (After that the PIN will stop working.) Therefore use a medium of communication to transfer the PIN that is unlikely to be intercepted and used by a rogue party before the proper party uses the PIN.So if someone knows your Lookup ID, there's a 3 in 10,000 chance they can read your message. I wouldn't trust that for sending a credit card number, and it's much worse when dealing with Bitcoin private keys.Quote from: frisco2 on September 06, 2023, 09:19:18 PMI can tell you when I needed to do that,- sharing an online wallet at blockchain.info with a business partner, for arbitrageWeb wallets are not recommended, and sharing a wallet at least doubles the risk of losing your funds.Quote- sharing an encrypted Cryptomator cloud drive with a business partnerIf I really, really have to share something encrypted online, I'd prefer Protonmail.Quote- giving Netflix password to my momI'd just drive there and enter it Quote- encrypting ZIP file with AES and sending the ZIP by Dropbox, while password by another methodAgain: Protonmail.

But the standalone app will continue to exist in any case. QuoteIs Crosspass using any servers, and what would happen if app or servers are down?Crosspass client is talking to a Crosspass server. The job of the server is: - to send out Push Notifications to wake up phones so that they resume talking with the server. - to reserve lookup IDs- to prevent someone triggering too many Push Notification to the same phone.If the server is down, the tunnel won't be established between the sender and recipient, so notes won't be able to be retrieved while it is down. I am prepared to move to serverless infrastructure as soon as I observe any scalability issues.  Currently, an MQTT handler is being integrated into the mobile apps. This allows to decouple everything and go serverless without the need for users to update their apps. (Note: \"serverless\" still is a \"server,\" but the server is e.g. all of AWS.)Let's see what happens if the mobile app of the sender is down. Because the exchange is peer-to-peer (with the server acting to establish a tunnel), the protocol fails if the sender's device doesn't respond to a Push Notification or if Push Notification takes too long to arrive. Normally it arrives within 2 seconds, but I have observed a 30 minute delay on rare occasions. The currently published version of the app will just show an error to the recipient upon a timeout of 30 seconds. However, I am making a UX improvement now for this rare case. The recipient's phone will place the request on hold and resume normal operation. When the sender's phone comes back to life, the server will send Push Notification to the recipient's side to resume the protocol.",

If Protonmail ever compromises their core principles, they won't survive.Lavamail chose to shutdown instead of fooling its users and being silent under a gag order. It was a USA corporation. Can't this happen in Switzerland? I think it can, because USA forced Swiss banks to close American accounts and to reveal all account activity to American authorities. Also, as much as I value privacy, I value and respect the judicial system. The reason? Civilized society is setup to protect private property and privacy, at least in principle. So if police wants data on someone and they come to me with a court order, it is my principle to respect the law and to comply with the request.  However, if I simply can't help because of the way the protocol is implemented, I do well by both the law and by privacy of clients.  In contrast, Protonmail, Signal, WhatsApp, et. al. could MITM any user by issuing rogue public keys. Crosspass is safer because in order for the Crosspass server operator to MITM a client, he would have to guess the PIN, which is as hard as guessing 11 coin flips. QuoteQuoteGuessing 3 out of 10,000 is like 1 out of 3333, and that's harder than guessing a sequence of 11 flips of a coin. It's good enough for a bank apparently.The difference is that a bank also requires a piece of hardware to go with the PIN. If the Lookup ID is public, that's like handing out your bank card to random strangers to try their luck.What's the difference, if in total only three attempts are permitted? Does it matter which three people use up these attempts? The bank is happy with a 4 digits PIN because it can limit the number of attempts.  Long passwords are needed only when a brute force attack cannot be prevented (when password hashes are leaked).  Crosspass is relying on the OTP model for authentication. In common usage OTPs are short and yet they unlock a person's account. Why is this safe? The time limit on the OTPs prevents theft through shoulder surfing or internet traffic harvesting.  The limit on tries prevents brute forcing. (You can achieve the former with Crosspass by deleting a share after 5 minutes.)QuoteIf you've installed malware, it's safe to assume it's still there after you try to delete it. That's why I don't like installing unknown software outside a controlled environment (such as a VM or spare laptop). I've setup my spare laptop to wipe and reinstall it in minutes, and I use this when dealing with untrusted Forkcoin wallets. I can't do that on my phone, and even spare phones are less easy to properly wipe and use again.I understand this, but the person to whom your are sending sensitive stuff (or receiving from) most likely will not. It takes two to tango. If the recipient is a busy accountant, realtor, or a doctor, he will not do all this work. So if we are to have any adoption of secure practices, we need to package it in a form-factor he will use without friction.The other issue is: are you willing to keep your laptop online until you establish a shared key by Diffie-Hellman? The choice to put Crosspass on a smartphone was made because it is always online, like a personal server in a pocket. Twenty years ago people kept their desktops online, serving a website from it. With the prevalence of laptops this ended while computers which are always online had moved to the cloud.QuoteThe problem is still the same: there will be a 3 in a million chance for someone to find the private key I sent. That's an unacceptable risk.Not just any someone, it would have to be someone who is a MITM. Otherwise, you will know the key was stolen if your friend has not received it. Crosspass will release the shared secret only once, and expire the PIN.Then send a public key, not a private key: establish a private key by Diffie-Hellman (DH) and verify the public keys by Crosspass to ensure that there was no MITM in the Diffie-Hellman exchange. (You can do this in practice with the Signal app by sending Signal's Safety Numbers by Crosspass.)  In any case, if you do transfer a private key by Crosspass and it is used to initialize a Signal protocol chat, then one chat round (e.g. \"Hello Alice\" and \"Hello Bob\") are sufficient to establish a new Diffie-Hellman key, essentially using the original private key only for authentication.QuoteI've never used Google's app payment system, and I never will. Again, I guess I'm not the average user here, but I refuse to pay for small pieces of software on a small screen when I have complete open source operating systems with loads of software at my disposal free of charge.Crosspass one day will be a free of charge CLI which you can install with Apt or Brew, from source. That will cover the cool cats, but what about the laymen they have to deal with? As mentioned above, most other people who receive or send stuff to you will not be able to use it in this form. End-to-end encryption was almost non-existent in adoption until WhatsApp. In order to make encryption habitual, it must be put into a form that everyone can use. This was my design goal with Crosspass.P.S. If you want to support Crosspass, please give some love to @entelecheia_inc Twitter account which I just created.",

That's an unacceptable risk.Not just any someone, it would have to be someone who is a MITM. Otherwise, you will know the key was stolen if your friend has not received it. Crosspass will release the shared secret only once, and expire the PIN.That's different than what you said on your website:Quotenote that the Lookup ID is not secret, so you can make it public without any loss of privacy.This makes it look like you can post the Lookup ID on social media, while it's something to be kept a secret.",

However, I am not suggesting tweeting the lookup ID on Twitter. If it were tweeted, then some jerk could try to access it with 3 invalid PINs and lock the note. The Crosspass server knows the lookup ID, since it issued it. From the cryptographic theoretical perspective it is not private because there is at least one third party which knows it.LoyceV, thank you for raising this. I now have updated the website with a clearer explanation to the question \"Do I need to send the PIN by another channel?\"  This is the new copy,QuoteYou can send both the Lookup ID and PIN together. However, if you are communicating over an insecure channel and you need to refer to the share, you can refer to it by the Lookup ID. For example, Alice writes in an email to her cat sitter Bob:QuoteHey Bob,Thanks again for agreeing to feed my cat Luna. You are a lifesaver!I am sending you the WiFi password in note XYZC, and the gate code in note QCTY.You will need to use the Crosspass app to get them. Text me when you are at the gate.Feel free to hang out at my place, Luna could use the company.Hugs,AliceThen, once he arrives at the gate and texts her,QuoteI am at the gate and I have Crosspass. What’s the PIN?She texts him,QuoteXYZC 1935QCTY 0382",

      "body": "I am going to agree with LoyceV that there are too many potential issues to consider using it.Most notably the fact that it is a black box for the user what happens under the hood. Too much trust required. For me to ever consider something like this, it would have to be open source.If I wanted to share private information, I would likely use OnionShare which is open source and rather easy to use.Your service does seem simple to use. The requirement to download an app is slightly annoying. Having the secret expire after 3 incorrect attempts seems like enough for sharing secrets that are not super sensitive. Expiring the secret after it has been viewed is another good thing. Setting asides problems that I have with it personally, someone might find it useful although I would still warn anyone to trust their secrets with a third-party.",

It is a webpage that can be run locally as `file://`,  thereby protecting from Javascript backdoors. Simply use \"Save As (Webpage, Complete)\" in the browser and save it. It's designed to be run locally.  The code is simple to review fully, since it merely wraps browser's native libraries.https://borisreitman.com/privacy.htmlI have made Crosspass because as simple as that tool is, it is still too difficult for non-techies.",

      "body": "what your application offers is actually simple, namely offering an easy and secure way to share passwords, but in line with what other users have said, most people are more interested in using popular applications such as protonmail or whatsapp which use an encryption system and have trusted for a long time to send their sensitive texts.moreover, the id system that you use is actually not very convincing for people because someone could guess a random id and log into someone's account (even if the attempt fails up to 3 times, this is still vulnerable) and this application is paid which for some people is quite annoying .but even so, what you build needs to be appreciated. starting from the design, whitepaper, and faq, you explained it well. maybe if you improve the quality of the system there will be more people who trust to use your application.",
