      "body": "welcome to the forum, your site has a very nice and simple design, I particularly liked the design although I don't play those games that just depend on luck, I wonder if it's worth creating a site that only forces a single type of game while you could take advantage of this and create a website where you have all types of possible games and you would also add sports betting to the website because with that you would capture all types of customers and not just have one type of customer as you currently are, for example in your current case if you ran a subscription campaign on this forum you would have to spend money just to get a specific group of people who like this type of game, the risk of spending money and getting few customers is much greater, but if you had a complete casino with all possible games and sports betting by running a subscription campaign you would be capturing customers of all kinds, the chances of having a good customer base would be greaterQuote from: weeddaddy on November 21, 2022, 06:20:06 AM‚û°Ô∏è What can I do with your in-site coins?Our in-site coin is called $EED. You can use it mainly for playing, and we are going to launch a new feature that‚Äôll let you exchange the $EEDs to USDC! (which means you will get the chance to WIN BIG with our free coins!)Your currency still has no value and hardly anyone will want to claim hours to win something that has no value, why don't you offer bitcoin instead of still creating something that still has no value? or else you wait until your altcoin has value and then open the faucet because at least then people will be able to see the value of your altcoin and will decide if it's worth spending time to claim on the faucet, and I imagine people will have a choice to exchange your altcoin for USDC on your website? because if you are still thinking that after creating your altcoin you have to look for an exchange to add your altcoin then this will be a very long process and no one or a very small number of people will accept using a faucet in that condition of still having to take the altcoin to go trade on one of those small and shady exchanges because new projects always list on those small and shady altcoins",

Are you going to make the users addicted with your crash game as much as the weed do :-P? The site design is very neat and looks nice. There are no distractions.It's good to see that you already bought the copper membership to be able to post image. But you should consider posting a full image for the ANN like others mainly your competitors did, as example btc365 ann thread. Currently it's just an image at the bottom and all information are in text format. Consider designing an ANN with full image.Besides, you can think of promoting the brand to this community. There are many ways to be active and engage with the community to build a positive brand. If you want we can talk about some of them. Additionally, you can launch a long lasting signature campaign to introduce the project and spread out the words. There are many campaign managers around who can help you promoting your product to this community. You will find them here. I do offer campaign management service and I would love to work together if you consider my service among them.Anyway, welcome to the forum.",
