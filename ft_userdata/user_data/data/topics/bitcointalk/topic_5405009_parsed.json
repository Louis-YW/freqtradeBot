  "content": "I recently won a free spin bonus on Livecasion.io, the signature campaign that I am in. Though I have been offered a type of bonus(welcome bonus) some time ago, I was excited about this particular bonus for two reasons. First, it was my first time getting a free spin bonus. And secondly, because I won a fair amount of money from the spin.For every gambling beginner, here is a list of the common types of bonuses online casinos offer.Common Types of Bonuses Offered by Online CasinosWelcome BonusesLoyalty BonusesDeposit BonusesNo Deposit BonusesFree Spin BonusesCashable BonusesMatched Deposit BonusesReward Multipliers BonusesReferral BonusHigh Roller RewardsReload BonusesPlease kindly note that I will be quoting the whole explanation of each of the common types of bonuses offered by online casinos so as not to miss any crucial detail Welcome BonusesQuoteA first deposit bonus – typically a “welcome” bonus – is one in which the casino will match a percentage of your first deposit. For example, if the bonus is a 100% welcome bonus up $1,000, the casino will match every dollar you deposit, up to a total of $1,000.Loyalty(VIP) BonusesQuoteA loyalty – or VIP – program is one where you earn points, cash, or rewards the more that you play. Every VIP program is a little different, but they’re structured similarly, as players move through tiers and claim rewards based on how often and how much they play.Deposit BonusesQuoteDeposit bonuses are also a common method of motivating new players to join online casinos. Similar to welcome bonuses, these bonuses will give a multiple of the deposit after the player has opened an account. It could be 2, 3 4, or even five times the amount deposited. Deposit bonuses up to 100% can usually be used on table games, such as blackjack, while bonuses of 200%, or more, will be limited to play only on slot machines.No Deposit BonusesQuoteNo deposit bonuses give players a chance to try out a new casino without risking any money. As the name implies, no deposit is needed, nor is any credit card information required. The player only needs to activate an account and start playing for free. Usually, the bonus is limited to a maximum of $150 and there will be some restrictions on it. Perhaps, you may only be able to use it on slot machines and a certain amount of “churn” will be required. For example, if you are given $100 in credit, you will have to play it through the machine 20 times, making a total of $2,000 in bets. Also, there will probably be a limit on the maximum that you can cash out. So, if you win a $10,000 jackpot with your free bonus the maximum cashout may be limited to just $500.These restrictions may seem onerous, but casinos need to do it to prevent bonus hunters from going to different casinos and simply cashing out their free credits.Free Spin BonusesQuoteOne of the most popular casino bonuses you’ll encounter, a free spins casino bonus is exactly what it sounds like – the casino will give you a number of free spins on their slot games. Sometimes you may be limited to specific games, and free spins bonuses may be standalone offers or combined with another bonus. Typically a casino site will offer dozens. or even hundreds of free spins spread across your first 1-10 deposit(s).Cashable BonusesQuoteCashable Bonuses are bonuses that can be cashed out once you’ve met the casino’s conditions (typically a wagering requirement). For example, if a casino gives you a $500 cashable bonus, as soon as you’ve met the requirements, you can cash this $500 out.Matched BonusesQuoteMatch bonuses are one of the most popular forms of rewards at online casinos. Match bonus follows a relatively simple phenomenon wherein the casino matches the player’s first deposit with an equal amount of compensation from their side. For instance, if an online casino offers a 100% match bonus deposit and the player deposits $200 in their account, then, in that case, the casino tops up the player’s account with $200 from their side. The percentage and type of match bonus highly vary from casino to casino.Reward Multipliers BonusesQuoteMany online casinos provide special reward multipliers to engage users and promote new slots. Reward multipliers are usually available within a limited period allowing players to get higher winnings. For example, if you play a slot while the reward multiplier is active, your winnings will be multiplied. Most reward multipliers double or triple the amount you won, but some of them multiply your winnings by up to 100 times! If you know that a casino you visit offers reward multipliers, make sure to play a few slots because you might win a lot more money than is usually allowed on that particular game.Referral BonusesQuoteRefer-a-friend programs are a great way to boost your bankroll if friends and family are also keen players. When a friend signs up for the casino via your link, the casino will give you a reward for your referral.High Roller Rewards QuoteSome casinos prefer players who are willing to make massive deposits, so they offer high roller bonuses. If you’re eager to make a higher deposit, the casino recognizes you as a VIP, which usually grants you access to all kinds of perks and events, such as free slot tournaments where cash prizes are supplied by the casino. Most casinos will require at least a $500 deposit to qualify as a high roller entry, so make sure you check the requirements before making a deposit. Reload BonusesQuoteReload bonuses are specifically for returning players who have already signed up at a casino, where the casino may match their deposit up to a certain amount, to encourage them to come back to the casino. Reload bonuses are fantastic for regular players who deposit every few weeks.You can add some of the other bonuses which I may have missed out which you think are also common. Here is a question for veteran gamblers. Do you check the types of bonuses offered by an online casino before signing up?Source:https://www.gambleonline.co/casino/bonus/#:~:text=A%20first%20deposit%20bonus%20%E2%80%93%20typically,to%20a%20total%20of%20%241%2C000.https://www.casinorankings.com/bonuses/match/#:~:text=Match%20bonuses%20are%20one%20of,of%20compensation%20from%20their%20sidehttps://nativenewsonline.net/advertise/branded-voices/types-of-bonuses-online-casinos-offer",

      "body": "This is a good article but I have one disagreement about referral bonus, I can not call it a bonus unless there is addictional extra referral reward added to it which can be called a bonus. But it is nover like that. I only count it as referral reward because it is not a bonus in my opinion, it is a reward of what you worked for by referring people to join the betting site, if they join and play on the betting site, the referrer would be rewarded.Another is cashback, probably this can be under what OP said to be cashable bonuses because there are conditions for it too in a way certain amount would have first been lost in a particular period of time before the gamblers can be eligible to get back certain percentage of the total amount lost.",

Rarer Sports Rollbots unlock the best free bets!Sports Rollbots holders earn a share of the profit from Rollbit's Sportsbook. 10% is paid out for all sports, receive up to 30% for sports that match your Sports Rollbot!Other Bonuses: 10% Rakeback, Rank Up Bonuses and Cashback Rewards.Bottom line: every online casino's bonus offer is different though, the most important thing is that users enjoy their bets and enjoy betting at online casinos.",

That's also what more gamblers are looking for, the advantage from bonus will extend we playing long time as well. If problem of winning or not depends on the gambler's emotions, I also still have a failure rate because of that emotion, but by getting a bonus usually the gambler will be calmer and feel comfortable to spend time at casino.",
