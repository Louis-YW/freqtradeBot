  "content": "And actually, it goes way deeper than this. It all has to do with the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank, and how they want to make more money, and take more control... and how they pull the strings of the world to do so.The USA's Covert Empirehttps://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/06/no_author/the-usas-covert-empire/In an interview shortly before his death Daniel Ellsberg said the US runs a \"covert empire\", which is a really good way of putting it.We really don't pay enough attention to the fact that all the most influential media platforms are owned and operated by extremely wealthy people who have every motive to keep us all focused on culture wars and electoral politics so we don't focus on class war and direct action.It's surreal how saying the FBI constantly grooms mentally ill people to get involved in terrorist plots makes you sound like a kooky crackpot, but it's actually a well-documented fact that we just don't talk about much for some reason.The only time Trump was praised by the mass media was when he bombed Syria. The only time Biden was condemned by the mass media was when he withdrew from Afghanistan. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere....",

      "body": "^^^ This is exactly why they are making so much trouble for Julian Assange and Wikileaks.Nobody is an island. No Elite, wealthy person is an island. Everybody absolutely NEEDS at least a few associates. And these associates need others... all to get something done for the wealthy elite.The wealthy Elite depend on each other and their main people to get things done, and to move operations in the world. If they have major disagreements among themselves, things don't work as well... or maybe not at all.This was the goal that Assange was doing through Wikileaks - and in other ways. He was causing doubt to exist between the elites and their followers. He was throwing info out there that would break their trust of each other. This would cause them to have to change their plans on a regular basis. It would slow them down and maybe destroy their plans altogether.AI is dangerous because it is helping certain elite to maintain their dominion without needing as much trust in others. But here is the trick to AI. It can help other elite to branch out in other directions, making it a fight against itself, thereby.",
