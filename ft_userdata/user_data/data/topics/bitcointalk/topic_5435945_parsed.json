  "content": "Looking to purchase BTC with Cash deposit to High Street banks at 4% above market value. Lets be real no-one wants to 'go first' so we'll use Localbitcoins escrow service and I will pay the 1% sellers fee. This way we both have peace of mind!! I have 500+ trades on the site with 100% feedback. No silly amounts, all trades between Â£2k-10k. All I need is the name on the account, account number and the sort code. I appreciate no-one wants to abuse their account and smash loads of cash into it, thus the amounts are low and the rate is high. Please contact me to discuss more.
