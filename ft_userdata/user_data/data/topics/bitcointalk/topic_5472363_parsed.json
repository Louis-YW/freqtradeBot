Btw, welcome to the forum before you continue your activity here I’ll advice you take your time to navigate around and get a good idea of what the forum is about and what each boards are meant for and possibly go through the rules of the forum.",

Just remember, the market can be volatile, so invest cautiously and keep learning. The world of cryptocurrencies awaits!Your post is not explanatory, I believe you should be learning and not teaching. The write-up that you just did is not really explanatory. If you are creating a thread about how to guide beginners, then you should have made it more explanatory. I don’t think any beginner will understand or learn anything serious from the thread that you just created. How will you want to explain the basics of cryptocurrency, and you think just a few posts that you made is enough? You didn’t talk about the necessary things that newbies are supposed to know before joining cryptocurrency.",

I was curious if OP really knows he or she is a newbie here to have made this and possibly other members would think OP is here not to learn but to start getting merit without wanting to learn more about the platform. OP should have known that first engagement matters when it comes to activities of this nature on this platform.The platform is always open to anyone who is willing to learn more about it and I will advise OP to fell free to ask questions as an it bothers his or her curiosity here because that is what would steer up more actions from Members to helping OP out by assisting OP to learn more.",

If your aim is to get merits and start making money then you will not learn enough to get to that level and may do it the hard way, take out time study, understand the dynamics of this forum and then you will benefit more than you are aiming at now as there's more you can bet from here.The reason I'm stating all that which I mentioned above is because your post is just too basic and almost has no quality but then it could be considered since you are a newbie, if you have studied well enough your topic is such that would convey more quality than it is doing now, also take out some time to read the rules and guidelines of this forum so as to guide you alright but then I must commend your effort to wanting to educate others but whatever is worth doing should he done well.",

You should know that someone will catch you at some point. A friendly suggestion from me is to stop using these AI shit to publish content in this forum. You won't go any longer with this.

Except this just an easy way to calling attention to yourself, I see no reason for this, op. If you were so knowledgeable, at least you would have deigned to check if this your basic knowledge of crypto has been helpfully supplied by another or are you just another of the many alts of a user who enjoys littering the forum by spamming? Or is it just that you can't make use of the search engine? Way to go though, atleast you've joined the club of noobs who don't start with \" hey I'm new\"..",
