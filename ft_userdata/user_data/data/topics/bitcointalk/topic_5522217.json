It's incredibly powerful, having solved in less than five minutes a computational problem that would take the fastest computer available right now more than 10 septillion years (a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe). Will this chip be able to break the cryptography behind BTC addresses so quickly that it will make the entire BTC network insecure?",

Of course all the 10,000 altcoins would also cease to exist.As well as destroying all the satellites and cell towers in the world, all the credit card networks as well as govt networks in the world would be shut down, etc. Civilization and the modern world as we know it would pretty much come to an end.",

It is their 2nd one.Fine. However there is still not a single QC application program that has *any* real-world use and per the Google researchers there are still several more milestones to be crossed before there ever will be any. It took over 19 years to solve the error rate problem, odds are it will take several decades more to cross the remaining milestones.Once technology does progress enough for real-world applications:a. QC's will not be available outside of research organizations and 3-letter gov agencies for many many years meaning hackers will be locked out for a long long time.b. As others have already said, once QC's *are* widely available, crypto coins will be far down the list of targets. The world's banking and information systems will be much higher on the list. Those being attacked will make attacks on crypto of insignificant importance.",
