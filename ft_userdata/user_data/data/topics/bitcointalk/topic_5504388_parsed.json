Be it to be used as payment method or choice for liquidating or diversification of assets?Your thoughts are welcomed!I don't think so, because if the return of the gold standard in general life will only affect the value of fiat in the eyes of many people, Bitcoin will continue to experience price increases as long as its acceptance is still widespread and I believe that Bitcoin's acceptance will not decrease when the gold standard is back among the world's people. And at this time I don't see gold as an opponent of Bitcoin because both can still have value and grow separately so that it will actually make it more difficult for fiat to determine its value in the future.",

I mean the question that the OP asked. Gold standard means the currency of a nation would be in gold price. Each country will prefer to defend their currencies and they will not prefer the gold standard because this could likely have negative effect on their own currencies when than bitcoin. I do not think it will affect bitcoin at all even if it becomes true. But it is far more of fantasy than what could become reality.",

Therefore, their attempt to restore the gold standard will never happen. Besides, I don't think bringing back the gold standard would bring any good to our world. It is no different from a double-edged sword because the population is increasing, supply and demand are imbalanced, and if the Government cannot print money itself to solve this problem, the poor will also be larger, and they will continue to be more miserable. It can be said that maintaining world stability is not as simple as we think.Regarding bitcoin , I don't think there will be any impact because the scenario of the world returning to the gold standard will never happen.",

The only time this could be a thing is when the countries currency got hit by a huge inflation which affects its value and in other to defend it they would rather go for this gold standard. I think bitcoin will not be affected because it is an alternative and people have find reasons beyond just the stability of the currency to invest in it. Even if gold standard is use in fiat currency, the banks needed to hold your funds is still a barrier that many bitcoiners are running from so they would still stick to bitcoin. The asset which might be affected will be the gold itself",

Governments will not make Bitcoin standard legally in their nations but the success of Bitcoin as a pioneer of Blockchain technology, triggers governments to think of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and developments of CBDC will be another signal of never return of Gold standard.If you are optimistic about Bitcoin standard, find some positive insights from The bullish case for Bitcoin and Bitcoin standard book.",

Be it to be used as payment method or choice for liquidating or diversification of assets?Your thoughts are welcomed!Return of gold standard could have mix effect on Bitcoin and Crypto. However, if gold leads to increased confidence and stability in fiat currency, the appeal of crypto or alternative assets might decline. Bitcoin and other crypto can be compared to as digital gold due to finite supply and potential as s store of value. If gold stabilized the global monetary system, it could restore dependence in fiat currencies and possibly limits the need for cryptocurrencies. Still cryptocurrencies offer benefits like fast and low-cost international transaction and financial involvement, which very unlikely to the policies of fiat currency so crypto's role might remain unaffected if gold standard shift's back.Quote from: dzungmobile on July 28, 2024, 02:47:14 PMThe world debt with combination of many national debts keep increasing sharply with time.Very timely, global debt increases dramatically because many countries are borrowing more money. It surge more during the COVID-19 pandemic as all government borrows money just to support their economies.",

The reshaping of how things are done to allow for it would cause so much pain that it could never work.Anyone who can do even basic math can figure it out.There are about 244,000 metric tons of gold in the world. A metric ton is 1000 kilograms so 244000*1000 so 244,000,000 kilograms there are 1000 grams in a kilogram so * 1000 again gets you 244,000,000,000 grams of gold.
