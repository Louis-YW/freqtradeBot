  "content": "This skip my mind all this why, naija we dont like to discuss more bitcoin, and their is something I understand very well in cryptocurrency when you bitcoin you have known it forever and when you don't know bitcoin in the discussion you won't contribute your own part of it, we are suppose to be making more of bitcoin topics so that anyone coming to our local board our brothers and sisters will be happy learning from than going outside to commit different crimes here, so what I understand is that here,  is that it's few people who knows bitcoin and who can stand fit to defend and teach our dear brothers and sisters bitcoin, let us be doing as a culture it will help to raise some people for understanding bitcoin. Do you know most of us is not into technical, and that is why it's hard before you see our people discussing in a technical board, its few of them that discuss in technical board,summary let concentrate generally in every discipline and make sure that we discuss more of bitcoin in our board.",

      "body": "I also have the same thinking because when our fellow Naija brothers and sisters come to the forum, they just see the local board as a newsreader place. Not that we are not discussing bitcoin-related topics, but most of us are engaged in bringing unnecessary news to the community. In this process, many of them spam sometimes, but if we engage more in discussion about bitcoin, many of us will understand because some of us here can’t express our minds using English, but when it comes to pidgin, they will be able to write and also understand more. My view here is that if we can start discussion and creating thread that will be base on bitcoin writing in pidgin it will help more of our members that are in this forum to understand more about bitcoin especially the newcomers they need to have adequate knowledge so that they will not be a victim of breaking and rule of the forum and they should understand more about bitcoin  And we should engage in creating thread like  this one,  to help the newcomers.",

Even for di established members di relevant discussions go also de refresh dem memories about bitcoin, because out of sight na out of mind. Also we go de get new ideas join di ones wey we get, based on say di forum na about bitcoin talk. Person like me wey no get any idea about bitcoin before I join dis forum, na here I start to gradually gain every knowledge of crypto matter wey I know, so if no be plenty bitcoin discussions wey de on ground for me to de join di discussion and learn, I no know where my level for de about bitcoin now. Aldo off topics discussions de OK for our board too, so we go de de informed about oda things wey de happen for our country. But di topics no suppose pass  bitcoin related discussions, so people wey visit di board go know say na bitcoin matter be di koko for here. But I no know di possibilities of getting off topic sub board inside our local board, dat one for make am very convenient, so members go know where to direct any topic go.",

      "body": "You made a wonderful observation by the way OP, and it is evidently clear that our Bitcoin knowledge including mine is very small. It's not as if the interest to discuss or create topics isn't there, it's just that many of the topics about Bitcoin may have been discussed previously and it becomes hard to dwell on a subject that has long been discussed mostly coming from newbies. Newbies like me learn more of Bitcoin from the beginners and help section and though I know this Naija section is still part of the Bitcointalk forum, it would be confusing to create new topics on Bitcoin with a semblance to what we have read or commented in the beginners and help section.",

People aren't used to the whole bitcoin and it's concept yet you're talking about the technical aspects, one needs to understand the basics first before going further to the advanced technical aspects, this is not about making a post alone, but we have to also consider giving the right and constructive information required and from experience.",

All is required is a quality post on how it can attest to be useful amongst people in and out of the forum.It is believed that if you have a strong hold Bitcoin topic to discuss about it is better channeled to Bitcoin Discussion board where you may have more proficient varieties of individual opinions.On the Local board is triggered to bring about what feels expressive by you so if you have thousands of Bitcoin Discussion and delightful to table it here you are still not access denied and there are still members here who have good offers to render.The LB is a multipurpose board opened for discussions",
