From what I can see, this exchange operates in the Asia region which is their center.When I try to search with the search keyword \"bitstenproole\", the results appear as shown in the image.If that's the case, then you need to be careful if you have the desire to register and make transactionsI want to convey, this topic is more suitable if the discussion is moved to the exchange board. There has become a place for discussion related to exchange.",

Not your keys not your coins.Not to be harsh here but if actually the domain was created just less two months ago and this is the first post by OP, just less than an hour after creation of the account to ask about the exchange , then it is clear enough that this is a promotional post for the exchange. Because even for a pro it will take so time to find this exchange out. But nonetheless OP I would strong adhere you to stick to Oshosondy advice not to leave coins on exchanges. In fact I would advise you not to rely too much on centralized exchanges just for privacy sake. Here is a filtered list of decentralized exchanges for you.  kycnot.me.",

Apologized if you aren't the actor yourself, and my advice is use something that others are using, they are there before you, they have past experience, stay away from any new thing in crypto space.Go Binance, Coinbase, OkeX, MeXc, Kraken, Bybit, Bitfinex, Bitget, Upbit, Huobi, BitMart, Gemini and so on.... What the hell is Bitstenproole if not a scam?",

So, I think that you know what to do if you're planning to trade there but there's also this thought of mine that this is likely a shill from a newbie account. Despite not being familiar to everyone here, you just tried to give some exposure on it through asking if it's a good place or not. I guess that you've just successfully made our curiosity hit but still, thanks but no thanks we won't trade there.",

Yes, the website is new but I'd give op the benefit of the doubt since scam DMs have been pretty rampant and it's not that rare for victims of crypto romance scams/pig butchering to fall for a new/no one has heard of exchange.Back to OP's question: for safety, it is best to play it safe by staying away from any zero reputation exchanges like bitsten-whatever-dot-com specially if it was a recommendation from an internet stranger.",

Or counter which says 10 million users... At the same time, there is not a single piece of information about who is behind the \"exchange\", team members, where the company is registered...So, bitstenproole.com is an obvious scam and everyone needs to stay away from there.",

TBH, there are some projects I will not recommend that anyone should embark despite how prepared you feel you are or how experienced your team is. The exchanges business is a project I will be skeptical to take up. Reasons be; Exchanges are recently not in the good book of cryptocurrency. Following the collapse of arguably one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, people are very skeptical of exchanges. Even upto loosing confidence in their most trusted exchanges. It is at this very time you will expect many people to patronising your new untested and unreliable project?New gambling companies come with alot of bonuses for new users.  This I understand encourages old gamblers to be able to try new gambling projects.  Then, what will be the reason of anyone to leave their somewhat reputable and trusted exchanges to experiment with a poorly designed relatively new one?Quote from: btc78 on July 02, 2023, 03:13:43 AMplease tell what is your main objective here? is this for promotion ? sorry but there are Binance and other exchange that is legit and serving people for years but not this one.There is this saying I cannot recall verbatim. But is says about being better to have a good promoter and a bad project than the reverse. The method some project owners use to announce their project is very laughable. In the internet anything goes",
