You can bring up a topic about it, let people discuss about it to know if there is a need for such child board and you can have a representative to message theymos about the need for the child board. If most of the topics on this fist page of our local board is pertaining to the board that you are requesting for, it would be given.",

Reporting to the moderator who has been assigned to dis local board is good but those moderators are busy so there are some times reports are ignored.Quote from: Charles-Tim on January 29, 2023, 02:01:26 PMTo have a child board, that means you are discussing more about a particular aspect that should belong to a certain board on our local board, example that I have known is 'politics and society' which may be the first child board that we may have.

So we are still on the process of arranging the home in order. Once everything is set, brainboss, Charles-Tim or Igehhh will pm theymos for the children boards creation.",

Point to some that you reported but not handled. If there are many cases like that, you can request for a moderator if seen valid.",
