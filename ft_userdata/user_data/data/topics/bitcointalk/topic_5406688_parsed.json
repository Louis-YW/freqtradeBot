  "content": "Hello everyone, I recently bought a used Innosilicon T1, but the logo of the received goods is DragonMint T1, and the hash board, I found out that it may be the hashboard of Aladdin T1. I asked the seller, the seller told me they are together, all T1, T2 are Innosilicon. Is this believable?",

My comments made some DragonMint staff quite mad towards me. Now it is quite easy to see how right I was all along.",
