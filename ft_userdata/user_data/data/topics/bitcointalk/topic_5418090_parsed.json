Report it to me and if the member is in any of my campaign then you will receive the payment for the week instead of the accused member.

Very professional, quick and high attention to detail. I really recommend Royse777. ¬† F.A.Qs ¬† We have small budget and we need quick ROI, please enlighten us.Quote from: Royse777 on October 26, 2022, 04:43:30 PMBuilding a brand takes time. There are many successful projects who launched on bitcointalk and now they are one of the leaders in their own industry. Consider Chipmixer. Their weekly budget is 55*$300 which means $16,500 per week.To build the brand they have been promoting their product since March 2017.Another example is BestChange. We all know how hard it was for them to even launch their signature campaign. People were tearing them apart just because BestChange team refused to agree with them on escrowing the campaign fund. But today they are one of the best in their own industry because of consistency to build their brand. We have example of many casino and sportsbooks too. Sportsbet.io, Stake, Fortunejack and many others are constantly spending money on their advertising for years to build their brand. Today all of them are market leaders.To conclude, if you have a small budget and want a few weeks advertising but expects massive result in return then it's unrealistic. For a successful project, it requires long term advertising plan to monetize the traffic of a community.What typical weekly budget do you recommend?Quote from: Royse777 on October 26, 2022, 04:43:30 PMQuote from: Solosanz on October 20, 2022, 09:33:36 AM$50/week for Hero/Legendary members are considered a low payout since average of signature campaigns pay around $70 for Hero/Legendary members, moreover the campaign already run at least 30+ weeks.If the @OP want to get high quality posters, he need to give a guarantee at least 6 months the campaign will run and the payment for Hero/Legendary members is $100+When designing a signature campaign one of the most important aspects a manager needs to consider is the attention the campaign will receive from the community. There are many factors to consider to make a campaign attractive, it's not just the budget. Number of required posts per week plays a big role along with the duration of a campaign. When manager is asking for 25 posts per week and rewarding $50 for it then it's too much to ask considering the ecosystem but if s/he is asking to make 15 posts to reward $50 per week then it's completely okay. The campaign will find many average participants.Another scenario could be like this: Manager is paying $100 per week and asking to make 50+ posts. S/he will definitely encourage spammers to spam on the boards. The campaign will fail to attract reputable forum members who have influence on different boards, even though it's paying $100 per week. Having high end members also matters for a brand promotion.A campaign manager needs to consider the project owners psychology too. Most of the project owners are not aware of the behaviors of the community members. For them it's just another place to advertise their platform. So if a manger thinks a project owner is going to spend $16K+ per week straight way like Chipmixer then it's wrong. It completely make sense that project owners will try to start from an economic budget to check the outcome. But in any case the duration can not be compromised if a project wants to create a positive brand awareness. A project wants to run a campaign with $5k per week budget but only for 4 weeks? They are going to waste the $20k only for few signups. It's the hard reality. After the four weeks everyone will forget about the brand (maybe they will remember it for few more weeks and that's it). But instead, if they spend $1k or even $750 (tight but still) per week and continue the campaign for 20+ weeks they will receive better response. For long five months, members are going to see the brand in front of them and slowly they will start trusting it. The longer a project continue the better influence it starts to create towards the members of the community. The secret for successful projects those are now leading the industry is their long term plan to build a positive value for their own brands.How do you secure escrow funds?I have a 2 of 2 Multi-Sig bitcoin wallet, each key are accessed from two different devices. Whenever a client send payment upfront for a campaign, the coins are stored in that 2 of 2 Multi-Sig bitcoin wallet. So chances of losing the funds are slim. Besides, I have enough bitcoin in my possessions stored in the cold storage to cover any loss of fund from the escrow address. Your funds are safe and secure in my possession.",
