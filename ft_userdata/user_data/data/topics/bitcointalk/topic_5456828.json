Is there likely to be any agreement for a glyph in the near future?I quite like the symbol suggested by satsymbol.com, as it is close to the chinese character meaning bountiful.I also checked and there have not been any consensus among the community on the design of the glyph. The website satsymbol.com is promoting this glyph design  . This is the first time I am seeing this design which means that it is still unpopular. The bitcoin glyph BTC, got the right attention and recognition because it was proposed by the founder (the images are now invalid) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.msg504#msg504.It will take the support of a well known figure in the bitcoin industry to propose a design and gain the needed support. The meaning of glyph proposed by satsymbol.com is wonderful but I think the design should have an 'S' sign which is the first alphabet of Satoshi as in the case of most currencies.

No Latin, chinese, mythological symbols; we should go all in with the new symbol. I think mixing up the names, may be some technical word from the mining operation, or program that we could find on the Satoshi paper should be used. We have seen repeated currency symbol just updated with slight designs so they are mostly boring. For example someone might just come up with “S” which is put in horizontal and making it new Satoshi symbol. We should host contest in Meta section for this new glyph. 😋",

Only a single  S  is quite preferable symbol of Satoshi rather than SAT, I'm sorry I'm not against SAT, but that sounds unprofessional is quite similar to the SAT tests kind of thing. I'll give it a try and update my reply when I'm done. I'm not good at graphic design by any means, but giving it a try won't cost me anything, and who knows someone with better graphic design skills can create a quite useful one after being inspired by my version.",
