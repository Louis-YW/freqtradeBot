You did  well with your design but its not really catchy to me and I think you should have the services of experienced Ann designers on the forum to help you design your Ann  thread.Goodluck bro and I've seen your name several  times both on the local board and the forum at large.",

I'm glad you accepted my words warmly without picking fights and this is a good way to start with and always remember that customers are always right, so try to respect every client you get now regardless  of the pay and try to build a brand first. Goodluck  once again brother and be very respectful  while sliding  into people's dm for the first time.",

      "body": "@Salahmu, I just have a few questions as I can find your ANN detailed and informative enough. On the aspect where you say \"Fast growing community,\" Do you mean this forum as a fast growing community, or do you have a community that you are building that is fast growing, which you will want potential clients to be aware of? If yes,  then I will advise you to add a link to that community on your ANN because some clients may want to see the amount of influence that your community has. Another thing I also want to ask is, Have you managed any campaigns before? I mean, if you have had management experience before now, even if it is outside this forum, If yes, then I will advise you to add the name of those projects, as experience gives you more advantage in winning a client's heart.Try and work on your ANN image size; those other spaces are wasting space. I don't know the exact image size for ANN, but this does not really fit in.",

I still don't understand that, As I can't find any information relating to that.If you have experience in Bounty management with one of the respected and famous managers here on the forum, that is an added advantage for you. I wish to see you around some day managing a project I could possibly be interested in, although I don't do bounty programs as they are almost worthless based on my observation.",
