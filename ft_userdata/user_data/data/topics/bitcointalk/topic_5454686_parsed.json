The evidence for this is that the United States is never affected and does not show any position, and I do not imagine it will remain silent if what is happening threatens the dominance of the dollar, which can be considered one of the most important sources of its power to dominate the world.",

Their currencies are not like other countries that are fully backed by Gold. But the value of each country's currency is still dependent on the price of the U.S. dollar, isn't that surprising?",

The BRICS might be one of the biggest alliances that's focusing in removing USD with its dominance but it will take time and that's the reality. As your sentiment goes for real that the pairs with trades for USD won't be gone and removed quickly, only time will tell if it will happen or if the USD will be stronger out of these situations.",

It can be a very long process or getting the trust of investors and holders of the new currencies so they can do transactions as they please as they usually do with the USD.The thing is that USA is one of the biggest economies on the planet and much of the global commerce happens to go through that country, which means there will be always a demand of their currency.  China and their allies could come up with plans to implant the Chinese Yuan in developing countries in Asia and Latin America, to build a strong front against the USD, but still it is far from behind a reality, the status quo is strong.",

In my opinion if that will be still useless. It has impact for their own nation but not for affecting the existence of USD. Dedollarization was only about speculation but it's different with the reality that happens now, dedolarisation has no massive impact. The fact that if dedolarisation has been starting a very long time ago. It's getting a bit massive caused by china was trying to taking this as opportunity to push its yuan as a replacement for the dollar. The fact that USD is too strong. Even it's strengthening on its value compared with another currency right now. People can have very big speculation about dedolarisation will destroy US but it's being the opposite to the reality right now.",

China also made several agreements with economically influential international parties (Saudi Arabia is an example) to conduct trade exchanges with it in Chinese yuan and abandon the dollar. In addition to some other agreements between some countries to adopt CBDC in the future in exchanges between them.These shifts cannot be overlooked, but at the same time they do not represent a threat to the dominance of the dollar, since all countries participating in this wave keep the dollar as the most important part of their reserves, and it is difficult to work to reduce it in a short period.",

I gotta be honest that while I remained sceptical toward the idea of dedollarisaton, all these discussions made me wonder if there's some truth to it. I found a wonderful article that shows the data in support of the idea that dedollarisation isn't really happening. For example, there's a chart of foreign exchange reserves by currency, and the percentage of reserves in the USD is higher now than it was in 1993, and it's not significantly lower than it's been overall in this century. It was around 60% of global currency reserves in the end of 2022, while it used to be 50% 30 years ago. To compare, the Chinese yuan is at less than 3%.",
