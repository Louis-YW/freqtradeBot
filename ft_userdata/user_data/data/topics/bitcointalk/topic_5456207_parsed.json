  "content": "In our today's society, a lot of person's come out every day to complain about the kind of democracy we are practicing as a people. because a lot of person's have argued that, we are operating a civilian rule kind of government, not Democracy in its entirety because the tenets of democracy is not followed to the latter. In an idea sense of Democracy, justice and fairness reign supreme.In a the valedictory session held by the 9th senate, senator Adamu Bulkachuwa while making his speech, he made some shocking revelations about his role as to ensuring his wife zaniab Bulkachuwa, the former President of the federal court of appeal in Nigeria which he encroached as a husband to help some of his senator Colleagues.  In his words \"I want to thank Particularly, my wife whose freedom and independence I encroached upon while she was in office.And she had been very tolerant and accepted my encroachment and extended her help to my Colleagues\"   The senate President interjected almost immediately because it was a live session, distinguish, i don't think it's a good idea going in this direction, it's not a good idea lawan Said and he immediately off the mic of Bulkachuwa.  Today we've gotten a new slogan \" if you don't like it go to court\"  this are some of the elements that has brought about such emboldened statements.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbT9bfEIFn8",

Lols, I was thinking only understood this as well that I don't like politics for any reason because of its nature. Mostly involving killing whatever they thought in order to survived in the long run of their affairs, whomever that doesn't understand politics shouldn't go closer to them rather such person may end up being used and dumped by them.",

Check out na for a live broadcast wey a politician that was called to serve, the  opens em mouth the disclose how him encroached on his wife's position as President of the federal court of appeal in Nigeria to help his colleagues during her wife's reign in the office as the appeal court president. This na to tell you and I sae politics na game of connection, if you no get am, no room for you there. You need to follow and mingle with politicians wey know road on how to influence the Nigeria electoral process through the Appeal Court because it is quite obvious that our votes doesn't count  any longer. Na politicians wey get the upper link d get the willpower to appoint and remove any politicians wey no d for their clique or have the long rope to remain in power.",

Nigeria is operating a civilian rule and nothing like \"we are operating civilian kind of government\" we are operating civilian government already. I know you wanted to say military kind of government. Nigeria operates Oligarchical system of government which has nothing to do with the Nigerian population but their interest is for few government officials. But this new government might release 1% to the masses.",

Zannab Bulkachuwa should be tag today as a disappointment  and a betrayal to the oath of the Federal government. She has failed Nigerians and the judiciary. This reveals that the Judiciary is crippled and completely compromised to favor corrupt political elites.",

Because I'm sure since that post might have been gotten base on favoritism, she is likely to also work still base on favoritism.",

So don't make it sound as if political affaire world over is a thing of the survival of the fittest generally. Unlike the West In our own democratical setting we have individuals that are bigger than institutions and that's why you could see these so-called politicians publicly make certain statements why fear of what the law could do to them cause in practice they are above the law by the status they posses in the society, and the institutions is just but a barking dog with no teeths except for when it comes to the average Nigerian citizen.Take for instance the ongoing case of Hunter Biden invasion of tax, as currently he's been prosecuted by the law despite his father being the sitting president of the USA https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna90144&ved=2ahUKEwj8hbnL6NT_AhXPSsAKHd52CLAQ0PADKAB6BAgQEAE&usg=AOvVaw2I7ls3GrDhPi_KHqUo7NKMDo you think such can happen to even the distant relative of the president Nigeria not to talk of his own son. The law and it's institutions would blatantly give a blind eye and sweep the matter under the carpet for it to die a natural death.  So in all am saying it's that political affair is not a thing of the survival of the fittest as there is a difference between what ought to be and what it is.",
