  "content": "Hi there, Alex's readers! Today I’m back to continue with the analysis of the project in the Fan Token category - LAZIO. In the previous article, I explained about Smart Money - a smart cash flow that has a strong influence on the price of tokens. The transactions of the Smart Money wallet cluster are mainly supposed to coordinate and affect the token price by buy/sell orders, so the characteristics of this wallet cluster are the high asset value (nearly 2M USD in total), the large number of tokens held (nearly 17K tokens) and especially the huge number of trading orders (up to nearly 80K transactions).https://i.imgur.com/jm6DGD8.jpgIn this article, I will delve into a type of cash flow that also affects the price of tokens, which is the cash flow from Sharks-Whales wallet clusters. Unlike the Smart Money wallet cluster, the main purpose of Sharks-Whales is to invest/speculate and make profit. Therefore,  Sharks-Whales usually do not trade too much. Instead, they invest in tokens when they see their potential. They can hold for a long time and only sell when they have achieved their goals of profit. Let’s take a look back in the chart showing the buying/selling amount of Smart Money in the previous article, every time Smart Money executes a lot of buy and sell orders simultaneously, the token price suddenly increases very high. Compared to the chart showing the buying/selling amount the of Sharks-Whales, it is noticeable that  Sharks-Whales only buy after the token price has dropped sharply,  and sell as soon as the token price spikes:  https://i.imgur.com/4bU1ECQ.jpgIn financial markets, it is pivotal for investors to study the signs and behaviors of large cash flows in order to seize opportunities and minimize investment risks, which is especially true for beginner or retail investors.By using TokFlow AI, I compile a list of LAZIO's Shark-wallets: https://i.imgur.com/Ub3MN5u.pngFrom the dashboard above, we have specific information of the Shark wallet list such as wallet name, total number of transactions, number of tokens they hold and the percentage of profit/loss of each wallet. It can be assessed that LAZIO does not attract too many Sharks-Whales to invest, as of now in October 2022, only 8 Shark wallets are holding LAZIO tokens and Shark's investment volume is also quite small. Of the 8 Shark wallets, only 2 are profitable, the rest are at negative profits. As I check the Shark07b0 wallet which holds the largest number of LAZIO tokens, there are only 4 transactions. https://i.imgur.com/fMrYT9l.pngIn the chart on the right, we can track BUY/SELL transactions of Shark07b0 wallet at each price range, the most recent activity is the BUY order on 25 Sep 2022. For more details on the transactions of this wallet, I check the Transaction History dashboard:  https://i.imgur.com/yubZnj6.pngOn 25 September 2022, this wallet made 3 buy orders and 1 sell order. So I continue to go deeper to check the details of each transaction. The total volume for 3 consecutive buy orders of this Shark wallet is 1003 LAZIO tokens and there was a very small sell order execution worth only $21: https://i.imgur.com/YVWQ6mj.jpgWith an average buying price of around 7.3 and with LAZIO's current price of 4.88, this Shark07b0 wallet is losing 34%.https://i.imgur.com/Zjc8HpA.pngAfter checking the remaining Shark wallets, I can come to a conclusion that these wallets share the same feature when spending a very small amount of money to buy LAZIO tokens (several thousand dollars) and executing test sales orders soon after that.In comparison with other wallet clusters, it is interesting to note that 87.64% of the tokens are still in Dev & Funds wallets. There are even fewer tokens in Sharks-Whales wallets (0.11%) than in Retail Investors (0.14%), and Smart Money wallets only own 0.01% of LAZIO tokens.https://i.imgur.com/DmPidT0.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/ycqR6Xk.jpg It can be seen that for this project, the Sharks-Whales have only taken a bite of the pie just to test and investigate. Still, they are expecting a better price and show no sign of accumulation desires at this time. So, if you are an investor who is interested in the LAZIO token, how will you make your mind up?
