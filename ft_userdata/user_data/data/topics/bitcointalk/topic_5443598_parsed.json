Then you might want to explain how exactly this has a fair lauch? I mean what do you mean about it because it has sure gone trough inflation of meaning. So maybe explain it by comparing to projects that don't have fair launch. Another buzz term is \"organic growth\". What steps exactly have you taken to achieve that?Game itself doesn't look bad, but it isn't looking pro either. And with these days standards, if you want to build fps what people will play it needs to work really smoothly or it needs at least original idea. From your trailer i am not getting either. It seems quite generic and i can't figure out why that was worth posting. I am guessing you wanted to show that you have something. Hopefully it was alpha stage or something, still, why post alpha footage if it's not ground breaking.",

Have you considered collaborating with existing gaming projects or leveraging strategic partnerships to gain credibility and access to a wider audience? Simply relying on a fair launch and organic growth might not be enough to compete in such a competitive landscape.Thank you for your valuable insight! We completely understand the challenges of securing funding from gaming companies, especially in a competitive market with established partnerships and loyal user bases. We have explored various strategies to gain credibility and access a wider audience.Collaborating with existing gaming projects and forging strategic partnerships is one avenue we are actively pursuing. By joining forces with like-minded developers and leveraging their expertise and resources, we aim to enhance the visibility and credibility of our game, R.O.W. We believe such collaborations can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes, allowing us to tap into new audiences and generate more interest in our project.While I acknowledge that a fair launch and organic growth have limitations, we have been proactive in reaching out to potential partners and exploring avenues for collaboration. Our ongoing efforts include the Steam platform to list our game, and we are eagerly awaiting their response. Additionally, we are working on providing a demo to Epic, which has the potential to generate significant funding and further support the development of R.O.W.Throughout this journey, I have been personally funding the project. I also have to express my gratitude to Shoaib, who has been the most significant contributor to the development of R.O.W. His support has been invaluable in bringing our vision to life.We remain committed to exploring all possible avenues for funding and growth, recognizing the need to establish credibility and access wider audiences. By combining our resources, strategic partnerships, and the support of gaming communities, we are confident in our ability to make R.O.W. a success.Again, Thank you for your thoughtful comment, and I appreciate your suggestions as we navigate the competitive gaming landscape.",

We appreciate your insights and wanted to share more about our plans for creating a fair and engaging gaming experience.Our goal is to build a strong community and provide equal opportunities for all players. With the release of our game, we will introduce the Infinity Realm (iRem) token as the in-game economy. This token will enable players to engage in token-based wagering, where the winner takes all. By implementing this system, we aim to foster a competitive environment where players have the chance to earn rewards based on their skills and strategies.In addition to the wagering system, we are actively working on implementing a trading system within the game. This will allow players to engage in player-to-player transactions, including the buying and selling of crafted items. We believe that enabling a player-driven economy will enhance the overall experience and provide opportunities for players to benefit from their in-game achievements.To ensure fairness and accessibility, our game will be completely free to play. We have opted not to sell anything as a company within the game, as we want to avoid creating any imbalances or advantages based on monetary transactions. Instead, we have implemented a tax on the Infinity Realm token to support the game's ongoing development and maintenance.We understand the importance of attracting players to our platform and creating a preferred gaming destination. By offering a comprehensive player-to-player ecosystem and fostering a competitive environment, we aim to cultivate a strong community of passionate gamers who are drawn to the unique features and fairness of our game.We appreciate your support and encouragement as we navigate the competitive gaming landscape. Our team is committed to delivering an immersive and rewarding gaming experience, and we are excited about the potential of our player-driven ecosystem powered by the Infinity Realm token. Thank you for your well wishes, and we hope to exceed your expectations in the future.",

Hopefully it was alpha stage or something, still, why post alpha footage if it's not ground breaking.Thank you for your feedback and observations. We appreciate your insights and would like to address your concerns regarding our token launch, organic growth strategy, and the current state of our game.Firstly, I apologize for any confusion regarding the terminology. You are correct that the token is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and follows the BEP-20 standard, which is under the Binance blockchain but not the Binance exchange, the exchange that we are under is Pancakeswap, a smaller exchange.Regarding the fair launch, I meant that we did not conduct a private sale or go through any launch pad platform to raise funds. Our intention was to provide equal opportunities for everyone to participate from the beginning, without any pre-sales or preferential treatment. However, I acknowledge that the term \"fair launch\" has been used in various contexts, and I apologize for any confusion caused by its meaning. You can compare it to projects that may have employed private sales strategies to provide a clearer understanding.In terms of organic growth, our focus has been on utilizing social media platforms, blog posts, articles, and word of mouth to raise awareness about our token. We have actively maintained a presence on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Medium, and other channels to engage with the community and share updates about our project. While we understand the importance of advertising, we have chosen to prioritize organic growth at this stage since the game development is being funded by me personally. We have considered the cost implications and are exploring cost-effective strategies to maximize our reach and impact within our means.Regarding the game itself, it is currently in the alpha stage of development. I understand your feedback about the visuals and the need for smooth gameplay or original ideas to stand out in the highly competitive FPS genre, and I appreciate your honest assessment and understand the importance of delivering a polished and unique experience. We are continuously working on improving the game and incorporating innovative elements to make it more captivating and enjoyable for players. I appreciate your understanding that the game's current state may not fully represent its final form.I value your feedback as it helps us identify areas for improvement and refine our approach. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality game that meets players' expectations. While funding limitations may pose challenges, we are actively exploring various avenues to secure the necessary resources and enhance the game's development. We believe that we can achieve the desired level of excellence with time and dedication.Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback and sharing your thoughts. I appreciate your support and understanding as we work towards realizing our vision for the game.",
