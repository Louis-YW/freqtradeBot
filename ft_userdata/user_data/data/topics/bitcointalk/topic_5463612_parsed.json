  "content": "Hello all,I am looking for a bitcoin lottery miner. I like the idea of mining Bitcoin but I can't afford to buy big machines because they make too much noise and take up a lot of space. The idea is to find a small bitcoin miner that is cheap (less than $1000), doesn't make noise, and still has a chance of mining a block even if that chance is low. A bit like a kind of lottery game that gives you a very small chance of winning among millions of combinations.I will then let this little miner mine for life in a corner and who knows, maybe one day he will mine a block.I exclude USB miners because it will require a computer and I do not prefer to leave it on 24/24 for security reasons.Anyone have any idea on something reliable in these criteria?Thanks!",

I think that when preparing the place it will be completely safe and not consume a lot of electricity, but your chances are also minimal. But any device is not eternal.",

For example, HeatBit currently only support NiceHash.True, with a but. There are a lot of videos showing the disassembly of it.They are just S9 units in a custom case with a custom fan assembly looped through a custom wireless bridge. You can flash other firmware and a few other things to get out of their NH only setup.I really would not want to, but it is always an option. Probably should have mentioned that in the reply I made.The other option for lottery mining is also really old miners. With a little looking you can find MANY generation out units at places like thrift stores and pawn shops and such for less then the scrap metal value at this point.I picked up a pair of S7 units this spring for $5. The boards and aluminum heat-sinks were worth more then that. Put together a complete one from the both of them. Scrapped the other and have a 4th unit when running on low power just about silent mode. Unlike the S9 mod I mentioned before these would be cheaper to buy money wise but take more time in hunting one down.-Dave",

I am seeing this for the first time and love the idea. I love the ideology behind it but I am really not sure about the calculations that they have shown on the website. They are claiming that over the period of one year one Heatbit device can generate up to $980 that is just insane and doesn't add up with the mining profitability calculator.According to CoinWarz, the current profitability can only happen if we have over 100 TH/s of hashing rate with average electricity rate of around $3.00The device only produces 10 TH/s of energy and cost around 300 USD. It would take forever to get my ROI with this type of device. Either they need to upgrade the Mining Chip to Hi-end processing power or this idea or device is just cool for project purpose. Though HeatBit is considering the average price of three years, I highly doubt we have profits. We do not know the future of Bitcoin. It's volatility can either bless you or take everything away from you.",

Not that old so you can visit that thread and see other people's comments about the product. I guess you can argue that it is one of the lottery miner products, although from their advertisement they don't seem to think that way. You should not expect consistent profit from a product like this, stick to the old and tested ASIC or other mining rigs if that's what you're looking for imo.",
