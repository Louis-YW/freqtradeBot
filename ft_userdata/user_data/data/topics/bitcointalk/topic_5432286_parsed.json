  "content": "Most influencial leaders areNot Putin not anyone from eu.We take consideritaion also the heritage and DNA Nr 1 Are Biden trump Bush Clinton.Then then John Kerry.The other leaders are never gona be their level.Probably the Biden and trump are strongest country who have Trump and Biden as leaders then the this countries are lucky trump is like men also not snowflake.So the weakest Are definately canada trudeau and all UK leaders Also macron not strong likely Same like Putin and zelensky.Experts have. Not find Also from Australia the strong leader.Also the xpingÂ  not strong.Mostly who i say not strong means they got no special dna the accident pharonic bloodline wich makes strongest leaders.Also no any of those leaders from latin america right now we have just Biden and trump the Biden Are smart but trump Are strong.But RIGHT now probably the best leader are Biden in the world Even pope respect Biden.Probably Biden are the world leader not just the USA leader.Also the Putin cant do nothing until Biden Are alive second person who Putin listen Are trump but trump .Our world will not go in war until Biden and trump Lead world Also If Bushi and Clinton Are strong ones",
