      "body": "First of all thanks to @Husires for maintaining thread for last few years. It was very useful. Haven't checked this topic for some time and I surprised to see quite a lot decentralised processors. Nothing wrong with BTCPay Server, but it's always good to have more than one option. Maybe there is members who use one of these gateways? It would be interesting to hear pros and cons of it.",

It has an autoconversion feature and it claims it doesn't ask for KYC stuff.",

Total cost to use perhaps?There is a lot of DYOR for people but having a bit more information here might help.Also, I made this post a while ago: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5366008Another column that lists the last known % away from the average BTC might be good. Having a 1% fee is fine but if their rates suck that bad you will loose customers.-Dave",

I just made some changes to the list:- Removed BTC-Cashier from the list since the source code hasn't been updated since 2018.- Removed both Globee and Savvy as they're both not working anymore.- Took off the \"lightning support\" column and replaced it with the lightning symbol. This should make it easier to spot.- Added \"integrations\" column which now includes all of the supported plugins/integrations of a processor.And I will be adding the processors suggested and some new ones soon.

For now, they seem quite \"guilty\" because we have not heard an official explanation from their side.Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5510461.0",
