Some time ago I was mining vectoreum and only my CPU managed to mine 1 coin 1 day.It's not worth burning a cpu for so little gain. my cpu is an 8th generation intel i5. I anticipate that this coin is not profitable for small miners. there are large miners who reach 4 MH that is unfair for those of us who do not have a mining farm.",
