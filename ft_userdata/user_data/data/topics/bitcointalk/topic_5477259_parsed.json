Why risk your money when you are getting it for free? Just spend it and get more when you run out. Sounds like the american dream. Federal agencies denied knowledge of such a scheme and Lamb offered no evidence to support his claim on X, formerly known as Twitter.There must be some truth to this story.  Federal agencies are not going to come out and admit something like that so that's no big surprise...",

It sounds rather about immigration politics, instead of the advantages and disadvantages the traditional backing system has when compared to decentralized assets. Also, I would not be surprised if there is indeed some giveaway of gift cards for those who cross the border, so they can afford some food after a very long travel across the continent, but this news makes it sound as if each immigrant is getting that amount of money in GCs, which sounds quite unreal, keeping in mind the huge amount of immigrants who enter the southern border of the United States. We would be talking about billions of dollars. I believe.",

QuoteAlso, I would not be surprised if there is indeed some giveaway of gift cards for those who cross the border, so they can afford some food after a very long travel across the continent,the government should just be honest about what exactly they are providing. but they aren't being transparent. that's the issue.Quote but this news makes it sound as if each immigrant is getting that amount of money in GCs, which sounds quite unreal, keeping in mind the huge amount of immigrants who enter the southern border of the United States. it's just a rumor from one person but the government didn't deny it. but i would estimate the cost of each migrant to be far greater than just $5000 to this country. it's probably more like $100,000 over a few years. maybe even more. QuoteWe would be talking about billions of dollars. I believe. not just billions but maybe even trillions eventually. tens of trillions even hundreds of trillions.",

Even if some small percentage of them managed to get naturalized or got permanent residence within the United States, it would be such a slow process for them that Biden will be likely retired before it happens. It is the typical conspiracy theory about democrats using immigrants to carry out election fraud.",

Federal agencies denied knowledge of such a scheme and Lamb offered no evidence to support his claim on X, formerly known as Twitter.There's no connection between Bitcoin and giving rewards to migrants, the former is a valued digital asset, while the latter, if it's proven true that migrants where given $5000 gift cards, will be purely politically motivated. So what happens to those of us that have Bitcoin, and can not migrate to the US, and be eligible for this purpoted offer? Bitcoin is far more valuable than any short term reward, it can guarantee the holder a more profitable future.For someone who's running for a highly placed office like the Senate, Mr. Lamb, should have had evidence before making allegations, I think that this is a minus for him. We need leaders that backs up their claims with facts, not acting on heresay.",

No, actually it does not make sense to me. Even if Democrats are trying to do something like that you describe, there would be a rain of lawsuits against the party issued by Republicans, because that stuff you are saying is simply against the constitution of the United States of America, only citizens can vote for their president. (Ironically the United States has come annexed territories in Samoa and in the Caribbean, where people are American citizens and yet they cannot vote). If Democrats wanted to change the outcome of elections by that scheme you are describing, why would they be sent to big cities where democrats already have enough votes to win locally anyways? Would not be more productive for their plans to send those immigrants to rural areas in read states where their alledged illegal votes would come handy to win those electoral collegues?",

Don’t be too sure about that. Non-citizens are already voting in local elections in 15 U.S. jurisdictions, and the Biden card opens more avenues for mischief, or at least confusion, at polling places. this was over a year ago. just imagine what it's like now.
