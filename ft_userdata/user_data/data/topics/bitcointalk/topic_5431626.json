  "content": "Hello!! I have developed, at the theoretical level, a protocol (would be a dApp) to boost Bitcoin adoption for every day use, by everyone.But, I completely lack the knowledge on where even to start looking in order to learn what I need to know to make at least a proof of concept of this protocol.What I do fully understand:- I understand the core concept of Bitcoin, I have read the white paper thoroughly, and I'm a programmer (Python and C#). I also understand very well the economics involved and the whole concept, which is the reason I'm a committed supporter of the adoption of bitcoin as currency.- I understand I'm going to have to vinculate many complex tools to get the different components of the protocol (which are each a world by themselves), and I understand that even getting them to work together is going to be a challenge in itself.So I'm fully aware that there is no shortcut here, no \"for dummies\" version, this could take up more than a year to even get the PoC, and that at the end all this might very well end up being way above my IQ. I'm fully aware of my ignorance and the size and high level of the technical complexity implied.What I'm humbly asking for:- Can you please guide me on at least part of what I need to put together to get this done and where can I start learning about it?I'm obviously not asking for the full package, but my aim is to try to put together whatever answers I might get, start from there, fill in the blancs, and see where I can go.I'm deeply thankful in advance for any answer, I understand that this is a crowded and vibrant ecosystem so I really appreciate the time anyone gives.This is the protocol (it was moved to \"Altcoin Discussion\" because it mentions an altcoin in it to illustrate part of the concept, but it haves nothing to do with any altcoin, it proposes no new altcoin nor anything alike, this is just pure Bitcoin):https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5390178.0",

And such system must be according to the Bitcoin ideals so that it's safely Interoperable with Bitcoin or existing more like compatible Lego you can plug into the Bitcoin building/foundation to exchange data.

Thank you for this input I think that what you are proposing will tend to evolve naturally from the \"metaverse\"/\"web3\" ecosystems, isn't?Before we reach that point, by now, I'm aiming to \"the streets\", to say. \"Parallel Nations\", in strongly regulated (socialist) countries (like mine), are essentially what \"non official markets\" are. I'm avoiding the term \"black market\" because it haves a negative connotation in first world countries, but in socialist countries \"black markets\" are the \"good markets\". Nothing illegal goes there except that the exchanges are not subjected to government oppression in it's many forms (inflation, taxation, confiscation, banning, limitation, segregation, racketeering, lobby, etc).So we already have this self-sustaining systems up and running on the streets as a means of survival (the culture started after the 2001 national crisis, when the first full parallel economy spontaneously grew). The only eternal problem is the currency, which is still limited to the national currency for the vast majority of the population. To make bitcoin a viable currency, there has to be a way to deal with it's volatility, to allow mass adoption. The protocol I'm pointing to proposes a solution, which do not implies to try to control bitcoin's price.If you could take a look at it, I would really appreciate it",

The protocol I'm pointing to proposes a solution, which do not implies to try to control bitcoin's price.If you could take a look at it, I would really appreciate it Sorry for the late reply @didIplaywell. I actually want something that's built wholly for Bitcoin system with bitcoin serving as it's main native currency. You could eventually include other foreign currencies/crypto in the future. I don't really fancy the web3/metaverse things that much as they could be built on ideals (like consensus mechanism) I find unsafe for regular usage.In regards to the bolded, you could check out one of my solutions to the volatility issue you raised. You can go through my other post before this.Bitcoin will be a good alternative currency in such parallel state, especially when the need arises like during a national/global dictatorship, tyranny, choas or economic crisis. Tyrants will try to impose their will on parallel state as they could be seen as a threat... A good mobile or nomadic state that uses Bitcoin will be hard to control",

The temporal usage of a stablecoin is to allow, simultaneously, for people to transition from fiat to bitcoin, and to make that transition smooth for the average citizen (while investors will withstand the brunt of the volatility).",

      "body": "I read from an online source that in order to implement a protocol to boost Bitcoin usage you need to:QuoteSome of the key technologies that you'll need to learn about include:Bitcoin Script: A programming language used to create Bitcoin smart contracts.Bitcoin Core: The reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.Bitcoin Wallet: A software application that allows users to manage their bitcoin transactions and addresses.Bitcoin Payment Protocol (BIP 70-73): A set of standards for securing bitcoin payments.Bitcoin Network: The peer-to-peer network that enables bitcoin transactions.Bitcoin Mining: The process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are verified.Bitcoin Scripting: A set of scripts used to create Bitcoin smart contracts.For learning these technologies, you can start by studying the Bitcoin Core documentation, the Bitcoin Script documentation, and the Bitcoin Wiki. Additionally, you can find a lot of resources in the Bitcoin Development community, such as Bitcoin.org, BitcoinTalk, and Bitcoin StackExchange.It's important to note that creating a PoC of a complex protocol like the one you described is a significant undertaking, and it will likely take a lot of time and effort to complete. It's also important to be realistic about your abilities and be willing to seek help when necessary.I hope this information helps you to get started. I hope it helps and just disregard it if it didn't",

I think it's worth the try Thank you again!!",
