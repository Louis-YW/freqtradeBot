  "content": "Karabakh donkey, or some    Nature's mistakes        Molla Nasreddin had a donkey that could read, albeit silently, however, like most people. In Azerbaijan, to emphasize the special intellectual abilities of someone, the expression \"Karabakh donkey\" is used. I want to make a reservation right away that the word donkey in translation from Azerbaijani is a donkey. Whatever it was, but this species of artiodactyls, which include horses, has been in close contact with humans since ancient times, which apparently explains the unique ability of Molla Nasreddin's parting companion. A lot of time has passed since then, and today some representatives of the order of equids have learned not only to read, but also to think, and putting them into words. Therefore, there is nothing surprising in the fact that a donkey, in our case a horse, which does not matter for this species, possessing such a gift, ended up in an important position in the Russian government as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and this, one might say, is the second-ranking post in state. So the works of Molla Nasreddin, who taught the donkey to read, were not in vain. By the way, this fact once again confirms the accuracy of such a science as genetics. It is not for nothing that the hereditary signs of a equid-hoofed animal can be clearly seen in the photograph of the minister.      The other day, this minister once again showed what heights a horse can reach in thinking ability. This is me to the fact that the Russian Foreign Minister found the hereditary origin of Hitler, discovering Jewish roots in him, which caused a stir in Israel. The international scandal that has flared up now threatens to break the political relations of the Kremlin with the Jewish state, which until now has remained neutral on the issue of anti-Russian sanctions by the West. It seems that the horse, having learned to talk, did not learn that not all thoughts, and even more so doubtful ones, should be said aloud, in such a position as the Minister of Foreign Affairs.   05.05.2022",
