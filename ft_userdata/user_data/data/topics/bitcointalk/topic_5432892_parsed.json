  "content": "While I was browsing around Twitter I ended up finding quite exciting news[1] being shared by @SamouraiDev[2] (a developer working at Samourai):QuoteWe are pleased to announce the release by Straylight of their Whirlpool ðŸŒ€ðŸŒ€ðŸŒ€ client library (FOSS, coded in Rust). - https://github.com/straylight-orbit/whirlpool-client-rsIf you're wondering who's Straylight, he/she recently implemented BIP47 in Rust[3]. Also, like the developer says, this library went through many validations with Samourai Wallet Whirpool coordinators and it's safe to say that it can be used with other Bitcoin project that are also coded in Rust. Does anyone have any idea of what projects might benefit from this library that you might have been following? I've been browsing for a while but haven't find anything very informative as of now ... The fact that the project is FOSS is already great news as it brings transparency that many will see as vital for future implementations of this library ...

      "body": "Looks interesting, but as ETFbitcoin pointed out you really have to search to find a wallet written in rust. I like that people are developing everything in every language so that if for some reason we all have to shift to wallets written in something else they are there. Cannot think of a reason off the top of my head but there mat be one someday.However, my concern is that if less people use it, there are less eyes on it so even though it has been through many validations with Samourai Wallet Whirpool coordinators, things might still be there that people missed. But still good.-Dave",

Cloudhead's Nakamoto is a bitcoin light wallet implemented in Rust. The developer refers to it as a privacy preserving client. I don't know anything about it, but I managed to find it after a quick search.Here is some more info:https://cloudhead.io/nakamoto/https://github.com/cloudhead/nakamoto",
