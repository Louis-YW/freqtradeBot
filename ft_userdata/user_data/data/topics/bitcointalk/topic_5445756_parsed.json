They add a passphrase.Some robber steals their backup words ( 24 seed words )The robber goes home, and creates a new wallet with his own new hardware wallet ( it gives him the option to recover using the 24 words )The robber enters the victim's 24 words... therefore recovering the victim's wallet..... so what I am wondering is... can the victim still enter the 24 words into a new wallet, AND enter the passphrase to recover the funds on the passphrase wallet?or, when the robber entered the 24 words, does that make the wallet, and passphrase wallet, unaccessable?Thanks for the help!",

      "body": "There's some confusing terminology that might or might not protect you in this case. Your seed is composed out of 12 or 24 seed words (usually). Allmost all hardware and software wallet vendors give you the opportunity to encrypt your master private key which gets derived out of these 12 or 24 words.If with \"passphrase\" you mean such an encryption password, the hacker can steal your funds even without knowing your passphrase, since the passphrase was only used to encrypt the master private key, but the hacker can just derive said unencrypted master private key if he has your 12 or 24 words... In this case, you are not safe at all!!! If he physically steals your hardware wallet, the code might or might not protect you for a while (at least, untill the attacker bruteforces your code, which is sometimes not as easy as it sounds).Some hardware vendors also offer to add a 13th or 25th word to your seed (extend your key with an extra word). In this case, if a hacker steals your seed, he'll also have to brute force this 13th (or 25th) word before he can derive your master private key. In this case, you're better off, but certainly NOT as safe as without having your key compromised. The hacker just has to brute force one word, which is plausible... On top of this 25th word, the vendor usually asks you to also add a pincode (or password), this password (or pincode) has the same function as the first part of this reply (just encrypting the master private key...).If the hacker steals your physical device, he'll have to bruteforce the password encrypting your mpk AND bruteforce the 13th (or 25th) word... It'll take him longer, but i personally wouldn't rest comfortably before my funds were moved to a new (clean) wallet.",

Take note that you should move the fund from that wallet to a new wallet with a new seed phrase as soon as possible. With your seed phrase being compromised, your wallet isn't as secure as before, especially if you have used a weak passphrase. It's possible that the thief can brute-force the passphrase and access the fund.",

But it is good to use a strong passhrase that would be difficult to brute force.The possibility of brute force is the main problem here. If your seed is compromised you should move your coins as fast as possible. The passphrase can give you the time that is necessary to do that. If you dont move your coins then your password can be brute forced now or in a few month. You can never know and will loose your coins at some point.",

You have an additional hidden wallet which uses this seed phrase along with a weak passphrase. You passphrase might be a single word, or just a couple of characters, or something related to you personally such as your name or birthday or whatever. An attacker could either guess your passphrase or simply bruteforce it. There is plenty of software which will allow an attacker to attempt millions of possible passphrases a second and check the corresponding wallets for funds.For that reason, you should ensure any passphrase you do use is strong enough to protect your wallet on its own, in the event that your seed phrase is compromised. This usually means either a long and random string of characters and symbols as might be generated by a good password manager, or a further string of words not dissimilar to your seed phrase itself. Your passphrase should also obviously be backed up on paper separately to your seed phrase. And as soon as an attacker has your seed phrase, you should consider your passphrased wallets at risk, and move all the coins within to a new seed phrase +/- passphrase.",

A sample is by placing your paper backup in a vault. Everything is possible even if you have a strong passphrase there is still a chance that it can be brute-force since the technology is developing and maybe in the future hackers can develop a tool that is faster than the previous brute-force tool. So the very important thing you need to do is to save the seed phrase in a safe and secure location so that no one can able to steal it and you're the only one who can protect it from theft.",

A 12 word BIP39 seed phrase provides 128 bits of entropy. Since a private key provides 128 bits of security, a 12 word seed phrase is enough. If you want to have more security, you can add a passphrase and keep it is a separate safe place. In this way, even if someone steals your seed phrase can't steal your fund, unless your passphrase is weak and can brute-forced. If you make a 2 of 2 multi-signature wallet and you keep your seed phrases in separate places, both of seed phrases are required for accessing the fund.This would provide a same security as a wallet with a seed phrase extended by a passphrase (assuming the passphrase is kept in a separate place, it's chosen completely random and provides enough entropy.)",

That device therefore becomes a single point of failure, and if that device is compromised, then I lose everything. With a multi-sig wallet with a threshold number of signers of 2 or more, then I can recover each signing wallet to a different device, and pass partially signed transactions between these devices to be signed by each device individually. This means that if one device is compromised, my coins remain safe.In terms of backing up, then it depends on the exact multi-sig numbers you are using. A 2-of-3 multi-sig for example will be more resistant to loss than a seed phrase/passphrase combination (which requires 2 of 2 back ups to restore), but will equally be more vulnerable to being discovered (since you require 3 separate back ups instead of just 2 (or ideally 6 instead of 4)).",

Not keeping everything in the same wallet is a good start.Having a seed phrase with multiple different passphrases is one option, as you say. This can provide some plausible deniability as you can split your coins across the multiple passphrases (making sure that there is also no blockchain link between these wallets). You need to have the seed phrase and each passphrase all backed up separately. You could also have one or more multi-sig wallets, but each multi-sig also requires multiple separate back ups and some people can struggle to find multiple separate safe locations for these back ups.",
