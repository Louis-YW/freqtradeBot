  "content": "Hi Guys,Decided to try out a new website called Rollbit for gambling. I deposited around 12,000 USD of tether and I want to bet on soccer games. I first placed a 1000 USD bet on a soccer game and won 800USD. I then tried to place a bet on another soccer game for around 5000 USD but it said that the max i could place on that game was only 200usd which was odd. Soo i decided to withdrawal all my money (around 12,800 USD )After 24 hours my withdrawal did not arrive so I messaged support who asked me to do KYC. Once I done the KYC, I was messaged by someone called RAZOR who said they wanted to do a video call with me. I said I was ready to do a video call straight away and they said they could do not it then that i should wait till Monday. On Monday, I message Razor to do the video call and got no reply. The same again on Tuesday, no reply from them. I message support and they say that I just need to wait for the relevant person to contact me but its been 3 days?Can anyone give a suggestion on what is going on or best way to escalate this. Their site and platform seems good so I would have imagined this is something that they would be able to resolve very quickly? Seems odd they would request a video call and then suddenly just disappear and not respond to any of my requests to sort it outThanks Guys - appreciate all the support on this and can anyone let me know if they have had the same experience?!!",

You could also inquire about the best way to escalate the issue if you still don't receive a response. The link is given above the ANN thread and the forum representative is also the best way to reach out to them. However, it is important to remain patient and courteous when dealing with customer support. They are likely doing their best to resolve your issue as quickly as possible, and getting angry or frustrated with them won't help the situation.",

I really do not think they have forgotten about handling your case but if I may ask did you use VPN while login into your account?. Nevertheless was the amount you tried withdrawing above the maximum daily withdrawal?I would advise you be patient with them while you try sending their representative here message as you have been given by a member here. Drop a message with the representative and also drop a comment on their announcement thread together with the link to this thread there so they could give you maximum attention to resolving your complaints speedily.",

They are here for how many years building up their reputation and I don't think they will scam you. For now, try to contact them again and patiently wait for the result --while waiting try to read again the terms of the withdrawal, perhaps you are suspecting money laundering since you withdraw it after 1 bet.

Little did they know that you would come here and make a complaint...and because you have, they will either concoct a good story saying you violated their terms of service, or, cave and pay you out when they start to see the thread. That's my opinion based on other issues I've read with casinos. I wish you all the best in getting your withdrawal.",

In TaC rollbit, there is no clear definition of the terms and conditions for withdrawal of funds, however, the FAQ says that the condition for withdrawal is a deposit of at least $10 and wager $10 in the same place for withdrawal of funds it says that withdrawals in rare cases can be postponed, but this is solved very quickly. The only thing that I do not understand what exactly is being discussed in the TaC for a period of 14 days is with regard to the refund of funds when the order is canceled. Try contacting someone from support in their discord channel https://discord.gg/Mwx3zqH , there is a senior support and assistants.Quote from: https://rollbit.com/faqQuote from: https://rollbit.com/terms-and-conditions",
