  "content": "As Tether (USDT) was founded in 2014 it was pegged to a phisical USD (nearly) 1 to 1. You gave them 1 USD and they stored the USD. If you would give them back the USDT you would get 1 USD back and the USDT token would be burned. But suprise: The USDT is still existing, traded, and for the future there is no guarantee that you get your USD back.Tether Ltd. is in personal identity with BITFINEX (Paradise Papers) a 2014 founded company who was nothing more than a ponzi scheme, which was runned by child predators, fraudsters and poker god-mode givers. USDT as backbone of the global crypto lquidity you have to understand and be aware that Tether is since 8 years unaudited and is just pegged to USD in a ratio of 1 USDT to ~0,03 USD. Tether Ltd. basically loaned their insolvent \"parent comany\" and changed their USD-USTD-pegging to an USDT-\"reserves\"-pegging secretly. Now Tether is nothing more than a money printer creating money from thin air.In the last days with the SBF investigations, indypendent investigators realized that Tether Ltd. on the Bahamas is just a \"mail company\" with empty office buildings.So this is a warning: Do not hold large amounts of USDT or you will lose nearly everything!Additional video informaton:- Coffeezilla: https://youtu.be/-whuXHSL1Pg- Bitboy Crypto: https://youtu.be/9Nl5r2Txs88- Coindesk: https://youtu.be/ilJs8s1S_mU- ClearValue Tax: https://youtu.be/2TKGgMLHL64Additional text information:- coingeek: https://coingeek.com/even-binance-thinks-the-tether-stablecoin-is-an-unbacked-scam/- Blockworks: https://blockworks.co/news/tether-fraud-investigation-gets-new-leader-bloomberg- Coindesk: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/31/us-tether-bank-fraud-investigation-changes-hands-within-the-doj-report/- Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tetherThank you for your attention!Roland Ionas Bialke",

Nevertheless, is has the potential to become something big, assuming the right management. First, this stablecoin has the highest transaction volume to market cap ratio - meaning it is used for daily transactions, and payments, including cross-border transfers. We have done some research on it here https://www.observers.com/zoom-in-on-stablecoins/ If people find it convenient, that is the best property for money. Money is a social construct.They work on transparency issues as well. They have issued an audited reserve report. https://www.observers.com/tether-new-attestation-of-reserves/ It is still not a full financial statement and the auditor is not from Big4. Further, the auditors are from the hometown of Tether CFO. But it is better than nothing.",

But suprise: The USDT is still existing, traded, and for the future there is no guarantee that you get your USD back.Well i think there are discussions about USDT not being backed 1:1 by real USD anymore since at least a few years now because back then the company behind USDT changed the wording from \"evey USDT is backed by a real Dollar\" to \"we have enough reserves to back every USDT minted\" the big problem with this statement is, that nobody knows what kind of reserves they are having or if those reserves really exist.Recently though i heard news that Bitfinex is now more open about their reserves and that they have published something, but i did not check that myself. If USDT would crash then i think we would see a crypto crash like never before though.",

They have been speculate many years ago if I'm not mistaken and because they are not willing to open their books. But so far they are one of the most solid stable coins that we have in the market right now.I would agree if the thread is like telling people to get out of exchanges or at least don't leave huge amount of money on it. But single handedly pushing for Tether to be the next one to collapse, then maybe we will have to see what will happen in the future.",

If you want to be taken seriously, stick to the facts.There has been Tether fud as long as there has been USDT. They must be most investigated crypto firm out there. Don't you think that amount of investigation they are going trough would at some point have revealed something why officials could shut their operation down? I personally think that all this fud most likely originates from bitter bitfinex hack victims who weren't happy how Bitfinex dealed with the whole hacking scandal.",

For more free USDT transfers TRON freeze required. So the only transfer fees are some TRON crypto, which is very low price. Therefore Tether USDT is vey popular and I do not see why it can crash ?",

Tether is a centralized stablecoin backed by dollars and securities, while UST was an algorithmic stablecoin that used the LUNA peg as collateral. If Tether were to crash, the consequences would be even worse than the FTX crash, since most exchange trades are linked to Tether, if USDT crashes, bitcoin could easily drop below $10,000.",

I think Teher Ltd which is located in the Bahamas is not the original Tether Ltd but a similar company, because logically how can a company the size and magnitude of Tether Ltd be a postal company with empty office buildings? If I'm wrong it would really be a disaster. Me, I naturally do not trust any currency that is supported by central parties. Therefore, as you mentioned, we should not put all our wealth in one stablecoin, as there are many other alternatives. The BUSD is good, as it is supported by the Binance platform, But we also do not trust it completely and diversify our currencies.",
