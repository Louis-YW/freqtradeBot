  "content": "*BTC/USDT Swap â€” Bitcoin moves FIRST (ZERO Risk to Buyer) -Q1.2023*NO changes to procedure nor qualifying requirement (7m USDT wallet) will be entertained. Gross Discount: -8%*-5% NET to Buyer* Â 1. To Qualify: MUST send $20 from a USDT wallet that has MINIMUM $7m USDT with no more that 50 transactions.2. Once BTC Seller receives the $20, he will send the $20 back in BTC from transactional wallet with equivalent 7m (or more) worth in Bitcoin so the USDT swap agent can run forensics on wallet and see $7m worth of BTC in his wallet.3. Once both sides run forensics BTC will push FIRST with the comfortable amount the Seller provides a tranche schedule for.4. Rinse & Repeat steps 2 & 3 with larger subsequent tranches as per agreed upon schedule.*To Note (NON-negotiable)*Exchange walletÂ  NOT accepted- needs to be PRIVATE : trust,Â  exodus etc- less than 50 transactions- 7m in USDT must already be loaded in the wallet*Those points need to be 100% clear if not they are just sending 20 bucks that will not be entertained*",
