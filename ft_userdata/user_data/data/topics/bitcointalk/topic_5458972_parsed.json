The \"consolidation\" or generally speaking the handling of UTXOs and transactions should take place in another wallet that is online and does NOT have any private keys (only public keys/addresses) instead of your cold storage. If you try to go around this restriction (eg. manually importing UTXOs) your wallet could stop being \"cold\" (ie be considered compromised).",

Your watch-only wallet doesn't contain any private key and it can't sign transactions at all. You should use your online device (which you have your watch-only wallet on) for creating the unsigned transaction and broadcasting the singed tranaction.

If you want to send coins from your cold wallet, you simply create the necessary transaction on your watch only wallet first. Create a transaction sending coins to wherever you want, and consolidate all your other coins in to a single UTXO if you want (just be aware of the privacy implications of doing this). Use your cold wallet to sign it, and your watch only wallet to broadcast it.",

I think I understand what OP is asking.OP has two wallets.Wallet #1 is a standard hot wallet.Wallet #2 is a cold wallet with its associated watch-only wallet for the creation and broadcasting of transactions. Let's assume OP has 10 UTXOs in each wallet, so 20 in total. He is asking if he can consolidate all 20 UTXOs (belonging to two different wallets) at the same time. I have never thought about it and would be interested how that would work myself. A standard setup wouldn't allow it because his cold wallet doesn't hold the signing keys for wallet #1. Perhaps if he were to export the needed private keys from wallet #1 and import them into his cold wallet (wallet #2) it would work. But then how would he create the transaction across two different wallets on the online machine? Importing the public keys into one of the wallets and only using that wallet for the creation of the transaction? Multisig is different. @o_e_l_e_o thoughts?",

It's keys aren't going anywhere. The second wallet was already a hot wallet, so its keys were already exposed to the internet prior to this. hosseinimr93's solution effectively spends all the UTXOs from the hot wallet, consolidates the coins with those in the cold wallet, and creates a brand-new cold wallet.",

It goes without saying that you should be doing that in a private environment. Most preferably in your own home where you have some privacy. Working with private keys is not something you should be doing on a shared computer or in a public space. I would, of course, avoid using a phone when out and about as well.",
