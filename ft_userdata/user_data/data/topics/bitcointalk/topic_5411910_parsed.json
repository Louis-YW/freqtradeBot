It's frustrating and tiring to watch the market almost everyday just to know if there's an improvement of the price but we should understand that during bear market you can't expect something to change in the market. You just have to hodl and wait patiently for the bull market to come.",

I wouldn't be surprised to see a drop even up to the end of the month because we are in a bear market.Although usually in December there could be significant increased but nothing spectacular. Nevertheless, as you have said, we should just expect the unexpected and let this year ride all throughout with a good risk management. I guess for the majority, the risk is nothing, I mean we should just hold and see how it goes in the future.",

The historical crypto winter may not be over (may take 1-3 more months) and this means a new leg down is possible (and the worse case scenario is under 10k!).2. The rainbow chart shows the price is in the low area and it's not much (if any) room for going lower.Some will go by some indicators, some will go by another, hence some will always be wrong. I find it a good time to buy, HODL and wait for the \"winter\" to get to an end.",

I started this year with a bearish perspective just like the majority of us.So we have the last quarter to proved otherwise, but I highly doubt that we will go up again. Most likely this will be the price for this year around that numbers and worst case is that we will go lower that $17,500.",

I see we are too far to end this bearish condition and it is very likely we end up this year like this. Never get excited to see a few pumps these days because later on, it drops back again. We only have two directions on whether the price of Bitcoin will pump next week or continue to reach the bottom.",

      "body": "The more people are thinking that Bitcoin is going lower to $12k-$10k zones the less likely it is to become, Remember this is exactly what happened at 69k ATH, when almost everyone was saying to the moon \"100k\"  and what happened was the opposite, Bitcoin tends to do what it wants to do at any given time, it's high time we just HODL and leave the market to do what it wants to do.Don't forget that there are a lot factors that do drive the market like the macro factor and fears etc. in terms of fears, sometimes the market makers can just create fears in the market through various ways in order to buy. However , looking at the market structure using the monthly time frame, the possibility of Bitcoin getting a retest of 12k-10k cannot be thrown away, but it still a probability which may happen or may not. In the other hands, market could equally decide to use the $17500 as reverseal point and not drop to the $12-$10k zones, and In addition to that, Remember that the four years simple moving average for Bitcoin is a the 21k.Therefore, In my general view of the market, it's mostly likely that January 2023 could decide the bottom for Bitcoin base on past histories after Bitcoin's having, bottom of the market was during the month of January if I'm not wrong.",

Perhaps they really don't understand what bear market means, or hasn't seen it before. But for us who have been here at least in 2017, have seen the worst in 2018-2020, this is just a repeat, so mostly likely this year is just the start of the bear market and might continue till 2023 or early 2024 or prior to the halving, approximately in May.So yeah, we can't do anything at every month's end so just be prepared for the worst this quarter, at the end of the month. I still remember 2018 December though, some pump before Christmas and New Year, but that's it.",

All of us already marked that dates but first, we are looking forward on what will the price be of bitcoin before we end this month of august because that will usually have an impact on the start of a new month. So, btc declined a little bit during the last minutes of august which resulted for us to see a 19k dollar in price this September.I think the bloodbath may continue for the next 2 to 3 weeks. Eth on the side can just continue on its transition from proof of work to proof of stake and that may caused a price boost on its own value which could also affect some of the altcoins and tokens but not in btc because btc is on a different line.",

That's why I was surprised to see the damage on the price near the ETH merge but I was wrong with the date. Although the market has bounce back to the $19k'ish and maybe on the 13th we may see some pump in the whole crypto because of the said merge.Quote from: adaseb on September 03, 2022, 04:05:24 AMThe CPI is important because if we get a low number then we will rally hard.

Yesterday's slump in the market indicates that we are given a good time to buy bitcoins but it looks like not many will be able to use it to buy but just keep waiting. It's great if you just keep waiting and hold on to bitcoins while waiting for the price to rise again. We want to sell bitcoin at the next high, which could be a new ATH later.",
