Just do some research and invest what you can invest. I don’t believe most of even the members that comes out to say they sold some certain properties to acquire bitcoin, I see it as just click bait or merit fishing as the forum calls it. The percentage of people that actually sold for real did that with properties that they do not use or have in numbers and with this they can do away without one. Aside this it is never advisable to sell your properties for bitcoin. Another reason people invest most of these properties into bitcoin is basically for profit and that is not enough good reason to invest in it. People feel like bitcoin wouldn’t have a low again after the halving but that is not true because based on the time even proposed for bitcoin mining to stop I think even a bitcoin worth $100k is still low considering the year since it’s inception to now and how the price grows and how many years left for that. So do not copy invest, invest what you can to because this gives you freedom to hodl for long and that is the most safest way to earn profits in bitcoin",

And it is not just restricted to only investing in bitcoin only but to other investments like stocks. Perhaps a lesson warning should be for everyone to weigh their level of risk, how much risk can they carry and from it invest in bitcoin or not. I think it is easier to invest in bitcoin when you are single than when you have a family and more responsibilities because one wrong investing mistake and you and your family may just be on the streets. Seek financial advice and before investing.",

The answer is \"No\" but we are optimistic and passionate that something good could like happen whereby bitcoin price would hit another ATH.",

Even if you are investing in Bitcoin, be sure you understand the fundamentals behind what you are doing and do not invest with the intention of making quick money.I don't think people do it to show off. Most people that invest without having an understanding of Bitcoin just want to make a profit, which is good because that is the whole idea of investing, but it's not right to just dive into something without understanding at least the basics of that thing. Most of these guys don't just want to miss out on an opportunity. It's why people easily fall for shitcoin scams and Ponzi schemes. When a person is too eager and desperate to make quick money, they'll most likely fall into the wrong hands. Quote from: Hyphen(-) on June 30, 2023, 08:40:05 PMAlways avoid borrowing money for Investments.  Actually, it depends. People borrow to start up businesses. A business can be seen as a form of investment. There are crypto traders who have people invest with them. They collect money from people, trade the money, and give the investors their share of the profit. A Very risky business, I don't advise it.  Personally (and this is not financial advice in any way), I think it is only okay to borrow for an investment when you have in-depth knowledge of that particular investment, with some experience. And even as you borrow, make sure it's something that you'll be able to land on your feet if things go wrong.",
