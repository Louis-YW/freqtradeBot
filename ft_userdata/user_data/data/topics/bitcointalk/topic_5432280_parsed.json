We can complain all we want, but we're mere pawns in this game. Well, at least there's Bitcoin. It's resistant to the kinds of abuses those powerful people up there are doing with fiat, but even Bitcoin's price reacts to how governments do their thing. So, I guess we just have to hustle hard and smart while we're still breathing. At the end of the day, we can't just tell our landlord that we can't pay the rent because of that brrrrr.",

In my opinion, they should not have gotten for 2% but try to go 0% or 0.5%. But I assume they needed that looseness.",

Similar to the Lehman crash.Then economy will be weak. People out of jobs. Fed will have to cut rates and most likely stimulus will be back again. And the entire cycle will keep repeating every few years. Might even get double digit inflation because of this.",

But I agree more that OP can be able to teach the child to make money and manage money better. Not printing via a printer like people make photos and then print them via a printer. Because printing money carelessly also has a big risk because it can be considered as counterfeit money and even in some countries if someone is caught counterfeiting money, he can be subject to crime and there are special penalties for people who do this.",

We all know the consequences are great, but we hardly have a more effective solution. But this year, they are trying to fix everything, that is raise interest rates, which also causes some pain, and the people who suffer are none other than the people.You should not compare corrupt and stupid governments like Venezuela with other governments.

These conditions are often of two distinct kinds, deprivation of food, light, etc. so leading to imperfect nutrition and enervation; the other, a life of repose, with abundant supply of food and decreased exposure to the dangers of the environment. It is noteworthy that while the former only depresses, or at most distinguishes the specific type, the latter, through the disuse of the nervous and other structures etc. which such a simplification of life involves, brings about that far more insidious and through degeneration seen in the life history of myriads of parasites.-Patrick Geddes (biologist/sociologist)I have seen the above quotation used to define negative trends of inflation in economics. Decreased exposure to dangers present with inflation and other negative economic trends, reduce the human self defense mechanisms necessary to address said trends. The regression can extend so far as to result in degeneration of organisms in nature. The same precedent might also apply to people. We lose many of our social and cultural adaptations when decreased exposure to dangers, causes us to believe them no longer necessary. Its an interesting point to consider.",
