Which surely includes people of both the types, good and bad which governments still need to work on. But in general, it's a great step. Other governments charge upto 30% tax on Crypto income and for some countries like India, it's 1% on every Crypto Transaction. Really interesting world we are in.",

It's good to hear that UAE has removed taxes, I might have to send that message to some of my friends in UAE right now so that they can invest on it. And with that, it's welcoming to hear such good news as a crypto enthusiast and it seems that the Middle East could be poised to become a crypto hub as well. And if you have to think of it, there are a lot of millionaires and billionaires around that country and who knows, maybe they will pour their wealth on the market.However, as far as UK or any other UE countries, I doubt that they will suddenly make a U-turn and allow no tax. EU will be crypto friendly, but I doubt that they will simply not taxing everything related to crypto. They will have to make money out of it.",

From the article, I got the impression that the UAE want to regulate the market more and encourage businesses to report their crypto activities, providing them with VAT exemption as an incentive to do so.I also want to point out that VAT isn't the only tax out there, so removing VAT doesn't mean there are no taxes to pay on cryptos. There's also usually income tax, but in the UAE it isn't imposed on individuals. But there's also corporate income tax which I assume applies to crypto businesses as well.",

We just hope it last long as the government sometimes do not stick to the promise or we don't really know their motive behind the removal. Well UAE is one of the most visited country by millionaires and lots of traders and I guess it's a way to attract even more investors into the country. Many other countries might not want to remove the taxes like the European countries that was mentioned by op. They have alot of reason with the taxes as they want to control the flow of money generated from crypto into the economy.",

The proposition by the government to remove taxes on cryptocurrency transactions isn't a surprise to me, and am sure that in the nearest future, if not now, crypto currency will be a renowned currency for exchange with easy rates and Bitcoin dispensing ATMs in surplus supply across locations in the UAE.",

By offering tax-free crypto transactions and profits, it's setting a strong precedent that will likely attract more investors and foster the growth of the crypto ecosystem. El Salvador’s early adoption of Bitcoin has indeed sparked interest from other nations, and it's interesting to see how other countries might respond to these trends.As for the UK and Europe, while they might miss out on some tax revenue by adopting similar policies, the long-term benefits, such as increased innovation and economic growth, could outweigh the initial losses. It will be fascinating to see how different governments balance regulation and innovation in the crypto space. Macy’s Insite",

Do you think the UK and other countries in Europe will make such a move in the near future? El Salvador is a crypto heaven but the high crime rate doesn't outweigh the pros of being crypto heaven. Crime rate is their weakest spot because this country isn't a safe place to live, so even in the case of very good opportunities and tax rates on crypto, it's hard to convince any developer or businessman to move there and live there.On the other hand, UAE looks far more attractive but the heat is unbearable there. A person from developed country like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, UK, Ireland and so on, can't live there long-term. I don't say all but most of them definitely can't last long in such a hot climate. So, this is the cons of UAE. UAE is far better choice compared to El Salvador because there is very low crime rate there and believe me, crime rate means a lot.
