A generous billionaire kid, a smart young guy who wanted to make a change but he was tricked by a bad man from China. All Sam was trying to do is give back to local businesses and politicians, save them all from bankruptcy and that bad Chinese competitor created a panic that destroyed our local American business.

ALWAYS ready the terms of service/user agreement to see how ethical they are before handing them your coins, even if you intend to only use them short term",

I didn't dive deep enough into the story to figure out whether it was mismanagement of funds or a scam, though, so I don't really have an opinion on that. I am sorry for those who lost their money, and I hope selling assets and reimbursing the victims will be forced upon FTX soon enough. I don't think people will get everything back, but maybe at least a sizeable part.The FTX crash gave an additional hit to an already bearish market, but it's nothing unfixable when it comes to Bitcoin's price. I think Bitcoin can recover from this till the end of the year (I mean, from FTX and get to the $20k barrier), unless another major event like this one happens before then.",

It would seem that the rich do not go to jail, no matter how much money they steal as long as they are not stealing from the government. The CEO of the Luna scam obviously did not go to jail. He might be in hiding but if the government really wanted to put him in jail, they would have found him already. Same goes for Bankman. Either he was working together with the government or he paid off the government and is now enjoying life somewhere on some island.Justice will obviously not reach him.The only punishment he will receive is if the people he stole from decided to inflict mob justice on him. But the world has turned so soft, I doubt anyone will want to do that. Its a great age to be a scammer.",

I didn't dive deep enough into the story to figure out whether it was mismanagement of funds or a scam, though, so I don't really have an opinion on that. Mismanagement of funds is a straight up scam, using user funds to purchase homes for advisors and employees. Last October FTX raised $420 million and SBF took $300 million for his personal use and you still cannot have an opinion regarding a dumb paper billionaire  .Not long ago SBF offered Elon Musk $2 billion liquid when he was planning to take over Twitter and now he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and not Chapter 7  .Their exchange wallets are compromised all of a sudden and millions of dollars worth of coins vanishedPeople from Bahama were able to withdraw even when they disabled the rest to escape from the regulators in Bahamas and now they tweet that Bahamian withdrawals were illegal and asking exchanges to return those funds.Quote from: CryptoYar on November 20, 2022, 06:57:25 PMQuoteWhen will Sam Bankman-Fried go to jail?Do Kwon is in jail? no, he is not!

Probably quite fair summary of what needs to be legally determined, but there is also the non-philosophical question of whether he carried out all activities with his company's money above board. As CEO, did he actually have full power to use budgets and finances as he did, or were the entire board complicit, etc.He may (will) get away with what he did with customers, or end up paying a trifle for their suffering. It's the big suits and whether he also lost their money is what will be his worry (as pointed out above what Holmes also found out).",
