I know its possible on Graphic cards but is it possible to mine two different coins on an Asic miner? For example BTC + BCH or BCD. Each ASIC is tailored to mine a specific algorithm, so you will find them for a given algorithm. This means all ASICs meant for Bitcoin can mine all other cryptocurrencies that use algorithms similar to Bitcoin's.ASIC miners optimized for BTC are usually pointed at whatever SHA-256 coin is the most profitable to mine at the moment.Since BCH and BCD are forks of btc, they use similar algorithm of btc so you can mine them in an asic miner but not at the same time I believe.",

If different coins have implemented in their code the same mining algorithm, same hardware and probably same software should be able to mine any of those coins at a time.If, on the other hand you say about merged mining, ie mining both in the same time, I think that it's not only that they have to the same algorithm, I think that they also have to have something extra implemented to allow merged mining. Plus the mining pools may also have to know about it.I have some old memories on the early days of Litecoin + Dogecoin merged mining, but they're fuzzy, so better explanations may be needed.",

I don't know if double mining negatively affects bitcoin mining, but if it does not affect these coins can be mined and stored in the long term (at least in theory), for example ELA is now $0.8 while its ATH was about $80, also SYS is now priced 0.09 while its ATH was around $1.I know these coins don't necessarily have to get their ATH back but my point is they are not profitable right now but they could be profitable in the long run.",

I know its possible on Graphic cards but is it possible to mine two different coins on an Asic miner? For example BTC + BCH or BCD. According to me as I have seen that many of Miners mine one coin per time cause we just lock Graphics Cards power to lock to mine and than they run for a whole 24 hours. And if there could such way to mine BTC+ether per same time cycle than these miners could just blow up to ashes. And other reason is that these mining devices are much less powerful than Asic miners and these miners are very specific to mine and very most power that are coming in 2022 and 2023. And I like mostly Bitmain mining devices.",

What is Merged Mining?Workers who mine BTC, BCH and LTC can not only receive mining coins, but also ELA, NMC, SYS, EMC, and DOGE for FREE. BTC    Mined BTC and get 2 NMC, 5 SYS, 0.1 EMC, 0.8 ELA for FREE.BCH    Mined BCH and get 1 SYS for FREE.LTC     Mined LTC and obtain DOGE proportionally.
