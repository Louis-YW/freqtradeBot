In that case I would really need the advice of old members here to know the kind of posts that will earn me merits.In my experience, genuine attempts to either acquire or dispense knowledge, usually attract merit (depending on how interesting it is and how much effort was made). Obviously, there are many other ways (like humor in appropriate threads, finding and reporting plagiarism, etc.), but I think those first two are the most reliable.Simply sharing your opinion about various subjects will rarely result in merit. Redundant posting (answering a question that's already been answered, without adding anything new) will also usually not result in merit.This topic (by fillippone) contains lots of useful info: Ranking up is possible! 2900 Merits earned in less than 12 months!My 11 Hints!",

But be careful with overdoing this because what you can get is the opposite result: merit sources and higher ranked merit will put you on their ignore list. I see you have already earned 3 merits. Just use the forum to learn and exchange information and little by little you will become a better poster and get more merits.",
