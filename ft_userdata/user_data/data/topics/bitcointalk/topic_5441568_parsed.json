If it cannot be exchanged directly for money then, what does it do? I doubt this will work out. Everything is about the exchange rate today. You cannot tell investors that your currency is not up to exchanging and it won't be listed in an exchange, it almost sound like a scam. There must be a basis on how the value will be proven by the market and that means being listed to one of the reputable exchange. What you should be working out is to find a fix to that kind of hole and not take advantage of it.",

However, it is important to note that the value of any cryptocurrency is ultimately determined by the collective actions of users and the wider market, regardless of whether or not it is traded on an exchange.Quote from: ONinjaDos7Clans on February 28, 2023, 03:11:54 PMso it's more secure.What makes it more secure?Quote from: ONinjaDos7Clans on February 28, 2023, 03:11:54 PMthe vallue is determinated by negotiation:In contrast to what determines the value of any other digital asset?",
