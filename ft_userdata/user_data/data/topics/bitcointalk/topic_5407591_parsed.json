      "body": "Have you verified that you've a genuine Electrum version? If not, where exactly did you download it from?When you typed a certain amount (how much?) to open a trampoline channel, then why did your Electrum use the whole amount in your wallet? Your sole UTXO in address bc1qqwl7xj8x50rgvwmfmrdr00zjwql2n90ly6jhc0 was spent in total for the \"funding\" transaction, no change returned which contradicts what you wrote in your original post that you used a certain amount.That's weird. Are you sure you didn't click on the max button when you opened the channel?Next strange thing: why is there an OP_RETURN script as first output of your channel funding transaction? That makes no sense to me and I didn't observe such behavior by Electrum before. Again, do you have a genuine Electrum?I checked opening a trampoline Lightning channel with my Testnet wallet, used 2000000 tSats to fund it and it worked like a charm with channel status OPEN, in contrary to FUNDED as yours. My Testnet channel is also a trampoline channel (no kangaroo icon, but no yellow flash icon in bottom right corner, ie. no Lightning gossip in use).Something went clearly wrong with opening of your channel, just not sure what exactly. Strange also as mentioned by @nc50lc that you actually don't have a trampoline channel but rather one that uses Lightning gossip to populate routing info.Which options do you get when you right-click the channel on the \"Channels\" tab?I would be careful until you explicitly have verified your Electrum!",

The way you describe that is different.Did you wait until the status changed from OPENING to OPEN?

With the single channel you opened there's no way to proceed from here with success (or it's beyond your control) unless you open another channel (additionally or not). You would need some other channel to a better connected node which may be able to find a route. But to my knowledge there's no easy way to find such a channel partner. Likely a channel partner who has lots of channels open should find a successful route to your merchant, but there's no guarantee.Closing a channel may not give an immediate response. Be more patient. A cooperative Close needs both sides to agree to publish a channel finalization settlement transaction on-chain which needs at least 3 confirmation, too. But Electrum should indicate this somehow with a channel status of \"CLOSING\".Choosing \"Force close\" might not have been necessary as this should be a last resort option if the channel partner is non-responsive. But I would wait some time after a normal close to see what's going on.Do you remember at which point of your closing massaker you got the error message that you should enable \"gossip routing\"?As @nc50lc said, I too have no further help for you. I'm not sure how Electrum should indicate that a Force close is in progress. You should try to resolve this in the Github issue. There are some strange issues with your channel, indeed.",
