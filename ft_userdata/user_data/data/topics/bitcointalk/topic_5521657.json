It might reach $100k again, but it’s different from the first time it hit that milestone. You know how volatility works, right? We might even see it drop below $90k, but as we all know, Bitcoin always bounces back. That prediction of $125k to $130k by the end of the year is still possible, hopefully!",

The big question now is - are we still going to the moon mars from here? Yes, Bitcoin price has finally crossed one hundred thousand dollars.  And now it looks like this is going to be the case with Bitcoin's ATH this year as the entire market starts to decline again.  It is unlikely that the price of Bitcoin will go higher than this.  Every Bitcoin lover's dream was to see Bitcoin price at $100k.  We have been discussing this price of Bitcoin for a long time and finally Bitcoin crossed this price.  Very nice to see this.  I sold the bitcoins I was holding because I put this price as my highest target.  Now I will wait again for bear market.  And my next target will be $150k",

Perhaps this is the historic day that all Bitcoin holders have been waiting for, Finally ending everyone's wait, Bitcoin price has touched the much awaited $100k dollar mark. After Bitcoin hit all-time highs, the market crashed again. Even the market suddenly went down and it touched 90 thousand dollars. After a sudden drop, the price of Bitcoin has started to rise again, now the price of Bitcoin is 99 thousand dollars.Happy BTC $100k all Bitcoiners. We may see Bitcoin touch $150k next.",

Currently 100k of bitcoins has touched this milestone now waiting to see it's new ATH for 150k later.Yes, the 100K milestone was a big goal for every investor, which we have crossed, for those who have been holding Bitcoin continuously since 2-4 years, it is undoubtedly a big achievement.But this is not the end, now the wait for 150k has begun, our next goal is $150K - $200K - $500K - $1M and above. Volatility is the nature of Bitcoin, it will always be there, but we have to have long-term faith in Bitcoin, because from the beginning Bitcoin has reached this stage through such volatility, and if Bitcoin can reach this stage, then it can definitely go up to $1M also.So have faith in Bitcoin, and have a long-term holding perspective, we will definitely be able to go to much bigger stages in the future.",

I think this time, Bitcoin has been building up the price gradually, and that there's still room for further growth by the end of this year and maybe in January 2025. I wouldn't expect anything too crazy like $200k, for example, but something like $120k seems pretty realistic to me. In any case, it's great to see that Bitcoin got its expected bull run and reached a new symbolic threshold. I'm sure it's not the last bull market anyway, even if this one is getting close to being over.",

We may see a little dumping in the market at the moment, but we can say for sure that we will see new ATHs in the future. We are seeing beautiful lines of new ATHs at every stage, we will have to wait a long time to see ATHs like 200k+ in the future. But this much is sure that we will definitely see such ATHs.

Well, congratulations to all of us and BTC really outperformed all of our expectations, I really did not waited for it to hit this milestone because I did not expected it to hit.
