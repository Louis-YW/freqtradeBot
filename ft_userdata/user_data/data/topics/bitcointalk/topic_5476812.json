I collected all my btc and put them in my binance account. Back than I thought it would be a hassle for me to claim every forks personally. I was okay with using electrum like wallets but I was suspicious how my private keys would be used by different and newer wallets.At some point in time, there were so many forks of bitcoin that it was difficult to track them. And I was actually satisfied what what binance did with my coins. I remember of getting forked coins like weekly and selling them for a profit.",

I had to use Electron Cash for the Bitcoin Cash & I had to buy an Android phone (I am an iPhone guy) to download some app that allowed me to claim the less well known ones. As I had already claimed those shit forks I didn’t get BSV. I don’t know about claiming if you used an exchange to store your Bitcoin originally because I’ve always been a self custody guy.",

I'm not sure how much money people make from those drop but if those forks happen now they would have faced huge sell pressure in the market as the number of bitcoin holders grows significantly compared to before. I assume that there are still unclaimed bitcoin fork coin like the unclaimed ARB token from the arbitrum airdrop. Some people were unaware, some lost their keys, and there were some who were not interested. The same thing happens with those bitcoin fork coin as well.",

Quote from: jerry0 on December 06, 2023, 07:21:25 PMAlso why would anyone not claim it? However, I tried to answer in general and it seems that there are still indications of discord in society surrounding fork makers which is the cause of low market acceptance of forks.Quote from: jerry0 on December 06, 2023, 07:21:25 PMWhat would be the reason? This indication also indirectly weakens the original value and focus of fork makers.
