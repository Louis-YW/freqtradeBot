Do also note, some stablecoins have a feature to freeze funds, so it is another possibility. Overall, A general or even the most sophisticated hacker can't do much with only the address and time of the transactions.Quote from: swogerino on February 18, 2023, 11:09:08 AMFirst of all I would advise you change wallet from a third party based like Coinbase as that is a third party wallet which can turn offline any day and you can forget about your coins as that saying says \"Not your keys,not your coins\".Coinbase Wallet is a self-custodial wallet, as they have claimed. So as long OP keeps the seed phrases secure, it should be able to be exported to other wallets. Also, Coinbase Wallet is not a third-party wallet, I'm not even sure what you mean by a third-party-based wallet.",

However, don't just sit and be confident that there are no hackers that can get into your account. Just practice safe security, always put a password on your wallet that is hard to guess and your seed should not be be saved in your mobile phone or laptop.",

Yet we must not be confident but we should always make it a practice to re-check the receivers address if it's a correct one or not.To be able to do this in an efficient way, I check a few characters on the beginning and on the last part of a crypto wallet address. On the second one or about the private keys, make sure we avoid sites or transactions which requires us to paste our private keys because they are obviously a scam. We should also store our private keys offline. Transacting big amount is also fine as long as you know to your self that you are clean and free from illegal transactions in the past.",
