  "content": "**If this is not the right place, kindly help me move it to the right section**Nothing is perfect in life, and Bitcoin is not an exception, I believe there is more to be done. As much as I appreciate and advocate for Bitcoin since I adopted it, I won't still turn a blind eye to the issues that need to be resolved, if possible. The pressing one is the issue related to the high fee/congestion period in which transactions could be unconfirmed for only God knows when.For over 2 weeks, I've not seen the unconfirmed transactions in the mempool lower than 250,000, which is not acceptable with a good system. There should be a modality/plan/rule (as you might call it) that even miners must obey in which transactions must not be abandoned for more than a certain period of time irrespective of the fee used. It could be within 24 hours, a week, or a month at max (I don't recommend this long), it doesn't matter. Not that people's money would be held in the system without a stamped date it would ever be confirmed.Many people are victims of this, they transferred their money for a purpose and the system holds as much as over 250,000 of such for so long. I will not blame them (the senders) because it's not everybody that knows the right wallets to use or have much understanding of Bitcoin like BTT members and many others. Even some that understand might just be caught in this unplanned.Miners have taken this mostly as business, and will always go for the highest fee disregarding the health and sanity of the network. Yet, developers could make it difficult for miners who have significant transactions with lower fees unattended to, particularly those that are due for their maximum dates. Meaning that the system could be designed in such a way that miners MUST take a certain percentage of low-fee transactions along with the high fees they want so that no transactions would be delayed for too long.Satoshi has left everything in the hands of everybody, so this is a challenge to the Bitcoin community and developers if they are reading this. There should be a way they could make miners accountable and more ethical instead of turning the system solely into a pure business for themselves. Some would rather make you pay an outrageous fee to accelerate your stuck transaction even if the money sent is little. This is now business-orientated for them rather than the respect for the network.",

It won't censor transactions which are broadcasted by users. You have all these with bitcoin blockchain and you have freedom to use low fee rate and wait longer or higher fee rate and enjoy faster confirmation.QuoteMany people are victims of this, they transferred their money for a purpose and the system holds as much as over 250,000 of such for so long.If they use centralized exchanges, their withdrawals will be proceeded with high transaction fee rate enough to be confirmed by miners.

This is an open field where everyone can be a miner and take any transactions they feel like into there blocks. We can’t just charge the miners to take lower transaction fees without also pointing fingers at the amount they spend on mining equipments. After spending that amount on those equipments and sometimes on electricity, it will not be logical to accuse them of prioritizing high fees moreover who isn’t on this for the profit purposes. The first thing solution now is to educate bitcoiners about the knowledge of wallet to be used so as to bump fees when needed. Secondly to find a way to filter this ordinal or BRC20 tokens off the blockchain. Thirdly with more adoption probably the cost of mining would reduce and will have more miners which will increase the decentralization of it",

I can't use my understanding and know-how to judge others, and that doesn't still mean I can't capture their interest in my wish. For unconfirmed transactions to be as high as that means that many people didn't know. My wish is for a system that will be friendly to all irrespective of the wallet used.While some might be victims simply because they were lectured about Bitcoin and wallets by someone who knows little or nothing about it. This explains why some people are still using custodial wallets. Can we totally blame them? No, it's just the unfortunate way they adopted it and the exposure at their disposal.That's why I called for a system that will make sure transactions are confirmed at a maximum time regardless of your experience.Quote from: Deddyhoku on May 23, 2023, 11:05:42 AMPeople will start to use 1sat fee if they will 100% know that this is enough.

But, the question arises that who would set those rules because miners are the real bosses till this date and  who could force them to add the low-fee transactions in the blocks? The answer is no one.There can't be a solution for the problem because if the miners are forced to do anything that's against their will, they will leave away such systems where they can't earn a lot. The miners are basically doing the mining thing as a business and any businessmen would prefer to earn as much from a business as possible. If the miners were doing it for humanity purpose or for love of technology then that would be another thing.The best option for anyone is to understand the basics of Bitcoin transactions so that they can choose the preferable wallet software according to their needs. The knowledge regarding such things should be a compulsory thing, and everyone should prefer the wallet software that supports features like RBF, and CPFP, because these features are very helpful for stuck transactions.",

From compressed legacy to nested segwit with further fee reduction. From nested segwit to native segwit with more fee reduction. Comparing compressed legacy to native segwit, there is 42% to 50% or more in fee reduction, depending on the transaction inputs and outputs. Developers have not been relaxing too. We should respect that.There was a time, a fork that led to Bitcoin Cash, to increase block size. Another thing is that develoers will also may still be trying to avoid what can lead to such hard fork. Know that miners also have say. Example is Segwit and Taproot activation, mines are the ones that are flagging the block mined to be in support or not. Miners are the ones that earn from fee and they have upper say about it too. If you want to make your suggestions to be heard, you have to be one of the bitcoin developers and you will have to make an official proposal that will show your aim, how you want to achieve it. Other developers may accept it or not. If accepted, but regarding fee reduction proposal, miners (mining pools) are the ones that will signal support, or not signal anything.",

Since there is no central authority that can block specific users, this is the only way to ensure that an attacker will think twice if it is worth it to spam the network.The other thing however is the block size. If it would be my decision the block size would be doubled tomorrow. We are not in 2011 any more, yet still the network has the same capacity (with millions of users instead of just a few hundred).",

And give a warning if it's not.Not the other way around. I screwed up the other day, and did not notice that for whatever reason RBF was not checked and set a lower fee non RBF transaction. Not a big deal since I just did a CPFP with the change. But, I tend to make BTC transactions a few times a week and would like to think that I know what I am doing.If I can screw that up, then anyone can.-DaveI wasn't that lucky, I made a low fee transaction from Mycelium wallet which does not support RBF, and since I spent entire available balance, I can't use CPFP bump.So now I had to wait for it to either be forgotten by the network or for the fees to come down. But as anyone can potentially rebroadcast any transaction and there's no guarantee the fees will come down any time soon - it could be stuck for a very long time.",

Does this mean you never publish RBF transactions before? I suggest moving to another wallet that supports RBF by default (or those that offer more coin control in general).Quote from: EarnOnVictor on May 23, 2023, 11:35:20 AMNot when you want your transaction confirmed fast. My plight is that transactions should not be unconfirmed for too long and without even knowing when they would ever be confirmed. Nothing could be more painful in some circumstances like that.One of the easier solutions is to use other networks if you need a fast transaction. RBF is also mandatory if you still want to force to use Bitcoin when the network is busy and being spammed by others. I believe you should view the \"long time to confirm\" as the security required to make sure your transaction is irreversible. We've seen many rollbacks on some altcoin networks before, I don't think that's a good thing to aim for. CMIIW.",
