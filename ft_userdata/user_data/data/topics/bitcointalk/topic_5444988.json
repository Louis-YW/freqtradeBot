He did not hadÂ  to disclose his identity to be able to do this. He has to get this printed and get a van hired for some hours. All this can be done without revealing his own identity. He need not pay the person in the poster . I do not encourage phot of some influential people though without their consent for promoting anything. Because this can be abused in a number of ways. My first reaction on seeing the image was that it is photoshopped but I wait for responses on this thread from experts regarding this.",

It was indeed photoshopped obviously because why the heck would the chair of federal reserve endorse bitcoin. This is the original photo(Bitcoin sign guy) from years ago that inspired this comical(though likely illegal) ad.",

That way their money cannot be traded or used to buy assets by third party services like banks and centralized exchanges, just as Silicon valley bank did with their depositors funds and lost it.",

This is done with purpose and surely the police department will be searching for the person who done it. The good thing is the spread about bitcoin in the failure of one of the reputed banks of America. I thought someone have done good editing and did it, but the image is real and taken infront of SVB. The person who had done it is really courageous.",
