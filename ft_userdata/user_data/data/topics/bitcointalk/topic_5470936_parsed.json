  "content": "I refer you to my previous post where we carried out bitcoin awareness in Cameroon. Afterward, we gifted the new bitcoiners $1 worth of bitcoin each. This question is a follow-up from one of the participants who is part of the WhatsApp group we created for continual bitcoin education and to answer whatever questions they may have as they learn more about bitcoin.The question: Hello, thank you very much for the class on Bitcoin. I appreciate the $1 Bitcoin welcoming gift sent to our wallet s. You said we should be free to reach out with our questions on Bitcoin and so this is the reason I am reaching out. In my family, we have a precious metal(gold) that has been passed down from my great great grandfather who was a gold miner to my great  great grandfather to my grandfather and my father and now to me (My father passed away some months ago). This piece of gold is worth a lot money in US dollars. My income as a school teacher is very little for me to  to invest in Bitcoin and profit from the halving of Bitcoin in 2024 which you mentioned during the awareness class that happens once in four year. Would you advise me to sell off this gold which has been in my family for so long and use the money to buy  Bitcoin now so that I make profit from it during the halving?Please, guys, what is the best way to respond to this question? Do you advise I tell him to take up a second job and work very hard to save up and invest in bitcoin instead of selling the precious metal that has been in his family for years because it is good to hold both gold and bitcoin? Do you advise I tell him to continue the family tradition and also pass down the gold to his children, just as his father and father's father did before him? Or that it is okay to sell off the gold and invest in bitcoin because after the halving, he would be able to buy twice as much gold as he has now? What do you think is the right advice to give to this young chap?",

In situations like this, you might end up being blamed for helping him make such decisions and potentially getting into serious trouble. It wouldn't be appropriate to sell a family heirloom that has been passed down through generations. Decisions like these should involve the entire family, rather than him making a solo decision to sell it. Bitcoin investment carries risks, and as a beginner with limited knowledge on how to secure his funds, he should take his time and not rush into investing. Right now, he should focus on learning the basics and consider making small, gradual investments. He should also be aware that he can start investing in bitcoin with whatever he has and consider using the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) method.",

I doubt your words now, are you really building these stories up or what? I'm not accusing you, I'm just being skeptical here.Well, the answer you might give him should be based on statistics and facts. For example, I don't know how much worth and weight it has, but let's say it's worth around 100k dollars if he sells it now. And according to the price of gold (by analyzing the history charts) and doing TA and FA, you think that 100K dollars will become around 200K in the next, let's say, 5 years. Which I am truly not saying that will become, just assuming.Then use the same profit and loss measurements and calculations on BTC, like what if he invested that 100k in BTC now at the rate of 28,700$ and sold after the halving next year and made 2x or 3x on that, which obviously is not for sure, but the risk is almost the same as in gold. And it might become hard to keep that gold in a safe place, too.And after telling him about all the calculations, you can also give him the idea of dividing the investment into two parts, one for gold (which means keeping some form in gold) and the other for BTC. If that student of yours really wanted to enter the realm of BTC,",

These are two very important questions. If it is gold that should not be sold, it means that it should not be sold because if it is sold and the money invested into bitcoins, that original amount invested from the sale of the bitcoin is still not logically yours and will need to passed to the next generation. You can only claim ownership to the profit from it.",

This is a family legacy, and something to remember his father by. But children are different, some people may not share such sentiments and may consider selling family treasures to improve their financial status. From the OP, I sense the young man doesn’t have any sentimental value for the object his father passed down to him. He sees it for its value as gold, I think he’s already made up his mind to sell the object. The only thing stopping him right now is the million dollar question “ is Bitcoin more profitable than Gold”.",

The reason is because the precious metal has been passed down from generation to generation in his family so if the previous generations did not sell then their should be a reason.Investing now in Bitcoin because of the coming Bitcoin halving to me is a desperate move, one Which is born because you believe you must make profits. But Bitcoin is volatile and nothing is guaranteed in terms of return on investment.

So one should never invest if he is still in doubt, and one should never invest by risking other asset just to invest in bitcoin. Instead, make yourself familiarize and understand well about bitcoin. Do not jump into making investment, but know the risks first that you need to overcome so you won't regret your decision  in the end. And as much as possible, never invest using other people's money or asset, but use your own hard-earned money that you can afford to lose whenever your investment does not work according to your plan.Bitcoin investment is certainly more valuable than fiat investment.

Some items should never be sold regardless of how much returns they will bring. I would advise him not to sell the gold bar to buy Bitcoin because that precious stone is also a good investment.  There is no need to rush to invest in the sector because he needs to learn many things. If he is not well informed about Bitcoin, he might end up losing his investment. The best option is for him to start small and build his holding using DCA over the years. Getting a second job, saving, and investing some percentage of his income in Bitcoin will be better than selling a generational asset. Another reason not to sell the gold bar is because the gold market is more stable than the bitcoin market. The price of Bitcoin is unpredictable so there is no assurance that he will make gain from his profit next year. We know bitcoin halving is next year but we cannot accurately predict how high the price of bitcoin will go.",

I bought some assets sometime around 2018, and held it until the recent bull run that happened in 2021. I saw my portfolio going to as high as $7,000 or even higher. Did I sell it during the bull run? No, and I'm very disappointed of myself because I let my potential profits go away. My advice is that \"Don't fall in love with your assets.\" Whether it's a gold, or silver, or whatever assets it is, always, always sell it if there's an opportunity, or you believe that investing it into another asset will give you higher profit. We have different reasons as to why we are holding assets like with the guy you shared OP where the gold has been passed from generation to generation. So will it stay that way forever? No one will have the guts to sell it? For me, assets are meant to be sold for profit, nothing more, nothing less, and that includes gold, and Bitcoin. To answer this \"Would you advise me to sell off this gold which has been in my family for so long and use the money to buy  Bitcoin now so that I make profit from it during the halving?\" I guess it would be better for that gold holder to ask his family first because it seems like the gold has a sentimental value towards other family members since it has been passed for a very long time. If all of them agrees then I would say yes - only if that person is already equipped with knowledge with regards to Bitcoin.Ask the teacher guy OP as to why he is holding that Gold. From there, you can formulate an advice. You will hear different advice here since we have different perspective when it comes to Gold. I already shared mine.
