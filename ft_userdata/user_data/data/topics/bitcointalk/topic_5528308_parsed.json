But you can still make use of the cards to make transaction.There are other wallets that support NFC. Nunchuk is one of them.I prefer only OR code for signing.",

      "body": "NFC comes with additional risks and is a poor way to store sensitive data/wallets so it is usually an acceptable option if you want to create payments for coffee or daily needs with a minimum of $50/$100 and is bad for using as a hot wallet (it can be encrypted but that will add more complexity)So instead of looking for an electrum wallet NFC you can use one of these cards  ----> https://thebitcoinmanual.com/security/nfc/ (DYOR and remember not use them as a hot wallet)",

Coldcard Q w tapsigner cards would be economical way to do multi-sig, but the cards need NFC. Are you referring to this product[1]? What makes you think you need NFC to set up a multisig with it? I read their guides[2] and it seems you can import your details through an SD Card too. I failed to see any mandatory requirements that you need to use NFC to do this[3].

      "body": "Good point! NFC is super convenient for small, everyday transactions, but definitely not the best choice for storing large amounts or using as a hot wallet. Encryption can help, but like you said, it adds complexity. Those NFC cards you linked look interesting—I’ll check them out! Always good to remember security first when dealing with crypto.

CMIIW.He is referring to Tapsigner card for the NFC. If it is Coldcard Q, I found out that it also support QR code which should be enough for fast transaction if Electrum support the type of the QR code. But if it is Tapsigner card, it supports just NFC, according to my findings about the card.",

This would let me get started in a multisig with modest bitcoin I plan to have initially. I think this means I have to use Nunchuk to utilize the tapsigners. I already have electrum, and was hoping I wouldn't have to switch. Looks like I do.",
