Perhaps, he's referring to the quantity of Bitcoin you have when he says it increases in value instead of decreasing. The explanation is somehow misleading and when you explain something like this to Nigerian kids you'll realize the damage you have caused. I think digital money through the use of peer to peer will be fine. Quote from: SatoPrincess on January 22, 2024, 04:04:45 PMI don‚Äôt think OP was talking about teaching bitcoin to kids.

There was no direct mention of children but we all know the age range we refer to as second grade and there is no perfect way to start teaching anything other than explaining. Moreover, is there any simple and easier way to describe bitcoin better these two in your comment? Unless the person has problem with English and comprehension because I see nothing too technical in decentralization or non custodian.",

Do it as good as Sunny Lu did for blockchain.Bitcoin is another money that can be spent without any borders, as long as there are people willing to accept it as money then that's an alternative money for most. And it's not just your different kind of money through the internet but it's also an asset, a store of value that money does. So basically, there are ways to obtain or accumulate Bitcoin. First through mining, this is like the conventional way of it but it will cost you lots of money for the equipment for you to start mining. The easier way is to simply buy it through exchanges using your local money and convert it to Bitcoin and, the other way is through getting paid with it like a typical worker.",

He or she wants to explain it to the mother the way a child would understand. It's not about getting kids into crypto but people that aren't tech savvy. ¬†So, to answer the topic, She wants to know what the difference between bitcoin and crypto is and what mining is. In short, you can tell her that bitcoin is a type of crypto, but there are other types, the way Fords were the first popular cars, but now we a hundred brands. Bitcoin is the first ever digital currency working on its own, without an issuer, contrary to national fiat currencies like the dollar, which has an issuer (US Gov.) and can be digitalized (not to confuse with digitized) Bitcoin was made digital from the start.Miners are the ones who process transactions because someone has to make the calculations necessary to encrypt and decrypt transactions. Without them anybody would be able to hijack your money, so they provide security and stability that allows the network to function. It's really easy if you don't overcomplicate it.",
