  "content": "The issue of poverty that has surrounded West Africa is no longer a news, as the government of these countries has failed their people. Most especially in Nigeria, where inflation matters keep getting worse years after years. The idea of fighting poverty and hunger is no longer the responsibility of the Nigeria government, as citizens have given up on them a long time ago.Was it always like this ?, I would say no because as far as I can remember, the government that left power in 2015 didn't leave such mess, although times were tough as always. but the government before that was even far better than the one that left in 2015. Without being told, I know that this situation is getting worse and as time goes on, we might as well see even more hardship in Nigeria.About two days ago, I sat down to watch TV and coincidentally, I turned to ad jazeera where news of illegal immigrants was being broadcasted. It saddens me when I heard that over 118K illegal immigrants from Africa has entered Italy since January this year till this moment.The most frustrating part was that the Italian government has declared that they can no longer accommodate illegal immigrants in their country.https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/program/inside-story/2023/9/14/has-italys-approach-to-migration-failedThis shows how terrible the whole situation has become, Knowing fully well that so many Nigerians, including some of us reading this post would love to leave this country with any given opportunity.(japa).Though, I won't blame the Italian government for taking such action, they should also be able to reduce over population unlike the one that has affected Nigeria and other Africa countries.Even with the current hardship, something still surprises me among some Nigerians, most especially the youths that has made the right decision for themselves. The evolution of technology has become their source of income, as they've capitalized fully on the potentials of the internet. The youths can no longer sit and wait for the government, because they no longer care about our future.All they care about is their political title and themselves. with this, I will say that the government is being selfish. These whole issue has made the youth to utilize the power of the internet and are making the best out of it.The internet which is basically categories into three webs which are web 1.0, 2.0 and the recent 3.0 have being able to provide few Nigerians with the financial freedom they need. Web 3.0 which is a complete package of Blockchain technology, Artificial intelligence, Cryptocurrency, etc is beginning to take shape in our world today.This youth have fully taken advantage on the benefits of the internet and provide job opportunities for themselves. You must be wondering what kind of jobs are they ?, They are...Cryptocurrency (Trading)Forex TradingContent Creation (blogging, video,etc)AnimationsProgrammingFrom the list above, we literally don't need any physical tutor to learn any of these, because YouTube is the current best tutor around the world. these skills can generate an average Nigeria youth at least something to help take care of his daily needs.We no longer need to wait for the government for a job, because there isn't any. I remembered sometimes ago, on tv where the government were making fund of the poor. This doesn't sounds well right because the government of a country is supposed to provide for it's people no matter what and eradicate poverty. instead they sit up there and laugh at us.If you are living in Nigeria, and you know for sure that a job isn't secured for you, it is advisable that you get one of this digital skills or else, hunger fit destroy your life. even at getting a job, you can still minize time and also engage in some of these web3 jobs because they will actually act as a means of earning extra. we shouldn't forget that you are not supposed to have 1 source of income in a country like Nigeria where everything is on a hike. let's all endeavour to participate in these job opportunities. we should Make a wise decision now and secure our future.",

If all of us depend on the government and fail to go to the internet and look for something to do, then by now, what to eat will be very hard for the common man because our leaders are selfish and are not ready to help us.",

Internet get many job opportunities na you go need choose which one wey you go do and e make sense to not depend on only one way but to get multiple skills because we no know how tomorrow go be so e no go make sense to think say wetin dey today go still dey like dat tomorrow. As you dey learn coding no just stop for only the normal coding but also shuku hand for blockchain programming because this wan go increase ur advantage and e go make you dey hirable. If you no see work for normal coding, blockchain go enter your side. For this same internet, you fit do e-commerce, web development, App development etc. Anything wey you for do for manual work, an online version dey so make you put head for ground and do research and empower yourself with skills and the job go come.

You fit dey dey your manual work and dey combined am with this online jobs too. You fit just get the skills and turn to teacher wey be say you go dey collect fees to dey teach the skills to the younger generation wey dey come for back. You no even need to get office as you fit dey run am from the comfort of ur house online. People dey wey dey do am like all this TikTok influencers wey dey teach people many things on TikTok. You go also dey get endorsement deals from this thing wey you go just dey your house dey run and also dey get other free things.

We just lack the availability of job creation to fix these people. I believe the literacy rate in Nigeria have now increased over the years, thanks to invention of new technologies yearly. Nigerians running away to other countries for a greener pasture is because there’s no availability of such for them by the government in the country. They go to where they can employ their skill and earn a living instead of depending on the government for their daily needs.

Civil servants will be retired after 35 years in service, politicians will also leave their positions after their tenure has ended.

Inclusion controversies at some youths who are not diligent enough to be creative and productively impacted to take lead of the internet advantages due to the less concerned of the political governance system across the masses has brought about diverse mayhems to advancement across the African nations. Especially Nigeria where the youths has indulged their selves in criminality acts such as compromising the positive usage of the internet for fraudulence on diversities (scamming/yahoo-yahoo) activities all to create means of survival and also the illegal usage of arms for robberies and other nuisances all on the same goal to keep its life going since the government is of no concern.Though I totally disapproves these acts of the youths illegal indulgences and appreciated the efforts where the youths positively took advantage on the internet as scripted by the OP.To an extend, many no longer aim to meet up a better life with their initial broad dreams but to a maximum aiming to keep a \"just life\" living and  these are areas where carrers dies due to what I would like to call infertility encouragement.",

Life in general is very hard but only the truly committed and dedicated one always find a way out.The most scary part of staying in your comfort zone is that it makes you overly stagnant in growth and learning new things. It is the worst part of a person particularly when you are in a young age. Comfort zone attracts many bad habits including procrastination and mental loneliness. The brain has been designed to accommodate active events to stay charged and active. I've experienced all of these in the past and all I can say is that we should fight our comfort zones, either by exiting or by engaging in other self-development skills and courses. Like it is said that in every sickness, there's a medicine.  Alongside the effects, I was able to learn self-development courses and skills that are helpful today.QuoteHaving one source of income in Nigeria is not advisable.

Because for Naija, I doubt if them get single person wey never enter comfort zone before, but like we dey talk, side hustle really dey important for life. In fact, whether you work or not. Having multiple streams of income is the best thing that can ever happen to a man. For me, the standard is at least four streams of income.

So in summary having a diverse source of income is important because it seems a bit more fulfilling when you have different businesses generating income either on weekly or monthly basis as such if one failed another will sustain you.",
