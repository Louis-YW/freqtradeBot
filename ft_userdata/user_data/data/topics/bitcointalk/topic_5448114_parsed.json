If you have used SushiSwap in last week than revoke your allowance. For this follow some sample step.== Open revoke.cash== Connect your wallet (select network which you used for swao etc)== You will see all allowance you have given. search for SushiSwap and there will be revoke button next to SushiSwap.== Just click in revoke and you will he charged small fee and now you are safe.",

Just copy-paste. One chain gets an exploit and all the other will have the same problem.Another important thing is to always use virgin address when interacting with smart contracts. Only what one wants to trade or exchange should be in the address and not the whole portfolio.I hope the traders revoke the permissions fast enough before they become the next victims.",

      "body": "Interesting to see that this exploits happen at the time when high number of Liquidity has been provided by LP Users. Arbitrum token has been recently launched and they Airdropped tokens to theirs community which attract many users to interect with dex in multiple chains andany users provided liquidity in arbitrum chain to collect fee because mumber if transaction become higher in this chain. This is not look incidental but its preplanned just like FTX exchange. Now the better option is for SushiSwap to refund or give Airdrop to those addresses which lost lot because of this exploit. I think 90% of these hacks are done by insiders. I might be wrong but its just my thinking.I read News recently that total 1k Ethereum was affected in this exploit. 300 Ethereum has been refunded by Security team while 700 is still to be refunded. i surprised to see that Sushi Token is not affected so much. i remembered when Axie was hacked then Its token was down badly but here the situation was totally different. its down 5% and very quickly its recovered back to original price.",

One of the reasons why these alts will never replace bitcoin in any timeline. I thought these smart contracts where double checked and audited. That's also what I believed,  if this keeps happening and investors are losing millions because of the bugs then all contract-based coins and tokens are in deep trouble in losing their reputation.There's really no sound investment like Bitcoin if you know how to secure your private keys you are safe, compared to smart contracts that can be exploited so even if you have good security and you keep your private keys secure you can still be hacked.",

I guess the relatively low amount of loss also contributed to that. So, it is not surprising that the price was not affected that much. It is also understandable to assume there are some whales or traders who try to keep the price as high as possible though, anything is possible.I don't think they will survive if exploits are happening so often though, they better improve the security or they will lose more than just 1k ETH in the future.",

No doubt the survived this time but if another exploit happen then many traders will leave SushiSwap just like Solona. when first time Solona network bug was happen then its not affected Sol price but when its continued second and third time we have seen big crash in solona token price too.

I completely agree with you; the mistakes that happened to Solana over and over again in the long term are what affected the current currency price, which has fallen a lot, and this indicates that investors are moving away from this currency, also what happened to SushiSwap platform and the bug that hackers exploited in the smart contract led to huge losses, but they tried to return things to their course, as they were able to recover part of the stolen money from the Ethereum currency, as this hacking also affected the SushiSwap (SUSHI) currency, but the effect was not great, but its price soon recovered, but yes, if more fatal bugs, hacking, and losses are repeated, exposing users’ funds to danger and theft, then yes the SUSHI coin will be uglier and worse than what happened to Solana coin, it will harm the coin holders and users of the SushiSwap platform.",

This was an approval bug and  Hackers took advantage of it and success to break security. Security companies identify these bug very fast and Dex was lucky And was saved from great loss and recovery some Eth earlier. If their contract not audit by big companies there was chances if big loss.",
