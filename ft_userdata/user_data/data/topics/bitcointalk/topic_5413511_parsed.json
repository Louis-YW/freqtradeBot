  "content": "I was looking through eBay and ran across what I think seems like a good deal on some older Baikal ASICS, I don't have much money to burn ATM and I'm kinda on a budget,these are Multi Algo, and will mine Blake256R14, Blake256R8, and Blake2B if I can win them at $300 would that be a good deal? I was looking at other comparable Baikal and Antminers they seem to be going for twice that price for one miner, but I don't know much about them and was hoping someone here had some experience with Baikal. https://www.ebay.com/itm/185579622973",

But you must have very cheap electricity, for example 1.5-2 cents.And if unpopular asics break down, you won’t be able to quickly repair it.",
