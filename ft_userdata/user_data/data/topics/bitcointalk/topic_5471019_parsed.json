If so, it may well be that Telegram tries to contact you, but does not get through because your mobile provider already blocks the calls / SMS. What you could try then is to call the support of your mobile operator. They can tell you if SMS are blocked (and read out the code if you ask nicely ...).If not ... In my case, the number from which Telegram sends the SMS (and possibly also calls) was stored in a blacklist on my phone, so the calls and SMS were put through to my smartphone, but not displayed there because of the blacklist. Edit (you were faster than me): You could also contact the Telegram-support (https://telegram.org/support) as a last resort and tell them about your problem. I am sure you are not the only person with such a problem  Hope you get access to your account soon!",

Sometimes connecting your phone to VPN first and then try to generate an SMS works (only if the mobile operator has not blocked the SMS from the telegram).But probelm is that he has logged in to some other device as well and do not know which is that device, so the sms may never arrive and only the support can help to identify and logout all the unknown devices.Also, I don't you how quick and  efficent is the telegram support ? If thier response time is low, then it may take few days for them to see the issue and  come to the conclusion. And yeah this is a frustration time when you are unable to login to telegram.",

Don't worry TelegramX is not an unofficial app nor a modded version, it's just one of Telegram's official clients and also developed by Telegram-LLC.Once you installed the app, just follow the same login process as Telegram and here you will receive the verification code via normal SMS to your mobile Number when you click didn't receive code for the second time.I am suggesting this only after trying this on my side now on my secondary Android when my telegram session is still active on my primary mobile.

Other than that I tried everything else including writing Telegram support (did not receive a response yet though). Even I got a new phone yesterday just to make sure my older phone was not keeping any catch, data log whatever it is. But failed with this brand new phone too. All other OTP works but it does not work only for this specific telegram.Is there a specific number that Telegram use to send OTP? I may need to talk to my cell operator to whitelist it in case they blocked it or possible anything that is causing this problem.I am really frustrated, I don't think I have left any information unread on youtube, web articles too and tried their suggestions.",
