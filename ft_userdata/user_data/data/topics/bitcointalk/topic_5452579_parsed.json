Is it even possible to download the whole blockchain in its current state?I want it so I can submit blocks I mined.Thank you.",

It could be your internet speed, HDD, lack of RAM, low dbcache or other processes that consume resources. Without sharing system specs, it can be anything.QuoteIs it even possible to download the whole blockchain in its current state?Yes. With modern hardware and fast internet it's possible within a day.QuoteI want it so I can submit blocks I mined.Considering the questions you're asking, I highly doubt you're mining blocks. What did you do?",

      "body": "If you're running a Bitcoin full node using bitcoind, it may take some time to fully sync the blockchain, especially if you're starting from a very distant starting point like 2015/16. The sync process requires the download and verification of all blocks and transactions from the creation of the blockchain up to the current most recent block.  This can take a long time, depending on the speed of your internet connection, the performance of your system, and the amount of data that needs to be downloaded and verified.Quote from: publicdata on May 13, 2023, 11:49:35 AMI\"ll try prunenode.I\"m using a seedbox with lots of storage, and ram, and top isn\"t showing much CPU usage... weirdInterestingly, Bitcoin Node Sync does not require heavy CPU usage.  Most of the workload is on the hard drive I/O operations, as the node has to download, verify and store the blockchain data. Make sure you have correctly configured your node with reduced mode by using the -prune=<size> command line option, where <size> represents the amount of space you want to allocate for the blockchain.",
