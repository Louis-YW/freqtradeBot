No rules nothing to doNo, unfortunately it is not allowed to do that on the forum. You can do giveaways off-site (for example, google form) and post a link in this thread, but you can't give people any incentive for replying to your thread.Quote from: theymos on January 27, 2014, 06:11:50 AMMost giveaway threads are no longer allowed in the Alternate cryptocurrencies sections. From now on, posting or replying to such threads could result in being banned. Existing threads will be locked.Specifically, you are not allowed to give people any incentive to post insubstantial posts in your threads. You can't offer to pay people who post their addresses, usernames, etc. You can do giveaways off-site and link to the giveaway page in a thread, but you can't give people any bonus for replying to your thread.Similar threads are already restricted to Games and Rounds in the non-altcoin sections, but the giveaway-related post volume is so high in the altcoin sections that I've decided to just ban them entirely here.",

No rules nothing to doIn as far as I commend your generosity, it's unwise to do giveaway without taking some criteria into consideration. Although it is your wish to do it in a way that suit you but I would advise you to set certain criteria in order to minimize spam and of course to allow the less privilege benefit from it. It will go a long way for people here also fund raising for flood disaster in Pakistan.The above is just a recommendation and not trying to make you act against your wish.",

If someone has good intention to bless others with a raffle or freebies, it shouldn't be stopped.
