I directly invest in coins, but I'm curious about the differences between the two in case I decide to start mining. Cloudmining is either a scam or is making you take all the financial risk in exchange for a small piece of the profit, hosted mining is either a scam or hosting your actual mining rig.Basically, most of the cloudmining company's discussed on bitcointalk are either an obvious scam or later on turn out to be a scam. The \"honest\" ones run their own hardware in their own datacenter, and you pay all their costs in exchange for a part of their income.On the other hand, hosted mining company's usually let you run your own miner, you still pay all the costs, but because it's your hardware you also get all the income.Personally, i wouldn't invest in neither of these options... Maybe i'd dip my feet in hosted mining IF i could find a reliable company in my own country AND the math proves it would be profitable... but still... for me it would either be home mining or not mining at all (and at the electricity prices we've been paying for years, home mining is no longer a viable option for me)",

I directly invest in coins, but I'm curious about the differences between the two in case I decide to start mining. In theory the difference should be that in case of cloud mining you buy (any) hash rate (which you may also able to resell to other users if you no longer want to mine), while for hosted mining you buy actual miners and that may not be so easy (availability, more expensive, ...). Especially in case of hosted mining you'll have to pay for all the expenses, from electricity to maintenance. And you also don't get your hands on the machines.In reality cloud mining means websites that have no miners, display some nice numbers and offers to attract unsuspecting newbies into investing and they don't pay (or even more, they ask for more money pretending you need to pay in order to get your money). Plain scams.In reality hosted mining is also dangerous since you cannot be 100% certain the host will keep his promise. I've seen stories with the host simply making some day all the miners mine to his own wallet and not answering to calls any longer. Of course, if you have a good contract and the identity of the host was real, you can start (a costly) lawsuit.As @mocacinno said: it's better to avoid both (unless you have very reliable information you can react legally if they attempt to scam you, information most won't give, or not a real one).",

Such a nice way to summarize it, while probably ignoring the majority of the issues. OP, don't get trapped by marketing words like this. Not saying they are lying, but there are dozens of businesses that scam their users in the end while promising cost-efficient mining. Even if they are honest, the risk outweighs the benefit. FYI, your link doesn't work.",

Well, you haven't even indicated which coins you are investing in, it's possible that they have nothing to do with mining, and if I were you, I wouldn't rush to invest in cloud mining, usually it's not who they pretend to be, so be careful with that. The difference between cloud mining and hosting is that in the first case you just buy virtual capacities, which may not be available from the seller, in the case of hosting, you place your devices, for example, in the nearest data center and just pay rent.",

This will attract many customers who are afraid to immediately invest, or the service will pay a reward in this way to partners who attract new users. I invested a little in such services and was deceived because the services for maintaining and paying for electricity after a year were more than the profit from mining.",
