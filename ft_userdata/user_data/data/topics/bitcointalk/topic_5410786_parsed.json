  "content": "Hello all sorry to post this here, i was reading through some articles online and i got attracted by it and i decided to share to seek different understand from those who are likely from same entity with me know if this was the cause why Nigeria is undeveloped like other first world countries?.WHO SOLD NIGERIA TO THE BRITISH FOR ¬£865K IN 1899?.This is the story of the first oil war, which was fought in the 19th century, in the area that became Nigeria.All through the 19th century, palm oil was highly sought-after by the British, for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery. Remember that Britain was the world‚Äôs first industrialised nation, so they needed resources such as palm oil to maintain that.Palm oil, of course, is a tropical plant, which is native to the Niger Delta. Malaysia‚Äôs dominance came a century later. By 1870, palm oil had replaced slaves as the main export of the Niger Delta, the area which was once known as the Slave Coast. At first, most of the trade in the oil palm was uncoordinated, with natives selling to those who gave them the best deals. Native chiefs such as former slave, Jaja of Opobo became immensely wealthy because of oil palm. With this wealth came influence.However, among the Europeans, there was competition for who would get preferential access to the lucrative oil palm trade. In 1879, George Goldie formed the United African Company (UAC), which was modelled on the former East India Company. Goldie effectively took control of the Lower Niger River. By 1884, his company had 30 trading posts along the Lower Niger. This monopoly gave the British a strong hand against the French and Germans in the 1884 Berlin Conference. The British got the area that the UAC operated in, included in their sphere of influence after the Berlin Conference.When the Brits got the terms they wanted from other Europeans, they began to deal with the African chiefs. Within two years of 1886, Goldie had signed treaties with tribal chiefs along the Benue and Niger Rivers whilst also penetrating inland. This move inland was against the spirit of verbal agreements that had been made to restrict the organisation‚Äôs activities to coastal regions.By 1886, the company name changed to The National Africa Company and was granted a royal charter (incorporated). The charter authorised the company to administer the Niger Delta and all lands around the banks of the Benue and Niger Rivers. Soon after, the company was again renamed. The new name was Royal Niger Company, which survives, as Unilever, till this day.To local chiefs, the Royal Niger Company negotiators had pledged free trade in the region. Behind, they entered private contracts on their terms. Because the (deceitful) private contracts were often written in English and signed by the local chiefs, the British government enforced them. So for example, Jaja of Opobo, when he tried to export palm oil on his own, was forced into exile for ‚Äúobstructing commerce‚Äù. As an aside, Jaja was ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù in 1891 and allowed to return home, but he died on the way back, poisoned with a cup of tea.Seeing what happened to Jaja, some other native rulers began to look more closely at the deals they were getting from the Royal Nigeria Company. One of such kingdoms was Nembe, whose king, Koko Mingi VIII, ascended the throne in 1889 after being a Christian schoolteacher. Koko Mingi VIII, King Koko for short, like most rulers in the yard, was faced with the Royal Nigeria Company encroachment. He also resented the monopoly enjoyed by the Royal Nigeria Company and tried to seek out favourable trading terms, with particularly the Germans in Kamerun (Cameroon). click the source to read more üëáüëáNB: The Source might not be accessible to everyone but could try.What are your thought about this History does it has any effect to what is happening to Nigeria today or We should blamed the Nigerian Government?Les talk about.",

The beginning of Nigeria underdevelopment is from this historical aspect. This history also give us the saying that, Europeans came to Nigeria in particular and Africa at large for their \"Goods not for their Good\". King Jaja and King Koko were the first Nationalists in African (Nigeria) colonialism. in 1884 to 1885 Africa was partition to scramble by the then world powers. The history is very long but let me stop here.",

Yes the British strategies in the administration of Nigeria was very faulty, especially the amalgamation of Nigeria, without considering the historical, political and cultural differences of the diverse ethnic groups. Yes we can affirm that the British exploited their colonies gravely. But that can never be the reason for Nigeria's economic woes. Egypt, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia,¬† Botswana, Ghana, and Malawi were all colonies of British. And we can confirm that some of these nations are doing well economically than Nigeria. One of the greatest asset of failures is complain. Nigeria have gotten almost 62 years since independence to solve it problems, yet it seems the nation is just confused. Nigeria's problem is not colonialism, it's just corrupt and visionless leaders.",

Yet they claim to have independence 62 years ago when in fact, the British government can simply seal their mouths. Colonized and¬† then simply plunder whatever resources in the region like the palm oil. We're not even talking about the other African countries yet. History is very crazy and needs to be hidden by these guys. They were also the ones who goes to America where they claimed they discover and then partitioned the vast area with other colonizers like the owned it. I wouldn't be surprise if¬† they could also manage a regime change of African countries through a supported insurgents. If it weren't for the Chinese developing¬† infrastructures, schools, bridges and rail roads,¬† Africa may not have developments still. Good to see they have leaders who voices out like Naledi Pandor who stands with Russia.",

It wasn't the only factor, after all, tribal conflicts and early arab slave trade did their part, but european colonisation and the subsuquent instability it brought to many African countries is still felt strongly to this day.",

For me, to an extent i agree to the motion that the colonial masters had and still has a role to play while Nigeria is what it is today, because Nigeria been a country of more than 100 ethnic groups, but yet only three was recognize and place into top positions in the then colonial era, of which till date those set of people still believe that Nigeria as a country belongs to them, and them alone, and by that i mean the ''Hausa & Fulani'' people. Because till date most of the top positions are been headed by the Northerners, currently in Buhari's government whereby neglecting other regions, together with visionless leaders who only go there after the money but has nothing to offer",

Nigeria's problem is not colonialism, it's just corrupt and visionless leadersBlame two things here, our corrupt leaders right from time, then the country's immaturity as at the time of demanding for indepence, all the benefits Nigerians got during the British colony aren't they far better than the current predicament we all suffers, no free education anymore, government schools pays school fees, increasing terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, religious crisis, inflation, poverty, unemployment, let me just pause here never to mind in going deep with the system of politics and godfatherism, are these all what the British taught before they left?",
