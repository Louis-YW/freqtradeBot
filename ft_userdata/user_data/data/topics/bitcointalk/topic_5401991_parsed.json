      "body": "Its not an actual effect, its a perception or speculative alteration of sentiment.   The Federal reserve cannot raise interest rates above inflation, they can only make noises to reduce the dilution of the US dollar.   Whatever they do its like clapping your hands at an errant bear, sometimes it works but the FED isnt in control thats delusional imo.  Its still going to be true that 2023 the US dollar declines at some rate of decay in its value, within ten years its easily possible to say the value will have halved which is quite incredible.    Because its gradual people are accustomed to always losing money they have earnt, I guess I would relate it to propaganda we accept it as normal when its not correct for your earnings to removed from your wallet afterwards its kinda ridiculous.    BTC is effected by negative sentiment right now but the Dollar itself is on the same negative gradient its had for decades so I only see trading themes.      Market news is always expected vs actual, surprise downside or upside.   +50 basis pts will be normal I think",
