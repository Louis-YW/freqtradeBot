Thanks.Bitcoin at heart was designed as money, now it is also true it has been a great investment opportunity during the last decade, but this is only a side effect and nothing else.Besides even if bitcoin losses its attractiveness as an investment vehicle that does not mean that it will lose its value, its value will be more stable but that will be it, so if that scenario were to happen the only thing you will need to do is to look for other assets with high volatility and invest in them if you want.",

It can be a store of value though which is what money is supposed to be.QuoteIf that happened, what's the point of making Bitcoin worldwide acceptable while losing its value and nature of Bitcoin ? Your confusion is because you think bitcoin is an investment but that was never the case. Bitcoin was created to be a currency that you use as a medium of exchange.

What is your opinion ? Please let me know. Thanks.In regards to the underlined parts of your post,  Bitcoin is more suitable for investment or for storing value long-term (Store of Value) than as a Medium of exchange. Both (MoE/Fiat  & SoV/Investment) don't really contradict each other as a lot of people don't  hold Bitcoin for too long. They exchange it for goods/fiats and services while others hold long-term. If you take away the Store of Value feature, you may nolonger be able to use it to preserve value longterm which is a very important feature of Bitcoin. You can only keep the price volatility moderate for most of the time and only allow the extreme price movement, mostly upward, once in a while. This will help ensure that it maintains its SoV or deflationary feature rather than being inflationary like fiat currencies.  Converting it into fiat currency will require hijacking it and having it massively altered in such a way that it becomes centralized and loses it important ideals that make it decentralized and safe. It will become inflationary, less transparent, opaque, mutable, non censorship-resistance . But it will be almost impossible to altered by normal people unless they just create contrary systems such as centralized platforms and get much of the world to use fake bitcoins, probably with the aim of manipulating the price or to prevent people from using Bitcoin properly and benefit from its features.",

Be aware that Bitcoin was created as a decentralized currency and its real intent is to be used regularly in our normal day-to-day transactions. It isn't happening globally because it needs to stabilize its price and there is also the regulation factor. But I wish that would become a reality one day. By that time, the whole Bitcoin capitalization would be in trillions of dollars. Not as attractive anymore for long-term HODL but you can always do leverage trading just like the current forex market.",

Governments have forced down and adopted Fiat to the people, but just because they are using it does not mean everyone actually likes it, similarly, not everyone will accept bitcoin adoption, it may go against some opinions, but that is the truth and that is how the world works, not everyone fantasizes bitcoin, not everyone like fiat either.Fiat has historically been the preferred form of payment that countries have accepted, I assumed if bitcoin would one day get to that level, it will be more of been used as a reserve than been used as means of payment and hence the nature remains the same, nothing will change like that. EL Salvador comes to my mind, despite the force and airdrops to bring people closer to bitcoin, many are still shifting away from bitcoin as a legal entity and the crash hasn't been helping their bags as well.",

Thanks.Irrespective of the growing global adoption, Bitcoin was invented for a purpose and for that purpose it would accomplish despite the challenges facing with government and other financial agencies from allowing it being adopted in their various nations. I see all these as a big solution to faster and rapid adoption of bitcoin when the time comes. Talking about bitcoin changing to another when it will be massively adopted, i doubt so if it would ever change its name or function contrary to the sole reasons for which it was invented.  Come to talk of it, what aspect of change are you referring to, are you referring to change in name or change in its function for which it was created? Well either way, i do not see any changes. If there would be any changes, it might likely be in functions and not name. Like one of the reply here says   Quote from: BALIK on December 07, 2022, 03:33:29 AMSatoshi created bitcoin intending to replace the centralized fiat system, meaning bitcoin is designed as a currency and not an investment asset. But people turned bitcoin into an investment and spread it to the next generations, and now most people only know bitcoin as an investment rather than a currency.  As you can see it above that is all the situation now and if there is any change you are referring to, it simply or likely as the quote above.Talking of fiat, i really doubt if the government of various nations would allow it fade away just like that. Each and every nation has their own currency independent of any nation so how do you think  for instance,  American would want to do away with their dollar and opt for bitcoin as a legal tender? do you think European Nation would also do same? the hell no way. These nations would want to protect their  sovereign interest.",

Investors base their reasoning on historical data that may confirm that gold is more than suitable when it comes to preserving the value of investments. Bitcoin is often compared to gold as being a good digital substitute for traditional precious metals used as a store of value. Bitcoin can be said to be an emerging means of preserving value; in this context, \"emerging\" means that its price fluctuates and is growing long-term, and eventually, it will become a proper store of value, maybe even better than gold, thanks to its unique characteristics. When it finally transforms into a new form with valuable functions, it won't stop being seen as an investment asset because people will still be eager to alleviate the consequences of an unpredictable future via reasonable investments in established stores of value.",
