Their approach can be different than Microstrategy too, and because they're a considerable smaller institutional investor than Microstrategy, their sale is not a big bomb with enough pressure to dump Bitcoin market.Do they have rights to sell bitcoins that were bought as their investment?They've full rights to do that, and it's good for any investor who was able to take profit and cash out. If Bitcoin blockchain and Bitcoin market become something that does not allow investors free rights to cash out anytime they want, it's no longer a good blockchain to use and to invest money in.",

Being a business entity, their main motivation is always profit. It’s basic - they’ll only make a profit once they sell.So, I wouldn’t be surprised if MicroStrategy (the non-Asian one) sells their holdings in the future. They’re probably waiting for a bigger profit, and they’re definitely not selling at $100k, as that milestone has already been achieved.",

That can only happen if the price of Bitcoin goes up.The same applies to Michael Saylor’s business. It’s his responsibility to ensure that shareholders gain profit when the time comes to sell. At the moment, they probably don’t see it as the right time to sell, so they’ll likely continue accumulating, of course, using shareholders' money, and eventually sell at a decent profit in the future.Every business has its own strategy, but this shows us that holding isn’t necessarily the approach for every company.",

You can't predict when they will sell; there is no profit that's considered enough for them, as it's as if they have a duration of a year they want to hold their bitcoin or they want to transfer it to their next generation. Some are holders using it as a means to escape inflation that could have affected their fiat if they had held their savings on it, so if they had a need for the fund, they would definitely sell. Meitu was just one of those companies that were looking for means to increase their revenue, which Bitcoin was the perfect option for, and once they got the profit they needed, they took it.",

Let's not also forget that these firms owe it to their investors to deliver profits and selling is the major way they can realize the profit.",

There might be a reason why decide to liquidate their position. Believe me, Bitcoin is not the only portfolio owned by Meitu. I know if we saw it from our perspective as bitcoiners. They're totally wrong to sold their BTC, but 80 millions profit is big enough especially in Asia. I personally this news doesn't have impact to the Market.
