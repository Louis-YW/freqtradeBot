I try one link and I was asked to pay fee so that I will be able to be one of the first people they would be given the airdrop coins too. If you pay any money, no airdrop coin and the money you pay is lost. Another that I know but did not happen to me because I do not do KYC airdrop at that time. It is the use of your information by scammers for phishing attack against you.",

To be honest, with other \"coins\" I have never been involved. However it seems to me that, with ETH for example, anyone could deploy any shitty code they wanted and share a smart contract with you. It is much easier to be scammed this way, I guess.",
