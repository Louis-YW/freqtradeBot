  "content": "So I went to a doctor with my kid and out of pure boredom, while she was inside, started browsing 9gag. They were having a laugh talking how the idea of NFT failed with the market crashing and all that \"going to 0\" shit and of course the discussion was sidetracked into bitcoin with the general theme being that it's also worthless like NFT and also going to 0. I read it for a second just to see how random people who spend time browsing memes see things that happen in our crypto space and I'd like to spare you all the crap and make it into some kind of a list, so here it is:Bitcoin is worthless because there's no backing, unlike with fiat that is backed by states. It just uses electricity and doesn't give anything back, it wastes energy.Most of it is owned by just a few addresses so they decide if you win or lose. It's going to 0 because it's a bubble like tulips and it's even smaller in size than tulips were.It failed in El Salvador because nobody uses it, people just wanted free coins and stopped using Chivo when they got their coins out.Only poor countries that don't know how to handle inflation will adopt bitcoin because they're out of ideas. It lost so much value in the last year so it's not a hedge against anything. Gold lost less so it's a better hedge. I used to think that people who hate technology and progress will be those who are too old to switch, like Warren Buffett or Peter Schiff, but young people who sometimes are working in tech jobs seem to rather be in fiat or gold, like the old generation. Personally, I would never be against something that gives people the freedom of choice and I'm not that young. I'd think people who are in their 20s should be backing freedom 100%, but guess not. On the other side, following the old meme, in the Internet nobody knows you're a dog. That could be a central bank employee trolling you on reddit",

People lost their minds into money, speculation, profit, greediness and more. They don't spend their time to learn about technology and what it can change the world. NFT has multiple use cases that are helpful for many industries. I disagree with the hype on NFT and how KOLs try to take advantage of their reputation and this trend to get quick money. It makes people especially lazy and greed ones forget about a true value of NFT technology.QuoteBitcoin is worthless because there's no backing, unlike with fiat that is backed by states. So having governments, central banks back behind fiat currencies, CBDCs or companies back behind stable coins will make them better than Bitcoin?The answer is No and is shown on the market. Bitcoin is the King and CBDCs, stablecoins can only look at Bitcoin with jealous eyes.Bitcoin itself does not need legal tender, legal approval from government to be transacted on its decentralized network and used by the people.",

Bitcoin has seen a fair share of controversy since its inception and despite all these, it has seen a strong growth. There will always be naysayers in the market but but doesn't matter a lot!",

Yes, there are those who will always seek out like minded people in order to validate theiropinions.  In so many cases these no-coiners refuse to research or listen to facts. They remind mepeople in the QAnon or Freemen movements or people who are anti-government oneverything. I think they will only have an influence on others with the same mindset.",
