  "content": "Dear Coders, I would like to offer a one-time reward of 0.1 Bitcoin to the first person in this thread to name a valid prime number that does NOT lie on one of the 8 axes of the Plichta \"Prime Number Cross\" (except of course the number 2 and 3 as the only known exception, see graphic and further information below). In this way, Plichta's revolutionary discovery shall finally find its way into cryptography.As far as I know, there has never been found a prime number outside this cross structure and accordingly revolutionary would be the effects on modern encryption methods like RSA, ECC or Hash.The problem: I myself have no programming background and don't know how such a proof could be presented transparently for laymen (if at all possible). Is some kind of swarm intelligence perhaps a solution here? Â Surely a piece of code would have to be written to check any number for its position on one of the 8 axes. For this attempt, the AI gave me out:\"The exact formula for determining the axis of any number in the prime cross is complex and requires deeper mathematical analysis. There is no simple mathematical function that directly calculates this assignment. It is more of a geometric and combinatorial problem.\"Infographics:https://i.ibb.co/MSQrg69/plichta-prim-number-cross-english-by-maeckes.jpghttps://www.plichta.de/plichta/images/plichta/a_raum_und_zeit_01.gifAnimated graphicMore info in english about Peter Plichtas Prime Number Cross:https://www.maeckes.nl/Getallencirkel%20(kruis)%20GB.html (very short text, first graphics from here; \"Only the prime number 3 does not meet the form 6n Â± 1\")https://nazm-quran.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-primary-council-of-dr-peter-plichta.html (short text)https://perceivebelieve.tumblr.com/post/140029085031/peter-plichta-prime-number-cross-wheel-of-24 (long text)Peter Plichta's book in english: \"God's Secret Formula: Deciphering the Riddle of the Universe and the Prime Number Code\" (1997)",

But there are plenty of documents out there discussing why it can't happen.But, if you really serious and think it can be done you should escrow the funds with someone. Nobody is going to trust a new user to pay them BTC0.1 for work without proof of funds.-Dave",
