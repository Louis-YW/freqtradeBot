  "content": "What happens to your tokens you held when you withdraw them to your bank account/paypal/etc from an exchange?I never actually thought about this, nor do I think many have. What does the exchange do with the tokens you had in your exchange wallet when you withdraw them as dollars to your paypal/bank account/etc?(my guess is they are burned forever?)I tried asking this question word-for-word the same on a reddit crypto thread and the post was immediately auto deleted and my account banned for 7 days. Lol. What is WRONG with that site??So I created an account here just to ask this question. I am curious about what the exchange actually does with the tokens you held in your wallet once you withdraw. Is it just as simple as it gets burned? Does the exchange re-appropriate it somehow else? It might be more complicated than most know. So I am curious if any experts really know.",

      "body": "Lol! Nice response. Thanks I guess?I only use exchanges for one purpose. Well two. To initially buy my crypto aka onboard from fiat money from bank account. And then to move whatever token I've been hodling to USDT to hold once it's reached gains during a bitcoin (and consequently altcoin) rally. To hold the value of the gains until the next dip in the market, at which time will be to re-buy the dip.I am not that dump Although I have profited significantly over the last couple of years using this method, I have never actually withdrawn any crypto back to my bank account yet. (no need yet). But I'm sure it's a fairly straightforward process just like it is to buy crypto with fiat money. My question was only about the technical side of how exchanges work..... because I get too curious about things!",

NO.Whenever you do make up decisions on selling your coin into USDT and would be later on to be withdrawn on fiat form or directly sell it on fiat conversion then those coins would really remaininto exchange platform because we know that sellers and buyers are present which means it is really just playing around in the hands of market makers.Exchange are really just getting revenues out of those trading fees and commissions.",

Those coins are pobably witheld too and will be used for supply in their platform in case some will buy too using that mode.",

      "body": "I think really basic question from OP about what happening with his token after withdrawing to be cash money, you will convert or trade your token to be BUSD or USDT depending exchange market support which one pair. All your token investing before buy the other people on their account exchange market. You withdraw after your coins have been sold exactly with BUSD to be your local currency money, usually Binance have support trade with several local currency pair like in my country have BUSD/BIDR.I think all your coins when trading buy the other people around the world when using global exchange market like Binance, but if you use local exchange market for trading usually your people coming from the same country have buy your coins. The same when you success trade or buy several altcoin you have taking other person who sell their coins before withdrawing to cash money.",

What if everyone on an exchange wanted to withdraw all of their money from a certain token (lets say all bitcoin, wants to immediately be withdrawn by everyone) to their bank accounts.

What happens to the exchange then? To the bitcoin tokens? Where would they go.I guess the term for this in banking world is called a \"bank run\". The bank only has 10% or so of the money actually available at any given time. So 90% of customers would be completed f****d in this scenario trying to withdraw their money. But what happens to crypto in this case?",

But what happens to crypto in this case?First of all, you need to understand about MM (Market Maker) as MM provides liquidity on both side of buy and sell option in every exchanges. So there will be buy or sell order even everyone wants to withdraw fiat into their bank account. Not only that, exchanges have fee for both maker and taker in every trade. As a result, they got so much reserve funds in their cold wallet. As you are learning about these things, i would suggest you to google or search on youtube regarding cold & hot wallet in the meantime. So exchanges won't face any problem in such situation, however market will be more volatile. Also long term hodler might take that chance to buy more if that's kind of situation occurs in worst case scenario.",

      "body": "Well, first let's see what happens when you have a normal cryptocurrency exchange (no fiat support) like Bittrex, Poloniex or Binance. The obvious answer is that those companies are not banks so they can't just hold the tokens for you.You need to know what blockchain the token is on, where is the market to sell it, and how to buy \"gas\" for transaction fees.Once it reaches your personal wallet, these new tokens can be sent wherever you want such as your bank account, or you can send tokens to other exchanges.",

But what happens to crypto in this case?You are misrepresenting the number on the exchange is an imaginary number or can be printed as they wish. Regulated centralized cryptocurrency exchange and a bank are different. The most likely scenario in cryptocurrency is when the exchange itself is a scam, thus they run with all of the customer cryptocurrencies.But let's say, I follow your hypothetical scenario, if there are no buy orders, then simply the bitcoin that everyone had will not move a.k.a not being sold, thus they can't have any FIAT. And the bitcoin is frozen because there isn't any activity. Let's say even if in one exchange the selling pressure is way bigger than the buy, well the market will reach its own equilibrium because there is an arbitrage opportunity.",
