      "body": "What eth dev scammers want to do is keep those staked eth locked as long as they can because if they move to pos, people will want them to unlock those staked eth, meaning, they dont want eth to crash below 500 usd, because if they unlock then eth will crash around 300 usd or even less, so unlocking those staked eth before the next bullrun, at pre bullrun, will give them time to contain the crash while eth 2.0 will give them hype in order to make sheeps to buy in and rise eth price, they can manipulate the market as well by buying before anybody else cheap eth and then dumping it later on. All in all, eth dev scammers can do whatever they want and idiots who staked their eth cant do anything, even if eth crashes below 300 usd, do not invest everything in it, 20% is good, it might sound crazy but things happen and eth might even crash below 100 usd again, forks are dangerous, reason btc still strong is that it rarely does hard forks, meaning less chances to break something up on the network and crash because of that. Anyway, all this is a pump and dump scam cycle and how do we know it? Did btc crash below previous ath? yes, so that is the answer.",

Coins like Tether (68BUSD) , Usd coin (55BUSD) and other stablecoins.How can you do a 51% attack with 8.3%? That makes no sense at all. You need 51% to make a 51% attack. What's your source for that 8.3% claim?https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#:~:text=in%20its%20history.-,Proof%2Dof%2Dstake%20and%20security,ETH%20(about%20%2415%2C000%2C000%2C000%20USD).PROOF-OF-STAKE AND SECURITYThe threat of a 51% attack still exists on proof-of-stake as it does on proof-of-work, but it's even riskier for the attackers. A attacker would need 51% of the staked ETH (about $15,000,000,000 USD). They could then use their own attestations to ensure their preferred fork was the one with the most accumulated attestations. The 'weight' of accumulated attestations is what consensus clients use to determine the correct chain, so this attacker would be able to make their fork the canonical one. However, a strength of proof-of-stake over proof-of-work is that the community has flexibility in mounting a counter-attack. For example, the honest validators could decide to keep building on the minority chain and ignore the attacker's fork while encouraging apps, exchanges, and pools to do the same. They could also decide to forcibly remove the attacker from the network and destroy their staked ether. These are strong economic defenses against a 51% attack.51% attacks are just one flavor of malicious activity. Bad actors could attempt long-range attacks (although the finality gadget neutralizes this attack vector), short range 'reorgs' (although proposer boosting and attestation deadlines mitigate this), bouncing and balancing attacks (also mitigated by proposer boosting, and these attacks have anyway only been demonstrated under idealized network conditions) or avalanche attacks (neutralized by the fork choice algorithms rule of only considering the latest message).Overall, proof-of-stake, as it is implemented on Ethereum, has been demonstrated to be more economically secure than proof-of-work.PROS AND CONS",

If the price continueto fall, the network will become less secure..That's not correct. Only the staked ETH will be validators. Just holding ETH in a wallet does not mean you would be validating transactions. You would either have to setup a 32 ETH validator or join a staking pool if you have less than 32 ETH to stake. IF you have 500 ETH and want to do solo staking you would have to setup fifteen 32 ETH validators. The remaining 20 ETH would have to be staked on a staking pool.And currently 10% of ETH is staked, not 8.3%. It has increased.You would need 51% of the 10% staked ETH to execute a 51% attack. There are over 300,000 validators. You would need to control more than 150,000 validators for a 51% attack. And doing this would mean your ETH could be slashed if you are a dishonest validator.
