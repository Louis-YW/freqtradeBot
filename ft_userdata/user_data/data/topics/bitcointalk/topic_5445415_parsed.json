What is your advice to people?The advantage is that you can be there and get wiser about what happens there so that you can build your own experience also. As a newbie, you may be eager to join such group hoping that it is where you make profit easily and faster but ask yourself how big is the owner of the group? He is just as a trader like you. You may be lonely as a trader but you can read online, watch trading videos.",

So, do your own research.- The admin of the group would never send you a DM. So, do not be deceived.- As soon as you feel suspicious about the activities of the group or you feel that they are derailing from the purpose for which the group was create, leave the group.",

Can there be any major disadvantage being a member of such a trading groups? What is your advice to people?Depends on the person itself, people prefer to be alone to learn or just being a silent reader to actually learn something instead of communicating via trading groups in social medias. There is nothing wrong with either two of that because if you are planning to learn something you will have the benefit to learn it and with the minus point as well.By joining trading groups, you will have more circle of people that are interested into same thing so you can discuss stuff more such as trading so you have better understanding about tips and trick in trading. But, you have also the risk of being a victim of FUD and FOMO because there are always bad side about those groups. It does have the benefit, the point is how do you filter those knowledges so you can use it in your real trading scene.",

I do not see wrong joining a legit trading community especially for beginner traders as it will open him to the realities of trading, and he can certainly learned from the experiences of other traders as long as the community or forum itself is transparent and no intentions to lure beginner traders. This is actually an advantage for them, but the bad thing is if these beginners will trade quickly because of greed of profits, once they will be tempted to use other trader’s strategies knowing some strategies may work for others but won’t work for them. It’s still best to trade on your own and learn on yourself.",

Trading can be very hard at times and even if you read books doing that in actual can be different, so asking those who already have experienced in trading is a big help. What I don’t advise is to depend that much on that group, it is still better if you can trade on your own.",

There are actually some advantages on joining a trading community, you share trade ideas, you learn from the experiences of others, you find immediate friends to support you on your trades especially when you’re devastated, and while the interest keeps growing, your learning will also not stop. However, if you join these communities to pay others to do trading for you, that is a disadvantage on your part. Although you can be stress free and trade effortless, but in the end you learned nothing and just become loser when those people who trade for you will leave the community. It’s good to engage yourself in a trading community, but never rely on them for your decision making in doing your final trades.",

Some trading groups are just a waste of time, and I cannot possibly advise a newbie to join such groups without noting some warnings.
