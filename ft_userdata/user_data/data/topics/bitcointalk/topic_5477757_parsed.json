And from your post history, you would be able to tell that you were guided on your first post here on the forum.The OP doesn't add anything useful, that's true, because all the ideas he mentioned are put in action at least since I joined back in 2017, and I'm very sure that before too. Maybe the OP meant something different with the one about the mentors? there are plenty of threads that recommend authors of books and other sources of information everyone can learn from though.But I'm not a friend of locking threads lightly, as some of them may lead to new ideas from other members that perhaps no one would have thought of until now. For instance, in this case, it could lead to a discussion about a Bitcointalk mentorship programme. I don't see it as very viable, but it is just an example.",

Specially the dreaded questions from newbies asking for financial advises.This forum has tons of information to begin with, so used it to your advantage. Just like everyday, learn a thing or to about investments, altcoins market, or what causes the price to go up and others. Just go around the forum, sort of play around with it and then familiarize yourself. And for sure you will be happy that you do that in your own capacity and in the future you might be the one answering questions for the next set of newbies going into this community.",

There are lots of credible information on bitcoin available here, all you need to is use the search engine.  If you think the forum is harsh on newcomers, you are mistaken.

The goal of this forum is to spread Bitcoin knowledge, so the community will always be pleased to welcome new members who are willing to learn about Bitcoin. No rule stops any newcomer from asking questions. There is no question that you will ask in this forum that will not attract answers and members are always willing to help newbies. The forum has enough educational material that can turn a newbie into a knowledgeable Bitcoiner. There is no information about Bit Bitcoin that you cannot find in the forum if you do a patient search. The forum doesn't support videos yet, but there are other good videos on YouTube and I recommend Andreas M. Antonopoulos's videos.Quote- Encourage newcomers to participate in discussions and ask questions.I am aware that newbies cannot post pictures but they are not restricted from engaging in various discussions. But they are always advised to read and observe more than posting. The newbie period should be a time for learning and not writing. But they can always ask questions but it should be relevant. Many questions that most newbies ask have been answered several times. These questions keep reappearing because they don't use the search option of the forum.Quote- Help newcomers find a mentor or someone they can learn from.Quote- Be patient and understanding as newcomers learn the ropes.With a little support and encouragement, newcomers can feel more comfortable and confident in navigating the crypto space.

In the start, newbies should follow everyone and should not make any mentors in the early time.He should first wait for the right time to decide whether to trust that method or not, and with time you can learn new things also. Newbies should Do their own research and never trust blindly, be skeptical about new learnings and ask questions, and try not to feel bad when some older or senior will taunt them for not doing good or doing something wrong.",
