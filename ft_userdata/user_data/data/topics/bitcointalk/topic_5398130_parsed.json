  "content": "Among the proposals, the group of eight organizations requested the Environmental Protection Agency subject PoW mining firms to “stringent reviews” around operating permits.As the crypto space continues to grow with many investors in the United States, industry leaders and lawmakers have stepped up to address issues around financial risks as well as the potential impact on the environment from Bitcoin (BTC) mining. In April, a group of 23 members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the EPA saying the “rapidly expanding cryptocurrency industry needs to be held accountable” and alleging “cryptocurrency mining is poisoning our communities.”The Bitcoin Mining Council responded with its own letter written by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor to EPA administrator Michael Regan on May 2, claiming that the group of lawmakers had mistaken several key issues. The industry leader placed the alleged misconception on “power generating facilities” causing pollution, not BTC mining itself.The New York State government is currently considering a bill that could place a two-year ban on all new PoW mining facilities in the state using carbon-based fuel to power their operations. Both the Sierra Club and Seneca Lake Guardian have pushed back against mining firm Greenidge Generation Holdings’ operations at the state’s Seneca Lake.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

His \"research\" would be laughed out of most academic circles - biased, misleading, and sometimes entirely fabricated - but there seems to be no end to the number of people who will just believe anything they read and then write to Congress about it. Vries is literally on the payroll of a bank who wants bitcoin to fail. Believing his nonsense is the same as believing all the \"research\" which showed that smoking isn't bad for you, funded and published by the Tobacco Industry. Here are some links which explain why this is all complete bullshit:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-energy-per-transaction-metric-is-misleadinghttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/elon-musk-bitcoin-environment-wrong",

What are the most impactful areas in terms of climate change? Which are the easiest to change potentially? Which can be reduced rather than fully abolished? Which can be restructured or abandoned for the sake of better options? It's best to tackle big industries and make policies that would affect many agents on the market, rather than crack down on particular things, such as crypto mining IMO. I hope that there will be enough counteraction in the US.",

Oil companies, mining companies, the military industry complex, plastic manufacturers, companies responsible for deforestation and dumping pollution directly in to rivers - these are all fine, because they sponsor our politicians, fund their campaigns, take them out for nice dinners, and so on. Bitcoin doesn't do these things, and so it is obviously by far the worst polluter in the world and must be relentless targeted, despite being a completely irrelevant and negligible fraction of even one of the companies belonging to the previously mentioned categories.You want to completely offset the entire carbon dioxide production of the global bitcoin network several times over? Stop leaving your TV and cable box on stand by. That's it. I'd like to see anyone say the same thing about Exxon or Aramco.",

Destroying Bitcoin by all possible means is what the government can only do to stop financial freedom. It's ironic how they stop crypto mining due to environment concern while the rest of the world contributes 99.999999% of pollution that worsening the climate change. I think they should propose a bill to reduce more carbon on factories to be fair on crypto mining industry.I do not see this as a big problem at all, even if the leading states ban bitcoin mining. More than 19 million bitcoins out of 21 million have already been mined. Bitcoin may well do without the remaining two million. In addition, in our world there will always be nooks and crannies where bitcoin will be mined with any restrictions.But in general, states can prohibit the mining of cryptocurrencies that use the PoW algorithm. They are not interested in a decentralized cryptocurrency. It's easier than radically restructuring their energy-intensive industries.",

Bitcoin miners have the advantage that they can set up nearly anywhere, don't need all the expensive infrastructure that other industries need, don't need to be near a population base, and so on.
