  "content": "Some people have said repeatedly about Bitcoin it would be dead – but it is not true, Bitcoin is not dead. Bitcoin has survived many bear markets and not just survived, Bitcoin has massively increased in price every new cycle. Bitcoin has survived so many 'better' Altcoins. Where are such Altcoins now, just look at Shitcoins like Tron or EOS - useless. Bitcoin has survived a ban by Xi Jin Pooh, when a lot of Hashrate was relocated. Today, Hashrate is even higher. Bitcoin is not dead, don’t fall for shitcoiners claiming it. Scamcoins like BSV have tried to impersonate Bitcoin and such scammers have failed. Altcoin lies were spread about Bitcoin but no Altcoin can compete against Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still leading by a large margin and will continue to do so. See Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin will continue to work because it is extremely reliable. Even Xi Jin Pooh could not stop Bitcoin – and Xi Jin Pooh is very powerful. Bitcoin is not dead and won’t be dead because Bitcoin is a very robust network. It is probably impossible to destroy Bitcoin. People saying about Bitcoin, it would be dead are very often spreading Altcoin lies – please don’t fall for such lies. HODL your Bitcoin. wagmi",

      "body": "Bitcoin has indeed been declared bad too many times. I think there's even a thread on Bitcointalk somewhere, dedicated to times it happened. In part, the media are to blame, as they use things like corrections to talk about the price 'plummeting' and stuff like that. But the media do what 'sells' best (is read/watched most), so it's also humanity's desire for drama, for action that drives others and resources to such things as declaring Bitcoin dead.Bitcoin is a survivor, I agree to that. But also, I think that if it can still lose more than two-thirds of its value in comparison with ATH, it's way too volatile. Furthermore, it doesn't seem that more or significantly more places accept Bitcoin now than, say, 3 years ago, so adoption of it as money isn't going very well. El Salvador is a big exception, a step forward, but it's one big step in years.",

I don't believe in predictions so I don't expect you should take mine but I doubt if Bitcoin would go lower than $17,000 this year again.",

This kind of statement \"Bitcoin is dead\" will only come from new investors and people that do not understand Bitcoin properly, Using Michael Saylor for instance, His resignation as CEO of Microstrategy to focus more on Bitcoin and advocate for Bitcoin is a good example of a person and part of people that got good understanding of Bitcoin and the purpose, looking at his long term view of Bitcoin shows he believes that Bitcoin is indeed the future of money.",
