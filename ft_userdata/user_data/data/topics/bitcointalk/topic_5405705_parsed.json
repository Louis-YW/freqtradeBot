  "content": "Hi everyone, So here is an idea I think would be fun to do and at the same time, Help us to support each other, for our individual growth on the forum. Impotant Notice:-we all are free to post comments, but when posting a count down to your next rank, Make sure to read the rules carefully and follow them, doing otherwise will have your post reported and possibly deleted by the Moderator.And also note that this program is for those that have achieved the required Activity to move to the next rank, but are lacking in Merit(s), if your have achieved the Merit(s) required for your next rank and lacks enough Activity, receiving more Merit(s) through to this program won't help you rank up immediately, but will in the long run though.IN MERIT- POST A COUNT DOWN TO YOUR NEXT RANK.Description:-This is announcing or posting -(and keeping post constantly updated)- the number of Merit(s) left to get you into your next rank.Benefits:-If you post the number of merit(s) left for you to move to the next rank here, Merit sources, Any one and Everyone watching this topic with lots of sMerit to share might decide to take a look at your post history, to find posts that are Merit worthy to Merit so as to help you ascend.Note:-Please note that you stand a better chance of being Assisted/Merited into your next rank if --you have little amount of Merit(s) left to ascend to your next rank.If your posts are of utmost quality.RULESThis program is open to all Ranks except Legendary, who are already Legends and have no other rank to attain, But Legendary ranks are free to comment/support/correct/take action on those that fail to follow the rules here. Minimum required Activity to participate in this program is 50+, any account making count down post here with less than 50 activity level will have his post reported to moderator and possibly deleted. To avoid or minimize spam, it is henceforth required that You must be a jr member rank to make a count down post on this thread - 1 merit is not so hard to earn on your own I believe.For orderliness, and to differentiate Count down Posts from ordinary comments, You are mandated to use the format below to make/create your count down post.Code:[b]My Countdown to _____ Rank[/b][b][i]Number of Merit(s) left: ?[/i][/b]It is mandatory that You must be less than 25 merits from next rank to make a count down post on this thread. As you get Merit(s), Try as much as possible to keep your count down post updated with the current number(s) of Merit left to shift you to your next rank.In order to bring spam down to its barest minimum, especially from Newbies, Only one count down post is required per user, you can always edit your count down post for your next rank if you get upgraded, that is, if your are a Full member rank and make a count down post to Senior member rank, once you get to Senior member rank, you can edit your count down post for your next rank which is Hero member rank.We know you would like your count down post to be on the last page of the thread for better visibility, but making a countdown post on every page is Spam and that's not so cool, So you are required to only ask (make a count down post) once in a 7 days period.After you have achieved your new rank, DO NOT USE THIS THREAD AS A PLACE TO ANNOUNCE YOUR NEW RANK, you can announce your new rank on Announce your rank up, merit or any achievements that makes you feel great!Failure to Adhere and comply with the above rules will result to a total boycott of your request, and you stand a chance of being reported to the mod for spamming. Rules are likely to be added or changed, but for now, make sure to read the rules above and obey them.",

Quote Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on July 09, 2022, 11:27:47 AMSo anybody with maybe 500, 200 100 merits left for their next rank are also qualified to post a count down to their next rank.

If they like, why not?, like I've said before, this is majorly a count down to your next rank thread, something fun like, if you are a full member needing 110 merit to rank up to senior member, you can post a count down of 110 merits, and as you earn merit around the forum, you can always come around here to edit your count down post by bringing 110 down according to the number of Merit you've earned in the past seconds, minutes, hours or days or weeks, just like that until 110 becomes 0, this means you've earned 110 merit and now a Senior member. I really hope you understand the explanation. Quote So there should be fixed criteria for these applications as shitposters will spam this thread as soon as it's open for all with no restriction so you need to review your criteria.I am open to suggestions, so feel free to drop some based on my explanation above, like I said before, this is majorly for fun, the merit side of it is something I added as minority, to encourage users to join.",

There was a lot of Drama with Ratimov. He has been accused of being a Merit whore by BitcoinGirl.club. Other Merit sources also criticized him countless times for sending merits to newbies. He is one of the Merit sources who sent most merits to banned users. So, I guess he is a bit depressed. He didn't close the thread yet. But, I guess he is not going to accept new applications. Better not to suggest his thread anymore.I have 12 merits left to reach my next rank. Once I sum up some of my good posts (in my opinion) and posted on a thread named Report Unmerited good post. I don't think any merit source saw that post. Or maybe those posts don't deserve merits. I noticed DdmrDdmr Mentioned me on his thread. Still, I didn't get caught in merit sources' eyes.

I will be upset if theymos introduces new rank before I reach Legendary   Why is this needed? This rank will be able to get units. Such users, who have 5000 merits + 5000 activities, are already known to everyone on this forum and their nicknames are on everyone's lips. If theymos asks me if need to introduce a new rank, I will definitely answer No (as long as I have something to strive for). I'm curious if he ever voiced the possibility of a new rank?Even though there are already several similar topics like this one, I think creating a topic [FUN][In Merit] Post Count Down To Your Next Rank Here] would not be superfluous at all. The rest, like [Merit] ]Help newbies and those who have a little left to the next rank, are almost inactive, which, in my opinion, is bad. On forum should be able to receive additional merits, when users are just a little bit up to a new rank. But there must be some criteria, as aysg76:Quote from: aysg76 on July 09, 2022, 11:45:37 AMSo there should be fixed criteria for these applications as shitposters will spam this thread as soon as it's open for all with no restriction so you need to review your criteria.",

Although actually you have a number of rules and limitations, but I think your hand should be stronger than the hands of other users. I mean you are not a merit source and it will make it difficult for you to appreciate other users' posts because you only get 1 sMerit out of 2 merit you receive from other members. Even if you rely on merit source to specifically review those users without sending a link to their post, then it will just waste a lot of time for them. I'm sure many of them won't bother to do it, but I actually support your idea. Just my two cents.But by the way, congratulations to your Hero Member.",
