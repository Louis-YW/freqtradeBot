In fact, most of traders that I have followed what they do first is predict BTC moving after that they start to analyze the altcoin. Bitcoin waves is real. Good Luck",

If you find BTC market is slow in crypto space, I am afraid that you may not find any other asset suitable for futures trading as in my opinion bitcoin market alone is too volatile compared to any other cryptocurrencies.",
