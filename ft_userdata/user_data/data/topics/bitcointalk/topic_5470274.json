It is design by Satoshi already to be almost perfect. And we are on the brink of another bull run next year, so regardless, money is going to flow in the ecosystem for that matter.I guess someone has it's own motive behind to push this kind of narrative.

First, it does not involve miners directly in consensus or use merge-mining in any of its variant forms. Second, it uses multisig and escrow bonds to create a second layer proof-of-stake system on top of Bitcoin. Third, it does not require any changes to Bitcoin in order to deploy.Quote from:  franky1things to noteethereums market just shadow traced bitcoin markets movements which shows ethereum does not have its own independent community/utility. ether clowns know they are dependant on bitcoin.bitcoiners know that many bitcoin subnetwork bridges are crap. many failures many broken promises.so now they want to join ethereums more successful subnetworks with bitcoinhowever mainstreaming bitcoin does not and should not rely on one \"solution\"being dependant on one solution usually is a pathway to centralisation of middleman controlso then that must mean you're a supporter of not only Spiderchain but also Bip-300 aka Drivechain.

Might as well invest in ethereum...Botanix Labs took those conclusion --Bitcoin need EVM -- based on the argument that Bitcoin will not fulfill it's potential just by becoming a decentralized currency, it also need to be listed in a commodity and security market, and I tend to disagree with that. Originally Bitcoin was made as peer-to-peer payment sytem to counter the hegemony of Governments controlled currency and IMF, and that's enough purpose for people to adopt Bitcoin. Adding another goal like make Bitcoin Commodity and Security will distract the main purpose, while it's not yeat achieved. And more over, currently with all the speculators buying bitcoin to gain profit, some poeple already consider it as a commodity",
