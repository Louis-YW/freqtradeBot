      "body": "Well, there are still a lot of micro tasks ways in 2023. I found an article when searching for ways to earn crypto and realised there are plenty of websites where you can do micro tasks and get paid. More exactly: - Learn & earn for crypto - Use presearch browser - hunt for crypto airdrop- freecash.com, cointiply.com, freecryptorewards.comÂ  - odysee's earn by watching videos - faucets - freelance for crypto - play p2e games And there are even more in the article above wrote by coindoo.com. I think the industry just became a bit more mature and the micro tasks are a bit harder, but for a bigger rewards as well.",

      "body": "It's clear that the micro earnings industry has taken a hit in popularity lately, but with the continued growth of cryptocurrency, there's a good chance that we'll see more people getting interested in earning small amounts of crypto without having to invest much. After all, who doesn't love the idea of earning a little extra cash with minimal effort?To make these micro earnings tasks more appealing, I believe that companies could step up their game by creating fun and engaging tasks that offer rewards that are actually worth the effort. Maybe they could partner up with other companies to offer users exclusive discounts or deals for completing certain tasks.",

      "body": "Good topic for discussion. I remember golden times of micro earnings with nostalgy. Back then it was really possible to earn money without any skills. In prime time of faucets I was making not bad money, something similar what I now get from signature campaigns.Now judging from activity in this board, micro earnings niche looks more or less dead. I have no idea how it would be possible to revive it. I looked at image that you added and maybe it can be somehow related with AL? How exactly? Don't know, but people are very creative and maybe they will find ways how to monetize AL, what is hot topic now.",
