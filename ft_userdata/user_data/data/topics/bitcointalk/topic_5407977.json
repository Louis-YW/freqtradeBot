  "content": "1HoDLCLUB customizable ingotsHello everyone ! i hope you all are fine !!  Today I open this post to measure the interest on a project that I had in mind for a while, it is a project that will give everyone the possibility of having a customizable BTC 1HoDLCLUB collectible !I think you all remember the 1oz Bitcoin ingots project! this piece had been much appreciated by the community.I would like to redo an ingot but this time a little different, it would be to make an ingot that would be in brass or copper plated in 2 tone gold and silver with the \"B\" of Bitcoin in Orange enamel. It would be bigger than the 1oz Bitcoin ingots, the size is not yet defined but we are talking about 4-5 times the size of the original.unlike the 1oz Bitcoin ingots you could choose which will be laser engraved on the front of the ingots, example bellowThe front customisable laser graving gonna be maximum of 14 caracters !for the back part as on the 1oz Bitcoin ingots there was the laser engraved BTC address, for this version you will have the choice of the first Bit of the Vanity address! example belowthe number of customizable characters is not yet defined, in any case 5 characters after the \"1\"! confirmation to comethe expected denomination is 0.005 BTC! I was also thinking of numbering each ingot from 1 to 210! but that is yet to be confirmed!it would be a pre-sale, the production time should not exceed 1 month! This will of course depend on the fundraising time!Actually it is a question of measuring the interest! the start of the project will be if 100 ingots are pre-ordered! the mint will be limited to 210! if the 100 ingots are reached the pre-sale will be closed 7 days later!I chose brass or copper as the material because it will be more accessible to large numbers, it will take $100 per ingot + the loading of 0.005 BTC! [this will be confirmed according to interest once I have requested a quote!]the design presented is not final! there could be modifications which will of course be presented before the opening of the pre sale thread!this is about offering a unique piece to each of you! whether for you or to offer it to a loved one or friend!I am of course open to your suggestions! if you have any, do not hesitate to say it here!while waiting for your messages, I wish you all a good day / night and thank you all for your support and trust for more than 1 year now!",
