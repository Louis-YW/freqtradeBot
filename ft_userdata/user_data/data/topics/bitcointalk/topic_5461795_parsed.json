  "content": "First, forgive me if by any chance, it happened that this has been suggested before now, i tried searching but found nothing..So i was just think.. How about an option to add more user(s) of your choice to co-moderate a your self-moderated thread alongside yourself (the op)?That is i create a self-moderated thread, and i have the option of choosing one, two, or three more users of my choice to join me in self-moderating that thread, just incase if there be any time i (the op), for some reason couldn't come online for a long time, i can trust that the thread wont be derailed with shitposts, somethings outside the real purpose the thread.And yeah, there could be option to remove a co-moderator just incase they turn a bad leave on the forum..What do you guys think?..",

I don't know how it works, but most times I feel like moderators give less attention to self-moderated topics, as the OP has already committed himself or herself to keeping the thread clean, and the OP is the person who knows what exactly is expected to be seen on the thread and could be considered off topic. So when I come across posts that appear in self-moderated threads, I usually ignore them.",

If you check through the thread history on the gambling board, you will always realize that threads under the gambling board always have a greater number of responses compared to other boards. I guess the OP of this thread has raised an issue regarding that before, which makes almost all his threads under the gambling sections self-moderated to reduce the number of shitposts as much as he can.",

In the past, i always argued that, sooner or later, we'd get new forum software (epochtalk) and that meddling with SMF's sourcecode to implement even more custom code wasn't that good of an idear... There was even a time i was running an epochtalk instance so i could make bug or feature requests in the repo (not that this ever happened tough). But when i look at the repo now, i see the last release was allmost 3 years ago, so i wonder if it might be a good idear to start asking for changes on SMF again (since the new forum software doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon).",

Especially since there are much more important things to implement, like 2fa for example. You never know if PowerGloves will develop a patch to solve this. If I am not wrong, he already coded the 2FA patch, and I don't know where he is now. Not sure if theymos will implement these patches. But I feel like this development could be helpful for some mega threads. Gambling discussions have some self-moderated threads, but the creator rarely moderates those. Sometimes people post nonsense and don't even know what they are talking about. WO thread will be benefited, and infofront might appoint some members to keep it clean. If this happens and infofront appoints some forum police, Twitter posters will be in trouble.",

What you can consider a quality post might not be up to the standard of another user. Therefore, if you add some users to moderate your post, they might delete some content that may be worth leaving in the thread.
