  "content": "Alik BakhshiPutin is the shepherd of the Russian world      President Putin has earned himself a reputation as a defender of Russians unwittingly stranded abroad after the partial collapse of the Soviet empire. All of them are discriminated against by the new authorities, and this is primarily reflected in the fact that today millions of Russians are forced to learn the language of the people among whom they live. And this is contrary to common sense, because in the Soviet Union everyone communicated perfectly in Russian without the need for knowledge of the language of the indigenous people. After all, any Latvian, for example, probably knew the great Russian language, so why was it necessary to artificially create a situation in which the Great Russians turned out to be second-class people. A similar situation, which offends the great Russian people, is developing to a greater or lesser extent throughout the entire post-Soviet space. The Russian people, who, at the cost of self-sacrifice, freed the once former colonial peoples from freedom, introduced them to their culture, taught them a rich Russian language, finally gave them writing, today they are forced to endure undeserved bullying, namely bullying, otherwise it is impossible to call the fact that a Russian person forced to learn Estonian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, or some other language, if he wants to achieve a prosperous existence while living in the respective countries. It should be noted that for some 20 years of independence, a young generation has appeared in these countries that does not know the Russian language at all, which carries a geopolitical threat to the Russian world, so to speak on a global scale.     We know from the laws of physics that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Putin was forced to take it upon himself to protect the Russian world and started with Ukraine, although he should have started with the Baltic states, where the percentage of the Russian population is much higher than in Ukraine. But unfortunately, the Balts turned out to be more efficient, unlike the Ukrainians, and managed to register themselves in NATO, which temporarily delayed Putin's concern for their compatriots there.    However, it should be noted the inconsistency and somewhere even Putin's double approach to the problem of protecting the Russian world. The fact is that millions of citizens of the Soviet Union, due to economic circumstances, were forced to leave the country in the 90s. For example, in Israel, the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is as much as 20% (in Ukraine 17.28%), that is, the same number as the Arabs, of which 20.8%, but they, like the Russian-speaking population in the Baltics, are discriminated against. If the Arabs have public schools where teaching is conducted in Arabic, not to mention the fact that Arabic is the second state language in Israel, then the Russians are deprived of all this. Similar to the conditions prevailing in Latvia, where one cannot find a decent job without knowledge of Latvian, in Israel it is also impossible to get a job without knowledge of Hebrew or Arabic. It is outrageous and even wild in some places that the Russian-speaking citizens of Israel, who are only half Jewish, do not have the right to marry. The question of giving the Russian language state status has been repeatedly raised in the Israeli parliament, but to no avail.      Putin, if he really undertook to defend the Russian world, is simply obliged to take effective measures, especially since quite a few Russian-speaking citizens of Israel are also citizens of Russia, otherwise in a short time under such conditions the Russian world in Israel will disappear without a trace. By the way, Israel is not a member of NATO. The flagrantly disenfranchised position of the Russian-speaking population of Israel can only be corrected by the appearance of their tamnets, and if Putin is really the shepherd of the Russian world, he should take advantage of the fact that a Russian soldier is today in neighboring Syria. History gives Putin a chance to become the Second Moses and save the Russian world in Israel. In short, millions of Russian Israelis are waiting for the referendum.    11/24/17",
