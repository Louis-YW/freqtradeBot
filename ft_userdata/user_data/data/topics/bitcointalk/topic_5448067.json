      "body": "Satoshi wanted a technology that could allow ordinary people to be in control of their finances in a digital financial environment, and so he created Bitcoin as an open source so that anyone could use it. Bitcoin started as a joke to people because, when it got Lounched, it was worthless. Satoshi's intention was not to creat a stable coin.Traders are taking advantage of the Bitcoin volatility because they buy at a low price and sell when the price is going up again. Future traders are also taking advantage because they just make predictions of the price movement, and when the market goes in their predicted direction, they will be making profits. So the volatility of Bitcoin is also a good thing.",

Is it not better than being a stable coin that depreciates in value? Bitcoin has limited supply, it has more demand as the adoption continues and yet a peer-to-peer means of transacting money. It is just perfect, a reason I was thinking Satoshi is never a single person, but I could be wrong.",

Bitcoin was not created to make anyone rich, though its main purpose was to give people financial freedom, and yes, early believers made money from it, but we shouldn't see it as a get rich scheme to avoid being disappointed. BTW, not all stabble coins are centralized; there are many decentralized stable coins that are pegged to the real value of the dollar. USDT is not safe.",

Secondly, if Bitcoin had been stable  just like the many other fiat currencies, I assure you nobody would have given a damn about it today, but it's simply because it's different, that's why today everybody now wants to own a whole or fraction of bitcoin.",

Just because a currency is a stablecoin no mean say e dey centralized but then Bitcoin couldn't have been a stablecoin from the beginning because it had no value or collateral backing the value to be equal to $1 per Satoshi or Bitcoin. It would had been an imaginary currency backing like most of the stablecoin wey we get today wey no get reserved of their market cap to make $1 of their stablecoin redeemable for real $1. Like if them wan sell all the USDT wey dey available, USDT no get the reserve backing to make that possible and Bitcoin wouldn't have had that without been associated with the same fiat system wey Satoshi dey try rescue us from. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to the fiats system, Satoshi focus was on currency that's decentralized but him too been understand say to make Bitcoin a store of value it need get some asset attributes and na why all this others qualities need come in like fixed supply, not pouring all coins into circulation at ones and the ability to increase in value through trading. If the community see a need for a Bitcoin backed stablecoin like real one og and  on the Bitcoin blockchain, dem go work on am but for now na the volatility and everything that is currently associated with Bitcoin dey make am sweet and interesting, so Satoshi was right making Bitcoin in this way.",

So I have been wondering why bitcoin was not created as a Stable coin?I think the whole concept behind creating bitcoin as a volatile and decentralized  currency was that no one can actually dictate the outcome of it.  Bitcoin not been stable has really made the technology stand out from every financial currency,  with bitcoin one can actually say that the value of their coins still remain same as inflation doesn't affect it and no government can actually control your funds as you are the sole owners of your own coins. Bitcoin has been really helpful to mankind especially to people who have been enslaved by the so called fiat currency of the banks.",

The volatile nature of bitcoin makes some persons to look for a kind of safe heaven when the market is bad to protect their assets, so that's where stablecoins come in, to minimize the volatility of crypto assets. Satoshi has good reasons for making bitcoin unstable, aside putting the finance of individuals in their hands, the unstable nature of bitcoin has also help to enrich lives. This is a coin that starts trading for few cents about a decade ago but it's currently trading at $28k today and an ATH of $69k, so you can imagine the rate of appreciation over the years.",

The truth is that Satoshi may not have intended it to serve that purpose only, but rather to assist people in finding a means of livelihood through trading. Simply buying low and selling high when prices rise. There should be more to consider as to why it is not stable, but the perfect answer can only be provided by the inventor only.",
