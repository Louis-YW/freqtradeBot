I do an in-depth research of a project before putting a piece of my cake (capital) in it. However, I would also commit that sometimes, even after doing aggressive research and paying extreme attention to the team and the project, I still lose as they turned scammers and sometimes I didn't receive the tokens and the team scammed, while sometimes it got dumped by early investors for quick profits (though the projects were rock solid).",

It‚Äôs okay to be skeptical about new investments, even though skepticism may cost you some investments that may turn out to be successful, I believe it‚Äôs better to play safe than be sorry. These kind of investors do not fall prey to scams and are very industrious with their money.",

I can say that I am a research investor and that's just being responsible with my investing. I've learned a lot of mistakes in investing and even became a victim of a few scam before until I've finally realized how to determine them. Being young in investing is an advantage and you get the beauty of it. Taking risk is easier and you'll not be scared of what's ahead and possible going to happen to your one investment. It's sad to see that there really are those ponzi investors and no matter how many times they became a victim of those scams, they won't just stop.",

I don't engage in Ponzi, I don't have such a big money to invest and I don't have such patience and money for the research that will fetch me later money. All I have money for is the investment that will give me the opportunity to make little money by buying shares in other companies. It is a little share, must not be big, it's a means to secure the future, so better than doing nothing.I believe that I like your type and that it is similar to mine. I invest the smallest amount that I am able to invest in order to make a profit and avoid being greedy enough to invest in any other ponzi schemes. I am aware that investing a larger sum of money yields greater returns than investing a smaller sum, but you have to be able to do so; you can't invest all of your savings and have nothing left over for any other financial needs.Every investor starts small and grows into a large investor over time. You can buy in any quantity you have and retain your coin for a long period of time to maximize your profit with no issues.",

This is the person who thinks about get-rich-quick schemes. People might think that this set of investors doesn't exist, but I can confirm that there are people that are addicted to Ponzi scheme investors. Regardless of how much they lose, immediately they see another Ponzi firm they will still put their funds. They are impatient people that want to make a profit without any stress or delay. I have a friend that dislikes investing in Bitcoin because he thinks it is a waste of time. He prefers investing in businesses that promise large profit within a short time.QuoteThe researcher investorThe researcher investor wants to conduct thorough investigation before deciding whether to invest.They might even decide against investing altogether since, if you wait to make a decision until you know everything, you might never invest.I assume I fall in this category. These sets of investors will always want to study the business comprehensively so that they can know the details and technically of the business. They are slow decision-makers and less risk-takers. They prefer not to invest, than to invest in an unknown terrain. Sometimes they miss viable opportunities because of their thoroughness and attention to detail.",
