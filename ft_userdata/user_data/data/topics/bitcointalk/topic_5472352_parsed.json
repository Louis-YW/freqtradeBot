It is just like bank transfer fees for traditional currency. Also it is not just any coin needed for gas fee but the parent coin for that network, like every token on bnb smart chain needs bnb, while that on Ethereum network needâ€™s Ethereum. My guess is this is done to increase the adoption or demand rate for the parent coin on that network",

Like if you wanted to buy with USDT then convert your USDT with MATIC with no fee. Yeah, you don't have to pay any type of fee but maybe when you will withdrew it from the exchange. Well, if you still need 0.2$ worth of Matic then I can help you just send me your Matic address and you don't have to return me 2 USDC. if you are okay with it then share it and I will send it you",

The OP said he is new to crypto so i doubt that he is aware of the functionality of centralized exchanges. Binance can be complicated to use for a novice as they offer almost every crypto related service the industry can offer. He doesn't have $0.20 to pay for gas fees that he needs to use to send his stablecoin somewhere so i don't think he has the money to make a deposit in a centralized exchange to buy some matic and withdraw it to his wallet.",

IF ANYONE WILLING TO HELP ME I WILL RETURN YOU 2$ IN USDC Dear, I can understand that you are new to the crypto industry, and you are facing some issues but asking for help with funds is not wise, even if it's not a big amount, if you are using a centralized exchange you can use the option to convert small amount into any other coin.Still, 0.2$ is not a big deal, I can help but my friendly advice is that if you do not know how all these blockchains work and facing serious gas fee issues prefer using a centralized platform to keep your funds and learn about the rest, Once you are done learning Imediatly move your funds. It's not wise to even hold funds in Exchanges but if your amount is Lower than a certain value better hold on the exchange. It will assist you in saving gas fees, and also you won't face any of such incidents.",

Unfortunately, this does not necessarily have anything to do with a lack of know-how; it has also happened to me that I had too few coins (e.g. ETH) to pay the gas fees for another coin. Especially when it comes to such small amounts, this is extremely annoying, as you probably already pay significantly more withdrawal fees on an exchange if you have to buy more coins. So I can understand why OP is asking if someone could help him out.",
