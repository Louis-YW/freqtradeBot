Nigeria has crude, the largest in Africa, but they continue to depend on foreign nations. Quote from: https://punchng.com/forex-crisis-marketers-propose-n720-litre-suspend-fuel-imports/?ampOil marketers, on Sunday, indicated that the cost of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, would rise to between N680/litre and N720/litre in the coming weeks should the dollar continue to trade from N910 to N950 at the parallel market.They also hinted that dealers seeking to import PMS were being forced to put the plans on hold due to the scarcity of foreign exchange to import the commodity.The warning came barely one week after the local currency crossed the N900/dollar ceiling, with the naira selling at over 945/dollar at the parallel market on Friday.Oil dealers said the CBN Importers and Exporters official window for foreign exchange, which boast of a lower exchange rate of about $740/litre, had remained illiquid and unable to provide the $25m to $30m required for the importation of PMS by dealers.",

Em d so pitiful that the giant of Africa wey claim to be no get no single refinery up till this moment. Despite all the money wey we get for the country, none of our leaders wey em don bother for em heart to reason sae, it's time for the giant of Africa to have a working refinery. All of them prefer to d refine our God-given crude oil for abroad, and import am back go give at high price. No be wickedness be that? If you check the world crude oil exporting countries and number of active refinery wey dem get, you go see sae Nigeria no get one. You can check it out on the link provide to know how many active refinery wey countries for the world gethttps://www.nairaland.com/7783216/crude-oil-exporting-countries-numbers After you don check on the list finish, now as yourself whether those countries wey get refineries richer than us for us to have a refinery of our own. Having said that, peso know no when the cost of living go decrease a bit. Naso em go d increase d go. It's now wey Nigerians enter the real shege banza for Tinubu hand. I just pray make the Tribunal judgment wey go happen next month be in favor of peoples choice president. If not the hardship continues to another 8years(God forbid sha).",

As long as APC remain in power, we should not expect anything different. From 2015 till date, na so so bad news we hear... from one problem to the other. According to Vanguard, more people were killed in Nigeria  during Buhari's eight years in office than in any other country where there was war. Now this one don come to kill the remaining Nigerians through hardship and suffering. I just pray people do not turn to massive crime as a quest to survive.... if that happens, anarchy is in sight.",

It's really pathetic say the price of goods dey increase every day as a result of an increase in the price of fuel, and yet the salary of the common masses remains constant like a stable currency, because for me, I see this as a deliberate act to make the rich gets richer, while the poor getting poorer with these unfavorable laws, resulting to lots of persons seeking different alternative to electricity,  such as the recent conversion of petrol gen to liquefied gas and high demand in solar system, which if this new price of #720 persists, it will double the price of goods and services.",

      "body": "As a matter of fact, where the problem lies is that Nigeria is a consuming nation. Virtually everything we use is imported into the country even the least things we need import are imported so tell me how does the economy be stable.  We have no working or functional refinery to refine our crude instead we sell our crude oil or swap for refined products and still import it with loss. The cabals are just using this country as their football pitch where they could just host a match sit and watch how it goes. Sorry to say this Nigeria is a laboratory where experiments are done and the results are put on trial to see the outcome and reactions of her citizens.With regards to the electric cars you have said OP. If fuel alone would cause such an uproar is it the electricity that is epileptic that you would depend on to power your electric car and bike? How often do you have electricity power supply? Do you think there is any charging taminal for such if it gets drained of power on high way? Or is it the one that you will be given over estimated bill for what you did not consume monthly?Nigeria is not yet set to even be independent. What is it with all these over dependence on foreign import yet we claim we are independent and we cannot even produce to export so as to have a balanced economy. Currency being devalued everyday. Poor salary structure for civil servants but yet on them the nation's economy and administration is managed.What a nation!!",

After Akpabio go still send \"prayer\" enter email   Dem just dey chop our money without doing anything. Na common sense say if you allow pressure on anything, the thing go begin do somehow. E dey for human being too, like if you make somebody important, na God's grace the persin no go cut of your nose and in this case dollar dey do sakara for naira. Na simple demand and supply rule na. Demonitize dollar, Naira go begin get value naturally. You want to deregulate when you are not producing anything, where dat one dey happen. The country solely depend on importation that is the only problem. Artificial deregulation is defined as when government dey carry their hand fix price",

Even gas price has also increase, the question now is that how much more can Nigerians take?  In Nigeria fuel price control and determine the price other commodities and also determine the services in the country. So any hike in fuel price affact greatly everything in the country. The increment of fuel pump price is nothing but it is a well calculated plan by the marketers to suffer the citizens. Because I can also still vividly remember on the national TV station AIT Politics Today in the year 2013/14 when the then president increase fuel price by removing fuel subsidy, an Economist, a financial analyst came out and said, even without the subsidy, the marketers can sell their fuel and have the gain of #5 on top as a profit they will still make it well. Which means the increase of it to this high price is a wicked act of the marketers for excess profit. You have said what I was thinking. The price of fuel will climb to 1k per liter. And we should not worry, everything will be stable. Fuel is going to be a thing of the past, electricity mobilization is going to take place and for home uses, solar system will do that for us. But the only problem wey we go get bi say, Niger Delta go suffer for solar, because of the weather condition in the region. And that cannot withstanding, gas is going to do it's work. Let me tell one thing, Nigerians are talented. There was a time, mechanics in Nigeria in the Goodluck Jonathan time produce Generators without fuel. And they were using it to power their house, and National House of Assembly dat stop that invention in the country because of di fuel marketers heard it sponsored a bill to stop di process. So this hardship will bring back many things again.",
