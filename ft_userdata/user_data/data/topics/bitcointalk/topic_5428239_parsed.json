  "content": "Due to the amount of bad news coming out about Binance people are panicking. Based on this report,QuoteSo I think he's higher now, because of what happened with Ftx, People don't trust the centralized exchange. And now it's the grass of FUD on Binance, Even though we think they are solvent as a matter of fact their assets are at 97% collateral which is a good number. There are also news that have come outQuoteThe CEO CZ is also included in this article, actually this investigation they are doing in Binance started in 2018. So it has been a long time, maybe we still need to gather a lot of evidence. But binance has an answer to this, because the news media spread this news and Binance said that their information (REUTERS) is wrong because,QuoteAnd Gambaryan also said (He is the Global head Intelligence and Investigation of Binance)QuoteAnd another thing that added to the fear was the withdrawal of Justin Sun.QuoteHowever, people because of the amount of bad news they hear about binance will think that maybe the whales are fleeing, because there is an issue with binance, that's how it used to be.And Lately, to calm the crypto market fear Justin Sun deposited 100M$ in binance again.QuoteSo, this is another Fud that the critics just magnified. What do you think?Reference: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/13/binance-withdrawals-surge-as-concerns-about-its-reserve-report-spook-traders/Reference: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/12/us-prosecutors-look-to-charge-binance-and-cz-for-possible-money-laundering-violations-reuters/Reference: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/13/justin-sun-looks-to-calm-crypto-market-fear-as-bnb-falls-8-withdrawals-continue-on-binance/",

      "body": "If the POI of Binance of 1:1 is true, there shouldn't be any problem with funds while people are withdrawing their money. For now, this allegation against Binance needs proof.  Unless the evidence is founded, these are just an act of pitchforking Binance and FUD'ing its ecosystem to crash the Binance market.  It is quite interesting, I think someone is behind all of these incidents.With regard to the money laundering case, this is just a plan of US prosecutors but hasn't been filed because they need solid evidence for this.  This makes me think, is this a counter on the backing out of CZ to support the now collapsed exchange FTX?",

If this is another attack from whales trying to destabilize a good exchange then we should be more careful now, and Binance will face a big challenge here. Again, we should not hold huge amount of money on any exchanges, the bear market right now is still powerful and if this news becomes worst, we should expect the worst as well.",

I think that they'll be able to overcome it. As long as you've got billions of assets that you can liquidate at any moment and sell for cash and then use it to clean your reputation, that's possible.They're a big company and talking about good reputation, that's what CZ wants for his ventures.",

Kucoin after fuds, is still operating well. Crypto.com is fine but need more time to verify.Binance is a newest exchanges under fud attacks. Latest days, I read news about Binance and there are not enough information for me to consider they are legit or not legit with their statement.Their audit with AuP (Agreed-Upon Procedure) is a short procedure for audit with agreement between customer and audit company about what point the customer want to be audited. It is a partial audit and not full audit. However it is one of procedures can be used for auditing.97% or 101% is not much big different but it has been exaggerated to attack Binance.I will wait for more information in coming weeks but it is good at the moment to avoid storing money on exchanges, not only on Binance exchange.",
