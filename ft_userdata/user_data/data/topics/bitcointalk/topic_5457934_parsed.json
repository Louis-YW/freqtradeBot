From July 15 onwards, new registrants to ku-coin will have to complete KYC verification compulsorily.And those who are already registered but have not done KYC verification, their deposit address will be closed. But one word of hope is that you can withdraw funds.According to Kucoin official statement, they are going to take this approach to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing etc. I personally used to like Ku-coin a little because without KYC verification my tasks could be completed but from now on it might not be possible here.

But will follow what they require since so far I only trust two exchange and kucoin is my second option so to continue using their service I might follow what they tell us to do. Since its risky to go on unreliable exchange since we know that they can fake volumes and scam us.",

Usually with these moves from exchanges, the users can't do anything against it. Whether we like it or not, the choices we only have is to comply or not to comply and leave. Despite being one of the longest exchanges to apply the no-kyc rule, at some point many have thought that this time will come.Quote from: ultrloa on June 29, 2023, 12:51:52 PMSince its risky to go on unreliable exchange since we know that they can fake volumes and scam us.I agree, some new exchanges aren't pressured by this change and they may still allow users not to comply with kyc but you'll never know if the volume is genuine on them.",

Personally i have verified my account long back because of the tier level and i care less about the current situation .",

Yeah, I tend to agree, and what do we expect here about those centralized exchangers regarding the KYC procedure?All of these are just because of regulatory compliance, our government keeps combating illegal activities mentioned by the OP, and the only way to increase the KYC procedures.  Because for them, KYC procedures help exchanges adhere to these regulations and the way to become their business legal. IMO, as long as there is a decentralized platform that can we use when buying and selling our crypto if our concern is our privacy, go to the P2P exchange which helps you to stay private. So what next to the Ku-coin exchange?",

I think this move is inevitable since they will need to follow to AML policy to regulate their customers or else they might have issue with the regulators. Almost all centrlized services is already impementing KYC which makes this kind of move normal already. Actually, I’m still impressed to Kucoin for delaying this update while other competitor is already implementing this feature.We have no choice and also most of us here surely undergo KYC on some crypto services when we want to convert our crypto to fiat.",
