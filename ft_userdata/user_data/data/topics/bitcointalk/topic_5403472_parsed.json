  "content": "I'd like to monitor some BTC address balances. Since bitcoin core does not provide such feature I was thinking about a separate electrummx server or something similar. But I see that these solutions require to have transaction indexing turned on and in consequence bitcoin core database cannot be pruned. Is there any open source solution I can use on a tiny server without the necessity of having a not-pruned node?It is acceptable for it to start with a full node for initial indexing but then I'd like it to update using pruned-node data. Any chance?",

But if you only have a clear fixed list of addresses you may have a chance.If the addresses are few, EPS may do.On EPS readme I've also found out about BWT, which may also be useful for you. I've never used it though.I'll add that I've had some small experience with EPS and I've found it unpleasant to set it up.",

But full UTXO database is still kept in chainstate DB in pruned node, isn't it?If so, what is the technical problem of making a sum for a given address?My answer was based on the fact that whenever you change the wallet (not to a new one) in a pruned Bitcoin Core you have to download everything again.Also afaik getbalance returns 0 for addresses not in your wallet.However, when I've done more research I've found somewhat contradicting info.According to this answer, all UTXO are indeed kept in pruned data.While chainstate does contains the UTXOs, there are no addresses there, it's scriptPubKeys (and amounts) (see here and here)Clearly scriptPubKey doesn't necessarily translate to an address, but that may not be a big problem. Even more, a tutorial here tells how to extract the data.One show stopper may be the fact Level DB doesn't like concurrent access from multiple apps, hence you may have to use the chainstate while bitcoind is stopped, or keep a copy for the job...",

It looks promising. I'll try to run levelDB instance on working node data with chainstate directory exposed as read only.I suppose I need to discover how to recognize new records on updates and learn how to convert scripts to addresses.But luckily LoyceV linked something interesting...",

Just make a C library that exports the particular details that you need from the chainstate, and make the library a build-time dependency of Bitcoin Core, so that they get compiled together.So that accesses to LevelDB from your library will still use Bitcoin Core's internal locks.",

It's easier and faster....Just if fresh / up-to-date values are important for OP he may have to do this either on every new block coming, either for each call he makes.It really depends on OP needs.From what I see OP wants to just do tests. If he goes on this route and wants to switch afterwards to full blockchain, and maybe txindex too, the effort done now may be for nothing.So now, with fresher head, I think that ardb should still consider going for full data from start.",

Yes.Just because you CAN does not mean you SHOULD.For a thought experiment fine.
