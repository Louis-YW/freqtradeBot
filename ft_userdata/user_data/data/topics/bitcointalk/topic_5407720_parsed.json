Most probably they didn’t anticipate this one, and now the sanctions are hitting their back, hopefully they can find the alternatives since Russia is not the only one who export the gas though it’s pretty cheap but EU have no more choice but to look for alternatives and a better solution.",

Yes, in the long term. For now politicians need to put their environmental ideal and the well-being of the people in the short term on a scale and decide.In my opinion, this is not about surviving, it is about living. I have never been in Europe but I assume people there are accustomed to a fairly high living standard (which requires energy) they have taken for granted, Putin knows it.This is about using gas as an economical/political weapon to damage the life of the average European citizen, make them stop living and turn them to \"survival mode\", in other words, decreasing that living stardard.",

Of course, alternatives are being explored but I doubt they could be available for use right away. So there's really no other way but reduction on its use. At the very least, however, it's voluntary. Also, it's just 15% reduction. So if we could deduce something from this, it suggests that the situation is not that dire that it's a matter of survival.",

And we have seen cars powered with water thats a good option.Know why they  couldn't approve that? Maybe the powerful guys above wouldn't make money.",

Small island countries like Ireland and Cyprus are not linked to the European mainland gas pipelines and don't need to follow the rules. Same goes for the Baltic countries, they rely heavily for their electricity on gas and the risk for the countries electricity grid to collapse is to high, and of course Hungary opposed any deals. To me it seems that the European Union is too afraid to make strict rules for everybody and will be too soft in the end to not look authoritarian. These 15% will not solve any shortages during the winter. Russian already dropped the gas supply in the pipelines to 20% of it's normal output and cites  technical difficulties as the reason. Obviously it's all politics now and Putin wants to increase the cost for Europe to support Ukraine.",

However, cutting the gas consumption by 15% will only solve 15% of the problem.If they can manage to use 0% gas then the problem of using the Russian gas will be gone completely.

Or better, they can just ration the existing gas supply and ask the EU citizens to switch off their ACs and other appliances.

I hope that you are right, and that heavy energy-intensive industry will bear the brunt of the gas shortage in Europe. Unfortunately or fortunately, I know history all too well, in particular the oil crisis in the 1970s. The real decline in oil supplies from the Middle East then amounted to only 7%, the rest were only verbal interventions. And this slight decline caused the worst global economic crisis with empty gas stations and solar panels on the White House. The volatility of gas prices in Europe right now reminds me of the price chart of shitcoins.",
