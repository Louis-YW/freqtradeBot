If this wasn't the biggest endorsement ever for bitcoin I don't know what is. Not really. There had already been many attempts to create electronic money by 1999, so he was only predicting success of a technology that people were already working on.David Chaum described anonymous electronic money in a paper in 1983 and started DigiCash in 1989.There were more many attempts over the years, but none were successful until Satoshi Nakamoto adapted Adam Back's HashCash idea as an economic solution to the double-spend problem in 2008.But to be fair, Milton Friedman was one of the few economists to recognize the importance and impact of the technology at the time.BTW, your links are broken.

Like picture a scene from a movie when a young satoshi was in his studies and came across this Milton Friedman quote and then had this massive idea pop into his head. I wonder if there will ever be some sort of final note from him after he is old and grey. Maybe he is gone or maybe it was a group and they're all scattered living remotely somewhere in the mountains far away from any blockchain connectivity etc! Maybe Satoshi is at large and still changing the world from a far in another crucial area. He could potentially be a living legend. I guess it will always remain a mystery.",

But he wasn't endorsing; he was just being realistic of what the internet would bring in the future. He foresaw that such internet money would somehow help criminals do their thing easily. It would also make tax collection harder. But one thing I easily remember about Milton Friedman is his association with Monetarism, a school of thought in economics which believes that governments controlling the supply of money will make them achieve economic stability. That's basically courting danger. That's basically putting too much power in the hands of a few policymakers who are corruptible.",

If it was a group of people who created Bitcoin, then that secret would be leaked because a group of people never keep the secret. Besides Bitcoin, it's phenomenal that Satoshi managed to keep his privacy and stay anonymous, it deserves another Merit on its own but I believe that he is dead, that's why his identity is still a secret.

I think, he meant that the government won't have as much influence during the era of internet and in that case, he is true. In the world of internet, influencers have more power than the actual government. Just imagine, Messi telling Argentinians to choose man X as a president, what do you think will happen? Messi wins, easily.I believe that internet did 10000 times more good than bad for humans. It's easy for people to learn something online, anytime, anywhere they wish. It's hard to censor anything online, so we have access to every information but in this case we depend on our brain and that's what I like. It will really take me hours to write down everything that internet bought in our world, for absolutely everyone.In the era of internet, it's hard to form North Korean like management in any country. Without internet, I think it was easier to brainwash people, with internet and less censorship, it's hard to hide truth. They still successfully brainwash people but at least you can show them the reality and it might change the way some people think while in the past, it wasn't possible. Well, if someone is stupid, no internet is gonna help them.",

Right now, you're writing on a forum, and likely getting paid in a manner that evades the scrutiny of your government. This is because you're using a currency not controlled by your government, and the person paying you is probably outside your government's jurisdiction. Governments have power when they can physically intervene in the transaction between one person and another (e.g., when you have a job with physical presence, inside your country).  The Internet is an unstoppable force that empowers individual sovereignty by enabling you to operate in a much larger market, that is governed by rules beyond the reach of your government's oversight.",
