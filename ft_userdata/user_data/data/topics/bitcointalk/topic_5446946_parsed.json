  "content": "You will agree that some category of people will most probably become addicted to gambling if exposed to it than some other people. If you are the type that likes to refer and tell people to try out new things, you should avoid encouraging this category of people listed below to try out gambling even as a way to relax or for fun.- Be careful introducing gambling to teens, especially young male teens. QuoteYoung people are more vulnerable to developing a gambling disorder than adults. According to the Journal of Child and Adolescent Behavior, around 5% of teenagers in the United States have problems with compulsive gambling. By contrast, only about 1% of adults have a severe gambling problem. And there is a specific about \"males\" because Quote men are at a higher risk of compulsive gambling than women in all age groups. What accounts for this difference? One study found that men are more likely to take risks and experience social anxiety than women, contributing to problem gambling.. source- Be Careful introducing gambling to people with some certain \"Personality Characteristics\".QuoteCertain personality traits are associated with a higher risk of developing a gambling addiction Quote individuals who are highly competitive or get bored easily may also be at higher risk of compulsive gambling. People that you notice have a poor opinion of themselves, Quotelow self-esteem connects to addictive behaviors, including compulsive gambling and substance use source- Be careful introducing gambling to people who have a good access to enough money and no discipline in spending, they may not mind gambling to win money, but for other reasons, and because of their good access to money, they may just become addicted without even knowing.- Be careful introducing gambling to someone who you know is poor and needs a better way to earn a livelihood. The person may mistake gambling as a way to earn a living.- Be careful introducing gambling to your friend who you know easily gets addicted to new things. - Be careful introducing gambling to your friend who you know has a drug use problem.In general, I know some forum users may like to respond saying we should be careful generally who we introduce gambling to, which is true, but since may not possibly be avoided, there are some categories of person's that we should be on the look out for in the society.Join the discussion by extending the list if possible.",

Later started to loss, and requests me to recover her loss for her. I used to recover playing with bigger bets and one day lost big. From that day she completely stopped gambling, not even for fun she doesn't gamble. I mention this just to state what is being said in the OP is true, men easily turns addictive. Good for the men is to concentrate on sports betting than casino games.",

Or it may be through seeing people in your area going to casino or betting agents, like your friends.

Since they don’t have the brains to get rich from the normal ways like working, gambling is their only chance to get rich because gambling mostly requires no skills as it is only based on the player’s luck. Obviously the games are designed to make the casinos rich taking the money from the pocket of the players, these addicts get poorer and poorer while they expect to get richer. It is a brilliant business.",

If you are a person who does have that kind of behavior or characteristics on pushing up yourself into something thats inside of your mind then you would definitely be going into a path on which you would be experiencing lots of problems.This is why its never been that recommendable on having this kind of behavior on which it would really be making yourself to be more addicted or prone into it and would hardly be able to keep away or avoid from it.There are several types which had been mentioned already but i do agree for this add up because it is one of the most common mindset and behavior of a particular person or gambleron which he dont mind much on how much he do spend up and wasnt aware on what he's doing.",

QuoteYoung people are more vulnerable to developing a gambling disorder than adults.  > Mostly, if they didn't come from wealthy family they want to be rich in short way. We can't accuse them because they want to be socialised and the money is their prior problem. I had many friends from high school till university which have a serious addict problem.  When they win they bought new clothes, accesories or they went to date. Basicly easy money is so sweety for them instead of getting by hard working.And there is a specific about \"males\" because Quote men are at a higher risk of compulsive gambling than women in all age groups. What accounts for this difference? One study found that men are more likely to take risks and experience social anxiety than women, contributing to problem gambling.. > We can say male life tough than female economically. Most of countries male has to handle home things. If they aren't married they have to impress their crush with surprise and some sort of gifts. Once they have a problem with income gambling seems like their way out. I can't accuse them because life is sooooo tough.- Be Careful introducing gambling to people with some certain \"Personality Characteristics\".QuoteCertain personality traits are associated with a higher risk of developing a gambling addiction > You know, I can say that many people in my country Turkey are like this. With economic crisis and high inflation they are looking a way out for a long time. Side hustles, cryptos, forex and gambling most of them making their move by hearing from their relatives. And they say they are not addicted can you believe  Quote individuals who are highly competitive or get bored easily may also be at higher risk of compulsive gambling. > They are people like double-edged knives. Either they win or lose but the result would be so huge. But if they win no matter what at the end they will lose at some point. Because they don't know how or when to stop.- Be careful introducing gambling to people who have a good access to enough money and no discipline in spending, they may not mind gambling to win money, but for other reasons, and because of their good access to money, they may just become addicted without even knowing.> Definitely, those who don't know the value of money will screw up if they play. There are many examples of this.- Be careful introducing gambling to someone who you know is poor and needs a better way to earn a livelihood.

Gambling is the same as a teenager's hobby for games which makes them addicted and in my opinion nothing can limit it, even though implicitly it doesn't introduce gambling to anyone.The extent of addiction depends on each individual, it is difficult to limit this and ensure that it works within the person's ability to recognize the impact of the risks, any advice will be back on each and control may be possible but limiting seems difficult.",

It is based on one's luck basically. Pattern on the usual is, perhaps winning continuously for 7 days straight, then losing for 2 weeks straight subconsciously. Once you're dragged with the idea that it is one of your sources of income, then you'll come to it day by day to make money basically. It should be considered only as a leisure. And yes, persuading someone to gamble will never be advisable. Allow them to seek with their own curiousity. 'coz for sure there will be this tendency for you to be blamed out of the bad outcome of their playing habit.",
