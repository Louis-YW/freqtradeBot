I do not like how the exchange do not support derivative trading too. I noticed that all the exchanges that I am using like Binance, Bybit, OKX, Huobi global and Kucoin all have proof-of-reserve. There are many exchanges that are having it that crypto exchange users can choose from.But people should not trust proof of reserve because it can be manipulated. We should also not be deceived and still always know that not your key not your coin. Proof of reserve can not prevent the inconveniences of many exchanges and also it can not prevent exchange hack.",

Even with such assurances, there is always a possibility that exchanges could engage in unexpected or unethical behavior.One of the most secure ways to safeguard your funds is to withdraw them from the exchange as soon as you are done trading and store them in your own wallet. By using a hardware wallet or other secure cold storage solution, you have full control over your private keys and funds, reducing the risk of potential losses due to exchange-related issues.",

As a trader, do you feel safe using such exchanges that haven’t released theirs or should the more transparent ones be given preference?You see that proof of reserve thing, it doesn't prove anything. Last year when the famous clown and FTX collapse, it begin to raise many questions if exchanges have coins on there wallet as they say to the public and then, the whole crypto community began to panic, follow by many FUD that started on Kucoin and then to Crypto.com exchange, so many people withdraw there exchange and when they found out that the rumours has done damages, finance announce their audit and wallet balance just to mitigate the damages but guess what Crypto.com exchange did. They went to borrow money from Gate exchange and show as proof of reserve only to secretly move out the usdt back to Gate exchange they were caught by chain analysts and mini onchain FBIs on twitter.The earlier you accept that your coins are not safe on the exchange the better for your health, you will have peace of mind and enough time to sleep. Many who left there savings on FTX are still hurt today because they never listen to \"not your keys, not your coins\". Proof of reserve open the eye of the public in 2022 but some of them were very foolish to withdraw their coin from other exchange and then sent to Binance thinking CZ will protect them, pathetic right!",

But most of exchange use their customer funds to venture on different crypto investments to get more funds that why they can't provide a legit Proof of Reserve same as Binance. Crypto exchanges are more shady than banks since they are not regulated even with billions of money they are holding.So far, No crypto exchange manage to provide an official proof of reserved that is audited by official auditors.",

But honestly, if you are a long-term holder, leaving your assets on exchanges is the dumbest thing to do. But if you are a trader, daily deposits and withdrawals are cumbersome and difficult to do. Trade does not always start and end during the day so it is difficult to withdraw at the end of the day, not to mention the fees we have to pay if we lose that day. Therefore, once we have accepted to be day traders, we should be aware of the risks of using centralized exchanges as well as other risks.",

Also, Mazars did not release any reports disclosing the mechanism that it used for conducting the Binance audit.One more important thing to note here is that, right after releasing its proof-of-reserves reports, Binance moved billions of dollars worth of funds out of its reserve wallets to unknown wallet addresses. When the questions were raised, Binance cited the on-chain activity as nothing but security measures for moving funds to secured cold wallets.Let me guess, you actually believe the whole #SAFU thing?   FACTS:Japan has legislation in which customer funds be it crypto or fiat can't be moved outside designated bank accounts, Binance fled Jpana not willing to obey, FTX stayed and FTX customers in Japan have received all their money.The US wants to have the same legislation, but Binance wants to flee and avoid it!Think again, why don't they want that?",

A few months ago, when I was looking to switch to a CEX, I conducted thorough research on Merkel tree, securities, licenses, and other factors before making my choice. I found out that exchanges like Binance and Bitget have a protection fund as an extra layer of security, which streamlined my decision. Nowadays, I primarily use the latter due to its copy trading feature.",

I had some discussions on this topic before. Well here in your case. People prefer to chose exchanges on many factors. Because there are those people who like DEXs over CEXs and vice versa. Then comes the factors on which they chose qhixh DEXs or CEXs they should select for trading purposes. 1. The one on which the token they want to trade is listed.2. That exchange must have liquidity to execute the trade.3. Mostly select only those exchanges either they are cexs or dexs which are most famous and are in the market for longer period of time.Except above many other factors are also keep in mind but that depend on person to person. Overall, the liquidity details are only available if they approve POR we can see the liquidity of a exchange on many websites like CMC or coingecko etc.",
