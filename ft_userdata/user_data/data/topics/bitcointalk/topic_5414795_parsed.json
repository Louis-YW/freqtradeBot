  "content": "A buddy gifted me a couple of these wallets that Arculus was giving away at the Miami bitcoin conference this year.  I finally decided to look in to this wallet out of curiosity and came across exactly what I expected to find, reasons why this wallet is not safe and secure. I also made this write up because I’ve seen this company doing a ton of advertising and lying about how “traditional” hardware wallets are less safe. This is a very shady marketing tactic, and one they didn’t have to use to become a successful product. https://www.getarculus.com/Here’s a pretty good YouTube video of a guy who explains some of the main reasons why this wallet isn’t secure. https://youtu.be/q09he4RPg_A—Some of the main issues—*Thousands have been given away for free at the Miami Conference alone. This and of itself should make you question the wallet’s legitimacy right off the bat. I understand this helps get the word out, but a truly revolutionary wallet (that retails for $99), as they claim to be, would garner enough attention where this likely wouldn’t be necessary. *Not Open Source *This wallet has to rely on its application/software alone for trust. You have to use a phone to use it which opens it up to potential issues such as malware. *They do not explain how the keys are stored, other than it’s “encrypted”. ( The guy in the video reached out to Arculus for key storage explanation and said all he got back was basically “you should just trust us”. *No screen display. Without a screen display you can’t verify on the hardware wallet itself that the key on the wallet matches the key on your phone.*Seed phrase is displayed on your phone and not the device itself. This opens it up to an attack, what if someone sim swapped you, they’ll be able to see the seed and steal your coins. On the website it states the seed is generated from the wallet itself, is that even possible with NFC chips? I am not an expert in this area, but I know enough to understand why this wallets flaws render it not smart to use. Would love to hear from others /experts with any experience with these wallets, other security issues I may not have mentioned, or just any thoughts in general on this wallet and the company behind it.",

Any company that spends more time attacking and talking bad about the competition rather than properly explaining the workings of their own product should be avoided in my opinion. Focus on presenting what it is that your device brings to the table. If that isn't the case and you aren't doing that, it might be because you don't have anything to offer. Since these HWs were given away for free, the saying \"if something is free, you are the product\" is suitable.",

Of course, with USB type A, even then no adapters are required. This means that the threat described in this topic will be excluded. USB A can easily handle exploits for PC/laptops, see the link from my other post here.So by making the wrong assumptions, instead of protecting one, you can end up getting malware on the other.Quote from: m2017 on March 24, 2022, 05:56:59 PMMore and more manufacturers are refusing to use USB A in their devices, and over time this will lead to a shortage of such devices. The market for used devices will not be endless either. This doesn't really make sense. USB A is still widely used for PCs, I don't think they'll get no-longer-produced too soon. And, if you want to, you can easily buy cheap and straightforwards adapters from USB A to micro USB or USB-C like this one:<Cough> MacBooks </cough> And any of the ultra portable PC ones (Microsoft surface, etc.) are all USB A only.Having one of those small adapters is nice. But people are people, and people forget things.If I drop a few of those cables around a show like BlackHat or Defcon probably nobody is going to plug them into anything.Leave a few around Bitcoin Miami and you could probably get someone to plug them in.Buy a few dozen (yes it's expensive) but then put a logo on for something that looks like a giveaway and you know people are going to use it....-DaveIt's a bit different in the fact that it's a hardware wallet but still, you are 'giving' me a $100 item. Like the saying goes, if you don't pay for it you are the product.[o_e_l_e_o  trigger warning]....Could also be 100% legit in security, but they are selling all your other information. Think about it, a decent HW wallet setup, that is now telling anyone who will pay for the information what coins came in and from what addresses and where they went.Or they could just be a team of incompetent nimrods who got funding and are trying to get a product out there, or a bunch of scammers who got funding who stole 90% of it and then just put out whatever to get more money from their backers. Going to have to find out a lot more, but for now yeah...run away.Quote from: The Pharmacist on September 25, 2022, 03:13:31 AMThanks for making this thread, OP.  I'm all out of sMerits, so I'll have to owe you some.I sent him 4 2 from me and 2 from you :-)-Dave",

But i'm not sure whether small power received by the chip is enough to run additional microcontroller to generate seed securely.Probably not and I can see it also being a support nightmare. There are so many variables to the amount of power a phone puts out through NFC. Add in different phone cases along with any other metal for attaching to magnetic holders and you have to assume that you are lucky to get tap to pay to work on a regular basis. I am not so much about open source as verifiable source with hardware / software wallet but without either why would you even want to use one that does not have it since there are so many that do give you that option.As always, for full disclosure, I use a closed source multi-coin wallet on my phone but I know and understand the risks and don't keep a lot of funds there. -Dave",

      "body": "Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are a lot of assumptions and falsehoods here.I'm the Head of Product at Arculus - let me give you the facts.First off, the wallets that were part of Bitcoin 2022 weren't \"free\" they were part of the entry fee to the conference.Arculus is part of a public company called CompoSecure that has been making metal payment cards (and has numerous patents on NFC communication with metal cards) for more than 20 years. We make about 2 million cards a month at our factory in New Jersey.We do not, to my knowledge, \"attack\" other wallets in our marketing. We believe in getting strong, hardware-based security to the mainstream. Without getting into calling out specific competitors, other hardware wallets are (for the most part) secure and good at keeping attackers away from your crypto. They're also pretty good at keeping you away from it as well because they are often difficult to use and inconvenient.If you see a server error on our website, please tell me where and we'll investigate.International expansion is coming soon.\"they are selling all your other information\" - No, we are not. Privacy is central. We have no way of connecting a wallet to a person's identity. The wallet is completely anonymous.If you want to read more about how the wallet works, you can read our whitepaper: https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-eew4m8g4im/content/documents/arculus-whitepaper.pdf",

      "body": "The facts are that neither your app nor your hardware is open source. It is impossible for the end user to verify anything that is going on and they must have complete trust in you and your product. They cannot verify their seed phrase or keys were created securely, and they cannot verify they are signing what they think they are signing. Having the seed phrase displayed on the phone is a huge security risk and makes the product barely any better than a free closed source mobile wallet. Users have no idea what the app is doing in the background, how much data it is collecting about what is going on, or how much data you are collecting through your servers which your app is connecting to.The price is ridiculous when you can get a proper open source hardware wallet with a screen like a Trezor for 20 bucks less.I got a server error on your landing page, but it seems a new Tor circuit has solved this.The whitepaper is not a whitepaper at all - it is an advertising brochure. It explains nothing about the inner workings of the app or the hardware.",
