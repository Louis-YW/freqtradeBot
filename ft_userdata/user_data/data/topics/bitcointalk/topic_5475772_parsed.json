  "content": "\"This move comes just after the SEC recently said it will start naming unlicensed exchanges in its advisories going forward, as well as working with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to block access to the exchangesâ€™ websites.\"\"The SEC warned that those acting as salesmen, brokers, dealers, agents, or promoters for Binance within the Philippines could face criminal liability under Section 28 of the SRC. The penalties include a fine of up to five million pesos or imprisonment of up to twenty-one years, or both.\"Source: https://bitpinas.com/regulation/ph-sec-binance-advisory/After the recent international news regarding sa binance, now, dito naman satin. Surely, this will have a huge effect dito satin lalo na sa mga p2p traders if ma block ang binance site, maybe hindi lang website nila ang ma ba-block pati nadin ang sms access like sms 2fa.At i bet na halos lahat ng crypto users dito satin ay may account sa binance compare sa ibang local exchanges. Also, may penalties pa na pwedeng ipataw sa mga promoters nito based sa Section 28 of the SRC.",
