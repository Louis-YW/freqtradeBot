It's not their fault LOL. I use it sometimes when imgur does not load or have any temporary problem. The only reason I do not use it always is because of more navigation required than imgur. On imgur you only click upload and then right click for the image link. But in imgbb you need few more clicks to get the image url.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on February 02, 2023, 05:28:17 AMIt's been down/not working for the majority of the day, and it's a really useful tool for adding pictures to my posts using BBcode.Sometimes your ISP can block the URL. Try to use VPN. It works fine.",

I have been using Imgur every time to post an image on Bitcointalk. They also have an android app, not sure whether they have an iOS one. Using the app I have been able to post images when I am not near my desktop. Another important aspect of using Imgur is that it is one of the most used image-sharing and image-hosting services which means the website will always be available online and you will never face uptime issues like you are facing now.",

I make use of imgur and it works perfectly, what i will advise OP is to always ensure that while using a mobile version he should go the browser settings and change the view to a desktop version/desktop site in order to be able to upload and also try to check the connectivity to the internet, switch your data and on it back, close the browser and relaunch it again, i think with this few tips you should be fine.",

I had problems using it yesterday, then I ignored it and used Imgur.com It is a better website than ImgBB. From where you get both the BBcode and HTML code of an image. So you can use both websites to get the BBcode of an image. In this case, if a site is temporarily under maintenance.  You will not be out of work.  You will use another site.  It is very simple.  Why are you afraid?",

It's official app is available for Android Users also. You can download it from Playstore . It's supported any img format and also gif supported. I hope there will be no need if imgbb when you will use it.I checked Imgbb also and it's now working fine. Maybe it's has stopped worked for some time. Many alternative is available. You can try any one of these.",
