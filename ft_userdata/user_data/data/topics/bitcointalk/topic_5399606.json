Help me translate my best posts in your Local Boardhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5230761.0 from this thread he can select the most impressive translation from the local boardsI am sorry, but I see absolutely no connection between the quality of translations made by some users for fillippone's topics and having a local board named \"the best\" based on that. For example, a local board may have a very low activity and yet, a user active in that board, to make a flawless translation for fillippone's topic(s). How would that make the respective board to be \"the best\"?And what made you choose those translations to be the criterion for having a board to be \"the best\"? I am sorry, I do not understand. Furthermore: have you ever asked fillippone if he would agree with such decision? I highly doubt that he would agree, as he would see also no connection between a good translation and naming a local board as \"the best\".And what does this \"the best\" actually mean? The best from what point of view? How do you define \"the best\"?OP, you should be a bit more rational or logic, if you like to do a statistic like this. You need clear criteria for your fields.Besides that, if you want to be taken seriously, you also need to spell the words correctly. Your topic and posts are full of typos and grammar errors (you use capital letters for some words, when it's not the case; you use double spaces sometimes between words; you spell wrong users' names; you spell wrong various words; you do not write dots (\".\") at the end of sentences; you use incorrectly the quote system etc.).These are some examples:1. Wrong use of quote system: in your reply to me you tried to quote me, but a part of my reply was quoted, while the other was not.2. Double space (between \"is\" and \"the\") and incorrect use to capital letter (for \"Moderators\" -- this term could be written with low caps \"m\"):Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 08:30:49 PMI have been trying it for about one month to make sure I received alert but IRONY is  the case. So I still prefer Moderators and admin 3. Incorrect use of capital letters (\"Mods\", \"Thread\" and \"Board\") + missing logic at the beginning of the sentence:Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 08:30:49 PMThe Mod's that is response to Threads, comments and always check up his or her Board (s) everyday.Probably, here you wanted to write \"Mods' evaluation is based on they way they respond inside threads, on their comments and on their activity inside their boards\".But the way you wrote the first part of the sentence makes no sense in English - \"The Mod's that is response to Threads\". What does that mean?4. Spelling error:Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 08:30:49 PMSo I will want everyone to list thier for the final sum upThe word is \"their\", not \"thier\"Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMNumber of pamban..........if you know any.......... username.........Perhaps you wanted to write \"permaban\"?Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMNumber of temban..........if you know any.......... username.......Perhaps you wanted to write \"tempban\"?Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMNumber of Plagiarised users..............with username..Perhaps you wanted to write \"plagiarist users\"?Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMIs the forum policies are active?.........

This sentence makes no sense.Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMI would like modirators to provide this.Modirators...?Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMThe most educative Threads?................... username... with link.. ogNastyHis username is OgNasty, not ogNasty...Quote from: Agbe on May 21, 2022, 01:21:37 PMSecond Quarter.... loadingHere you used four dots, instead of three. The punctuation symbol \"...\" has only three dots.Look, OP: again, don't take me wrong. But when you write a topic or a post, you should also re-read it prior submitting the post. Check your writing for proofreading; correct the typos; correct the various errors you may encounter. Never write a bunch of words and then immediately click on \"Post\", without checking first what you just wrote.And when you are using the \"Preview\" function, you can see that the text editor underlines (with a red line) the words which are spelled incorrectly. Correct those ones, at least. Or use another text editor, with dictionary set to English.Writing the way you do looks just like a mess, no matter if you even have a good idea. And, if you want to have the chance to be taken seriously or into consideration, you should present, at least, a correct text. If you'd read a book full of spelling errors, what would you think / do? Wouldn't you say \"Who is the underclassman which wrote this junk?\", then throw it away? What I want to say is that, if you write like that there are high chances that users will also not even read your posts. Who would lose time for reading some gibberish?I understand that you may not be an English native (if you are, the situation is even worst, as you are supposed to know your own language); many users from here are not English natives as well. But they make efforts to have correct writings. At least to use the text editor from \"Preview\" function... You may never have a text typo-free. But, at least, if you have just a few and minor ones, you can show that you tried, at least, to write a good and correct text.",

No need for quarterly achievements. I guess if you want to see the best threads or what not you can check the merit statistics which show the most recent highly merited threads, and also replies. That's probably the only way we could measure it, and even then that's subjective.

Honestly, some of the moderators aren't very active in posting, but they're kicking arse behind the scenes. So, these recognitions, and awards are always rather biased to those that are posting regularly in the public eye. The reality is most moderators are doing a ton of work, and only theymos really knows the numbers behind it.
