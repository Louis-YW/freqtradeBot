      "body": "I think your project is mainly about BSC blockchain as your project is based on it and you can not post things that are not related to BTC here on this thread (or maybe I am wrong). But you did try to link yourself to BTC by declaring yourself a Pepe community which indirectly means you are a community using Pepe token which is based on the BTC blockchain.And TBH, I from one of those who do not like the idea of Ordinals because it has hurt the adoption of BTC. (I don't want to talk about reasons here so I will just give up). and I do visit your website and the theme is good enough to give any of the users the to create a thought ok I am in an anonymous group website. You in this post more focused to solve the problems by catching the ones who are scammers and yet your portfolio contains zero cases and on the website you are more focused on making users buy your token. Best of luck.",
