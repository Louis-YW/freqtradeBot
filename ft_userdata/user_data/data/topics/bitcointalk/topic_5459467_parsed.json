Every crypto enthusiasm is currently expecting the price of BTC in particular to go high by 2024 but the only problem is that no price speculated can actually be the right price as no one knows for sure how bitcoin volatility really works.",

But this will all depend on what we are going to face in the remaining 5 months of the year. We could also see some significant negative change in price based on some unforeseen attack that might come to Bitcoin again, as there is always one trouble to the other from either regulators or racists, which might want to cause some panic to the market. But be that as it may, I see $40,000 as an achievable price before the end of the year.",

But I appreciate this kind of prediction, to give courage to the small Bitcoin holder.The thing with this prediction thought is that it is coming from the banking sector itself. So it's either they are going to accept bitcoin or just joining the bandwagon for now. But we all know that bitcoin is really going to be massive and that's why everyone is on it, including this big banks across EU or in the US.But for us average joe, we really don't care with this prediction, because we all know that there will be another all time high in 2024-2025.",
