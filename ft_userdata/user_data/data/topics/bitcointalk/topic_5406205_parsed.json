      "body": "There have been multiple projects on the same space in the past and all of them failed miserably. So if you are thinking of investing, refrain from doing so.

But now, such kind of secured and encrypted storage has a very very limited market and coupl3 of established enterprise level players.Â So the future prospect of such projects are not that shiney. So don't invest a dime here.",
