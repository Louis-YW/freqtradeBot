      "body": "So to kick off, I will be sharing mineAs for myself, I came across Bitcoin back in 2018, but I must admit, I was a bit hesitant and scared at first. However, I didn't let that stop me. I delved into numerous studies and sought to understand the fundamentals before taking the plunge.It was a friend who introduced me to Bitcointalk. I had never heard of it before, but now I'm grateful to have found this community. Learning from various perspectives and experiences on this platform has been truly beneficial in expanding my knowledge about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.To be honest, I still feel like there's so much more to learn, and I'm eager to explore and gain further insights here on Bitcointalk, so I would sincerely advice all newbies to take their time to digest Bitcoin in full, as they will get to enjoy all it's benefits as time goes on. It's been a valuable resource so far, and I believe it will continue to be an essential part of my learning journey.",

Therefore I don't see a good reason to have another thread for the basically same thing here. I'm not pointing to some forum rules...  As for newbies, well, they might like more to post here than arrange an interview with zasad@ as this may give them more benefits for an interesting story post (stay true, though!).",

I am not much of a Bitcoin investor but the main lesson this forum has taught me is that as a Bitcoin investor or holder one should have this faith and patience with BitcoinAnd my advice  to newbies like me is to always try as much as possible to learn from every post you come across on Bitcoin talk instead of trying to teach others rather learn and gather experience as you rank up",

Nothing much, besides the fact that when I was younger(and stupid) I was talking to friends about bitcoin when it was like $2000 and them laughing at me. Well, who's laughing now?5. Helped me A LOT to the point that it changed the trajectory of my life. Learned about finance, investing, capitalism, libertarianism, etc.",

Are there any memorable experiences or interactions you've had with Bitcoin and Bitcointalk that you'd like to share?5. How much help do you think Bitcoin has been of help to you since you learnt about it.1. The ability of an investor to earn from it. I mean for sure, there are some here who are just interested in Bitcoin because of the fact that they can earn from it. I'm one of them, but as I learn Bitcoin more, I realized that it's more than just an asset where you can earn money from it.2. Sharing what I know here increased my own knowledge because I believe that in order for me to share something here, I need to continuously learn something that's related to Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general. Well, I also learned many things since joining here in the forum as well, but aside from that, I also learned outside of the forum thru different videos online.3. Learn, research, watch, read. Those are just 4 of the things a newcomer must do when they want to start their crypto journey. TBH, I did all 4 of them, but I'm watching more than reading because I'm more of a watch guy than a read guy. I learned more from watching videos, did some research at first, and read various threads here.4. Memorable experience here in the forum? None I guess because I'm not interacting that much with people here. Yes I reply to some of their opinions, and posts here, but to interact like sharing some personal life etc. I haven't encounter one, and I think it will stay at that. Outside Bitcointalk, I heard many negative things already from the people that I know personally. Things like it will go down to X price, or it will not rise up anymore, or Bitcoin's a scam. Now they're the ones who are crying in different Facebook pages, feeling disappointed on themselves because of wrong beliefs with regards to Bitcoin.5. Many. Bitcoin is the reason why I'm investing into different assets right now. Bitcoin is like the eye-opener for me into different assets like the Stock Market. At the same time, Bitcoin is providing me some additional income as well, and additional money to be used for investing into other assets.",

Whether you're a seasoned enthusiast or just getting started, i believe that every story has something valuable to offer.Firstly, I don't think the Meta section is a place to share your bitcoin experience, but Meta is for discussing something you experienced in your forum journey. Some issues regarding forum, posting issues and several other complaints are worthy of Meta, but your topic seems to fit well on Bitcoin Discussion boards. So consider moving your topic.Secondly, I don't have much story to offer, but so far bitcoin has been very helpful to me economically from both trading and investing. I haven't been able to take advantage of his innovation in the real world, that's because bitcoin is not a legal currency in my country.",

Quote from: Hatchy on July 30, 2023, 11:24:01 AM2.How has your knowledge about Bitcoin evolved since joining Bitcointalk?Very rapid. Bitcointalk is an embodiment of information and knowledge. The most important thing is that I have learnt the basic things of bitcoin that will keep me going and I have also learnt to identify scam and not to fall for them.Quote from: Hatchy on July 30, 2023, 11:24:01 AM3.Do you have any advice for newcomers who are just starting their Bitcoin journey?Yes, I will advise them to learn and learn first, later they will earn at ease.Quote from: Hatchy on July 30, 2023, 11:24:01 AM4.

How much help do you think Bitcoin has been of help to you since you learnt about it.1. Honestly speaking, ive been involved first on HYIPS and ponzis that paying up bitcoin which you could directly make out some conversion to fiat and that was the start up.  2. A huge change which it did really make things clears out on what it is and what are the scams around existing.Even on the slightest and simplest information like on reading up the whitepaper did really make out that huge change.3. Always make an indepth analysis and never ever make yourself that greedy because this is where you would be finding out yourself get fall into the pit of desperation on which it would be causing lots of errors and mistakes.4. Lots of exchange hacks which resulting into loss of funds, made out some learnings but well its too late. Loosing lots of coins because of such mistake.5.It do make out some additional financial support since i've been making out investment and trading at the same time. Earning money is way more thanand cant really just only be heavily relying with my day job alone.",

I just discovered this forum when my friend told me the opportunities of earning money online while enjoying the convenience of doing it on my personal and free time.Quote2.How has your knowledge about Bitcoin evolved since joining Bitcointalk?  My knowledge and understanding about cryptocurrencies (BTC) had grown extensively. Before, I used to be this guy who was just focusing on earning but when I understood the potential of applying cryptocurrencies as alternative payments, my curiosity filled with excitement. I will not say that I am somewhat of a pro- but at least I have a good grasp on the fundamentals of it.Quote3.Do you have any advice for newcomers who are just starting their Bitcoin journey?INVEST! While others may contemplate the time on when to invest, I usually tell newcomers that the best time to invest is when you actually discovered the existence of BTC. The reason is simple- by basing it purely on the history of the price of BTC, you would see a pattern/trend where its price continually increases (while occasionally decreases) on the market.Quote4. Are there any memorable experiences or interactions you've had with Bitcoin and Bitcointalk that you'd like to share?Probably one the memorable experience was when I attended this conference in our country when USI-TECH visited. I was not aware of the existence of these so-called \"ponzi-schemes\" so my young-self got influenced easily and lost a bunch of BTCs worth $100. This experience really taught me the valuable lesson of being aware. This also inspired me to become a person who advocates in providing a clean and scam-free forum.Quote5. How much help do you think Bitcoin has been of help to you since you learnt about it.The journey of acceptance of BTC had come a long way. When it was first released, only a few believed and understood the potential of the system. This is also the reason on why at least majority of the users know the 10,000 BTC pizza story.The help of BTC personally is greatly appreciated given the fact that earning through signature campaigns is one of the most efficient ways of earning money in my country. While the value of money is relative, as someone who is living in a third-world country, every dollar counts.",

And at that time, actually not really interested, just trying it. But in that same year, Bitcoin finally got very hype, if I'm not mistaken it was a bullish period, which made Bitcoin boom because the price jumped so fantastically at that time. So that all the media in the country, especially online media, report a lot about it. And finally I have even higher expectations for this forum and Bitcoin. I imagine if I become one of the people who are successful and suddenly rich thanks to BitcoinQuote from: Hatchy on July 30, 2023, 11:24:01 AM2. How has your knowledge about Bitcoin evolved since joining Bitcointalk?  Quite good enough, because this forum really helps a lot to get various information about Bitcoin, including various sharing experiences and also various information to be discussed in this forum. This is really very helpful, especially for crosschecking when there is a certain FUD.Quote from: Hatchy on July 30, 2023, 11:24:01 AM3.Do you have any advice for newcomers who are just starting their Bitcoin journey?Yes, don't have too high expectations at first, especially if you don't have the knowledge and skills here. Even though sometimes high hopes are good for some people to boost up the energy and motivation, it's not uncommon for people to become discouraged because it turns out that reality doesn't match these high expectations.",

      "body": "1- I have a past that is not great with banks, not personally but everyone I know in my entire family is not great with money, even though they were always good earners and had high salaries, they were also careless about money and did stupid business ideas and failed after and after again with what they made from their good paying jobs. This resulted with banks (one might say rightfully so) constantly attacking us, and this made me angry at them no matter if they were right or not, because the \"way\" they did it made them wrong no matter how right they were, they can be cold and ruthless, nobody cares, its their job, but they can't be \"angry\", these are just workers for the bank, the money doesn't go into their pocket, it goes to shareholders, and yet in every bank, when it comes to collecting time, they sent some angry person, like what the fu- are you yelling at me for dude, you make minimum wage, stfu and do your job. Nobody questions why you are doing what you are doing, we had debt, we didn't pay, so you come to collect, that makes sense, but if you threaten me and yell at me, I will have a response that will get me to jail, so stfu and do your job. When I met bitcoin, that changed it all, at that moment I said from now on I am going to use this and will never have a single debt or money in any bank, and try to do that as much as I possibly can, always withdrawn all my money in cash, and never kept it in a bank longer than 24 hours if I can or just keep it in bitcoin for the rest.2- Well whenever I had any questions I come here, you can't always know everything, and sometimes the response is written somewhere when you google it, but you do not understand it, so you come here, open up a topic about it, and ask what you want to ask. There will be at least a dozen people responding, possibly more. Plus we get to just chat and have fun too regarding crypto, its not always about learning, sometimes its just chatting with some friends about a hobby you have.3- Do not start with buying silly meme stuff or shitcoins. Get bitcoin if you must, even avoid that and do not buy anything before you learn more about it if you could, but if you are in a rush then just get bitcoin alone, you can check the rest when you learn more about them later, but starting with bitcoin will save you a lot.4- Not really, I mean I met with some great people in bitcoin world, they are great, I consider them as friends. But there isn't really a \"moment\", like its the sum of all the things that happened, not a single situation that made anything better.5- I literally went from working in a hotel for 13 hours a day into a freelancer working at home for 8-10 hours a day without needing to go out of my home to work. The amount of improvement in my life is incredible, and I am even making more as well. So instead of making less money working 13 hours a day in a hotel, I make more money working 8-10 hours a day at the comfort of my home. I can't explain how much improvement that is, I would do this even if I was making less, its really that much better life. So I can say bitcoin made my life x100 better.",

I have evolved from being dogmatic and ignorant to becoming knowledgeable in Bitcoin and not just Bitcoin also Blockchain, security and privacy in fact everything pertaining to the Internet in regards to scams and the likes.3. As long as you are in this Forum, you are already having up to 60% chance to be successful in your bitcoin journey, because everything you need to be successful in your bitcoin journey is here and is up to you to choose either to learn or quit.4. I don't really have at the moment though one thing have really enjoyed is the knowledge I have acquired in this Forum and I just came up with an acronym for BITCOINTALK for me, which is :B = Bitcoin is unqiue and you can trust its growth I = If you want to grow you have to take your time to learn and be consistent. T = Trust is earned and not given C = Clarification of doubt and misconceptions O = Open for everyone language is not a barrier I = Individual researching is important and encouraged N = Not your key not your wallet T = The truth is hereA = Accessibility of knowledge is not restrictedL = learning comes before success K = knowledge is here and it's not just in bitcoin but in cryptocurrency, investment, security, privacy and others and it's up to you acquire them. 5 Since I have started learning about Bitcoin, I have trust in it and I developed interest in Blockchain technology something I have never thought about before my knowledge on Bitcoin.",
