There are so many interesting Topics to join in there - I am somehow bombarded with the Process here... Why Can't I? and How do I?",

Quote from: theymos on January 10, 2018, 05:12:05 PMI see that newbies were already posting junk in Serious Discussion, so I made changes: - The member limitations are moved up one rank. You must be a Jr Member to post in Serious Discussion and a Full Member to post in Ivory Tower - Posts in Serious Discussion only activate a potential-activity period. They do not increase your post count. - Posts in Ivory Tower neither activate a potential-activity period nor increase your post count.",

While becoming Full Member will require some efforts. This decision was made to prevent spam and get more quality discussion. It doesn't means that all Newbies are spammers, but unfortunately, most of spam comes from Newbies.And it's not unique thing. Many forums have restrictions to post in specific board until you reach required rank.",

That's why it's advisable for you to be reading some instructions before you post any topic.
