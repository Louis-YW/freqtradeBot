  "content": "Hey! I coded a very big HYIP Project from ground up, took 2 months, but I ended up not having enough time to run it. So I decided its best to sell it.Very unique, 100% custom coded Bitcoin HYIP. Includes a lot of custom pages, functionalities, fully automated payments, admin-panel with 2 access levels (Admin, Moderator), and even a neat looking Payment Invoice with live status update.Here are few snapshots of the HYIP. LIVE Demo is also available, for that contact me. I will send it out only to serious potential buyers.https://i.imgur.com/bzdCqjJ.jpeghttps://i.imgur.com/k9Ffmfk.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/vrjMqnD.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/PDm5Ehb.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/vrjMqnD.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/BWfIleT.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/Nn2vMdb.pngContact me at Telegram: @shellcode_hfI also wrote a FULL Description list of all pages I have made:◆ Landing Page   • Animated Logo Icon   • Investment Program Info (Live Profit Calculator)   • Services We Provide   • Affiliate System   • Testimonials   • Statistics (Days online, Total Users, Active Users, Total Paid)   • About Company   • Latest Transactions Table◆ Registration / Login / Recover Password   • Captcha for anti-spamming   • IP limiter for anti-spamming   • Form data validation   • Giveaway Section◆ Giveaway Page   • Information, Requrements, and Rules   • List of Prize Winners   • Form to submit your participation link (Admins can process them from panel)   • Section to monitor your progress◆ Dashboard   • Statistics (Balance, Active Deposits, Total Accumulated, Referrals)   • Recent History Table   • Referrals Table   • Giveaway Section   • News & Update Logs◆ Dashboard - Deposits   • List of Deposits with Progress Bar   • View Invoice   • Statistics (Daily Profit, Total Deposited, Total Earned, Total Deposits)◆ Dashboard - New Deposit   • 3 Step Form (Address Confirmation, Amount with Calculator, Confirmation with ToS)   • Deposit Invoice (Will update to Paid/Confirmed LIVE, without need to reload page)◆ Dashboard - Transaction History   • Table with detailed history of all activity   • Search Bar◆ Dashboard - Referrals   • Table with referrals and commissions   • Search Bar   • Referral Link Bar◆ Dashboard - Support   • Ticket System (Tickets, Unread Tickets, Resolved Tickets, Closed Tickets)   • New Ticket   • Read Ticket◆ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)   • Account Section   • Investments Section   • Withdrawals Section   • Affiliate Search◆ Profile Settings   • User Information Section   • Bitcoin Wallet Change   • Withdraw Funds   • Change Password◆ Admin Panel   • Tickets Manager   • Events Manager (Giveaway)   • Deposits Manager   • Payouts Manager   • Commissions Manager   • System History   • User Accounts Manager",
