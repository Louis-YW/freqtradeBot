Atleast provide reference link to all the project that you provide because all of them is not a major altcoins so most people here is not aware about the description of these 3 tokens. But base on the name itself I would suggest that go for the Skale Network since it’s a blockchain project and has a lot of potential for growth with just a proper dapp ecosystem. Avoid on p2e games like Satoshi Island because it’s hype is already over.I’m not a fan of DAO but this kind of idea is still good since the token purpose is for governance. Leave the P2E games on the choices. But it’s much better to choose top altcoins since most of them is currently down due to market condition.",

What you are going to do is look at all the projects and decide which one you would like to invest inWhat is funny with crypto is that a shitcoin can just pump out of nowhere to 3000% for no good reason",

There is no better investment in this bear market except solid solid coins like ETH, BNB, and ADA and any other altcoins that is in the top 10 or maybe top 20.I'm not saying that those projects that you mentioned will not yield you profit. It might, but it could be just a simply pump and dump scheme. And so when that happens, you just hope that you are awake when the dump occurs because if not then you are going to missed the boat.So to have a better sleep, I would go with my suggested coin, they are still very cheap in this bear market, just have patience and mentality to HODL and wait for the next bull run to occur.",

I may forget about BNB but many dislike it.So, aside from the three that you've mentioned, there goes these top cryptocurrencies that you should take a look at. I know some altcoins could come like a fury and might give you that tremendous return but they're like the lottery.",

There isn't even any link to those 3 projects and I don't think anyone will sit back and look up what these 3 coins are for him.My advice to OP is: as a beginner to the market you should invest in top projects and bitcoin should be a priority in your portfolio, you should develop your skills before you want to go further in the crypto market. Hasty investment will not bring good results",

These three have different concepts and it depends on what kind of concept investors and the market are supporting I am lenient on projects with staking features as long as the APY is not too high and they are properly audited by a third-party auditor so I'm supporting Lido Dao, but mine is not financial advice I gave it based on my experience and what I'm looking out, you may have a different view than mine, but of course, you are always on the safe side as long as you're investing money that you can afford to lose.",

Newbie and first time investment? I won’t suggest any.Again, if you are just a newbie better to invest on the top coins first and while learning how this market works you can have a good assurance that your money will not be liquidated easily because you’re in a good coins and the probability to earn some profit is high as well. Investing on small projects are vert risky, you can’t know what will be the future value of those new projects especially if its not that popular.",

Did you conduct a research?For newbies do an extensive research before investing. Choose to invest in coins that are proven to be worthy and unlikely to be delisted in exchanges. Check the CMC and look for the top coins that has real use case.",

If that is about investing in altcoin, I suggest you choose ethereum, bnb, ada, dot, matic, as those coins are in the top 15 lists. If you feel the price is too high to buy, you can adjust your budget before deciding how much money you will use.I have never heard about the projects you mention, so I do not recommend you to choose that.

You should think again, you can see that most of us here are unaware of the 3 coins you mentioned. they are shitcoins, investing in shitcoins is very risky, you should not invest. If for some reason you don't like bitcoin then you should invest in top projects, don't try to ignore them and go for shitcoins, it won't end well as they promised you. If you are still determined to invest, you must be willing to accept the risks they bring, investing in cryptocurrencies is very risky, so you should only invest when you are willing to take the risk.",
