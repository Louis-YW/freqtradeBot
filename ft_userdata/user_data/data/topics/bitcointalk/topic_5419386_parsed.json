  "content": "I was very bullish on FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried and have also predicted that it might kill Binance and become the king of centralized exchanges. However, it appears I have another prediction wrong hehehe. This review by Coindesk on a private document says that much of FTX's equity is on their exchange token FTT and much of Alameda Research's equity is on illiquid tokens that they created and issued in Solana. The tokens are MAPS, OXY, SRM and FIDA.They cannot sell them without dumping the market lower. Would it be correct for me to speculate that FTX might be insolvent or is this review on a private document which we are uncertain where it came from just another fud from Coindesk?Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire is officially broken into two main parts: FTX (his exchange) and Alameda Research (his trading firm), both giants in their respective industries.But even though they are two separate businesses, the division breaks down in a key place: on Alameda’s balance sheet, according to a private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk. (It is conceivable the document represents just part of Alameda.)That balance sheet is full of FTX – specifically, the FTT token issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. While there is nothing per se untoward or wrong about that, it shows Bankman-Fried’s trading giant Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. The situation adds to evidence that the ties between FTX and Alameda are unusually close.Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/",

Look at Bitfinex. They do exactly the same thing and worse with Tether. They even printed $800 billion USDT out of thin air and then loaned it to themselves to prevent Bitfinex from going bankrupt, and yet somehow both Bitfinex and Tether continue to grow and be ever more widely used. You can do pretty much any shady stuff you like in crypto and still attract morons to give you their money.After seeing the incredibly shady stuff platforms like Celsius and Voyager were doing, then I have no doubt whatsoever that FTX are also doing similar things behind the scenes.

I cannot fathom why anyone stills trusts this absolute junk. First they said it was backed up 1-to-1 with USD. Then they said it was backed up 1-to-1 with USD and other assets. Then they dropped the 1-to-1 claim altogether, with court documents showing as little as 14% of USDT was actually backed up. Those same documents showed that Bitfinex transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to Tether on the day of their independent audits, and then transferred it all back out again the next day.It later emerged that these \"other assets\" they claimed included uncollateralized loan repayments, including loan repayments to themselves from the $800 billion USDT they printed out of thin air and gave to themselves. They also included bitcoin they had purchased with the USDT they first printed. Print USDT out of thin air -> buy bitcoin with it -> claim USDT is now backed up with bitcoin. Unbelievable. And since all these revelations that USDT is an insolvent fractional reserve scam, its market cap has grown to $70 billion. The day it finally collapses a lot of people will lose a lot of money, but they can't say they weren't warned. The writing is on the wall.And then look at centralized lending/staking platforms. Even after Celsius and Voyager collapse, people are still using such platforms. Even after BlockFi revealed they needed a bail out to the tune of $250 million, people are still depositing their coins there.And throughout all these scams, Ponzis, insolvencies, bankruptcies, and more, I'm just sitting over here quietly using bitcoin peer to peer, as was intended in the first place, having never lost a single satoshi.",

That's what happens when you adopt a legit way of getting a loan to a money printing scheme, in a normal business procedure if a company would be offering you a special loan in which you would have to use a part of the funds for assets that can be collateralized and be part of your manufacturing or whatever your business type is, it would be legit, just as a stretch from issuing shares for expansion would come close to this.What they are doing is just on a different level, I'm still surprised why the US is still letting them roam fee, but I'm pretty sure if one government agency will ask them to provide the proofs they are not operating like either a fractional reserve or a Ponzi scheme there will be thousands who is defended tether and blame everything on the evil gubbermint.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on November 06, 2022, 08:27:51 AMAnd then look at centralized lending/staking platforms.

And once Tether start getting audited properly, you better make sure you are not holding too much USDT (or any other stablecoin for that matter). And lets not even mention that just like CBDCs they are completely centralized and even coins in your own wallets can be remotely frozen or seized against your will.This FTX nonsense is just the same. Shady stuff going on behind the scenes, entire ecosystem built on top of a token they can print out of thin air at will and then lend/give to themselves, questionable loans and acquisitions, and users with absolutely no idea what happens to any coins they deposit to the site.

I've also now added to my assumptions that the right to be forgotten (GDPR) will not be respected. And with financial institutions (exchanges fall under this category in the EU I believe), they actually have the right to retain information even should you request this because of AML laws which warrant them keeping it (I believe, for 7 years).
