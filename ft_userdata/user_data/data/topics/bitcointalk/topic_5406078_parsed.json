      "body": "Are you talking about the netprofit?It always depends on your Electricity rate and the price of the unit if you have free power I'm sure that list will be changed but don't use nicehash as your profit calculator because sometimes they change the profit to attract to mine on their pool. I suggest check asicminervalue.com and scroll down to the bottom and change the electricity rate the list is changing every time you change the electricity rate because it is sorted by profitability.",
