If these projects that wanted to advertise can pay with illiquid coins/tokens, then I guess they're also allowed to pay illiquid NFTs.Not sure why any campaign applicant would want that though lol.",

Even though there arent any tokens yet for the project and giving away nft as reward would totally fine at all.Either its liquid or not since its a form of incentive for the task on the bounty.",

If it does, it won't be allowed. If it doesn't, then it should be okay. If you have any queries related to those stickies then ask. This thread might be relevant too, as it depends what you mean by giveaway.",

However, it's advisable by the community to do so. Although, you can run it yourself if you wished. There's no official rule, stating you need a campaign manager to run it. Also, recommended when ever dealing with actual Bitcoin or Altcoins that aren't distributed by the owners, that they're escrowed, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Thought it'd be important to clarify that to avoid any confusion.",
