This is just from personal experience and I know this isn't necessary for all but I just want to share for awareness since almost all employers asked for working experience (you will be surprised that you wanted to have experience yet they require you to have an experience, ironic).A good read and you'll find information right there on where to find those jobs, mostly crypto related (what can you expect, you post this \"I need to find a job\" in a crypto related forum, so I think it's appropriate to link a crypto related article): https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/how-to-get-a-job-in-web3-971512",

You can earn that amount or higher by applying as an Article writer on casinos and crypto news company but there’s no assurance that you can have this job offer in regular basis because most of them are only accepting freelance work so you can only earn that amount per project based.

Any work available would be very helpful  maybe even do a sample work as well to proveSince you are a beginner, i would say that you would not be able to earn 100$ a week initially. I am not disappointing you but seeing that you have no big skill and never earned online, it's hard to start earning big. You might have to work for free to build up your portfolio, try to learn skills, etc and all this will take time. Once you are an experienced person in your skillset, you will never need to ask how and where to earn as opportunities automatically come to you.",

Why not join the forum more closely, learn as much as possible about bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and improve your level of knowledge? $100 a week on the Internet without work experience is very difficult to get, and more additional knowledge is needed, so I just suggest that you start developing in your free time. Having a forum rank and earning extra income in today's times is a very advantageous position, in addition to the fact that you can meet people and maybe offer article translation services.My thought and advice are, do not sit idle, do not wait to be found, and develop yourself more.",

Its seems like OP thinks that this forum is a money making machine where he will be able to earn 100$ a week. To be very realistic, without any skill or business, it is impossible to earn money here or anywhere in the world. Since i do not what is the educational background and experience of OP, i would suggest him to accept wok with low wages also in order to gain experience and keep learning according to your skill.",
