  "content": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-future-hinges-donations-got-194653381.htmlQuoteThis concept seems counter to how the majority of blockchain networks approach funding. Most so-called decentralized networks are governed and funded by central foundations.Ethereum, for example, was pre-mined via the second largest crowdsale on the Internet at the time and ongoing development is mostly funded by the Ethereum Foundation which held $1.6 billion in its coffers last year.Bitcoin doesn’t have $1.6 billion lying around to fund development. A rough back-of- the-envelope calculation indicates $150 million to $200 million would be required every year to fund development in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem (assuming 1,000 developers receiving Google’s average $150,000 to $200,000 annual compensation for software engineers).Is Bitcoin development being dependent on funding from crypto-businesses a potential threat? What's the worst that could happen if the funding dries up and there are only a handful of dedicated devs dedicating only their spare time? Will Bitcoin survive?I think the $150-$200 mil/year to maintain the entire ecosystem is likely exaggerated, but what's the minimum level of funding, if any?",

It was created as a business, by business people (who became obscenely rich of course), to serve a wide varity of business functions and is ran as a centralized business controlled by a handful of people who are in it purely for the $$$$$ it makes them.",

What happened to all the illegal trades using bitcoin to hide their transactions, will they lose that interest? What about miners with billions in hardware? While the technology remains valuable, there'll still be tons of cash entering the space, and, when there isn't, you're going to have quite a good reputation to move on from as an active core dev imo. The largest mmos can produce new content and provide their services on an annual budget of around $40 million too afaik (excluding marketing and hosting costs).",

The future of Bitcoin does not depend on donations.The question what if the funds dry up what will happen? It crosses my mind that Bitcoin has proven to many that it is able to survive since its inception until now.",
