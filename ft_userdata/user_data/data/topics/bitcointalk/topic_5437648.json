Usually, what is being told, the opposite of that actually happens.Media is usually controlled by the whales, and retailers just believe these media stories because they believe in these new agencies. I am not saying that we should stop reading these media stories but i would say to use them as an indication for the price movement.",

Some wealthy entities are buying bitcoin happily at this price levels. They may be paying for defamatory / FUD articles.2. Under the hood there may be some sort of \"exchanges war\". In the same way Binance has given the last push to FTX and spread some FUD on Coinbase (iirc), I would not be surprised if some exchange tries to \"give a push\" to Gemini.3. Governments and central banks have their own anti-bitcoin agenda. Just they are trying to be careful, since if they hit bitcoin too hard people may also perceive badly the yet-to-come CBDCs.But we know already that we don't have to get scared of each and every news, don't we?",

There's always something happening in crypto.This is why the media can't get enough of it and keeps talking trash about it.",

I will correct you, they are not trying to do anything you think, but they are trying to get more subscribers - because as others have noticed, the article is locked and I assume that you haven't read it either, because the news that you think is relevant is actually already old news that has been discussed on the forum for some time.Who thinks DCG / Genesis / Grayscale / Barry are bad actors?Quote from: virasog on February 01, 2023, 02:47:02 PMThis things indicates that prices are being suppressed because of these news and they will blast very soon.

It won't affect the price of Bitcoin that much in my opinion cause most of the bitcoin investors may know what is this related to so the only thing is it will create fear among the non bitcoiners who think bitcoinis not good for investment.",
