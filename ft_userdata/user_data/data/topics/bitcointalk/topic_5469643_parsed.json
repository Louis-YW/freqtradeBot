  "content": "Last update 20th MAY 2024 - If you looking for the sport betting tips, go to the last pages.This is my best tips and if you wanna start gamble on sport betting. I ain't a professional gambler. ðŸ˜Š But I would say this is by far the best and honest manual on this forum for sports betting.1. Always do some kind of research about the game and teams you gonna bet on. Are any important player injured? Is this team good or bad home/away? Does a team have extra hard against a specific team?2. Don't be so greedy, settle down with low odds but not to low (read 3), no need to add a lot of games to increase the odds, make research about one/two games and settle down with that, place a bet and if the bet turn out into winning, do it all over again with the winnings, it will be higher chance to be a winner long term this way instead of example only place bet with example 10odd - 15odd or more in odds.I would rather place a bet on a single game with 3 in odd with research then place a bet on four favorite's in a paralay without research.3. Single bet or double is the way to go, sometimes a triple. But not more as paralay. It's always at least one favorite team that won't win that day and normally when we \"guess\" we often has wrong at least once.(I would never go under 1.65 odd in odds for a single-bet, If I play a double each game can be like 1.50 odd or more, if you think a team will win big, go with for example -1.5 to increase the odds.In the end don't place a bet because of the odds, play it because of your own research.4. If you have hard to pick a winner in a game, even tho you made a good research don't be afraid to go for another bet. I.E over/under goalsIf it's two teams that normally do a lot of goals and the odds allow you go for over 2.5 or even 3.5! Or if it two tight teams, you can go for under 2.5. (over/under 2.5 is the normal number to look after)5. Understand the difference between home and away advance in the odds. a team that would have 1.20 odd or 1.30 odd home against the same team they play away, but away they got like 1.60 odd-1.70 oddCan be a good bet! But don't need to be. Still research is the way to go. But it's a got hint.6. Have patience, for example: if you place a bet 20:00 a evening and it all games is done around 00:00 and you winning, don't be greedy and place your earnings on some live game asap you don't have any information about, wait to the next day, make your research again and then place the next bet.7. Try to \"play for free\" as much as possible. Example: if you make a bet and put $20 on it and you win and you win up to example $50. Then I would still continue for another round, if that also turns out as winning and I then Â got $100-$150. I will cash out a part of the money and then continue, then the pressure is gone and if you lose it wont hurt as much.8. Set up a budget, never play with money you can't afford to lose, when you go into gambling always go into it with the mentality that the money is gone! Then it won't hurt if/when you lose because we all are losing time to time, but the important thing is to win more often then you lose!9. Sport betting is something that should be fun and a hobby, not something that is stressful or not fun, if it turns out to stressful for you, it's better to stop and take a break.10. Only gamble if you can afford to gamble! Gambling is not a solution to solve any economic problems, its something that should give you enjoy and be fun.11. In the end, always make a decision that is made by you and not any other person. You can of course listen to other ideas and read other's tips, but don't take it for granted.Your own research is always the best! Then you only have yourself to blame or praise! Â 12. Never bet with emotions! Try to avoid to place bet's on your favorite team, if you still want to do it rather go for example over or under 2.5 goals instead of pick a winner with emotions.Good example here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5469643.msg63615356#msg6361535613. Have fun! If you don't have fun. STOP!Now this maybe sound confusing, but it's much easier then you think, I been in the sport betting business for many years.Farm your way up, start low and safe as I said. Bet $25 (example) Â and try to make it to $100-$150 in 2 or 3 different bets instead of try to make $20 to $150 in a single bet, it's to risky and much harder then the other way I promise you. Always research the game and bet $25 (example) and settle down with a 2x-3x odds I would prefer a double and then do it again and again, and that $25 (example) Â will turn into $150 in a much easier way then example bet $10 and try to hit a 15 odd paralay.Then it's up to you how high you want to go and how much you want to spend on each bet, but this amounts is normally what I use. I normally make a cash out when I reach over $200 then I cash out 50% ($100) and then I try to go high with the remaining balance.FYI:- This is what works for me and this is just my opinions.- Sorry for bad English or bad writing or repeating.- This thread can come and be edited time to time and people can feel free to share their own advice's also.- If you have any questions you can reply in the thread or PM me.Good luck out there!",

So yes do good research and then only find good sports to bet on. Take minimal risk in such a manner that you can yield maximum profit from it. Thanks YOSHIEQuote from: YOSHIE on October 09, 2023, 02:02:18 PMSports betting is indeed difficult and easy, as long as we are guided by knowledge of the sport we want to bet on, the difficulty will be easier to do, Don't bet on sports if you don't know about the sport, don't bet on sports like bees looking at their nest.Thanks Oshosondy.Quote from: Oshosondy on October 08, 2023, 02:37:13 PMBut the odd should not be too low. Low olds can deceive a gambler to use high amount of money to gamble and lose more money in a single bet.Thanks BitcoinPanther.Quote from: BitcoinPanther on October 08, 2023, 08:34:25 PMAt the end of the day gambling should be viewed as an entertainment and never think of it as another source of income where we rely our futures expenditure by winning on sports betting. Â In addition, one should gamble responsibly may it be a game of luck or a game of skills, setting fund limit is a must and should engage only in sports that one has a good knowledge of each team. Â Researching about the team competing is good but without a foundation of knowledge of each team and players, our sports prediction on who will win might come short.Parlay sure gives better profit especially when we take advantage of value bets but the chance of winning gets more difficult the more matches is added on the parlay. Â Thanks mirakal.Quote from: mirakal on October 08, 2023, 11:49:21 PMSports bettor should only bet with the amount that they're able to lose it anytime time. Because just as how the gamblers are betting with the money that they normally afford to lose.Thanks Youngkhngdiddy.Quote from: Youngkhngdiddy on October 11, 2023, 09:43:40 AMSport betting shouldnâ€™t be played with favoritism cause you actually playing to win, your favorite and loving team might be in a poor form and are losing games, you can go betting on their game since you know your team is having a poor form. You will lose and of course the bet is not for free. The main aim of betting in the first place is to win. So that is why I suggest playing bet base on favorite is not a best strategy. There are several sites where you can check if a particular team is in form to aid your search. Itâ€™s very wise to make your findings before staking, make research online on the form of the team you are about select. This will aid your choice of going for the better odds. There are no such thing as sure odds as the game is totally base on luck. Cause if it wasnâ€™t all other lower odds too will be a boom, but this is not the case. They are other cases where the higher odd will win ahead of the smaller one. Though the smaller one has higher chance of winning in most cases, this is why it good to do your homework on your own part to be able to make the right decision for your own good. Personally I donâ€™t like to lose I will make sure I do my homework first before I play.",

Going beyond gambling budget means irresponsible gambling. The gambling budget should be very low in percentage. Like me I have 5% or less of my income as gambling budget, not more than the amount that I can spend on beer every weekend.",

But the chances of losing are even much more than just regular betting on a certain matchup.Although I have seen some who can afford a parley in sports betting, but in most cases the amount of money being lost was even much more once there's at least one selected certain matchup where your team lost.But I acknowledge that #2, #5 and #7 are the most important ones on the list.",

      "body": "Gambling is luck whether you like it not there is big luck in gambling. What works for you might not work for another person, all these tips and steps you have mentioned, have been tried by others but didn't work for them. Some even bet on the two sides of the same game yet they still loss the two. So sportsbetting is not something to follow another person luck. Have you not seen term of 9 or 10 players played against 11 players and still win them?What you said is correct but cannot be used as general tips in sportsbetting. We all saw what happened in the last world cup where weak teams were beating strong teams. So in the case like that, you can't use your tips to predict who will win in the game.",

Don't be so greedy, settle down with low odds but not to low, no need to add a lot of games to increase the odds, make research about 1-2 games and settle down with that, place a bet and if the bet turn out into winning, do it all over again with the winnings, it will be higher chance to be a winner long term this way instead of example only place bet with example 10x - 15x or more in odds.3. Single bet or double is the way to go, sometimes a triple. But not more, it always at least one favorite team that won't win that day.Those two advices don't make sense and are not the most relevent IMO because sportsbooks often take higher margins on small odds, because people are less likely to notice them. Offering 1.02 european odds instead of 1.03 goes more easily unnoticed than offering 9.00 instead of 10.0 for example. In addition you find several value bets multipliying in a parlay gives better profits than using single bets. Parlay sure gives better profit especially when we take advantage of value bets but the chance of winning gets more difficult the more matches is added on the parlay.",

I lose more when I was using 1.02 odd. But when I use high odd of 1.5 to 2, I gamble less and I gain more than before. But if talking of 5x and above odds, that can be resulting to continuous losses.Just like in the lower odds there is also a chance that you lose higher with higher odds, and just as we mentioned already following the odds of the game can be deceiving at times and this can lead to a more severe future outcome for the gambler since he is just taking chances without any possible, accurate analysis since is gambling and there is no certainty of repetitions of games outcome.So what is left for the gambler os to take the chances with the minimum amount in a bet that he can afford to bear if the bet goes against the ops,Â  and although gambling may tough decision especially when you do not know how to calculate your odds but then also, you must have to make prompt attempts as to when to make the most of the advantages that come along with various odds.",

Gambling is not a solution to solve any economic problems, its something that should give you enjoy and be fun.We're telling everybody about this for the nth time. Sports bettor should only bet with the amount that they're able to lose it anytime time. Because just as how the gamblers are betting with the money that they normally afford to lose.This is for every gambler in general and I agree on this one since many are still playing using the money they have borrowed from someone. Gambling can be very risky even if its a sports betting since you can still be emotional and you be more greedy, stay within your limit and donâ€™t ever force yourself if you canâ€™t afford it because thereâ€™s a perfect time to gamble so donâ€™t be in a hurry.",
