They declined to disclose a valuation.Co-founder Wertheimer said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been in Bitcoin for over a decade. We have these memories of how Bitcoin was. It was very experimental, but it changed,‚Äù.What do you guys think about their NFT project? It's similar to Apes from Yuga LABS.",

      "body": "whatever the form of NFT, whether via the bitcoin network or erc-20, the value will decrease all the same. this is possible because the economics of NFT do not exist, they only depend on market demand and cannot be used for transactions like bitcoin or other coins.moreover in recent times the presence of ordinals on the bitcoin network has been rejected by many bitcoin users because they cause high fees and make the network congested. so its popularity is limited and only certain communities accept its presence, and that means the sustainability of this ordinal is not high and its value will decrease over time.",

Just like this metaverse, they are planning to bring where NFTs will be shared among those who will show their love towards them like the videos of wearing wizards' outfits or tattoos, etc.Anyway, the amount they have raised is really a lot, I don't know if that amount is really needed to build a metaverse like Apes from Yuga LABS well as a matter of fact Yuga Labs raised around $450 million, and now they worth more than $4 billion dollars.If they succeed to start this initiative then I don't think the fee prices are getting any low.",

Imagine a naked girl on a bed in the middle of an square, nobody would dare to touch her because law enforcements are nearby, right? Now what happens if the law enforcement officers lose control and jump on her first? Lol (rip).But if her parents were competent and God fearing, they would never have allowed her to be used that way by teaching her how to cover her body etc.LE officers = miners.Pedestrians = could be any one in this community.The naked girl = Bitcoin.Her parents = developers.üòâ",

If you check, you'll figure that the only thing that happened with NFTs is reduced hype. At first, everyone was loud about it, new projects were built based on NFTs, and many other developments happened. For me, I still believe that NFTs (and digital real estate aka Metaverse) are not dead, though they could do better with some improvements or changes, after all, people still invest in them anyway.",

Freedom to do crap as well as anything else.Yes! You have a point! It's all about freedom without any Central authority. People get to do whatever crap they want but in a real world, it should not affect others. With all these NFT thing, ETH users are still suffering with high fees and Bitcoin users have started suffering. If the freedom is affecting others, that's not a good freedom and needs to be stopped. But yes, you have a point!",
