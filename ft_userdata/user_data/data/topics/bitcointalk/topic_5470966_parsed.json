      "body": "This is something to look into because I have many girlfriends who are yet to get married due to the high pride price list, naturally is culture and not a thing our fathers or mother's should handle because when Mrs. A has accepted some specific amount from their Inlaw due to culture of a thing Mrs. B won't like to go against their tradition rather would want to compete with others. During my own time it wasn't like that though it was all paid and settled but we should be mindful at the rate at which family's do extort their inlaw's that is coming to marry their daughters, I could remembered vividly when my father tried to messed up my husband I walked up to him telling him that he should accept whatever my husband's people said because after here there are more to bear in the marriage than just putting eyes in the marriage rights.See our father's always forgotten that marriage is an extended family where if their daughter get married today, whatever that comes up within our family my husband has to contribute at least 20 to 30 percent but if he channeled all his effort in paying marriage rights do you think he would look after you people when I am finally taken from you people? He listened and changes his mind then he left with no options because we knew that the truth are always bitter, then I think everything went successfully without any delay since there's now a mutual understanding between us and our inlaws. We the women has a very important role to play during our marriage day, just that most of us chooses to be showing off to make sure my wedding or traditional is much more higher than Mrs. B so we have to showcase our selves in the name that my husband is the highest builder, my dear see there are much than paying marriage rights because after that comes reality, you have to plan for the family, how to manage things including your children by then our parents are no longer their to over see whatever we are passing through. Therefore I suggest anyone choosing to marry should be very mindful and careful before jumping into marriage since this is not boyfriend and girlfriends, in boyfriends you can decide to walk away but in marriage whenever the woman decides to leave, and with the side of our country we came from they would count her as an irresponsible woman which to have another man could be that deem difficult because your records has been already spread around village, community and the nearby community.Choose wisely my people make you no do mistake oo, this journey no be to spend 1 hrs romancing and kissing",

      "body": "These higher bride price demand of a thing has painted some community negatively and their leaders has turned a blind eye towards it, for example, as a small boy learning computer repairs at Enugu state back then, I watched my boss go for marriage activities at Mbaise in IMO state and return without completing it because the list was unimaginable and even with the support of his friends, it was very much above their reach, he was very unhappy and because of how he loved the lady, he had to shift his marriage by six months to be able to meet up. There, myself and some of my fellow apprentices vowed never to marry from that part of the country and I still hold that belief till present. My boss completed his marriage, but banned his in-laws from coming to his house and his wife from visiting her people because he feels he already bought her. Now my question is?? what if my boss never came back to finish what he started what if this has created hard feelings between him and his in-lawsThe girl may have not been married by then and lose a relationship of almost  five years to start afresh with another person if at all. This is entirely bad to be honest.Parents and community heads should be aware of the dangers they put their children to by enacting inhuman rules regarding marriage. The sins of the fathers has to stop haunting the children at this time when everybody is exposed and knows vividly that there's more to marriage than just paying bride price.",

The most painful thing about it is that some of our parents were the ones who first caused it.They paid their bride price with little amount, which is what made their marriage blessed. I'm not sure how they forgot that.We understand that marriage is not recognised without a bride price, but not by placing all of your family's problems on the shoulders of another person.They need to understand that bride price is paid by a man to expresses the love he has for his wife meaning that it is a reward and an honour to show appreciation. I have witnessed numerous couples whose marriages have become unstable due to excessive bride prices.I'm not against it, but they shouldn't turn it into a competition because, as you can see, there are families nowadays that are struggling financially and still want to compare their bride price to that of a wealthy family. We should learn to cut our clothes according to our size. in my opinion it's something that our parents need to look in to.",

      "body": "Honestly speaking, this high bride Price has really affected our men and women who are willing to get married but due to lack of finance to meet up all the marital rights of the bride alot of our girls and boys that are due for marriage have been unmarried.You look at the streets you see alot of unmarried girls both single mothers I begin to wonder if their parents doesn't know that a woman's value tends to fade as time goes on because of menopause some girls on their own even feels that they're too pretty to accept bride Price that are not equal to their standards and the worst part of it is that those girls that claims slay queens and high class girls are from poor families that doesn't have anything to write home about. Some parents begins to calculate the expenses they made on their daughters through attaining education.It is important to know that marriage is a mutual feeling between two people who have accepted each other to become husband and wife so imposing high bride prices is just a way of hindering their daughters from getting married, some girls that couldn't wait for their bride prices to be paid forces their self to premarital pregnancy. Single mothers everywhere of which most of the births are out of wedluck.It is about time to think about the future as we can't channel all our challenges to the government. With the situation that surround marriages now for me I just think that the government should stamp a fixed price that should be paid to brides family and any family that goes against the stipulated price should pay a fine and possible punishment. Our daughters should get married as most of them are approaching menopause just because they're looking for someone that will pay high bride price.",
