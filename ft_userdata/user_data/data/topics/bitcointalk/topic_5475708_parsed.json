  "content": "If you haven’t noticed it yet, then by now Indiana Pacers is the number 1 team in the NBA when it comes to totals. The team roster doesn’t have any LeBron James or Stephen Curry, and yet it’s scoring in such a fast pace, that its name, Pacers, seems to suit it really well.But they used to be exactly the opposite several years ago, used to be an \"under\" team.So once again we have them tonight against the Trail Blazers, total is set at 240.Looks like the over is the best play for this one despite the high total.See our blog post about it:https://gamblingfreebies.com/2023/11/27/indiana-pacers-pick/",
