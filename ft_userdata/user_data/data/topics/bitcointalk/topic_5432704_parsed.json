The pool can be accessed through the below link:Bitcoin price guess, 2023Back to this thread, the lowest price I guess is $15500 which was the lowest price in 2022.I do not know what th highest price can be for now, but it guess it would be between $40000 to $50000.QuoteThere will be a continuation of the bearish trend and a new bottomNoQuoteThe bottom has already been passed, but there will be no growth this yearThere will be increase in bitcoin price this yearQuoteBitcoin is waiting for a recovery, the bearish trend is overYes, but there will still be bear market that will lead to bitcoin getting back to 20000 before 2024 bull runQuoteThere will be a new ATH in 2023No, there will be nothing like ATH this year.",

This year there will be a recovery in the price of bitcoin, but ATH is definitely not worth the wait. The maximum price of bitcoin can reach the last maximum of 2022, at around $48,000. By the way, it was from this mark that the price started in 2022, and it was to this mark that the price came before descending below $20,000.I have symilar predicion. Funy is that there is no option in your poll that i can pick. Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on January 01, 2023, 08:56:12 AMi've vote for 30-40k. I expect strong recovery that will push price close to 30k. Maybe even above 40k. We did not have a strong short squeez starting from ATH in NOV 2021. RSI on monthly was never as oversold as it is now. Fear/greed index shows extreme fear for last 1 year. We had only few days of fear and 0 days of greed. https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/I expect strong recovery but i don't think it will start next cycle. I think we are done with regular bitcoin cycles. So i miss an option \"we are close to strong recovery (even x3 from current price) but we will not see a new bull market with new ATH like in previous cycles.\"",

I don't see much happening this year with Bitcoin price and investors profiting from it. Only those who engage in margin trading will benefit from the slope that will continue to hit this industry as taking shorts will save the day.QuoteThe maximum price of bitcoin can reach the last maximum of 2022, at around $48,000. By the way, it was from this mark that the price started in 2022, and it was to this mark that the price came before descending below $20,000.I know we're merely speculating here but I believe Bitcoin price is likely to get to that point of $48,000, even before the last quarters of 2023 (which is where I expect bullishness). However, it's in 2024 that I envisage the main bull rally that will get price crossing $100k. I quoted that price from a calculative evaluation of the last two Bitcoin halvings and how price soared then. It's not as a wild guess. From $19k+ in 2017 to $68k+ in the last ATH in 2021. The price difference was much and so shall it be in the coming ATH.",

You know, the FTX, Binance fuds, and the rest. I didn't mentioned them because they may be outdated already but the effects or the trauma might still be there for some us. They can't fully moved on yet maybe not until a big positive news come along the way.The BTC halving is still far IMO but when it comes I think a big rally will happen not just a small relief but small reliefs can rather come onward in this current year. I am sceptical if we will reach a $10k low as for me, that is too low already and I think the people right now are much stronger than before.",

If even with such strong shocks in 2022, bitcoin was able to hold on to current price levels, then what would have to happen to break the bottom? It must be something so catastrophic, the probability of which is almost zero. In this regard, I expect that in 2023 bitcoin will hang around at the previous levels, periodically going up a little. I don't think there will be strong growth.",

Fortune is always somewhere, the problem is that it's concentrated in the hands of few individuals and these individuals aren't interested in bitcoin investment right now. To take the bear away and to bring the bull, these wealthy investors must retrieve their interest in bitcoin, meaning bitcoin must shine when compared to other investments' alternatives. Since bitcoin can't do this for now, we are still suffering in this market.The real reason of the bearish market is that there are better alternatives for influent investors at this time, outside crypto industry.",

I understand that people have a huge increase needs, like they want to see it at 30k first, then even break ATH and want to make huge amounts of profit and I get it, I understand it. But that doesn't mean that we are going to end up with something huge neither, it's fine if we do not have it at all.This is why I believe that we should not be really focusing on the current situation as a big deal, just nothing under 15k is more than enough for me, even if we stay in between 16k to 20k all year without going under or over, that's fine.",

I'm not expecting anything huge for this year because it just seems that it won't unless there will be something new, or a trend, that will boost investment interest towards this industry just like early or first quarter of last year. Right now, I'm looking forward more in 2024 in particular with the next Bitcoin halving. But ofcourse I am still hoping that there will be alternative trends to make profit from despite of the market behavior which will afterwards have a positive effect in this industry just like with NFTs and P2Es in 2022. To answer the question, I think the market price would stabilize around $15k to $18k on the first quarter of this year.",

I just think it is not going to be worse. The first few months might just be this same boring sideway movement. That's probably a consolidation period going towards recovery.
