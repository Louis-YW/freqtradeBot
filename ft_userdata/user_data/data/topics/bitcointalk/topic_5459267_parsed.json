  "content": "Hey guys do you think there are ways or any tool out there that can actually get us closer to the target public key? What I mean by this is for example let's say G= 120 and P= 1134Â  where pK = 136080 (G= generator point,Â  P= priv_key, pK = pub key) let's pretend that we don't have P just pK and we search random ranges to see if pK is within the range of some random valid range within Seco256k1. Well of course i understand that the point doubling doesn't happen like this but just for the sake of example. But let me know your thoughts",

Searching random ranges also doesn't give us any information without actually finding the public key.In other words if that were possible you could just look at any random public key, guess its range then limit the search space and brute force to find the private key.",

      "body": "How exactly do you search in random ranges to find a specific range for your target?Since the puzzle #125 is solved, we will see more interest on this subject for a while, you can be sure all the puzzle keys are in the said ranges, just like all the solved and revealed ones.In order to reduce the bit range, you'd need to correctly guess the private key characters, so if the key is 1a5f5da67870ccÂ  if you correctly guess the first 3 chars, you can drop 1a5 from your target, all the tools that exist are doing the same thing somehow, they just do it differently, one is trying to divide, another one tries to subtract, and they are all primitive tools without any effort put in to develop them.ðŸ˜‰",
