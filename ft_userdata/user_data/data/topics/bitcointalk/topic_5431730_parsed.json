  "content": "Sitting outside enjoying the early morning sunshine I was just contemplating on certain national issues as it affect the nation entirely, and then a divergence to the Nigerian economy and the unfriendly nature of the Nigerian financial policies to cryptocurrency activities.Going by this I recounted that few days  from now as we sail into the year 2023 the nation looks forward to her general elections to elect new leaders into governmental positions who will then makes decisions on our behalf as it affects we the citizens in every spheres. Listening to the manifestos of each of the politicians, from those contesting for the position of the President, Senate/Rep members, down to governor's, there was no single politician's manifesto that discussed about intentions of putting up policies that would make for an enabling environment for  digital currency like cryptocurrencies to operate without inimical restrictions or ban.It should suffice us to know that it is through a time as this that youths involved in cryptocurrency operations can have the possibility of  opportunity to enjoy an economic/political environment that is crypto-friendly in correspondence to support and electing of politicians that have a large interest for cryptocurrency utilization, in addition to other national developmental issues bothering the nation. For the Feb, 2023 general elections are just by the corner which might seem too short in time that we can't achieve much in this project, but within the four years intervals that would come by for in preparation to another general elections it would be pertinent and of immense necessity that youths push to the frontline for support for politicians with crypto-friendly programmes, initiatives and policies in their manifesto. This I believe to be one strategy amongst many others that we can use to achieving a crypto business friendly government as we have so desired.Your inputs to this idea be it critique or support would appreciated!",

Best you lock your own thread as that'll be against the progress of this board.Politics is a very broad topic that shouldn't be assigned to one thread, make we welcome all kind of discussion so we go get wetin we fit they talk on but make them no be low quality. As for OP, the reason you no dey see any politician talk about cryptocurency dis time around na because this year isn't crypto friendly and people no even they reasons the industry that much for the global space. Secondly you wan win election and you dey carry matter wey grass root no know dey campaign? Belike you never ready to win election.",

The old ones don't like cryptocurrency concept because it is a new pattern of assets which they don't understand that well or due to the decentralized pattern.Amongst the three presidential candidates it is only Peter Obi that has this feelings for the youth and might be the one to do this for Nigerians, omo the rest will always think in an old fashioned box,which is keeping this country the way it is presently.",

Best you lock your own thread as that'll be against the progress of this board.I was about to say the same thing; I didn't like the idea of creating a thread for only political discussion; now that we have a board, we don't need a thread for a specific discussion; a post of more than 150 words is qualified to stand a topic; this is the type of local board we want; the topic and the content didn't flow together, but it was the best way to catch our attention, which is a good thing to do.

This I believe to be one strategy amongst many others that we can use to achieving a crypto business friendly government as we have so desired.Only a few Nigerians are truly interested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; most of us simply buy and sell; there is more to crypto than just buying and selling; and, furthermore, more than 90% of Nigerians are not interested in crypto, so it would be foolish for anyone to use crypto legalization to campaign; Nigeria has many problems, and adopting crypto is the least of them. Things are fine as they are. unless you want it to be legalized with huge tax.",
