Usually the site has \"Pay in Wallet\" option and I use that and electrum opens up and I hit pay from electrum that take me back to website page. Today when I hit pay from electrum wallet it waited long and did not get recognized on the website end.Finally I got the message on electrum \"The Transaction is only available on your local machine\" and I did not get the coin back. I right clicked the transaction from Electrum and did \"Broadcast\" and the transaction now has 2 confirmations.Will this go through ?",

Some sites may have more than 2 confirmations before the site will see a transaction to be successful. How many confirmations is required on the site before it will see a transaction as successful?If it has reached the number of confirmations needed, contact their customer care as TryNinja stated already.",

      "body": "Probably the number of confirmation might be the issue. My major concern is you moving straight from the website to electrum wallet which means you have connected that wallet to the site. For security purpose it is a bad thing and if possible you need to take your funds off that address because it is expose to online website and can easily be compromised",

Coingate used to be the intermediary and they redirect to the site when I hit pay from the wallet and payments used to reflect after few minutes. Today it got timed out and I had to broadcast again. Will the destination address be recognizing this ? even though I got a timeout page from the website ?",

One more thing be careful of the way you copy and paste, there is also clipboard malware that is becoming very common now. So even when you copy make sure you’re pasting the right thing by going thoroughly through it",

I don't think there will be any issues pertaining to the missing transaction.CoinGate and other payment processors give you a short payment ID which will help them track the payment more easily in their databases, more than the long random strings of numbers and letters that we use as transaction IDs. That is what OP needs to give to the customer support so they can locate the transaction and issue a refund.",
