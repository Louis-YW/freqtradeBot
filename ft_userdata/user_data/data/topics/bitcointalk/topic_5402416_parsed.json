Users can withdraw $BTC on Ethereum or BNB Chain while our team works to resolve this temporary pause.QuoteBinance has temporarily paused #Bitcoin withdrawals on the $BTC network. Meanwhile, you can still withdraw BTC on other networks.This is due to a stuck on-chain transaction. Our team is currently working on a solution and will provide further updates soon.To open the discussion, my opinion is that bitcoin on any other chains is not bitcoin. Do not encourage binance or assist binance in their attempt to take control with their shit useless alt network. BTC is BTC, not BSC.",

In mempool.space we can get a confirmation with 27 sat/byte, which is about $ 1.50 or even $0.9  (if you use segwit)Binance probably just want to save on fees and they are repassing that cost to its customers, who doesn't understand that a token from other chains is not really BTC.My suggestion is that everyone should wait until BTC withdrawals come back and cash out to BTC chain any remaining btc.",
