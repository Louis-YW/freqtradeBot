Nevocoin is immune to Replace-By-Fee: transactions with no confirmations are less likely to be cancelled by an attacker. And in case you want extra security, one confirmation takes just 2 minutes.CPU miningNevocoin employs a custom mining algorithm based on random code execution to ensure a fair hashrate distribution. Consumer computers' CPUs are the best hardware for mining NEVO.PrivateMost cryptocurrencies are transparent: anybody in the world can track your funds and possibly correlate them with your private life. Nevocoin is completely anonymous and untraceable by default, thanks to its multi-layered privacy features.ScalableThanks to its fast to verify mining algorithm, pruning, Bulletproofs+, and many other optimization techniques, Nevocoin is one of the most scalable blockchains while still providing an excellent degree of anonymity.Useful linksExchangesXeggex: https://xeggex.com/asset/NEVONonKYC: https://nonkyc.io/asset/NEVOPoolshttps://nevo.kilopool.com/https://www.nevocoin.ch/Mining softwareNEVORig: https://github.com/nevocoin/nevorigKilonevo: https://github.com/kilopool/kilonevo",
