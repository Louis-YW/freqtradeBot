They have poor entropy when you want to generate random numbers, it is a bad idea to use it to generate a private key.For you to create a private key, you need some randomness to generate 256 bits of numbers (0-1) and with the help of elliptic curve multiplication, it generates your public key and then hashed to give you a short version public key hash and then encoded to address format.You cant employ a Passphrase unless you are trying to create a seed/recovery phrase that you can combine with Mnemonic code, each passphrase generates you a unique seed and with a single seed, you can generate private keys as you want with branches of addresses.Quote from: bitbollo on May 30, 2022, 09:42:05 PMQuote5JDVE834PAQ6dPnwLNDfVhrtpvUnLrjMd542K2v6xaxBMJmx5dZQuote1PDxsav11yCjkXCZAF4jXbZPkr8H5RHPpcFrom this, you created a Legacy address with WIF private key, I don't see the use of a passphrase that was required.

The passphrase can also be confusing because the passphrase used in Incoleman is for the hierarchical deterministic wallet in which new keys and addresses are generated through the salting process. This type of passphrase (in HD wallet) is also safe as it is not only used in generating the master private key, it is used along with seed phrase to generate entirely new keys and addresses.Quote from: bitbollo on May 30, 2022, 11:12:51 PMInteresting point.

He is sure of the phrase, but the numbers are unknown. I have prepared a dedicated software for that, a few GPUs are running... He found one address (so, the method is correct), but unfortunately the one which was already emptied by him years ago.

      "body": "The question is why are you doing it this way?Do you not trust that a 12 word seed phrase is secure enough? Bitcoin private keys have 128 bits of security, so having a seed phrase with more than 128 bits of security doesn't add very much to your set up. Creating your own method from a 500 character phrase might well have much more security than 128 bits, but it could also have far less. We can't say for sure. And if you want more than 12 words, then you can use 24.Or do you not trust your hardware to generate a seed phrase? In which case, why not generate your own seed phrase by flipping a (fair) coin 128 or 256 times and calculating the checksum? Then you can be sure that there is no bias or flaws in your hardware or software.Or do you worry about someone finding your seed phrase and stealing your coins? In that case, swapping to a longer phrase again doesn't add much in the way of security. The best mitigation here is to either use multiple passphrases or to use a multi-sig wallet.Whatever you are trying to achieve with a custom set up like this is better achieved by using one of the standard tools available, as well as making it far less likely that you forget what you have done and lock yourself out of your wallets in the future.",
