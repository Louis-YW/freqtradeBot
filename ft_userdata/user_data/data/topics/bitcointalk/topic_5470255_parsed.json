  "content": "Hi, I'm a layman, attempting to setup BitcoinCore for the first time and I'm encountering an error during synchronization.  I'm using a new 1TB external SSD.  Some basic Google searches suggested the block data is corrupted possibly from the hardware.  I assumed the new SSD is faulty.  I tried a second (also New) 1TB external SSD and received the same error at roughly the same block as the other one.  No idea what to do now.  Any help is greatly appreciated.Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number:    bitcoin-25-arm64-apple-darwin.dmgOperating System:    MacOS Sonoma 14System Hardware Specs:    Apple M2, 16 GB Ram, 256GB HD, 1TB external SanDisk SSD (for BitcoinCore)Description of Problem:  During synchronization, a prompt \"Error: A fatal error occurred, see debug.log for details\", then BitcoinCore shuts down.  Any further attempt to restart receives the same error.Screenshot of the problem:  https://imgur.com/a/XHID1TQLog Files from the Bitcoin Client:   https://pastebin.com/NgghHzmW2023-10-13T20:49:06Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000e527fc19df0992d58c12b98ef5a17544696bbba67812ef0e64 height=181440 version=0x00000001 log2_work=68.176392 tx=3425659 date='2012-05-24T18:10:29Z' progress=0.003885 cache=252.4MiB(1830338txo)2023-10-13T20:49:06Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000008b5dcfd70f61ab44bcb92e257c976ce0aeb820105b292477a65 height=181441 version=0x00000001 log2_work=68.176421 tx=3425976 date='2012-05-24T18:25:07Z' progress=0.003886 cache=252.4MiB(1830046txo)2023-10-13T20:49:06Z ERROR: ReadBlockFromDisk: Errors in block header at FlatFilePos(nFile=11, nPos=1591572)2023-10-13T20:49:06Z *** Failed to read block2023-10-13T20:49:06Z Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details2023-10-13T20:49:21Z ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: ActivateBestChain failed (Failed to read block)2023-10-13T20:49:21Z ERROR: ReadBlockFromDisk: Errors in block header at FlatFilePos(nFile=11, nPos=1591572)2023-10-13T20:49:21Z *** Failed to read block2023-10-13T20:49:21Z Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details2023-10-13T20:49:24Z ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: ActivateBestChain failed (Failed to read block)2023-10-13T20:49:24Z ERROR: ReadBlockFromDisk: Errors in block header at FlatFilePos(nFile=11, nPos=1591572)2023-10-13T20:49:24Z *** Failed to read block2023-10-13T20:49:24Z Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details2023-10-13T20:54:07Z ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: ActivateBestChain failed (Failed to read block)2023-10-13T20:54:07Z tor: Thread interrupt2023-10-13T20:54:07Z Shutdown: In progress...2023-10-13T20:54:07Z opencon thread exit2023-10-13T20:54:07Z addcon thread exit2023-10-13T20:54:07Z torcontrol thread exit2023-10-13T20:54:07Z msghand thread exit2023-10-13T20:54:07Z net thread exit2023-10-13T20:54:07Z DumpAnchors: Flush 2 outbound block-relay-only peer addresses to anchors.dat started2023-10-13T20:54:07Z DumpAnchors: Flush 2 outbound block-relay-only peer addresses to anchors.dat completed (0.00s)2023-10-13T20:54:07Z scheduler thread exit2023-10-13T20:54:07Z Writing 0 unbroadcast transactions to disk.2023-10-13T20:54:07Z Dumped mempool: 1.208e-06s to copy, 0.00155679s to dump2023-10-13T20:54:10Z Shutdown: done",

In many different systems.I will look for the reviews.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wd-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-sandisk-extreme-pro-ssd-failuresI suggest these instead.https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Photographers-MU-PE1T0S-AM/dp/B09VLK9W3S/ref=sr_1_3?once you do your external having a second copy on a samsung is worth having.",
