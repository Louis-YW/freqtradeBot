      "body": "Omo you talk better thing for here ooo,  some people have taken this  forum activities to be their full time job and for me, its not entirely a good thing because if for example, you're out of campaign, how do you survive before getting another one?. This should be a side hustle and there should be a fallback plan that anybody in the forum should have prepared, in case of any necessity. Its a serious act of laziness to have only forum activities as your day to day job. You should however think of acquiring a  marketable skill that you'll fund with your income from the forum and have it as another stream of income.Also, a word of advise to my fellow aspiring full members, better have a job to sustain you for the time being. There's no length of time projected to  attain full members rank, it can be shorter, or longer depending on your luck and level of quality engagement. I'm a web developer, graphics designer, hardware engineer and an ICT trainer.",

Having a work or source of income from this forum signifies that you are exposed to the computer or online world. You can chose from amongst the opportunities you have available online to chose the one that works best for you to explore also. If this forum is your main source of income, then you need to diversify and look for more. Since you’re conversant with computers through working from this forum, having a similar work that requires the use of computer gadgets will make it easier for you rather than going to have another physical work, which requires more of your time and energy been put into it with more stress. Bitcointalk should not be the only source of income, you should have more than one because even government work is not dependable to sustain one again. Having one is good and having two is better.",

Na truth talk, o brother the way people are hustled for the job now is no small thing, and some never see a single job join up today. To be honest this forum has helped many individuals; many people are earning here, some huge and some small, but with the littles, we get all survived. I can say that out of 100% in Nigerians, 50% are involved in online business because they believe it is a better option than hanging around without a job after graduating from school. Furthermore, I would like to provide some suggestions with my other members here: it would be beneficial if they could recommend their brother to any online businesses. I think they could have a great possibility, because the proverb started that if you share a little you have today with younger people or friends, tomorrow will be the biggest for you too.QuoteYou as a forum member, waiting be your occupation abi na only bitcointalk you depend on, Come make we chuck mouth for this matter , make newbie learn something about working.
