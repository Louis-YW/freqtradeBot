  "content": "I very much have the interest to be a professional crypto trader at some point in my life, but it should be after I have understood it the way I want. Am well aware of the emotions which hunt gamblers, because I had tried it a few times. Same emotions also hunt traders and it is in the form of Fear, greed, hope, regret. Although I beg to differ, I have learnt how it is in trying to be wary of such emotions that we become victims of such emotions in critical times. It helps to give a constant reminder to oneself on how to control such emotions when money/crypto is involved because a loss could be a recurring outcome and not being able to manage ones emotional state could be very detrimental.QuoteHere are 10 tips from the pros on how to manage your emotions while trading:1. Don’t act on anger. When you’re angry, hold out, wait until reason takes hold. There is no worse trade than a “revenge” trade, in which a trader follows up a loss by jumping right back in to recoup. Consult your trading journal to get back on track.2. Don’t marry your positions. It’s easy for a trader to get stubborn, and to hold on to a trade just because he ‘hopes’ it will turn around. Close down a bad trade as soon as possible, take your loss and move on. Your trading journal will suggest the next move.Follow each trade with a break. Trading goes on at a rapid pace, so don’t get caught up in the action. Take a moment to think about something else, and then come back and deliberate. Now look at your trading journal to get the next idea.3. Set a fixed point at which you stop. After three, four, five or whatever number you choose, stop for a good long break. It’s when one trade follows another that most mistakes happen. Consult your trading journal and review your strategy.4. Don’t keep track of profit and loss. Doing the math on your earnings will only get your emotions working. Concentrate on your trading strategy, and review your trading journal to develop it. Then, at the end of the trading day, you can check out how well or poorly you did.5. Keep your mind on the plan. Don’t let the results of a few trades change your overall strategy and approach. Stick to what you have learned and what you have planned – use your trading journal to develop your next moves.6. Don’t confuse prudence with fear. You want to trade prudently, using logic and reason. This may make you hold off on a trade. But make sure that prudence, and not fear, is behind your decision. Fear can wreck your trading by keeping you from making a trade. Use your trading journal to see if the trade makes sense, follows previous wins, or if the trade just doesn’t make sense.7. Watch out for greed. Greed can make you stay in a trade when you had planned to exit, hoping to milk it for a little more profit. Such trades risk turning out badly, just when you thought you were winning. Use your trading journal to judge the best exit points based on past behavior.8. Manage your stops carefully. A cautious approach to stops and limits will keep you from making rash decisions. It hurts to get a trade stopped out, but over time you will save money on losses. Your trading journal can give you useful comparisons on levels for stops.9. Don’t give up. There comes a point in every trader’s life when it just doesn’t seem worth it anymore. 10. Don’t let yourself be intimidated. Trading is tough, but you can win.Was this helpful? Share your perspective!Source link:https://tradersync.com/10-tips-to-manage-your-emotions-while-trading/",

Now look at your trading journal to get the next idea.You can decide not to close your position if you open the position and having in mind not to close it very soon. There are some traders that may want to go for swing trading for some weeks. If you do not learn the strategy to hold positions, that means you still always depend on using leverage that makes your trading riskier.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 16, 2023, 08:27:17 PM3.

It’s when one trade follows another that most mistakes happen.From my experience, you are not wrong about this. And trading can be addictive for some traders, but which is not good. Infact, the last trade that I lost, I have won more than $25 that day when bitcoin started to fall recently. I close the trade and buy and I lost more.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 16, 2023, 08:27:17 PM4. Don’t keep track of profit and loss.

Then, at the end of the trading day, you can check out how well or poorly you did.For me, I do not think so. I do not know of others. I keep track on profit and loss and that is not going to alter my trading plan.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 16, 2023, 08:27:17 PM7. Watch out for greed.

Use your trading journal to judge the best exit points based on past behavior.I totally agree. There are days I would have won the money I expected that day, but I will not close the position, later the market will reverse and I will start losing. When I was using a very high leverage, a favoured trade will later lead to liquidation of trading fund after greed of not closing the position opened after winning my target.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 16, 2023, 08:27:17 PM9. Don’t give up. There comes a point in every trader’s life when it just doesn’t seem worth it anymore.If anyone sees that trading is taking his more like an addicted gambler, there is nothing bad to stop trading, or at least for some time.",

Greed is inevitable. It’s hard to control yourself from being greedy because we are born with human greed. But if we want to maximize and be successful with crypto trading, then probably fighting our own emotions will be a big challenge for us. Some just leave trading because their emotions are uncontrollable, but we can always chose to trade with less emotions involved. It’s hard but if other crypto traders have succeeded on it, then it’s not far from reality that we can also be able to do it. Maybe we should learn to be more patient and understanding on whatever consequences this trading might cause, but with willingness and passion to overcome the risk, then we will eventually reach far in trading.",

I think if many just bought spot bitcoin or ethereum and held it for a few months they would make decent money in the long term. The issue is they want to go 100x leverage long or short on a token which is highly volatile like SOL or DOGE and that's how they get rekt very quickly.They see all over crypto twitter, people posting screenshots of $100K profit day and they get jealous and try to do the same. Only to find out how quickly you can get liquidated if you use high leverage such as 100x, especially on mid cap alt coins. Same reason why many stock traders don't make money either. Instead of buying and holding the stock. They just buy the options which are short dated and expire within a week. They want the 10-100x gains instead of the slow 1% weekly gains and that how they get liquidated.",

As keeping track of accounts is necessary and if you will not track the profits and losses you are making on each of your trades then how can you improve your next trade? Like, i know if the previous trade made you some loss then your sentiments will change for the next trade you will make on the same day. Which will be like covering the loss you have made in the previous trade. But sometimes, your determination to do things make you able to think beyond your knowledge and experience. So, if you just stick to the trade sequence or analysis you have made and started to perform trading one by one and at the end after calculating profit or loss, That would not be helpful. Other than 4th point, i am agreed with all of your points. You have shared many points but the main sentiments of markets that drove you are only 4 or 5 which i already covered in my topic before. Don’t Fall Prey to these Market Sentiments and Save your BitcoinWhich are holding, P&D, FOMO, and FUD. I know many will not agree with my points that's why i have opened all ears to new recommendations.",

In theory, I understand better. But when I practice directly in trading, I often lose control of my emotions. Then I asked one of the users from this forum and from the same country as me. and he seems quite adept at trading. then he said to me that experience will teach me. And he told me to get more involved in trading with small capital first. and he also said that if we want to be able to control our emotions then we have to know the fundamentals of the coin we are going to trade and we have to know the market situation by making a careful sentimental analysis. so the point is we must have good preparation before entering the trade. then I implemented it in the past few weeks. and the results are pretty good.

A close friend, maybe even a spouse. Or a brother/sister. Tell them exactly everything, I found this helped with another friend. He watched me and I watched him. But you must be open with each other 100%When you are losing, your emotions can't be controlled. But your friend isn't affected, and he can tell you to stop, or to take a break. And you do the same for him.You see all these tips are pointless because when you're caught up in emotion, you don't think rationally anymore. So you need help from someone objective. If you tell them \"stop me when I lose my deposit\". He will stop you because it's not his money and he's not losing.",
