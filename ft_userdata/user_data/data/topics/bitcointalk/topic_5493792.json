  "content": "Today, I'll offer the forum a thought experiment.Imagine that one day, the core devs of Bitcoin would come to a consensus that: Today, Bitcoin is simply an investment and value store, not a \"currency\" for most of its users.Today, most holders of Bitcoin do so in a centralized way, e.g. with a broker or an app.Bitcoin has failed its original purpose of being able to thwart government subpoenas since it is subject to chain analysis (and hence has opened the door to competitors like Monera for this niche need).Bitcoin could never become a mainstream currency since it was intentionally designed to be slow and expensive.With so much adoption and awareness from its popularity as an investment instrument, Bitcoin could become a mainstream worldwide currency if it were made to be fast and cheap, allowing it to be used for everyday transactions e.g. a parking meter or a cup of coffee.Mainstream adoption of Bitcoin like this would probably send the price of Bitcoin into orbit.The only way that you could make Bitcoin fast and cheap enough to transact such that it would be superior to (say) ordinary credit card transactions would be to centralize the architecture. In other words, instead of a consensus algorithm among thousands of anonymous servers, Bitcoin would be backed with an architecture controlled by a single legal entity and a trusted set of servers, eliminating the need for proof-of-work and eliminating vast amounts of complexity to the system, immensely streamlining Bitcoin transactions. In this scenario, Bitcoin could truly take over as a worldwide mainstream currency, with consumers replacing their everyday transactions with Bitcoin transactions.However, also in this scenario, Bitcoin would lose some of its \"mythology\" or \"religion\" since it started as a way to transact without the possibility of a government discovering the parties of its transactions.But in this scenario, almost all of Bitcoin's current users--and millions (or potentially billions) more--would only notice that Bitcoin is very fast and very cheap to transact with, and that millions of ordinary vendors now accept Bitcoin as retail payments, for instance.All it would take is for Bitcoin's core devs to change their minds.Could this happen? If not, why not?",

Today Bitcoin remains decentralized and is doing very well that way. now for people to buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin and buy things using bitcoin, governments have set their rules, laws. As exchanges are owned by private people and need banks, they had to give in, and this was inevitable from the day bitcoin was created. No government would let its citizens deal with a currency without putting in place rules on how that currency should be dealt with in their country. That's why, in my opinion, I don't see any reason for us to complain about anything today. bitcoin is being well regarded by governments, by large investors and this is a very good thing, because it allows bitcoin and fiat to both be used without people fighting and getting into paranoia that fiat should end, when they know that fighting with governments about ending fiat, and useless. That's why in my opinion no one would think of centralizing bitcoin",

The process to move Bitcoin to a centralized architecture would be a complicated one, but straight-forward, on the whole.And the only reason miners are even relevant is because of the software as well.

And if Bitcoin was faster and cheaper to transact, that seems like it would only make it more liquid, not less.Most users of Bitcoin today don't even know what \"decentralized\" means, and since they use it through an app or a broker, they aren't even exposed to this feature in any way. We're talking about getting rid of a feature that only perhaps 1% of this product's users even care about, in exchange for broadening it's appeal massively.Quote from: Dunamisx on April 22, 2024, 05:50:12 PMDon't just bring in some ideas that are not possible or being realistic about bitcoin, [...]If Bitcoin's core devs wanted to centralized Bitcoin, they could centralized Bitcoin.

This was never the original purpose of Bitcoin and it was never private either. Chain analysis is just a fancy word for reading an already public chain and drawing connections base of previous transactions.I find this rather bizarre, and I didn't think what I had said was particularly controversial. Bitcoin was invented in the context of P2P networks, which are only necessary when you don't want governments able to observe or stop the transactions. Otherwise there is no reason to just use a central server, which is the way almost all of the internet works already. The p2p approach is slower, more expensive, more complicated, harder to use, and can easily be very dangerous for end-users. The only reason you resort to something like that is because you have to, e.g. you could be prosecuted if you don't.Quoteâ€¢ The world is not in need of a fast and cheap means of transacting, they already have a variety of option, Bitcoin will not still finish top if it becomes centralized.This reminds of me of a famous quote: \"640k ought to be enough for anybody\" .Credit card transactions are still pretty slow in computing terms, and are still pretty expensive. But more importantly, they require an exchange of personal information in the transaction, which is a major limitation.Quoteâ€¢ An even more volatile means of paying for a cup of coffee?TouchÃ© . But if transactions are fast and cheap enough, you can presumably have processes inside of your wallet to move your store of value to thing(s) that are more stable. Then you could only expose yourself to Bitcoin's volatility when that's what you wanted.QuoteIn essence it will become just like any of the thousand other worthless altcoins.Maybe.
