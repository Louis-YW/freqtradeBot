This is not necessary as they will spam your emails, if you want to stay updated then you can follow their social media channels.If you are talking about testnet, this is an early tester form of the project and will likely be rewarded after the testnet phase ends. This is a popular form of airdrop today and it is effective for both the project and the participants.",

Safety-wise with the 'early birds' it's better to just go with another email just meant for NFTs, ICOs and other crypto related projects.",

It depends on the project but airdrop projects I believe is first come first serve, So the earlier you are is the early the reward will be sent to you. There are also airdrops that require task and those task would be easier if done early like their common referral program. If you are one of the first, There would be a high chance that you can invite more. Keeping in touch is one of the qualities that the airdrop hunters need, so having a direct email from the project would be a neet thing to have.",

I guess it's about something like doing task to get incentive. If you meant about something related with the early access was about test net. Testnet is a way for the developers to testing the network before it will be launched and it can be considered as early even as well.

It's not airdrop. Airdrop dropped by the developers as reward for the people who have tried to testing product.",

They're making it like they're mandating people to get on them as early as they can because they seem important but there's a twist with that.",

This is become a habit when we send email to online sites, not only when we want to take part in airdrops and others, even when we register on a trusted platform, it is still possible for our email to be misused so that it becomes full of junk and scam messages, my second email full of it",

But what I saw before on a Defi platform I am using is they have this page where they list some of their prospects that airdrop will happen on some chains, not only 1 chain but others too, you can filter it by chain or sort, etc.It's called DefiLlama, they have Airdrop page: https://defillama.com/airdrops",

This means you can make your investment during the seed phase or during the private sale phase and there you get the tokens to a price that is usually quite a bit lower than the one in the public sale or for the listing of the project.If they are saying early access in terms of airdrop then i would guess that they just want to have your e-mail address in order to send you spam mails or, even worse, to sell your address to other spam mail senders or scammers. So never given them your \"real\" mail address.",
