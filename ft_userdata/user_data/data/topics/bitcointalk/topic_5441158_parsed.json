      "body": "As I said in the thread on investing in the food related industry, I think the best thing to do is to try to earn more. If I have to cut back on something I prefer not to cut back on food, and by earning more I don't have to cut back. But since this thread is about cutting back, I will say that the best way to cut back is to prepare your own food and not take advantage of McDonald's and BK coupons as some of the options in the OP reflect. You buy healthy food, and cook from scratch. You always have cheaper options, as Hispo says. If you have to cut back, you're not going to buy prawns and lamb. You'd better buy eggs, chicken and pork. Seasonal fruits and vegetables, etc. And don't eat out or order food from home.",

      "body": "I come from the sports and entertainment business. And I had a little bit to do with living cheap on the road/tour.There are macros in nutrition, and the important one is protein. So there is a protein/human protein-ration (biological value) and proteinor biological value/Euro-ratio. Biological value means that a certain amount of consumed protein is changed to a certain amount of protein in your biological system. Eggs are the benchmark of 100. And often to eat two different proteins with different biological values is better as to eat just one high value protein. But this is not the biggest deal. The biggest deal ist the protein or biological value/Euro-ratio. In 2019 there was a 1g protein/0.8-1.2 Cent (Euro)-ratio the normal thing. So nearly every food in a supermarket had that range of ratio. But there were some special things. F.E. chicken hearts has a ratio of 1g protein/~0.2 Cent (Euro). So my tipp: Eat chicken hearts!---And the best free protein source is roadkill.It is easy: What everybody does not like to eat, buy it/eat it!",

I remember before that there are coupons given only to new user but still getting abuse by those not a new user by making a lot of accounts and changing identity. Yes we can save from it but it is rarely happening in our country",

Find a food shop that is lowBesides having to choose the needs that must be purchased, you can also look for large discounts and promo prices. In my country discounts or promos are held only when there is a big event and weekend while weekday prices return to normal, therefore you should buy food ingredients for weekly to be more efficient.

Let's say a big mac cost for $5 and you only want to buy 2 because you can't eat too much, but the 10% discount can be used if you buy in McDonald for minimum of $20. So you're actually spend $8 more when you're only need to spend $10 at the beginning, it's actually make you to spend more money.While if you buy a burger from street foods, it only cost you for $3 which mean cheaper without any discount.The best way to cut food costs is grow your own gardens or buy a raw materials, then cook it yourself.",

So in the end you get the burgers (with no meat) for a few cents. I do not remember exactly. But it is worth to experiment with that.McDonalds Monopoly is also a good thing to go with it: Most people do not use the stickers - and often you can collect them on the cups/burger packages and get free burgers.------------In some countrys it is legal, in some it is not:You can use the old 4-is-5-trick. It meant that you cut 1/5 (80 percent) of a note from the note. In most countrys you can change a note with more of 70 percent to a full note. So you do it with 4 100-notes and you have 4x20 percent extra = 1 extra 100-note.----You can buy food (with others) one the wholesale market.",

Although we have these companies in my home country they don't offer such a discount that would be activated with a code. And I have never seen such a special discount sale for specific groups like students. They usually advertise for discount sales or promos.These discount sales can indeed help citizens to save money but sometimes these products might be close to their expiration date which might not be ideal for a person that wants to buy in bulk and store them for future use.",

But of course with a limited supply of goods. so we have to compete with other buyers speed. like every Sunday in my area there is a Supermarket that provides a special bonus buy 1 get 1 free. I also recently bought 2 liter cooking oil and got a free cooking oil bonus with the same brand and size. but that only applies to the first 20 buyers. every week there are always discounts and bonuses like that with different types and products every week.Another way I do to cut food costs is to plant some types of plants that can live in front of my yard. I have plants like chilies, green onions, spinach, and many more types of vegetables. so that some of the ingredients for cooking are already available in front of the home page without having to buy it. because by chance my yard is quite wide",

Not to mention it is better for the environment (less plastic packaging) and can be done in bulk to get several meals for the future. It's a very useful skill to have and might even get you a job as a cook if you found it more interesting. Most people go for the ready meal type food, which can be packed with a lot of preservatives and unnecessary chemicals to extend the life of the food, which might not be so good for your health. The only slight downside is it takes a little longer to prepare, but like anything you practice, it gets faster and faster - plus the food can often come out much tastier.",
