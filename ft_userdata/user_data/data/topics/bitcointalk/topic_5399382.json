  "content": "Hi to all as you know and you can see im not a old old member of this forum but i gave you tips and help that you can need here to make better your post and to make more fluent your contact with the forum and members.One of the most things that a lot of beginners asks its.HOW CAN I PUT AN IMAGE IN MY POST?.Well we have a ton of threads made be users explaining that. But i think never its bad to remember to all how can be made and to have a thread nearby.Lets go with the explanation.We have two types of uploads for images. 1-   We can use the tool of the fórum to Upload images.  (the “hardest”).Two [img  gonna appear and between the two you have to put the link of you image.Can be a direct link or you can upload a image to any host of images like imgurBefore you post, click on preview and see if you did the correct, if you did , you can see in the preview the image displaying on the post.2-   For me the easiest way to made this.Go to  https://imgbb.com/Upload your imageChoose the “BBCode full linked” option.Copy and paste into your post. And thats its all.The link can be something like this.http://After this, we can have some troubles when a images its too big or huge for this we need to resize the images. Lets see how.This only can be made using the first method for uploading images.You can see more of resizing in this thread from where i collect the information. But i think i collect to you the most easiest way to do.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3357883.0With this you can made a HUGE IMPROVEMENT in yours publications.TRUST SYSTEM.Lets do very, very simple.When you have below 7 days of use (total time log in) in the fórum everytime you enter a thread made by a user with “bad reputation” you can see a banner in yellow or red warning of the risks for operating with him.If you are really beginer and you see this, RUN FAR AWAY.With only this tip you can be safe of the 90% of the Scam people.After the seven day of use this dissapear and for know if you can trust you need t osee the Trust in the user profile and made your election.Tip: If you see a user with bad reputation, go away simple as that.In this forum aside of comments or particular cases the trust system works good so if you see a user with bad reputation you can trust he is a bad user, because in my time here i didnt see any user falsely accusing. So trust in the veterans.FINAL DISCLAIMER: - Im a mid user so im not a wise of the forum and i need to keep learning some things.- Sorry if i dont write completly good, its because english its not my mother tongue.- Feel free to ask- I made this to help the begineers and because i think this are the two main questions when you start here.",

Sometimes people use trust feedback so arbitrarily and their feedback might not be true. They are angry and at the same moment, they write trust feedback. It is not big problem as later, per request or report, other members can double check on trust feedback, past reputation before any negative trust feedback.",

They might be able to buy copper members to bypass restrictions, but if not, they would have to wait at least to rank up to Jr. members to post the image and display it in the post.Beginners or newbie can only post image links but cannot be displayed unless someone with a Jr member rank or higher is willing to quote them. But your tutorial may be useful because some people may not know how to get image links.",

In this case you will have to use an external site like imgur to convert it to BBcode.Quote from: darxiaomi on May 19, 2022, 06:33:54 PMWe know a lot of new user dont remain for long here and also they don't want to read too much.

The forum trust system is only a suggestion, sometime with references; You bear the responsibility of doing your research.",

      "body": "Forgive the OP, but on the contrary, I see something in your post that can decently confuse beginners.Why create superficial themes? You skimmed through the images and briefly talked about the trust system.After reading this, the beginner will believe that he is already aware of all the rules and, subsequently, will convince us that he knows everything.I would offer a more complete understanding of each individual topic. Especially since you yourself have agreed that you are aware of all the links shown to you by hd49728.Do you yourself understand the meaning of creating such a topic?",
