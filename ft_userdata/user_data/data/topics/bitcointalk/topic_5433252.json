It's like buying a product but didn't read the manual. We tend to neglect such thing because we think it's not that important until it is. Celsius doesn't do anything wrong here, it's the client's fault of ignoring important notice from them since the start. This situation is completely different from \"not your keys, not your coins\" but somehow it's kinda related to the matter where you can't control what you don't completely own.",

If you do not agree with them, then they won't let you use their platform.Since we do not have decentralized platforms and we see others using the same platform, we have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions and hope the exchange / platform will run in good faith.In case of a collapse just as it happened with Celsius, of course our funds will be lost.",

It's too late for some things now, but it seems that even after everything, people have learned almost nothing - millions of BTC are in the possession of various CEXs, and their clients are exposed to the risk of being left without everything.But you can't force someone to act smart if he insists on being stupid, right?",

This is clearly the investor's fault. I am not defending centralized exchanges but frankly, the cryptocurrency market is not strictly regulated and not protected by law so we need to be responsible for our assets rather than relying on the government after the losses. If you deposit money in Celsius to receive interest, will you declare it to the government to pay taxes, or will you spend it on your own, and when you get scammed, you go to them for help?",

All these conditions could be greatly reduced. In order not to get into trouble, as users of the Celsius with a user agreement, it was simply not necessary to give btc to this platform or any other. Here I agree with OP, who singled out a well-known phrase in the crypto community, which is often forgotten, but never ceases to be relevant.

Most times people really do not read what they have to, they are in a hurry to agree to terms and conditions which they know not what is in-between the agreement. Agreeing to a legal document means you agreeing to everything stated in that documents as it relates to the organization which you consent to and you have no legal right over it after signing up for it that is why it is good to seek the advise of a legal attorney to guide you through.If I ask now how many of you read terms and conditions before signing  I guess not upto 30% do that This case is now a eye opener.
