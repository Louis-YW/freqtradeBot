There is no harm at all about posting that information in multiple boards. In fact, it can be really helpful, especially if it turns out to be true. Spreading the word and letting people know about a compromised wallet is a good thing. After all, there is strength in numbers, right? So, by posting in multiple boards, you are increasing the chances of reaching a wider audience and making sure the information reaches those who need it most.",

Im reading off the replies on their tweet and read that there was possible vulnerability issue that has been addressed properly few months before and they didnt disclose it. If Im not mistaken atomic wallet is a non custodian one. This is kinda scary, for some users. They should have tighten up their security and must refund affected users if found that its their fault.",

I'm asking because I did this a long time ago when I imported my wallet to the Atom and Exodus wallets, but after that time I have not yet visited or logged into the wallet. Maybe they did not drop the current happenings and full details of the situation.",

It's quite devastating I gather. This will cause people to start withdrawing their coins in a rush and some might make mistakes or don't get to do it quickly and get their coins stuck. Such threats can in the future be evaded by not trusting any wallet wholly, always staying informed by turning on notification, reading them and turning on news channels, using wallets totally seperated from the internet interference unless you want to withdraw the coins in it.

That is why I appreciate his effort but my reason for posting the first initial post link is to just make people aware that it has been posted before and maybe people could get more information from the discussion going on there. But overall I don’t agree with you about creating same thread by different members if it is not on urgent security related issues like this. But generalizing it will only make some members probably spammers abuse this and create more exiting posts to adding more value at all.",

Otherwise I prefer open-source wallets as a must. You can't look inside a black box and who has time to reverse-engineer closed-source executables. If I'd ever need such a multi-coin and multi-token wallet again and no open-source choice were available, it would've to support at least connection to a hardware wallet, so that seed and private keys are safe from the black box software.Unfortunately that's rarely an ability of such multi-coin wallets and no, I'm not going to use shitty Ledger Live with Ledger NoNo black box firmware crap.Quote from: yudi09 on June 04, 2023, 10:06:57 AMQuote from: Zaguru12 on June 03, 2023, 09:04:47 PMThanks for the information OP although Wind_FURY had posted same thing earlier on Wallet Software board.
