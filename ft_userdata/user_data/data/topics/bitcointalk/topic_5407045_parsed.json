I understand your point of view. I would like to say first off, 2019 - and if one were to look into the context of each situation and seek to understand it, imo (obviously), you'd truly be left with no qualms. Looking beyond these 'bold warnings from forum authoritative figures' helps reassure you too. Look into who they are too. These markers all seem to want to show me being late as an equivalent of me defaulting/disappearing, to really *attempt to* wreck any trust in me on this forum, but I digress.If I had the possibility of collateral, I think I would have converted it into liquid by now. Though, I do have real life context that confirms sufficient revenue for a loan of this size/interest/term.",
