Yield farming often looks very attractive to investors due toextremely large interest rates. Although, a problem in today's DeFi ecosystem is that rewards often haveto be paid out by using artificial inflation. This is a problem, but is also necessary for these protocols tofunction.  Because without inflation, platforms wouldn’t be able to offer enticing interest rates to investors.Although, it gives participants little reason to want to hold the token because it will be losing value as itbecomes more diluted. Historically yield farming platforms will have great price action at first, as theirlarge interest rates attract new investors and a large amount of capital to the platform. However, once therate of new users onboarding starts to peak and there is less new capital buying up the tokens that arebeing minted. It ends up with the price starting to consistently decline as the market gets more and morediluted with freshly minted tokens and sell pressure builds up. The Kinect Protocol has been developed ina way that solves all of these problems and uses it beneficially.FuntionalityThe Kinect protocol is able to generate attractive interest rates and reward its users in the native deflationary $KNT token.It is able to do this because the protocol outsources all of its capital to some of the leading yield farms on the BinanceSmart Chain.  All of the interest the protocol generates is then converted back into the native $KNT token and distributed tostakers (5% is burned & 5% is paid to $KNT stakers as governance rewards).  This allows the protocol to still offer competitiveinterest rates while also rewarding its users with a one of a kind reward token that is built for price appreciation.Protocol governanceOur native token $KNT will also act as the protocol's governance token. All participants will havethe ability to stake their KNT in the Dividend Vault to earn a portion ofall protocol fees (5% of all rewards and all deposit & withdrawal fees). These fees will be paid tostakeholders in the form of KNT dividends which will give them the ability to yet compound their rewardsand gain more ownership of the protocol.Discord: https://discord.gg/kN6S39RvqDTwitter: https://twitter.com/KinectFinanceWhitePaper: https://www.docdroid.net/VYvgLm9/kinect-whitepaper-pdf",
