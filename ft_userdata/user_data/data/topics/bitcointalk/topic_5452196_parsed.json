  "content": "I have a glow in the dark mini Altuve 2018 Allen Ginter that I am taking offers on.Pics:Also have it posted up on Ebay.  Note that the price on Ebay is just a placeholder. (you can check Ebay for more pictures with close-ups of the edges).Feel free to DM me if you have interest.  As far as I know, there were only 4 glow in the darks made (or was it 8?).  Very rare and this is in beautiful, gem mint condition.Please no low ball offers ($20, $50, etc.).  Willing to entertain what is reasonable.  Altuve is a top player and the Astros just won the series - I can see this card going for a decent amount in the future.  Ohtani is priced (on ebay) at $3888, I'd expect this one to be below that, but not in the few hundred dollar range.  Serious inquiries please.",
