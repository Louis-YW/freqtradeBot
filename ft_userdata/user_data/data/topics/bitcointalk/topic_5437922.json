  "content": "Following my first attempt to contribute in my own little way to the spread of bitcoins, I set out to make some stickers that talk about bitcoins, which I shared  here. The stickers were not as effective as I felt they will be from my inexperience and I received some tips from more experienced members on this forum on how to make my attempt better.I could not immediately make the changes and improvement that the stickers needed because it required money and I do not have enough yet to do things without planning. Good thing is I have been able to make the improvements and added a QR code as advised, so people can easily scan it and be redirected to a link where they will be able to learn more.THE SOFT COPY.(Please help me preview, so the images can be seen)The QR code is a link to  https://learnmeabitcoin.com/, as recommended by \"Maus0728'', It contains illustrations and I think it is ideal for newbies like myself to learn from. When I make more stickers, I will include links to other helpful websites with good information about bitcoins.I did not add any contact information because I do not feel that I have enough knowledge myself, and will be confident to tutor another person, and also since cryptocurrency is not completely legal in my country, I did not want to just put myself out there as promoting something that the government considers illegal.THE STICKERS(Please help me preview, so the images can be seen)I was able to afford 150 stickers for this, I will do more when this is finished and when I have some more spare cash to invest in the promotion of bitcoin.If there are any more improvements that can be done for subsequent stickers that I will do, please still let me know, I like this to be my commitment to making the name of bitcoins bigger.",

With the QR code scanner image that you insert there, I can tell you that 70 to 90 percent of the people who received your sticker don't have time to scan the QR code, and the majority also don't have the scanner. If you truly want to raise Bitcoin awareness and have proven to yourself that you understand a lot about bitcoin and blockchain in general, I recommend taking a risk and organizing a small seminar in your neighborhood, which I believe will have a larger turnout and most people will be enlightened from there rather than simply sharing stickers. Please change your image size using the code below.

Thank you for your suggestion, but like I have said before, I am a shy person and do not think that I deal with talking to a number of persons about bitcoin, especially since it is a something that I do know know so much about yet.Quote from: Doan9269 on February 03, 2023, 12:05:49 PMI can commend on your effort to an extent but i will also have to tell you the fact behind what is expected, creating an awareness on bitcoin has gone beyond ordinary printing of stickers which you may give some people and they won't read it after the collection,Stickers are not given to people; I think you are mistaking stickers to be Handbills and flyers that are shared hand to hand. Stickers are placed on strategic positions for people to see.Quote from: Doan9269 on February 03, 2023, 12:05:49 PMa sticker is not a bad idea but does it contains all the information required to tells someone about bitcoin, There is a quote that talks about bitcoin, something to raise someones interest about what bitcoins are, and there is a QR code that links to a website with good information about bitcoins.

Do you always click through ads when you see something like this?I have a lot of respect for your volunteer efforts to spread the word about bitcoin, but putting myself in the place of the person who saw your stickers, I would have missed them.The best example will always be live communication and an example of success. This is done by all those who have achieved something. Look at social networks and how information spreads there. Tell three people about what you have achieved, and these three will tell six more, and so on.The dry distribution of stickers, at least in my country, from a lot of advertising, leads the recipient to the nearest bin to throw them away.",

Besides, it's about his time and money, and who can say that nowadays he promotes someone and something at his own expense and without any compensation?",

This is because nobody has the time to read them, and if you send me a sticker, I'll probably do the same. Creating awareness is a nice thing, but I believe you should attempt a different approach.",

I think the next you can do now is to try acquire some little you think you can afford to buy and hold while you keep spreading the good news to people around by sharing the stickers with them. And lastly, since we now active on social media like facebook, instagram and twitter you can create a post with your stickers people who are interested can get it scanned and start reading things about while those who hold the sticker might easily read and trash it away without sticking it on their door or vehicle.",

Sharing stickers can help them identify Bitcoins, but somehow I think this method is less effective. The sticker is only an external introduction, they will never fully understand Bitcoin without holding a seminar. Apart from the stickers that you give to the people around you, I think it will be even more effective if it is accompanied by a seminar. A face-to-face meeting by directly hearing an explanation from you will be more understandable than just reading through the stickers that you distribute or other media such as print and electronic media.",

By distributing stickers containing a QR code, it will definitely add more attractiveness to everyone you give the sticker to. Even though you only have around 150 stickers now, I think that's a pretty good first step. After all, you are also the only one carrying out all the plans that you have, for costs or capital, you must only use your own money. So I consider all that you do yourself to promote bitcoin to the people around you, I consider it good enough. If you have finished sharing all the stickers you have with those around you, and the stickers total are 150 sheets. If out of 150 people you share stickers with, only 10 or 15 people are interested in bitcoin, I think that's enough to be proud of. And a little advice from me, if you share these stickers, prioritize targeting people aged 18-35 years. Because people who are that old, will respond more quickly to something digital like bitcoin, than people who are under or above it.",
