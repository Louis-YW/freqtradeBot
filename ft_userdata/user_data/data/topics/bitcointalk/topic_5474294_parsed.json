But the most I see are usually made it accommodate a number of rigs. Maybe if you plan to increase the number of miners with time, then you can get that frame. You could also just DIY or get someone to fabricate for you a custom frame.",

You can keep them suspended like on a platform not too high from the ground that can be easily constructed and at a safe place or distance with shelter where there will be no danger of something like a liquid getting spilled on it.¬†It also has to be placed in an area or place where it will not often be moved.",

Do not make it tall or nose heavy if you were looking for silent operation although it is not going to with that silent but you got the point.

One intake and one outflow is going to be enough. I think all the other thing that you need to do has already been answered by many people here so I will not go into that. If your cooling process is only air flow and temperature control, not having enough airflow time to time can create hot spots which may damage the components. So make sure that air flow is doing its job. Not getting proper air flow could lead to components becoming hot and can give you hardware errors.",

Have you yourself used springs to reduce vibration in mining?These ASICs have no vibration with their fan.Don‚Äôt stop a person from mining with such advice.

It‚Äôs very strange when you have no experience in mining or working with equipment, but try to write advice without even studying the process from videos or articles.In my country, mining is also illegal and there have already been criminal cases for consuming electricity at low prices for mining, but miners still continue their business.",
