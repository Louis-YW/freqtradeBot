  "content": "What happened:: Providing Fake google business Reviews which is illegal. They will provide bulk reviews to attract customers. As they will provide a single review and will not provide the base of the review on the service it may turn into a scam. Because The business they will promote might not be a good project but for their fake reviews customer may fall into their trap.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=983073Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447409Additional Notes: Quote from: dbs00 on April 03, 2023, 02:35:13 PM⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Google My Business Reviews. 5 Stars Sticky HQ SEO Optimized Content. Helps with Ranking & Sales ✅!​Simple Pricing:12$ - 1 Review Post in the thread with \"Bitcointalk discount 17%\" and I'll pm you the discount code10$ - 1 Review - for bitcoin talk usersSEO Optimized content according to your business. We'll use the keywords ( + variations of them ) that you'll provide. If you don't want to provide keywords, we'll do basic keyword research and use those. We'll use whatever else you'll provide: ex: the products that you want to raise your rank on. You're staff's name. We'll use LOCAL IPWe'll use Local Coordinates, set in the vicinity of your GMB.Drip-feed according to your specifications!Delivery time ~ 24hPayment methods:Crypto - automaticManual: Paypal, Perfect Money, Adv Cash & others can be arrangedIf needed, we can set them to go live only after you approve the review firsthand.30 days warranty! They Non-Drop for NOW but Google is Google so if they happen to drop, we'll replace the reviews done in the last 30 days.Do you have negative reviews? The best way to \"remove them\" is to bury them with 5 Star Reviews.A mix of: Long-form reviews, praising your services/products, emoticons, talking about local placesThey might look fake as a regular customer won't waste time in posting such long reviews butthese are the kind of reviews that you get when you're providing your customers with a worthy incentive.Ex if you're doing a 500$-1k $ sale and providing the customer with a 5-10% discount if they leave you a comprehensive review, this is the kind of review you will get.If you're doing a 50$ sale, and providing the customer with a 10% discount for a review, you'll probably get a 5 star without a comment, or a reply with \"sure, I'll do it soon!\"... but we all know that won't happen.Q: Why should you buy reviews?A: Because you need reviews in order to convince customers to choose your listing instead of your competitors.A: Because it helps with local ranking when done properly.A: Helps with sales, search for some stats and you'll be amazed. People consider reviews as the next best thing after a personal recommendation from their friends.Even if you're ranking First or Second, if the third listing has more reviews than you, they will probably get the clicks. Isn't that something that you're doing as well when choosing a service or product? usually going with the company that has the most reviews and a better average!Q: Bulk discount?A: Not at this moment, check the latest posts in this thread maybe things have changed since I created this thread.Q: Why should you choose me among the dozen review sellers around?A: Using my own team, not outsourcing. If you stop buying more reviews, we won't start blackmailing you with 1-star reviews until you start buying again. Yes, this crap is being done by plenty of sellers. I've been around since 2014 and I've got flawless REAL feedback here and on multiple freelancing sites. hehe, yes I know I'm selling reviews now, but I'm not boosting my own reviews. (this is a new service I'm providing, I've got feedback across multiple sites over the last 10 years)Q: Can you remove negative reviews?A: NO, but I can help you bury them with multiple new & great 5-star reviews. I've looked into it and If a seller tells you he can remove negative reviews, its a HUGE RED flag, play it safe (test first with a random GMB).Q: Delivery Time?A: Usually within 24h during working hours Monday - Friday.Q: In what countries can you do reviews?A: Any country! If the review isn't in English, we'll pass it along for approval before posting it (so you can correct it as we'll use AI translation)Q: Can you customize the accounts from which the reviews are being posted?A: Sure, tell me what you need!Q: Where can I order?A: If you want to pay via crypto you can order here ( clicking this ) and after you can contact me!A: If you want to pay via other method, contact me first (use the skype button below) so we can set it up!Or you can manually copy and paste this skype ID live:support_42971Be careful about scammers and impersonators.Use the skype button to prevent that.Flags: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3145",

They do all these just to project their products without any strong base to stand upon thereby misleading the masses into investing and keying into their fake products and after a while they start having issues as a result of the foundation on which they started.

Receiving negative reviews of your product can be disheartening, but it's important to keep a positive attitude and use the feedback constructively to improve your product and customer satisfaction. If they solve those negative reviews and work it out, they wouldn't have to fake positive reviews and fool their customers. In the end, it will be their business who'll benefit.

It is still the customer's responsibility to verify those reviews before making a purchase. Customers can verify reviews by looking at multiple sources of feedback like review sites, social media and even asking for referrals from friends or family. They can also look for patterns in the reviews and consider the credibility of the reviewer.
