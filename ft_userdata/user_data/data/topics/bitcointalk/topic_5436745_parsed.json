Taxing and Regulating the safety of consumer is 2 different thing. The government has the right to tax anything that involves fiat investment like cryptos. While the regulating all the projects in crypto space is different scope it needs to have guidelines on how to regulate them. Crypto taxation already has a bill which most law maker prioritize in their respective country. I believe regulating all the projects in crypto space will take some time to implement.I believe this question is ok here or in the economics section. It’s up to you on who’s audience do you want.",

Then the tax can be taken from the growth of that value.Any crime from any space will usually still be processed and you're entitled to law protection, but it should be noted that the government (through law enforcement) is only responsible for catching thieves and scammers, not compensating for losses.",

A topic like this seems more appropriate in the Economy > Economics section. Because you are discussing the circulation of money among investors through investment which is very related to the economy of the investors themselves, so I think this topic is more suitable in the Economics section, but you also don't need to make a decision based on what I said because you still have to hear some other people's suggestions on this.QuoteThe government warned all crypto investors, both new investors and old investors about how fraud cases are increasing in crypto space and yet many do not care and they lose money but some made a lot of money and some even made life changing money..

Maybe this has something to do with state regulations which oblige citizens to pay taxes to the state through the amount of income that has been determined by the government in state regulations so that citizens still have to pay this burden even though what they do is not regulated by state law.And the government's warning of fraud cases that have occurred in the crypto space actually also has a very positive value because it is for the safety of investors even though some investors don't care about this warning, but at least they have started to be careful with their investments.",

FYI, regulating anything won't stop from getting scammed because most of the market regulated all around the world for example stock still the individuals manages to find the loopholes to make billions and they keep doing it.I believe the first step of regulation is taxing, when people start doing it the government will give more guidelines about how the assets should be used and not, for now the leaders and people in the administration don't have any knowledge about blockchain, decentralization or even internet so eventually it will take time atleast few more decades from now to have better system.",

Because governments want to get extra money from the people, under whatever pretext it may be. Crypto is a new phenomenon, which means they are can get new taxes. If you lose money invested in foreign cryptocurrency, then the government will not compensate you in any way and will not help you, but if you make a profit from this, then you will hear \"pay taxes here quickly.\" This is how they have double standards and how they care about us. Nothing personal - just pay taxes here. If they can find a way to regulate this industry, they will definitely do it. The most surprising thing about this is that until you withdraw crypto into fiat, they will have almost no effect on you.",

It's really a matter of thought. This government is only concerned with its own interests and is unconcerned about your losses. I don't blame them because taxation is one of a government's basic responsibilities to its citizens, but the way and manner in which they deny and tax people using cryptocurrency is unusual.
