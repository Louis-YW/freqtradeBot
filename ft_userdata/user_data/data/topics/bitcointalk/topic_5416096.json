Or youre not supposed to get this fund from anywhere. This means you are under a dusting attack. But, you do not know what is dusting attack. For which maybe you did not give importance to getting that fund. Its dangerous. So know what dusting attack is. And save yourself from danger.What is Dust in Cryptocurrency?A very small amount of funds in cryptocurrency is called dust. You may find dust while trading, that some amount of funds from the orders you place to trade remain in the wallet. This very small amount of funds is called dust balance. Ex- 0.00000012 BTC etc.Dangers of dusting attacks.Hackers send very small amounts of tokens or coins to a wallets for dusting attacks. And that keeps the wallet in trucking. Because when a token or coin is sent from one's wallet to someone's address, it becomes very easy to track it. By that tracking, hackers find out the identity of the targeted wallet. When the hacker is able to find out the identity of the person in the targeted wallet, the hacker puts the person in danger with a phishing attack or cyber thread.Protecting Yourself from Dusting Attacks.If you're using an exchange wallet, there's nothing to warried about. Just keep your account security hard. In this case 2FA can be used. And update your passwords occasionally. And if you are using a personal wallet and noticed anything about it then you need to create a new address for every transaction.Recently dusting attack happened with me and my friends. After that i found about it. source= ( http://khutinati.com/%e0%a6%a1%e0%a6%be%e0%a6%b8%e0%a7%8d%e0%a6%9f%e0%a6%bf%e0%a6%82-%e0%a6%8f%e0%a7%8d%e0%a6%af%e0%a6%be%e0%a6%9f%e0%a6%be%e0%a6%95-%e0%a6%95%e0%a6%bf/ )",

This means you are under a dusting attack.Bitcoin minimum dust attack amount is 546 sat for legacy address, and slightly less for segwit, but not less down to 100 sat which is 0.000001 BTC.Quote from: Sabbir Hossen on October 05, 2022, 09:35:05 PMHackers send very small amounts of tokens or coins to a wallets for dusting attacks.

I have not seen any connection yet. But if someone's bitcoin address is known to the attacker, the attacker may want to know about the person more, like knowing the type of exchange he is transferring coins to and also if connected with bigger transactions.

When the hacker is able to find out the identity of the person in the targeted wallet, the hacker puts the person in danger with a phishing attack or cyber thread.It is called \"dust attack\" (not dusting) and that is not how it works. They send a small amount of coins to an address that is usually empty so that they can force you to combine that output with another coin from a different address so that they can find the link between the two (or more) addresses. They still can't track you or find your identity this way though.QuoteIf you're using an exchange wallet, there's nothing to warried about.Exchange are not wallets and if you are keeping funds there, you have a lot more to worry about. Not to mention that in most cases your identity is already known!",

But somehow we could see that its not a dust but a reward ona probably active staking youd already forgotten. Like on Binance, there are some little tokens we received and I just checked that it comes from their one tap feature staking. But of course there are also other tokens that probably came from dusting since the reward on the staking method doesnt include that particular that I received which means someone send it.",

      "body": "This is the worst advice you can give to anyone, as such attacks do not target exchange addresses because it is easy to identify them, but the addresses of individuals and therefore the probability of being executed on platforms addresses is much less than the possibility of implementing them on wallet addresses.The best way is to use a well-programmed wallet that supports coin control feature.",

As mentioned by Charles-Tim in the first reply, the dust limit for legacy addresses is 546 satoshi. That's 294 satoshi for segwit addresses and your transaction will be rejected, if you send lower than the limit.In the image you shared, we see a TRON transaction sending 0.000012 TRX and I don't know whether there's any dust limit for TRON transaction or not.",
