The one of pop up ads is one that is mostly discussed about because it most of the times seems too good to be true and when one does visit the sites that have such pop ups it is like an impulse to just click to see more. Hence the chance for hackers to dominate. I also don't like saving passwords on my browser or desktop because it is an easy hub for hackers to gain access to. These tips are very important and helpful and I think this post should be shared to the newbie section as well do as they get informed on how to avoid hackers and scammers in total.",

To make it short, the best way to safeguard your account from all types of hackers is save it an offline wallet, that way your account is free from hacking. And just don't entertain any messages or provided links from strangers, if possible turn off notifications so that you don't have to worry from appearing in your screen series of phishing sites and unrecognized links.Educate yourself on how to secure your account 24/7, just like you educate yourself on how to enter the market safe and sound.

We have a lot to know and understand about wallet security, not just depositing bitcoins in the wallet but also ensuring security to keep those bitcoins safe from hackers. Especially nowadays, a hacking method of hackers is to create a Phishing scam site and ask them to connect the wallet through the link of the Phishing scam site. If any wallet holder connects to the Phishing scam site and connects the wallet, the access to his wallet will be taken by the hackers. So we  Be aware and we will not connect our wallet through the link of various Phishing sites.However, many people are careless about giving passwords and passwords are usually weak, in which case the wallet holder's wallet is more likely to be hacked. In choosing a password, a strong password must be given. In this case, the password must be long and have different characters. Passwords with only uniform numbers are more likely to be hacked.",

I really appreciate you sincerely offering your contributions to guide our newbies. However, this topic is best suited to Beginners and Help. If you look at it well, move it now.The OP explains it well, but I will talk a little bit about it from a terminology perspective. Wallet privacy is important; do not engage in any suspension activities. It will cause you harm because a wallet is just for funds or to keep for investment, and if your funds or investments are not in a secure place, this will make you concerned. So be careful with your wallet, guys. Follow all of the best for your wallet, because funds are the main subject, and if your wallet is not safe, how should your investment or funds be safe? Do all of your best steps towards privacy to protect yourself from loss.",

All of your suggestions can be handled by having one hardware, but it is also good for some people who have not experience anything before, like newbies. In the second place, never click on a link that you do not understand. There are con artists that use email addresses to send you links that, if you click on, will give them access to your wallet.Thirdly, visiting any pornographic website is also risky these days because con artists are aware that men are drawn to entertaining content.

We should adapt by implementing different security protocols to safeguard our assets and data from hackers, just as they do with their cunning tactics. Even though we've been seeing posts similar to yours more frequently, you've still come up with some excellent recommendations that will help us strengthen our security. The best thing we can do for ourselves is to constantly remind ourselves of the risks posed by hacks and how crucial it is to protect our privacy. Reminding ourselves of the significance of maintaining tight security is something we should do on a regular basis. Quote from: SAHASAN on November 26, 2023, 05:41:26 PMDon't use or never jump quickly to any latest update software and installed browser or updated website, you must wait and give few time to use new updated things.certain users like updating to the newest software version too soon, which is generally not a good idea because certain software updates may be released with minor flaws or issues that endanger user data and provide opportunities for scammers to capitalise.  It's best to hold on for a few days to make sure the new software works flawlessly and doesn't have any problems.

Check here to see what your future husband/wife will look likeScammers employ silly techniques to entice amateurs who are so concerned with money that they blindly believe whatever they read or hear online. It is not a good idea to click on links from unknown sources when browsing the internet because this is a popular way scammers trick people who are naive.  Make sure you double-check and are aware of the link you are clicking on before clicking anywhere on the internet. Don't click on any random link simply because it has a flashy title or says it will double our money. You should stay away from anything that seems too good to be true. Quote from: SAHASAN on November 26, 2023, 05:41:26 PMNever use ( one) 1 online wallet or one crypto exchange site, always divide your crypto and put/use it 25% for per wallet It's amazing that I never came up with this brilliant concept before. It's not a terrible idea to divide your valuables around two or more cryptocurrency wallets, as this lowers the likelihood that you would lose them all at once to hackers. This is also an excellent method since, in the event that one wallet is compromised, you will still have some funds left over. However, this strategy is not without its drawbacks. Having your assets spread across multiple wallets also makes it more likely that one of your wallets or the exchange where you keep your coins may be compromised. This technique is safe, but you need exercise caution and ensure that the wallets being used are reliable. Additionally, I would advise against using cryptocurrency exchange wallets as you are not fully in control of your assets because you do not have access to the private keys. Non custodial open source wallets are recommendable online wallet you can use but hardware wallets are the most suitable and most scecure wallets to use when holding larger amounts of coins.",
