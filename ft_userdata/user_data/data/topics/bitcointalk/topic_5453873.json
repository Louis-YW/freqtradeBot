  "content": "Hi Guys. I am not sure to which board this thread should belong. Let me know if it fits better on some other board. I have been in Bitcoin For the last couple of years. But, I never bothered to read the Bitcoin White paper. Yesterday, I downloaded the Bitcoin White paper to read and understand it. The problem is I am not 100% native in English, so I was wondering If I could find a Bengali Translation of the Bitcoin White paper; that would be awesome. Then I realized the Bengali Translation is already available on Bitcoin.org. I downloaded the PDF and prepared it to print. Before I printed it, I decided to look at it, and I was shocked that I didn't understand almost anything. The translation was done by Tonmoy Sarkar (I did not find any activity in his Github) and Shafiun Miraz (His Twitter account is suspended). Now you may ask what the problem is. The problem is they used an automatic translator to translate the white paper, which is why I do not understand most of it. I am not a tech guy, so I can't understand the technical explanation part. But I should understand the general part. This is not fully automated translated, but I would say semi-automated. They used a translator for the most part and wrote the other part themself. I had a conversation with Little Mouse, and he agreed with me that the Bengali (বাংলা) Translation of the Bitcoin White Paper is Semi-Auto Translated. So, Adding a semi-auto-translated White paper to the website adds zero value. The Only guy I know is Little Mouse, who can help translate the tech part. But, He is super busy with some of his projects. I would be more than happy to translate the general part of the explanation. But I need someone who can help translate the tech-related part. Not only do Bangladeshi Talk in Bengali, But people from India (West Bengal) Also speak Bengali. If anyone knows Bengali Language and knows Bitcoin well, would you mind helping translate the Whitepaper? I need someone to translate part of it and will be paid for their work. We will discuss this further in DM.Cheers!",

I don't know maybe you can contact, @Porfirii  because they have this Alliance of Translators in our community, [OFNT] [AOBT] The Alliance Of Bitcointalk Translators.  Maybe you can work it out there and see if they can help you out. Some of the members are well experience, including @GazetaBitcoin who translated the Whitepaper already to their local language (Romanian).",
