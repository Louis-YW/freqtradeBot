It would be worse than anything we've seen before because several projects tokens are tied to the ethereum smart contract. The ethereum 2.0 has been extensively delayed, I only hope that the delay would be worth it after it's eventually lunched.",

      "body": "If i not mistaken, I can say that the use of smart contracts and stablecoins definitely improves liquidity and price predictability in the market. However, when it comes to stablecoins, the Ethereum ecosystem is almost always considered risky for its decentralization. There are simply too many unknown factors to be able to judge the risks of Ethereum 2.0 accurately, So in light of this, it's easy to see why some projects might be a bit hesitant when it comes to building a digital asset on top of Ethereum 2.0 but I think that the main thing above all else should be that we all be aware of these risks ahead of time, so there aren't any nasty surprises when the big day arrives.",

The ETH network is said to be the first and foremost trend-setting network that helps the market develop well.This upgrade has been in the works for the past 4 years and I don't think there will be any unfortunate incidents, I hope so.  Otherwise, as you say, will again cause a bad shock to the altcoin market.",

And this is no different than the legacy financial system we got now.That's the difference between ethereum and altcoins today. Once ETH is merged, it will be difficult for other blockchains to compete with ETH because the biggest drawback is gas fees and transaction speeds are fixed, but unfortunately will make ethereum more centralized.After becoming more centralized, will investors still be interested in this coin?, the future of ethereum makes me feel more in doubt than its success after the full transition to POS.",

But there is also a big minus that all ecosystems of the 2nd level depend on the work of the Ethereum POS. If there are problems in the main network, then all tier 2 ecosystems will be stopped or slowed down.",

Excluding Ethereum owned by Vitalik, there are many people especially miners who can have more than 32 Ethereum. Especially if we consider exchanges that will certainly creating and managing staking pools in future.Being more centralized is bad and I hope that Vitalik and Ethereum team can have preventive solutions for that scenario but I am very doubtful that they can prevent it happens.",
