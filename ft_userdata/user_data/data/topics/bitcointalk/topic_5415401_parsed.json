  "content": "Vertoreum (VTRM) - A Rare Proof of Work CoinTheoretically investing in Vertoreum is twice as good than investing in Bitcoin. This is based off the fact that the reward halves about every year, and that there is only 10.5 million coins.Why choose Vertoreum?Vertoreum has many things in place that make it more valuable. It has half as many coins as Bitcoin (10,500,000 coins) which allows for more rarity and price fluctuations. Vertoreum is only mineable with CPUs and GPUs and is protected against 51% attacks. Vertoreum transactions are twice as fast as Bitcoin.Download the Wallet: https://github.com/vertoreum/vertoreum/releases/latestSpecifications• Name: Vertoreum• Ticker: VTRM• ASICS resistant• Protected against double spend and 51% attacks• Adopts Segwit transactions• Algorithm: YescryptR16• Block Time: 5 minutes• Block Reward: 50 VTRM• Difficulty: Every block with Vertoreum difficulty calculation• Halving: 105,000 blocks (1 year)• P2P Port: 16178• RPC Port: 16179• Max supply: 10,500,000 VTRM• POW Lifespan: 3,360,000 blocks - 32 years• Confirmations: 100• Premined: None• Chain type: POW• Website: https://vertoreum.org• Discord: https://discord.gg/r9SmgeQCtM• Twitter: https://twitter.com/vertoreum• Reddit: https://reddit.com/user/vertoreum• Instagram: https://instagram.com/vertoreumThanks BitcoinTalk, and have a great day!",
