  "content": "Quote'There is no place in the police station where the stored goods can be saved from the rats,' prosecutor saysIndian police have said rats ate about 600kg of cannabis after a court demanded that the confiscated drugs be produced as evidence during a trial for people facing smuggling charges.Police in the northern city of Mathura wrote to magistrates to say 581kg of the drugs had gone missing from two storerooms after being seized from traffickers more than five years ago.Public prosecutor Ranveer Singh said the drugs were eaten by rodents and could not be produced.“There is no place in the police station where the stored goods can be saved from the rats. The remaining [cannabis] from the huge consignment was destroyed by officers,” prosecutors told the court.Police arrested six people on suspicion of smuggling on a motorway and seized the drugs in two consignments in 2018 and 2019.The alleged smugglers are now on trial for drug trafficking and other narcotics charges.Police delivered samples of the drugs to the court at the beginning of the trial but were mandated to produce the actual cache to bolster their case and obtain a conviction.The court asked senior police officers to ensure the safety of the evidence, which was meant to be presented on Saturday.The prosecution told the court that nearly 700kg of cannabis stored across several police stations in the district were under threat from rats.They also spoke of the inability to deal with the rodents, which they said were overwhelming the most secure places inside police stations.“Being small in size, the rats have no fear of police, nor can the police officers be considered experts in solving the problem,” prosecutors said.Trials in India can take years, if not decades, and many accused often escape punishment over poor police investigations or evidence management.Prosecutors in eastern Jharkhand state told a court in 2017 that rats consumed nearly 45kg of marijuana that was stored in a trafficking case involving 150kg of drugs.Police in neighbouring Bihar state that year said rats drank about one million litres of alcohol kept in storerooms in one of the country’s few dry states.https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/2022/11/23/indian-police-say-rats-ate-600kg-of-cannabis-from-station-storeroom/....Over the years, I have seen news articles published claiming that termites, ants and other pests devoured $50,000 which had been concealed beneath a sleeping mattress.Have to admit that 600kg of cannabis being devoured by rodents is a new one I haven't heard before. I think india or another nation in that region once issed bounties on rats. There was a famous case from years past where a single man killed a ridiculous number of rats which he turned in to receive a bounty.Is there a reason rats in some countries are more aggressive and rabid than in others? Are they evolving? Should we be concerned?",

      "body": "It sounds ridiculous in my opinion. I am not even sure if this is a serious problem in India (excessive rodents) or this is actually an excuse by corrupt police officers in order to disappear evidence. However, I admit that trying to dispose of 7 tonnes of drugs is very daring and difficult without a widespread network of corruption.Perhaps, it is something I can't take seriously because I have never read/heard about it here in my country. If there is anyone from India reading this thread, it would be interesting if they could give us their opinion on this matter and if this is credible or not.",

Here in the USA we have myths and urban legends claiming negative effects from cannabis smuggled across the border.Are derived from product being laced with rat poison.Although today rat poison isn't so much the concern. Today we have urban legends of random people smoking cannabis laced with fentanyl and dying. I guess that's the tragic modern day version.",

Random pills are said to be contaminated with trace amounts of fentanyl which can be fatal. Even things like adderall or exstasy bought off the street, can be randomly contaminated and fatal.Exactly how and where fentanyl overdoses are occurring isn't completely known.Perhaps our rats are simply not as evolved as those in other countries. They haven't leveled up to evidence lockers yet. Or perhaps our fumigation, pest exterminator and rat trap industry has better representation.",

Should we be concerned?I don't know why animals are always attracted to cannabis. It is possible that these rodents can consume some of them but not 600kg. These law enforcement agents might have sold those evidence to drug dealers and collected some good money. It is also possible that they want to conceal the evidence so that the accuse persons would not be convicted and sentenced accordingly. The claim that they are unable to handle the problem of rat threats is a big lie because rodents attack can be handle through diverse means. But it would be very interesting to see the rodents' behavior after the consumption of the substance.",

In my country when these drug law agency gets you arrested because of just a wrap of cannabis, if you can bail yourself immediately, you will see that they will not give you back the drug, instead they will smoke it. I also know a drug law agency that brings seized goods from the office to sell for people,so you can see that they are the rats.",
