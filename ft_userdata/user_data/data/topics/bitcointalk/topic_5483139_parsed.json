  "content": "I don't know who needs to hear this, I had no job when I started gathering some Bitcoin for long term hold, I looked wreteched for few years, I eat single meal per day, I looked old at a young age, like those who don't want me to carry on my BTC journey used to tell me, but in the end it all went well, where did I get my conviction? I had no other means to have a better future than this, it was like a do or die something for me then, something inside me just appreciate the existence of BTC, like I know something like it was coming to safe me, which I can't advice anyone to do the same today. What I am saying here is that it's still doable if you have the conviction to make things happen, if you crave for changes you will go any lent to make things happen in the right manner and ways, but having a source of income will make things more easier for you, I still considered my story as a easy one because I had my father then, I had a roof over my head in my parents home, and also I don't pay any bills, it was just me and my stomach to feed and my BTC wallet to fill up.For someone who came from poor home it will become a very big battle to conquer poverty, and for those who come from average or rich home, it becomes easier for them to have a better future because they will have more money to take risks, if you are from a home like mine, you need to strive hard, my battle took me three years, if I have never know Bitcoin and I decided to take the path that everyone in my country was into it would have been harder for me, judging from the present conditions of those who almost stopped my Bitcoin journey, I am not shaming anyone, I am just saying that Bitcoin is worth every shot. Because since the past 12 years, there is no investment that does it better than Bitcoin, you can't find anything like this anywhere else, it's worth every fight and hustle, but your journey will be way easier if you have a source of income, don't give up, always give your best short, you are on the right path.",

Anytime I come across Early adopters like you it make me wish I was an adopter too in the earliest time.I must say you seem to be a very disciplined person from your write up because it takes a hell lot of discipline for someone to be able to hodl without a source of income. I bet if you didn't have some assistance from parents you may not have been able to. Because it seems very illogical to be hungry and claiming to hodl Bitcoin.",

And when you've like this is a do or die thing, you got me there because we've got the same opinion when I've known Bitcoin for the first time and understood that it's an investment. Looking at its past where people have probably bought it at a cheap rate might have been holding several years ago when I was still new. And by that time, I've realized that it's never too late and just like today, some newbies might think that they're still too early because like in the past that we've thought of the same thing. It might not be easy but if they've got conviction just as yours, it's never too late but things can be easier if you believe before it finally becomes stable in terms of its pricing soon. But IMHO, we're still quite far from seeing that happen.",

The biggest struggle for normal people, even more poor people of course, is that in order to make more money you need to make a big switch in the way you manage money and the way you live your life. Why? Because 1) nobody is there to explain you how finance works 2) you have so many problems simply covering all the monthly expenses that you don't even think about investing or stuff like that. That's the reason many people with low income will have a low income pretty much all their lives while rich people oftentimes get richer and richer. Of course if you already have money it's easier, but with the right mindset you can actually change your life. And this is exactly what bitcoin does.",

We are actually on the same shoes mate, from pandemic to the recent supertyphoon that our provinces hard hit, I thought it will just end right there because I have no one to ask for help since signal coverage and electricity was restored more or less 7 months after the catastrophe. My mobile phone and laptop were fully damaged that is why I almost lose any hope. With the courage to help myself and my family I sold my silver coins collections in the hope of slowly getting my self up on my own knees in other words this self reliance helps me slowly recover. I got few hundreds of dollars with those silver coins and bought a new android phone from it that is why I came back here on the forum though not yet fully recovered from that devastation and stressful days, Bitcoin paying signature campaigns really help me with my own and family's needs from the time I got accepted from it. Right now, I am saving my weekly Bitcoin rewards on purpose because I already learned the lesson from the past. Government aid are there to be honest but unfortunately distributions were very political. That is why standing on our own feet and surviving during or after the catastrophe does make sense. So invest in Bitcoin, precious metals and real estate if you want to survive.",

I have to keep on holding to the very little amount of BTC I have since it's the only wealth I have to go on.  If my family had some spare that they could invest in BTC, I would have told them to buy more but because of the rising prices of everything today, I doubt they will have something to set aside for something that is not tangible.

But starving yourself was not a good decision because food is life instead of that you should just cut expenses down to meet your weekly DCA. For example if your DCA strategy was sorpos to be $10per week, you will reduce it to 5 or $7 at least you will still have a little to feed . Design is the necessity of life and hence if not properly taken care of it might result to what will still Leed to selling of your save coin. So next time take good care of yourself, save in bitcoin and also have an emergency fund.Coming from a rich family does not guarantee that their children have more advantage to invest than poor. You can't just generalise it because most rich folks also find it hard to lay their hands on their parents wealth. and some reason are because the parent thinks if their children are exposed to money early, it will corrupt them.  By so doing of creating a wrong expression make their children to hustle on their own. So not all rich kid has the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin because most of their parents are also not a fans of crypto currency.",

So invest in Bitcoin, precious metals and real estate if you want to survive. People who live in countries that have good governance might not understand what many people who are been ruled by corrupt governments face. In some cases there are no means of survival because jobs are not given based on competence but on political patronage and corruption. In such societies, the poor get poorer and the rich richer. The worst part of it is that these poor citizens are also deprived of basic infrastructure that would have made life better for them.It will usually take strong determination and diligence for people who have no political connection or financial backup to backup to break free from poverty. It usually takes as much depriving oneself of some basic needs because you need to save to invest. I encourage you OP to keep doing what is best for you but also ensure you take good care of yourself. Don't starve or deprive yourself of essential things that make life worth living.

Bitcoin is best in risk management and ROI but there are other cryptocurrencies that provide better ROIs.

In this day and age, to accumulate BTC on an empty stomach, with bills to pay, with a family or extended family to look out for, with other expenses rising, it would take discipline to maintain focus mostly when peers and friends are living fine and compelling one to do same as them. Everyone has to find or work out the best possible approach to take to invest in BTC, because it is a more valuable option of crypto currency to HoDL and despite the halving, it would remain so unless Satoshi Nakamoto didn't plan well, but in this case so far seen and studied, BTC as a crypto currency is a successful initiative and everyone considering holding or making investment should do so. What is to note however is that security of ones wallet is essential to a successful investment plan and shouldn't be taken lightly mostly when friends and peers are aware of such a venture.",
