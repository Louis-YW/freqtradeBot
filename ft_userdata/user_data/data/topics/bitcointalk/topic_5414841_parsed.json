Can I import a hardware wallet into a mobile wallet like metamask?What is the point of having a hardware wallet when you want to import its seed phrase into web wallet like metamask. That defeats the purpose of having a hardware wallet which are still better than online wallets.Quote from: Somegory on September 25, 2022, 01:52:24 PM2. What are the risks involved in doing this?The private key would be more vulnerable to online attack if it is imported on online wallets.Quote from: Somegory on September 25, 2022, 01:52:24 PM3. I want to bridge Arbitrum will it work on hardware wallet?This is the question you supposed to ask. You can connect the hardware wallet with wallets like metamask (not importing the seed phrase directly into metamask, but using it as a wallet to operate the hardware wallet).",

      "body": "Metamask PC can be used with hardware wallets, the mobile version can't be.I'm not sure there's a way of using other networks with hardware wallets on mobile you can use erc20 tokens from trezor with trezor suite web on mobile and I think ledger have something similar but I don't think it's possible to change networks because of how they're implemented.You might also be able to use wallet connect on you phone to connect to metamask/hardware on PC..Do not import your hardware wallets private key to your phone, ever. You can make a wallet on your phone with a different nmemonic if you don't plan to store anything of much value on there but that's about it.",

If you can export your metamask wallet to your hardware wallet, then be rest assured it is possible to export your hardware wallet to metamask, all you need is a private key or seed phrase. Quote 2. What are the risks involved in doing this? Risk involved is that metamask is more like a hot wallet and stands a higher risk of getting hacked, there are many phishing sites, even viruses and malwares targeting metamask users, if your system gets infected with a virus or malware, you stand a chance of loosing funds stored on your metamask wallet easily. Quote 3. I want to bridge Arbitrum will it work on hardware wallet?This I can not answer because I've never used a hardware wallet, all I know about hardware wallet are based on my research.So I think other users that have used hardware wallets will be in the best position to answer this question.",

      "body": "I think that choosing the word “import” was not successful because you will not export the seeds and then include them. By using MetaMask, you can link your wallet and enjoy all the options that Metamask provides you with the security of physical wallets.But if the coin cannot be accessed using a meta-mask, it is better to avoid it.One of the risks is privacy, but security depends on how you use it.",

Also..1. Can I import a hardware wallet into a mobile wallet like metamask?2. What are the risks involved in doing this?This is not recommended and I would not do that. A better solution is to create a secondary wallet with Metamask and use it separately from the hardware wallet.You probably don't need all the coins available on Metamask wallet all the time. Why not keep your main stash on a hardware wallet where it's safe, and transfer only what you need to Metamask?",

You should connect your hardware wallet to metamask instead of importing your wallet seed into it.By connecting your hw to metamask, you can access the non-supported tokens from metamask (by adding their smart contract addresses and other details manually as dkbit explained above) and you keep your wallet safe at the same time.",
