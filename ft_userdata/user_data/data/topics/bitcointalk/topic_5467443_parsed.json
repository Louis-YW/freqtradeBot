This is because bitcoin is not a centralised payment method, and this is not an entity in charge of it, so there is no way that anyone in control of bitcoin can offer any form of grant to anyone who is in need of The only thing that one can see is some centralised organisation that deals with Bitcoin transactions in both trading and payment systems and is running some kind of charity in the form of grants to help those who are in need.",

Bitcoin ecosystem isn't like that because all the new blockchains can mint coins and tokens anyhow they like and give to whoever they want to give, bitcoin isn't like that, there will be 21million BTC which makes it more decentralized and the people that have dedicated their life building from day one were the early birds and they are still here doing the free work to see bitcoin succeed without been rewarded in any form.There is only one reward in the Bitcoin ecosystem and that is mining, I think lots of people are happy doing that for the community and their pockets, and in return, it makes the chain more decentralized and stable.",

All Bitcoin coins can only be obtained by mining, everything is fair.Therefore, everything above was written correctly; there are grants from various other funds that contribute to the development of Bitcoin and related decentralized solutions. But there is no grant program from Bitcoin itself. When Bitcoin was created, no one pledged any funds for this, everything was pledged to the honest and transparent operation of the blockchain.",

BTC itself don't have but many other people or organizations are providing these programs to motivate developers to make improvements in the bitcoin blockchain and to enhance the adoption rate. This is a great thing. The number of people is not that much because BTC does not have that much adoption yet and how it can get that many blockchain developers. People who are aware of the BTC want to earn in BTC but those who are not developers have to find another way. And for those, the easiest way is to trade BTC in Future trading. Which is the biggest mistake of every newbie. I am going off-topic here but it can not be ignored. Quote from: Faisal2202 on September 20, 2023, 02:08:53 PMYes Bitcoin has grant programs.

I was quite amazed to see that many members above were just making posts saying that BTC doesn't have any grant programs. I might be misinterpreting things here. However, I can understand that BTC has no official grant program by their centralized organization. Because BTC is not centralized.",

If not for that, I don't think Bitcoin in itself offers grants and I think it's rational enough to say that. Reasons are that it is a decentralized market where there's no such things like Central authorities that's managing it or regulating the market, not to say that he/she offers users grants. Foundations are mostly in charge of grants or so. And Bitcoin doesn't have such to offer such grant programs.",

Others have mentioned Open Sats, another example of resource of the grants, especially for a developer, which can be seen at Lopp's compilation site relating the information: Bitcoin Charities.

Bitcoin is a decentralized coin and it can be mined based on how we intended to do that. Since there are 21 million Bitcoin to be mined, I think is is a form of incentives to people that are ready to build there own blocks and get the work done by themselves rather then trying to buy from the market and accumulate. No grant program at all but what we are expected to do to earn Bitcoin is to mine it with a sophisticated computers and devices.",
