  "content": "QuoteOn the eve of his departure from office on May 28, former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Finance Act, 2023, into law. The act introduces a series of tax reforms aimed at modernizing the country’s fiscal framework. Among its provisions was the introduction of a 10% tax on gains from the disposal of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.In early 2021, CBN sent a memo to all commercial banks in the country to block the accounts of persons or establishments involved in crypto activities but with this bill passed into law it seems that the CBN ban of cryptocurrency is no longer effective since the government now wants a 10% taxation fee from the gain in cypto usage.QuoteIn many cases, governments do require the cooperation of crypto exchanges operating within their jurisdiction to track users’ capital gains. By working with exchanges, authorities can access transaction data and identify individuals or entities for tax purposes. However, the level of cooperation and specific regulations vary from country to country. Some jurisdictions have implemented stricter requirements for exchanges to report user information, while others may have limited regulations or are in the process of developing them.Nigerian government can be successful with the new taxation law by having crypto platforms that are registered and operating in the country like Remitano, Luno, Roqqu, Bitmama, NairaEx etc. pay for their taxes but...Is this tax also applied to individuals using or trading cryptocurrency in these platforms? If yes... Do you think they will have any luck in taxing individuals using this platforms since we've not really had good results in collecting taxes from physical businesses? Also, most of these crypto merchants charges high transaction fees already and with the new law in place, can these platforms include a tax fee for every transactions without most users noticing?Share your thoughts.https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-to-tax-crypto-digital-assets-10-on-capital-gains-experts-react/amp",

I guess people that trade or invest and make profit would be the ones to pay the tax after the net profit is positive. But why mentioned Patricia? The exchange was hacked and their customers funds are still with the exchange up till now.Quote from: sokani on June 10, 2023, 11:40:10 AMIf yes... Do you think they will have any luck in taxing individuals using this platforms since we've not really had good results in collecting taxes from physical businesses?There will always be tax evaders, it is also in developed countries, but maybe not as worse as it is in Nigeria. Introducing tax on crypto will be beneficial for the country is all I could think of. Quote from: sokani on June 10, 2023, 11:40:10 AMAlso, most of these crypto merchants charges high transaction fees already and with the new law in place, can these platforms include a tax fee for every transactions without most users noticing?We need to know the regulatory framework about this. Is there one already? I do not have time to read about the Finance Act yet, but I think it is just an introduction of 10% tax for cryptocurrencies that is included yet for now. https://pwcnigeria.typepad.com/files/2022-finance-bill_hor.pdf",

First since the creation of this thread I have gone into research to see the financial act and what it entails because I am sure cryptocurrency is not mentioned their in and I wanted to ask the ops to share a link to the information he posted, because nigeria as a country really need a special policy frame work dedicated to digital currencies inclusive of Decentrslized assets e.g Bitcoin ethereuem and other cryptocurrencies that operate within the blokchain technology and their remittance into the nigeria economy, other important point to note os that decetnrized cryptocurrencies their transactions are hard to trace and unless the holder use a centralized exchange platforms then his transaction can be traced and taxed, but aside from that he can invade tax as long as he continues to hold bitcoin just as an asset. On the issue of banks and cryptocurrency transactions, I guess the misunderstanding came from the now suspended CBN governor, who introduced so many failed financial policy that most likely 90% failed e.g, the E-naira policy and the currency swap/ cashless policy scheme,  he is also the initiator of the bank vs cryptocurrency transaction ban, if not before the ban, the bank does not have any problem with cryptocurrency transaction and as a matter of fact, one can buy Bitcoin through union bank back then.",

All the same, I am not surprised why cryptocurrencies are not mentioned in the act after all this policy is a policy of the past administration whose central bank governor now suspended is gullible enough to believe that cryptocurrency is a threat to the government control of the financial sector, we're as he is now accused of terrorism financing which is the worst form of money laundering.",

Also, most of these crypto merchants charges high transaction fees already and with the new law in place, can these platforms include a tax fee for every transactions without most users noticing?E easy to achieved na, first dem go demand everybody wey dey use the platform to complete KYC and the crypto platform go register under SEC. Belike self na why SEC dun give Binance Nigeria strike one to do fast come register under the SEC. Dem go fit tax us by making sure these platforms collect tax immediately we dey do withdrawal form the exchange. E just belike when you go chop for all this fancy restaurant them, usually if you look your bill wey you get, you go see the tax wey dem dey collect and e dey go government (nobi there pocket). Dem no go tell you about the extra tax until you dun chop finish although e no dey too cost.The crypto platforms go just send alert to all their customers to inform them about the new laws and since e go dey everywhere we no go get choice but to just use the platforms like that and they pay the tax (but make we no fear as I believe e go be very small amount them). If be small percentage self for each withdrawal so poor man dey saved, na the rich dem go dey milk although e no go mean much to them too but I doubt we'll be able to reach this stages as e go mean Nigerian dun dey accept cryptocurency small small.

It also makes for more opportunities for economic growth and expansion, less unemployment and new users will join the network, small businesses and entrepreneurs who understand cryptocurrency would be able to leverage it to assist their businesses in terms of payments and subscriptions and grow significantly without reliance on the meager profit or earnings from sitting at a white collar job inorder to sustain such a business. Exposed minds and those in diaspora with great ideas or with intentions to relocate back home would be able to also rely on cryptocurrency services for effective application. Although, charges would become high, the taxation will encourage better exchange services to innovate and compete in the market to offer better service and new strategies would be formed by traders to save charge cost and other previous unnecessary expenses.",

      "body": "After reading the news about crypto taxation in Nigeria, I asked myself, what changed why are they interested in Bitcoin or the cryptocurrency market could it be that it is because Nigeria is in top ten in terms of the percentage of the population that owns cryptocurrency.  About 10.3 percent of our population owns cryptocurrency. That is like 22 million Nigerians own cryptocurrency1. Also remember that as of September 3, 2022, Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) announced partnership with Binance so that they can take advantage of a near trillion dollar virtual economy in blockchains and digital economy2. At this point, it should be obvious why the federal government stated now that cryptocurrency will be taxed in Nigeria. The federal government if successful, will make a lot of money from this. The first hurdle for them is to who has cryptocurrency and who doesn't. One may argue that they may use KYC from Binance exchange platform. They can't do that for non-KYC required wallets like the Electrum wallet.
