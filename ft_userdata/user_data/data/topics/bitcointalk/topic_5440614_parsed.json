  "content": "Last year, when Bitcoin was down at about $16k–$17k, I screamed, I shouted, I appealed, and I persuaded all my friends and colleagues to get it. Some are IT professionals, some are business owners, some are investment bankers, and some are government employees. I offered them the best strategy to get in easily without any stress: the dollar cost averaging strategy. When we hung out for drinks, I would always find a way to bring up the Bitcoin conversation. On our WhatsApp group, I did the same thing. Their counterargument was that Bitcoin has no value. And their assertion was further fueled by the FUD, FTX, and all of those negative news stories about Bitcoin that were all over the place last year.Fast forward to February 2023. Bitcoin is now worth more than $24,000. They're highlighting my messages on Bitcoin from last year and wanting us to meet and talk about it. \"How can they get in?\" they'll wonder. \"Is it too late?\" they have X dollars they can spare. They are my friends, and I am going to help them out. While I am glad they have shown some interest in it, I do not feel pity for them that they will have to buy it now while it is at $24k, because if there is one thing that I have learned so far in my Bitcoin journey, it is that everyone eventually buys at the price they deserve.",

They are getting something wrong because the price increase, they want to rush in, that is one of the ways they may later fomo and invest at the wrong time in the future. They need to learn, you need to teach them, especially about the risk so that they will not blame you what you do not deserve, because at the end, it would be a big gain for them if they can be patient. They may invest now and the price of bitcoin drop to $23000 or  $21000, it is possible. You need to educate them and how it is possible that bitcoin will reach over $50000 again, which may be this year or next year. Let them know that they may invest and begin to lose, but they should not panic but be happy and wait for what will happen if they have long term investment plan in mind and if they go for it.",

Had they bought it and it later dump a little you will be held responsible. More so persuasiveness could actually make some people invest more than they can lose with the mindset of getting hefty profits in a short time. We should just Allow them to pick interest in the value of bitcoin themselves and not bringing them into it with only a get rich quick mindset.Nevertheless every time is the right time to buy bitcoin that is if you can hodl for long and not panic when it is in it bearish period. Imagine people that were advice to buy when it was $40K without the perseverance to hodl they will sell at panic price. Right now you should advise your friends on DCA probably weekly since bitcoin is in its recovery phase now. But the funds been used to buy bitcoin should be money they could lose or more so could do away with for a very long time. Because the only to avoid losing in bitcoin I holding for long",

Try to question their reason for wanting to invest now. Anyone who hasn't picked up any real interest in Bitcoin or how it works probably is not fascinated by it and if their reason for wanting to invest is cause the price has moved from point A to point B, with point B being a higher price, then they would likely panic if the price moves back to point A or lower.",

You know, if they @Your friends, hand invested as immediate as you urge them to, they would have seen little value still in bitcoin and view it for some scheme or a thing for the while. They even won't have valued the profits they would have made since, they've got no course for regrets.Now, with the opportunity to have been left hanging and there minds set on what could have been gained which is now lost with the market, they would better understand the advantages of taking chances when it's best.Well, the good news remains that, no time is too late to invest. Your plans for your investment is what makes you end in profit or not. If you've got the time @OP, you could as well guide them but, don't let yourself be pushed.",

The reason we have crashes is because people start panic selling when there is bad news about BTC. We cannot predict this but I do not think it is BTC that is unpredictable but the news around BTC. If a company like FTX scams its users then we cannot predict that but I am confident that BTC would have continued to grow strong if that did not happen.",

Those who belong to the middle or lower class are more interested in starting their investment in crypto, and not without reason, they start investing because to get more returns by buying bitcoins at the lowest price. But for those who have middle and upper class steady jobs usually tend not to care because their own work is enough to produce, and some do get into crypto for long term investment, but some don't make any investment.

Who knows if 24k becomes 64k again just like the good old times? As long as it is okay to lose the amount anyway, no amount of money would be felt \"wasted\" or \"down in the drain\".$24k to $64 is very likely, it will touch the last ATH, maybe even more when the market is already bullish and the timing is right. just focus on the main goal, do it for the long term. It will give you greater profits when you are patient and wait for the right moment.",

It took me some time to discover what I had been missing, but even though I had joined out of FOMO, things didn't start off well but I ended up making some gain even though things might have turned out differently had I joined sooner.Introducing them to bitcoin is really a good thing to do make sure you tell them what about the risks involved and that its not just a money doubling scheme where they expect huge returns in a matter of weeks and let then know how the market behaves and how the price is influenced. They should invest the little they can afford to loose for now. It’s better late than never.",
