Someone tweeted, 'Looks like Ledger's Operation Self-destruct has been an unequivocal success...' along with a link to the tweet:  This could be some very clever video editing done intentionally to damage ledger and I would like to see confirmation from several sources, but I wouldn't be surprised if something like this is actually happening.I am not the one who is defending ledger at all (my post history proves that) but I always like to double check what really happened.Anyway, this would be a good chance to buy hardware wallet with cash or with BTC directly from manufacturers, so if you are in Prague you know what to do, and not much time left...",

I don't know how it works, but it seems impossible to get some Satoshi with a limited battery supply.   , but so far is cool, maybe next in the metaverse world it could be happening in our dreams.",

If we ignore the noise and the cooling mechanism, all these things make that mining bag movable NOT portable.As for the return, it will definitely not be a solo mining, but within mining pool. it will have a return more than some Satoshis.I remember seeing it before, it's nothing new in EXPO 2023.",
