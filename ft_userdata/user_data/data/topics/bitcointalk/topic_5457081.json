I have proof of course.My problem is am a bit paranoid when it comes to sharing addresses or transactions publicly (the less I share the more I feel comfortable); also, unless am missing something and in case please enlighten me, I didn't see any lending format/rule ( like scam accusation one for example) which compulsorily requires you to publish addresses or transactions even if I understand it will add more transparency to the agreement made.Please share your thoughts about this as I like lending small amounts here and there but at the same time I want to remain as private as possible without feeding doubts or suspicions. What do you suggest?",
