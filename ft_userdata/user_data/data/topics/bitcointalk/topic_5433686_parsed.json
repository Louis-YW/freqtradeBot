  "content": "Tonight the Georgia Bulldogs take on the TCU Horned Frogs for the NCAA college football National Championship game.  As of right now, the Georgia Bulldogs are a sizable favorite, as the line for the game is Georgia at -13.5pts.  The Over/Under for the game is at 62.5 points.So what do you guys think.  Have any good bets in mind for the game tonight? I'm not sure which way to bet myself. I would find it pretty hard to bet on Georgia to cover 13.5 pts, which is quite a bit.  Thoughts?",

Lol.",

Lol.This game was interesting for just a couple minutes lol. I don’t get a ton in to college football but always try and watch the championship game, so I stuck it out for most of the game for some reason. What an embarrassment. I asked a few of my buddies which way they were betting ahead of the game and all I got back was a “I’m taking the over”. I regret not following suit.",

I didn't think tcu was going to let them score that much which is why I was thinking the under.  Guaranteed the Big-12 has an issue getting a team into the playoffs next year because of this.  They looked like a mid major team playing against Georgia.  One of the worst college games I seen In awhile.  Just imagine the TCU fans that flew out for that lol.",
