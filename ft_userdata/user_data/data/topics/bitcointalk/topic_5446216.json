  "content": "The ARBI TokenARBI is a unique market basket protocol that enables users to buy ARBI tokens and burn them for underlying assets that back the token. As a part of every buy/sell transaction, there is a 7% tax that is collected by the ARBI token contract. These tokens can then be traded on a DEX or directly to other users. The assets received from trading these tokens will be utilized to buy other tokens on Arbitrum. Redemption of ARBI tokens is always available, and when tokens are burnt, the user will receive a percentage of the underlying assets that are proportional to the total supply of ARBI. The more ARBI tokens that are burnt, the greater the share of underlying assets that the user receives. In the future, the tax on ARBIwill be brought down as protocol revenue from baskets increases.Tokens that are redeemed are permanently burnt, making ARBI deflationary by design. ARBI's innovative market basket approach allows users to gain exposure to multiple tokens without the need to purchase each token individually. The underlying assets that back ARBI are diverse and range from micro-cap tokens to wBTC, providing broad exposure to the crypto market. The community plays a significant role in the selection of the tokens that are purchased.What are Bespoke Baskets?Bespoke on-chain baskets are like a basket of fruits that you can buy at the market. Instead of holding fruits, it holds different tokens. You can buy the basket token and it gives you access to all the tokens inside.If the value of the tokens inside the basket goes up, then the value of your basket token goes up too - vice versa. This is because you can buy basket tokens on the secondary market and burn them for the underlying assets.ARBI bespoke baskets will be multi-managed, meaning multiple traders or a DAO can control the basket. Our next product release will be AMB's, which are decentralized automated market baskets that have set rules and rebalancing periods.Just like an ETF, basket tokens can be minted or redeemed at any time (with the exception being ARBI token itself, which is only redeemable). Fees that are generated from baskets go back to the ARBI token contract to be redeemed.Tokenomics80% 6 months Vested LP5% Marketing10% Ecosystem grants vesting 1 year5% Team vesting 1 yearThis project has just started, and we are looking for community feedback on what we develop and the features you would be interested in.
