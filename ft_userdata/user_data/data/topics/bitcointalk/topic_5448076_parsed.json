  "content": "Greetings to all. Recently signed up to rollbit to bet on the sportsbook. Regular game, lots of deposits and withdrawals. A few days ago I noticed that maxbet was reduced. I asked them in the chat to review the limits. About an hour after contacting, they requested KYC. I successfully passed it, but my limits were cut to zero. After that, I immediately tried to withdraw funds, but I could not do this. In the chat, I asked what the problem was, they answered that I needed to make a video call, I immediately agreed, but warned that I did not know English, but that I was using Google translator. They did not answer me for a long time, the next morning a certain SmokeyLisa answered me that \"Hey,I will let you know once I have some availability to sort this issue out ASAP.Kind Regards,Smokey Lisa.\"Â That is, I just have to wait for some unknown reason until a certain SmokeyLisa has free time so that I can withdraw my money. It's been 3 days and no one has scheduled a video call for me. All my chat messages get a rare reply \"We'll update you accordingly.\"The account currently has 770$ and 150$ bonuses. I'm not even sure that I have earned at least something during the existence of the account.I just don't understand this whole situation. If you want to make a video call then let's do it! If you don't have time for it, then why should it be my problem?I'm sorry for the mistakes. Copied text in google translate",
