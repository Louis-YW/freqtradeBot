Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized and free from traditional control.We must keep questioning authority, actively participate in discussions, and uphold Bitcoin's core principles of decentralization and individual empowerment. Let's not forget why we got into Bitcoin and work together to protect its integrity.",

      "body": "If by Economic Nodes they mean Nodes that participate in meaningful Economic or Network activities. Or Nodes that contribute to the proper functioning of the Bitcoin system rather than idle ones then it may be a good idea because that will mean every honest & working participant can easily participate in Network consensus with little to no restrictions or with low barrier to entry. So they could use Proof of Work consensus mechanism to determine who quafies as economic node or who has contributed significantly to the economy or network. The contributions have to solve useful problem properly with little to no issue. Nevertheless, the right consensus or voting method for the Bitcoin System is the one with little to zero restriction, to enable anyone, whether new or old participate or contribute to the network without limit. Qualified contributions qualify as economic nodes and the contributors are ranked up by the weight of their useful contributions which will give them higher voting powers. This voting power can be accumulated on any part of the decentralized Network and used in future voting on the area on the Network that is related/similar to contributors works, talents or interests For now, any development by core that is against the Bitcoin ideals will fail or won't be embraced by the Bitcoin community. There will be competing ideas and developers that take over the roles of lazy, dumb and anti-Bitcoin developers. This will be happening at a rate their minds cannot comprehend",

      "body": "Here you go, I had ChatGPT write you a cordial letter you can fire off to the Core devs, or you know, send to the mailing list because I've seen you post stuff in there:QuoteSubject: A Heartfelt Letter of Concern and Hope for Bitcoin's FutureDear Bitcoin Core Developers,I hope this message finds you well. I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation for the incredible work you have done in advancing the Bitcoin protocol. Your dedication, expertise, and relentless pursuit of innovation have been instrumental in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape and have earned my respect.I am writing to you today with a sense of both admiration and concern. Over the years, I have witnessed the remarkable growth and transformation of Bitcoin, from its humble beginnings to a global phenomenon. However, with this growth, I have also observed changes in the way Bitcoin is governed and the direction in which it is headed.One of my primary concerns is the increasing centralization of governance within the Bitcoin ecosystem. I believe that Bitcoin's strength lies in its decentralization, and it's essential to preserve this core principle. Decisions that impact the entire community should be made collectively and transparently, with input from a diverse range of participants.I understand the importance of having a core development team to maintain and improve the protocol, but I also believe that this team should be accountable to the broader community. We should encourage open dialogue, thoughtful critique, and the opportunity for users and stakeholders to voice their concerns.Additionally, I urge us all to take a step back and reflect on Bitcoin's original vision. Bitcoin was conceived as a revolutionary concept, offering financial freedom and independence from traditional centralized systems. While it has grown immensely in popularity and value, it's crucial not to lose sight of its core ethos. Bitcoin should continue to serve as a decentralized digital currency that empowers individuals and fosters financial sovereignty.I understand that these concerns are complex and multifaceted. They require careful consideration, open dialogue, and a commitment to finding solutions that align with Bitcoin's core values. My intention in sharing these thoughts is not to criticize but to express my deep love for Bitcoin and my desire to see it thrive for generations to come.I would be more than willing to engage in constructive discussions, share ideas, and work together to address these issues. Our collective dedication to the success of Bitcoin is what has brought us to this point, and it is what will carry us forward.Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and for your ongoing commitment to the Bitcoin project. I believe that by working together, we can ensure that Bitcoin remains a beacon of decentralization, freedom, and innovation.Warm regards,Franky1",

It is right that the popularity of centralized exchanges is the major push away from the DEX. I think first we have to look at the role that DEX have played that gives room to the overtake of it. DEX community have not really been there in the eyes of users or crypto interested persons. Just few users even know the names of DEX like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, 1Inch, SushiSwap etc but every user of crypto have heard of binance, coinbase, if you go to CMC and other crypto platforms CEX feature more. So I think the nature of DEX have taken it backwards and the government again enjoys the control that they are getting from the regulation of CEX and casinos to the extent that they are licensed. However, I believe that the time will come when the bitcoin and blockchain foremost principle will be uphold.",

I remember time when people were only speculating when they will enter this game. And now that they have, they need regulatory compliance to stay in the game. If you want to escape regulations, monero is pretty much only way to go now. And sure, it works and you can use it, but when cexes refuse to list it and FATF aml laws require to provide origin of the money, it just might be that every crypto outside of regulations and cryptos traded against them can't be listed to cexes. And that affects the liquidity and price.",
