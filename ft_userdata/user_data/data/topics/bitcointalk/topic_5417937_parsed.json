And besides that, I didn't see that n1bet has a thread section here in this forum, so I said it's a bit vague that the management of n1bet will respond.But still do the right thing, and hopefully, you will recover and get your rights as a gambler, after you have evidence based on your statements here.",

I hope you can still recover your money back, but it is gross to have trust in a company only for them to stab you in the back. Next time, try to go for the right companies that could guarantee your withdrawals, you can do a lot of personal reviews online if you don't know people to turn to for this, BTT will also guide you at the gambling board. You should stop falling for their big incentive and bonuses, they only use them to lure their victims.",

Now see your case, you lost money, so far this is something normal in this market that has many scammers, but the biggest problem is that you KYC in a scam casino, if these shits are able to not pay you of course these scammers will sell your documents, because those damn thieves like moneyQuote from: n1betscam on October 22, 2022, 08:56:02 AMThank you very much on support.

I understand how frustrating it can be when a casino doesn't pay out your winnings. Unfortunately, N1Bet Casino is not advertised on this forum and has no official representative to handle support issues. As a result, we are unable to assist you in this matter. The only thing you can do here is open a topic in the Scam Accusations board to warn other members about this casino site. (Now I see you've already done that.)But there is some good news here: I was able to find information about the casino on the AskGamblers website, and I noticed that they have an active representative there who is willing to resolve complaints. I suggest you open a case with AskGamblers and explain your situation to them so that they can mediate between you and the casino operator.https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casinos/reviews/n1bet-casinoHopefully, you will be able to come to some sort of agreement, and this will help you get your money back. Good luck!EDIT:Quote from: n1betscam on October 22, 2022, 09:39:31 AMThank you, I made complaints to askgamblers.I didn't see your post when I was writing my reply.
