Discussing in private can easily get to the point you get scammed instead of getting helped. So you should better try to give here as many details as you can (of course, nothing private) and see what people can help with.2. If you have problems with a platform/business it's only them who can help. But you should give more details - maybe the name of the platform and what's the problem in a more detailed manner.",

I also hope that the OP is honest and just needs help, but at first glance, this seems like a classic scam where someone's funds are stuck on some fake crypto exchange, and all that is needed is to make a small deposit to enable withdrawal.

So you should better try to give here as many details as you can (of course, nothing private) and see what people can help with.He might likely be the one to scam people reason because i have got such engagements before, a newbie somehow sent me messages on telegram claiming he got my telegram details from forum saying if i could help him make a withdrawal that he has been struggling with it. And i replied what could be the problem they don't allow you to withdraw, and he quickly said \"He's country is restricted from making withdrawal but can transacts platform to platform\" i was like how?don't you read their compliance carefully before making an account over there and he said he didn't read those details and as matter of facts, he want to use the money inside the platform to settle his accommodations, pays their mother's hospital ect. The funniest part of it is that he was promising to pay me for my time spent if only i could renders him help to withdraw the bitcoin from my end, that he don't mind sending it to me through the platform then i make the withdrawal from my country and converts it to stablecoin and send to him. I said okay, i never knew he had a bad multive to scam me. Though then i was already told to be very careful scammers comes with something similar, so i did make the account as he said and he asked me to send him the mail i created the account with, which i did. Instantly i check and i saw about 6 bitcoin reflected on the scammed website he sent in btc. First thing that came into my mind was, this guy is a scammer but i just tried to follow him up to help make the withdrawal. lastly i was asked to pay a commision fee of 1 Bitcoin then i could withdraw 5 bitcoin, he said i should take 2 bitcoin and converts 3 bitcoin to stablecoin. It was then i came into convictions that i was dealing with a scammer instead, what i did was to to send him the email and password of the platform to make the withdrawal for himself before i could be label as scammers. Although then i was very Clever if anyone ask such help i will make a new mail so i could handover the mails to them whenever they aren't satisfied enough. After which i knock him off.",
