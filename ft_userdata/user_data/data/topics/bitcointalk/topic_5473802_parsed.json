The only way to know for sure in this scenario is to examine the transaction data yourself and to know what you are looking for. This does seem like a potential attack method to me.",

If you are using another tool to create and/or sign a transaction then it should also be assumed that you already know what you are doing and most importantly that you know what the risks of using that tool are. For example that other tool could be sending your coins to someone else's address or be setting the fee too high, etc.In any case I'm for showing a notification when an uncommon sighash type is used regardless of whether it is risky or not. That way the warning/notification is simpler to implement.",

Since the airgapped wallet does not know anything about which inputs to be used, then you will also need to copy across individual inputs and then manually craft your transaction since I don't know of any airgapped wallet which allows you to import individual inputs.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on November 14, 2023, 08:02:31 AMYou can also just install a software that checks for your transaction's SIGHASH like Sparrow.As I said above, although Sparrow lets you chose a different SIGHASH to use, it doesn't actually show you which SIGHASHes were used once the transaction has been created. So importing a signed transaction to Sparrow instead of Electrum does not solve this issue. The only way to know for sure at the moment is to manually examine the transaction data and check it uses 0x01 for SIGHASH_ALL on each input.It would be a fairly simple change for the preview transaction screen on either wallet to display the SIGHASH type for each input next to that input.",

You cannot import inputs in known wallet software via airgapped means (i.e., QR code). You can only sign unsigned transactions. Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on November 14, 2023, 11:05:55 AMAs I said above, although Sparrow lets you chose a different SIGHASH to use, it doesn't actually show you which SIGHASHes were used once the transaction has been created. Sparrow doesn't show you which SIGHASHes are used in a signed transaction, but it does show that information if you import an unsigned transaction. So, a solution would be to install Sparrow on your airgapped device, and before you sign a transaction, you can open it up with Sparrow to check. Although, I do agree that simply displaying the SIGHASH in the preview is fairly simple and informative. Edit: Sparrow does not show that sort of information for unsigned tx either. It is still better than Electrum to spot the 01 byte, which is the last byte of your input witness data. Has anyone reported this on either Electrum's or Sparrow's repo?",
