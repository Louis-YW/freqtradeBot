I have been a long time advocate of hardware wallets but hardware wallet manufacturers have shown a general disregard for their users safety by mishandling their name, phone number and email, in my opinion. So I made a service that lets you get a hardware wallet delivered near you without giving up any personal information. I am sure a lot of people here already have a hardware wallet, but I would love to hear any feedback y'all might have. Thanks and have a great day!",

Of course, re-packaging needs some extra care, but it's not that difficult.People were advised all the time to avoid third party and order directly from the factory shop where possible (since even from Amazon it seems to have happened to receive HW with seed already in, I will look for link, but I don't promise results) and this may be a problem for your business.",

Unless he works at Amazon or has someone on the inside, but that brings us back here:Quoteeven from Amazon it seems to have happened to receive HW with seed already inI'd say the risk of a receiving a compromised hardware wallet when ordering from OP is the same as when you order from Amazon directly. I've received fake products from Amazon in the past (not related to Bitcoin, just cheap knockoffs), so clearly their quality assurance system isn't perfect.The next risk is trusting a Newbie, but I like the idea of improved privacy.",

Maybe you are talking about this incident that involved a Ledger Nano S that was purchased from Amazon in the UK. The person who bought it, got a paper card already filled up with a 24-word seed. Not sure if the seed was also entered in the hardware wallet, but I am guessing it was.I agree with what DdmrDdmr said in the OP. This can be a device that was tempered with by someone at Amazon, or it could be a hardware wallet that was bought by a different person altogether. It was that other person that set it up, wrote down the seed words, and then returned the device back to Amazon for whatever reason. The personnel who received it had no idea what they were doing, they just checked the contents quickly, noticed that everything seemed to be OK, and placed the package among the other ones waiting to be sold.",

Thanks and have a great day!Is this service working for all countries with Amazon lockers or it's only available in United States? I think this can be a good idea but maybe you can expand this beyond hardware wallets for other small items.It's cool to accept Monero (like you say in your FAQ page) but I would like to pay also with Bitcoin and Lightning Network if possible.Good thing is that this service is open source, and code can be inspected on github page:https://github.com/DecentralizeJustice/anonymousLocker EDIT: I found out that this service is only available in US, so I would like to see this working in Europe also.",

      "body": "Wow thanks for all the great feedback guys. The question of buy directly from them and give up your info vs use some private 3rd party is definitely a tough one, but after I studied more about how trezor and ledger use  customer info and give it to third parties I would use the third party option every time. Its cool that ledger has partnered with best buy but people have also had issues with using that method. The trust issues makes sense but I have to start somewhere. I already got one positive review on reddit, so I just have to give great customer service to build up trust. My service accepts ltc, btc, eth, and monero. The original idea was a more general service, but the only customers I found who made it worth it were the hardware wallet people so I made a special landing page for that market segment. The general landing page can be found at https://anonymouslocker.app/.",

      "body": "I like the concept behind what you are trying to when it comes to the safety and security of the purchaser but since you do not have any history in the forum it will be difficult to convince others to come onboard. Even if you had excellent reputation here it would be difficult for people to put their trust in the service you provide because of fear of tampering.If you are simply providing a man in the middle service where you cannot gain access to the hardware wallets then it means the chances of them being tampered are still not reduced to zero because Amazon or other employees have the potential or possibility to tamper with the devices. In my opinion passing a promise of tamper-proof selling to potential customers (to convince them in order to buy) is something you will probably struggle with.Quote from: dgoon on November 21, 2022, 02:45:04 AMHi,I just started a service that uses amazon lockers to enable anonymous delivery of hardware wallets, https://anonymouslocker.app/hw .

So you can't open it again, and I don't think consumers can send packages to those lockers either (that would enable drug dealers to use them).

In the usa you can not open amazon lockers twice, but I could in theory still perform this attack. It would require me telling amazon customer service to give me a new locker code. This is possible and would leave a paper trail leading back to me. The lockers also have cameras on them. So if I drive to the locker you chose, tamper with the wallet and get amazon customer service to let me place it back in, I could in theory give you a tampered wallet. That sounds like a lot of work to just go to jail though, since this entire process can and would be traced back to me with amazon message logs and camera footage from the locker and business the locker is in.  So although this attack is possible, I think it's not a reasonable fear to have. But what other people see as reasonable varies. As far as tampering in general goes the only solution is multi-signature with different wallets. There is no other solution to prevent tampering when buying a premade hardware wallet. If you buy from ledger directly, amazon, or in person with cash at best buy, you face tampering issues. No supply change fix solves the tampering issue, and the only way to fix that is to go to the wallet manufacturer assembly line and build the hardware wallet yourself.Quote from: examplens on November 22, 2022, 10:44:05 AMQuote from: dgoon on November 21, 2022, 02:45:04 AMI have been a long time advocate of hardware wallets but hardware wallet manufacturers have shown a general disregard for their users safety by mishandling their name, phone number and email, in my opinion.

No app is 100% hack proof so I just don't collect information that could compromise your privacy. The only information needed for my service is: payment, what items you want, and the locker you want to pick up from. No name, no address info, email, phone number or any other information is used or collected by my service. So you can think of my service as guaranteed way to protect your privacy when you get a hardware wallet, something trezor nor ledger can offer you if you buy from them directly.",

I have to agree that buying directly would not ensure security as many people and/or companies could have the name and address of the person purchasing the hardware wallet.With hardware wallets becoming more and more common it stands to reason a business such as yours should have a niche market but lack of trust is thing probably holding it back. It is good to see business ideas leaping from paper to the real world in a functioning entity.

They could probably be opened with a crowbar, but they are usually inside stores where an attendant would probably call the cops. I have also pivoted my marketing away from hardware wallet deliveries since something about ht hardware wallet use case makes people very uncomfortable and it leads to unproductive discussions. I haven't had that happen here, but on places like reddit, https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z1w0uw/comment/ixf076d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3. I think it's just easier to discredit the amazon locker portion of the supply chain instead of people to admit that the entire supply chain from the hw maker to your front door has hundreds of opportunities to be exploited and offers no real protections from tampering. It maybe goes back to the advice about trust I was given earlier in the thread. I am not sure but I have had much better success going after just general privacy deliveries with amazon lockers. I am currenlty working on a private loyalty program. Also thanks for all the great feedback and discourse, I enjoy talking here much more than I do on reddit.",
