  "content": "Hello,I am somewhat familiar with the forum but I never posted before.I want to share this as an interesting story, especially for those who played on Stake before, and as a public opportunity for Stake to make a statement on this.What happened:1-I deposited 0.08925405 BTC on Stake on the 2nd of august 2022, first confirmation of the transaction at 9h30 am UTC2-I saw my balance showing 1980 euros, so I bet on Hippodrome Live roulette, at 9h31:18 UTC on multiple numbers, about all of my balance, and I had 300 euros on number 323- Edit: 08-09-22 (to assess that the bets were not rejected immediately) I see my bet debited from my balance, the chips taken into account on the table after bets were closed, and the ball make a few rounds4-I see a message saying \"your bet has been rejected\"5-I see the ball make about 2 to 3 rounds before landing on number 32 (this is probably why I didn't post this in the scam accusation section, as I thought they might not have cancelled my bet because of the result)6-I make another 1980 euros bet at 9h33:03 UTC, and it also gets rejected, but this time the bet would have lost7-I go to another live roulette, make the same bet, bets accepted, and lose.If my bets were processed like they should have been, my balance as of now should be 10800-1980-1980=6840 euros.How Stake technical team explained this problem:-The bet I made in section 2 above was rejected because my deposit was credited at 9h31:33 UTC and the bet was made before that at 9h31:18 UTC-There is no problem with this because, whatever the result was going to be, my bet would have still been refundedThe problem I see with this explanation:-It would be impossible for me to see my balance at 1980 euros or even try to bet if my deposit was not credited.-What he says is in contradiction with blockchain records. Stake requires one confirmation for the deposit to be credited. My transaction hash is b8f8fa7e9c7272c3791abc887740bed23a535441c193279a393c1d346da8b206 and the first confirmation took place at 9h30 UTC. For those of you who played on Stake before, you know it takes only seconds after confirmation for the deposit to be credited. This is stronger proof than his screenshots-His explanation doesn't say why my 2nd bet was rejected, which gives doubts about why my first bet was rejected. I just don't buy it-It is totally possible, with certain delays in the video, for them to know the result before I do. I am not accusing them of doing so, but this is possible, and it's a matter of trust of believing that they didn't cancel my bet because of the result. They might have cancelled my second losing bet as to not make it obvious about what is really happening. Their edge in this case would go from 2.7% to about 70%, 30x more return.-I've always bet immediately after my deposit was credited on stake, and never had this problem, and I've done it many, many times.In conclusion:-I've made my bets after transaction was confirmed and won.-I've been given some inaccurate explanations about as to why my bets were rejected-It is possible that the bets were rejected because of a winning result. Also possible that bets were rejected no matter the result.-I personally did not commit any mistakeSo I appeal Stake to take on their responsibilities and consider all of the bets I placed.Stake does not argue these facts, it's just about how to handle them, so I won't bother posting proof. And I'll just leave there.In case some of you are interested in the conversation that took place, here's the video of the complete conversation: https://www.transfernow.net/dl/202208052GZCdH1R You have the screenshots they sent me by the end of the conversation.Hope you'll have a nice day! Cheers!Edit 08-09-22: in the event that Stake wants to make a statement about this here, case number is: - SD-2546222",

Furthermore in live roulettes it's the game provider who decides win or lose, in other words everything related to the table you are in decided by the provider of the roulettes table. Stake or any other casino are just using their API and storing the data of their clients (in this case it's you) to pay your winnings or take money from your loss.",

It's not possible to observe a delay of this magnitude through operator's response to live chat. And it also depends on the game provider.OP did mention the game provider in his post (Hippodrome Live roulette). Maybe someone can test this theory in a conclusive manner.",
