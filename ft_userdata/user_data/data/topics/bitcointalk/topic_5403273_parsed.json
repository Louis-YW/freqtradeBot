No, these are identical algorithmic stablecoins, and their support is carried out by the main coin of the corresponding blockchain. Their only difference lies in the capitalization, which in USSD is 15 times lower that was on UST. It is for this reason that it is still possible to restore the value of USDD, since it is easier to redeem the surplus of this stablecoin.",

But for some reason, they haven't utilized their reserve to maintain the peg.Maybe the TDR is an \"exit scam\" by Justin Sun himself. I'd be surprised if he decides to run away with the money. We'd have to carefully inspect the smart contract's code to see if it gives TRX's founder the ability to do that. A fraudulent stablecoin will be a major blow to the crypto industry (just like what happened with Terra/LUNA/UST lately). With how unstable algorithmic \"stablecoins\" have proven to be, people will only trust stablecoins with real USD reserves and those that are truly collaterized like DAI. Let's see how everything will play out in the long run.Quote from: dbshck on June 20, 2022, 02:36:05 AMUnlikely, DAI has on-chain mechanisms to maintain the $1 soft peg and has been battle-tested through many crises, even the recent LUNA/UST crash. USDD, on the other hand, still relies on the TDR to do it.Maker's done a good job in helping DAI maintain the peg after all these years. Even after the recent market turmoil (caused by the collapse of Terra/LUNA/UST), the decentralized stablecoin's dollar value hasn't moved an inch. If only other decentralized stablecoins copied DAI's model, things would've been much better in the crypto/Blockchain space. Scandals like the UST crash gives crypto a bad reputation among people in the mainstream world. USDD already failed, so there's nowhere else to look for except to choose an alternative that lives up to its claims. Just my opinion",

It looks like this article[1] has an explanation of why the USDD lost its peg a few days ago.It stated that there are 3 reasons namely:1. Market sentiment2. stETH was losing peg and then causing the chain of reaction (ETH – TRX takes a big correction)3. USDD mint/burn mechanismYou can read the explanation through the source link belowIt looks like algorithmic stable coins aren't as great as they boasted.Btw, if you are wondering how USDD works you can check this diagramQuoteSpecifically, USDD will be pegged to the US dollar, with 1 USDD corresponding to 1 USD. In the immediate future, the value of USDD will be backed by TRON’s TRX token. To get USDD, users need to key their TRX to receive a corresponding amount of USDD.

This explains why TRON's stablecoin went downhill in an instant. If selling pressure continues, then it might become extremely worthless in the long run. That's what you get when you invest in an unregulated stablecoin backed solely by algorithms. The trusted third party is necessary for stablecoins to maintain their peg. There's no other way around it.By choosing regulated stablecoins, you can feel confident your investment won't go downhill overnight. That's because there are investor protections which prevents the issuing company from doing anything it wants. USDC and USDT may be the only stablecoins worth the investment as they've maintained their peg since day one (although USDT has been on the brink of losing its peg over the last few days). USDD failing will be a huge blow for Justin Sun's TRON project, leaving investors \"rekt\" in the process. I'd steer clear from it until the peg is restored. Just my thoughts",

He doesn't care about decentralization as long as his pockets are filled with money. Just like he destroyed the Steem project by manipulating the network's witnesses (validators) for his own personal benefit. USDD and UST are exactly the same thing with different names. If investors are careless, they could lose it all in an instant if USDD goes all the way down the drain.I would steer clear from any algorithmic stablecoin as they're prone to failure. Only collaterized and regulated stablecoins like USDC and BUSD have a future. Tether claims to be regulated, but its quite shady in its disclosure of USD holdings.

At least so far, Justin Sun has better reserve for his USDD stable coin. He did not sacrifice TRON to save USDD. That is different than Do Kwon as he sacrificed $LUNA to save $UST. When both died, he changed his mind and say Terra is more than $UST.

Fortunately, regulators will be weighting into the stablecoin industry to minimize scams/frauds as much as possible. Who knows if this becomes the time for the cleansing of the crypto market? Just my opinion Algorithm stable coins are very risky. From their algorithm and from the concept to back a stablecoin by a very volatile asset. That is unrealistic. If you want to make a reserve to back a stable coin, the asset you use to back it should be a stable one. The best is US dollar because the mission of a stable coin is its peg 1:1 against US dollar. Best asset in reserve should be US dollar, not any thing else.Even gold is unstable and can not be considered as a safe backing asset in reserve and collateral.",

Tether did something similar a while ago, where it printed more units of the stablecoin for no reason. It raised alarms of getting de-pegged from the USD after \"magically\" inflating the coin's supply. Fortunately, Tether stopped doing such practice after the UST collapse.I hope USDD doesn't take the same path as its counterpart (UST) or the crypto market will suffer. We need as much legitimate stablecoins as possible in order to attract as much investors into the crypto market.
