  "content": "Timestamp is a data in block which shows the exact time the transaction takes place. The reference timestamp is the coordinated universal time (UTC) or the London time.I did some reading and would like the forum to help me with the questions below. Perdon me if they have been answered before.1. In the arrangement of transactions in a block does the height takes proceeding or it can be arranged according to its timestamp?2. Is there a possibility to timestamp a transactionto been spent later?3. Since it takes time for transaction to be confirmed does this transaction take the timestamp of when It was confirmed or the initial time it was first issued?",

      "body": "Quote from: Zaguru12 on June 28, 2022, 10:02:13 AMTimestamp is a data in block which shows the exact time the transaction takes place.It is far from exact. The timestamp of a block can range from the median timestamp (plus one second) of the last 11 blocks in the past, to 2 hours in the future based on the adjusted network time. This gives (on average) a 3 hour window in which a block's timestamp can fall and still be valid.Quote from: Zaguru12 on June 28, 2022, 10:02:13 AM1. In the arrangement of transactions in a block does the height takes proceeding or it can be arranged according to its timestamp?The height is the only way to correctly order blocks. It is not uncommon for a block to have a timestamp earlier than the block before it.Quote from: Zaguru12 on June 28, 2022, 10:02:13 AM2. Is there a possibility to timestamp a transactionto been spent later?Transactions don't have timestamps; blocks do. You can timelock a transaction so it cannot be spent until later, however, but this is different from a timestamp.Quote from: Zaguru12 on June 28, 2022, 10:02:13 AM3. Since it takes time for transaction to be confirmed does this transaction take the timestamp of when It was confirmed or the initial time it was first issued?As above, transactions do not have timestamps. The only timestamp you can reliably apply to a transaction is the timestamp of the block in which it was mined. Some block explorers will display the time at which they first saw the transaction, but that does not tell you when the transaction was signed nor when it was broadcasted to the network - it only tells you about the local behavior of the specific node that said block explorer is relying on.",

Also worth pointing out that most explorers which do assign a timestamp to unconfirmed transactions will change that timestamp once the transaction confirms to the timestamp of the block in which it is mined.The most accurate way for you to timestamp when a transaction was first seen or first mined is to run your own well connected node and record the timestamp of every transaction it sees and every block it receives against a well calibrated local clock. Won't be perfect, but it's the best you'll get in a decentralized network. You'd also need to figure out why exactly you'd want to do any of that, though.",
