I don't think there's any way to tell if the owner of such account is dead or not and that's simply because no one reveals their true identity here on Bitcointalk. The only person I think his true identity wasn't hidden here is the legendary Hal Finney, who was once a member of Bitcointalk. But since after his death his account is sometimes used by his wife to pass on important messages to bitcoin talkers or even on his social media accounts. It's very easy to tell, if an account had switched user because everyone here, has a specific posting style and when your account begins to post in a different pattern and gets noticed, it can be said to have been sold, bought or hacked by another person.here on Bitcointalk, people watch your every move so you've got to be careful. Back to op, na true talk you yarn my brother, the idea don first dey my head before now. But I no sure say person go fit do anything about that matter. Death no be watin person dey plan for, but we all know say one day we go die leave all our earthly properties for this life. Bitcointalk na one special property for many of us here as we don invest our time and knowledge take grow our account e no o good make e just waste like that when we piae. D only thing wey you fit do na to introduce some of your family to Bitcointalk so Dem go still try study and grow them account.  Apart from that nothing dey wey person go fit do. Sha make we hear from other members them.",

So now wetting I dey ask be say that kind matter, how Dem dey handle am? A bitcointalk account is meant for one person because the way another person use Bitcointalk account it will not be the way another person will make use of bitcointalk account, some people here can use bitcointalk account with sincerity why some other people will not use it that way, if you inherit bitcointalk account you will not know how stressful of building account, so the person can use it to abuse some people or they use it for any other things like scam, defrauding people, so it's not good to inherit account, when check some of people who die in the forum or who voluntarily retired in the forum, the DT member do give the person tag, meanwhile their reasons of doing such is that they don't like a situation another person will use the reputation of the original owner of the account to deceive and defraud people",

OP, everything you’ve learned in this forum is a knowledge that is already instilled in you. As far as a I know, knowledge cannot be transferred and if someone else takes over your account, it does not mean the person will have the same knowledge as you, or a good reputation you’ve built here so far. This is a public forum and also a risky place as it involves many people from different places coming together, reputation is very vital here and when you lose it, you’ve lost everything here already. Because of your good reputation here, I can decide to trade with you but when it’s bad, I won’t think twice on whether to trade with you or not because I won’t. You can inherit the account but you can’t inherit the knowledge the deceased must have gathered so far here, so it is better you start on building yourself in the forum instead of using and impersonating someone’s account.Cases like this has already taken place before  and such new user’s taken over the original user’s account are advised to open an account on their own name and build the reputation themselves, if not the account will be tagged to know that the account have changed hand any they they should trade with caution with such account.",
