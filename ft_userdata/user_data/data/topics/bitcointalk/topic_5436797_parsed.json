  "content": "I just googled the return percentage of online casinos and saw different percentages that doesn't seem real. A slot machine can be written to pay out 98%, but its programmed to pay 90% and it's publicized that way to attract more people to play using that slot. Though one slot could be paying out that amount in the casino, yet my point is that no casino offers 100 percent payout that means if a slot pays out 94 percent for every 100 dollar bill spent on that machine the player losses 6$ to the casino. That is if you play longer times you'll lose, and we can almost never stay atop of the slot machines after long period of plays, unless you win a jackpot. Even if you win a huge amount, you can lose. They are numerous stories of people who won the jackpot and ended up spending the whole money back on the casino within a short period, 1 or 2 years, they lost the jackpot.

Jackpots are taken into account by casinos to calculate their house edge from a game of course. And they don't want to have games with negative house edge except for promotions during short periods of time. So even when you win a jackpot on a game you are not likely to make profits if you play it since very long time unfortunately. It only happens when the jackpot is worth millions times your average stake but it's quite unusual, jackpots are worth 10 000x max in general.",

Isn't it?You are sure correct, I agree with you, casino are built to always be in profit no matter which user wins and how much the user won, as long as that user is not the only gambler playing on that casino, the casino will always make the money back from other players, this is if the gambler is one that wins and run away with his winnings, but if the gambler that won the money is a faithful gambler on that casino, then over time, the casino wil recover all the money won by that user back, plus even more from that same user..I have friends who have won huge amount of money from casinos, kept playing and within a few weeks, they lost everything they won back to the casino and even more..",

It's obvious that this winner didn't manage their winning money very well and just to gamble all the money that they have won as if giving it back to the casino itself. That's why you really need to be responsible as well once you hit that jackpot. You should learn how to invest your money very well because nothing last and it won't sustain you in the long run if you keep on gambling it away. But the problem is that they got this money from gambling itself, I mean they didn't work this ass off earning this big so they have this mentally to burn it away until it's too late and they regret not saving or investing for the long haul.",
