You could also rely on those good bounty managers as they accept good projects that they have probably checked before accepting the offer to manage their bounties.Quote from: abcde2018 on October 30, 2022, 02:46:46 PMand one more thing. how to find out the bounty campaign from another user's signaturemany thanks!!Just go to the Bounties(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0) and find its thread. If they have an active bounty, you'll definitely going to see it.",

Any non escrow bounty is not worth to participated caused by the dev can do the shady things anytime. This has become the main concern by so many participants in the bounty sections. that's why mostly of managers are doing escrow right now.",

Go to bounty section, you see a lot of good campaign there but remember that there’s no guarantee profit in bounty, you can try to participate on signature campaign that pays in BTC, also on a project with escrow they are guaranteed.Can you tell me what hot bounty campaign is going on?, I think the bounty campaign is dead because the ICO is no more. Today potential projects they no longer use bounty campaigns as a means of marketing, it is not effective. Currently, most bounty campaigns are junk and non-potential projects, so they can't raise capital from VCs, so they force them to look for free forms of marketing.Bounty campaigns are there to serve as a promotion to the project. Even if ICO method is not being widely use today compared before, There are some new bounty project who are surviving even without VC help, A Project team who are really serious about the project will do a thing to accumulate some funds to the community to continue their development. Though I agree to you that the majority of bounty project doesn't really have a potential if you see deep through it. We all can agree that today a bounty campaign that offers reward with value is better than a bounty project that offer their own token reward that commonly don't have any value.",

To get a better campaign, you just have to be lucky as those who are good campaign when launch gets plenty participants and you won't get good payment. Those that have benefits the most from bounty are those who joined campaign not many people enroll to promote and later the campaign became successful.The good manager that launch good campaign don't give very high reward because many hunters are also following those manager to join their campaign. Just sperate your reach to as many campaign as possible and one will give you a good pay.",

      "body": "This topic was already discussed many times, try to use 'Search feature' to find out them.There are no exact ways to guarantee good bounties. But you can try analyzing the projects deeply and choose the bounties handled by trusted bounty managers only. If you find negative issues about the projects, it is a sign to avoid joining the bounties. You also don't join any bounty managed by bad bounty managers, you may never get the bounty payments. There are some bounty managers with bad reputations, kindly ignore them.In addition, to find a legit bounty or a legit signature campaign, the Service board is a recommended place : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0The Altcoin Discussion board seems a more proper place for this topic. Move this thread to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0",

      "body": "My best suggestion; don't. I agree with most people that Bounties are not a way of making money, they just give you money that they created, something that worths absolutely nothing, and they ask you to work for them and if all of us work for them for their made up money, then they would maaaaybe have a token that worths something, and we would earn.So in logic, we are the ones that made it worth something, not them, and they are paying us for what we did, when in fact we should be the ones who get it all, because it was our work that turned it into valuable thing. Otherwise all of their work prior to our bounty hunting would have worth zero anyway. So know your worth, and do not spend your time on bounties and just focus on things that actually have value, it would make you money for sure.",

But honestly, the projects in the bounty campaign are mostly junk, they can't even be listed on the exchange or will be dumped shortly after and disappear. I haven't seen any good or potential projects in the bounty board.I think the best sure way is when the reputable manager do also escrow the funds. As long as the manager and the escrow doesn't turn into a scam then you guys can expect to get your rewards as soon as the contract is over. If some of the projects can do this then why not the others right? Although there are still legit projects who can pay even without an escrow and even if it's only managed by some newbie/unreputable managers.If you are scared about the future of the tokens then don't apply bounty which pays their own token but choose the one that pays in stable coins instead or pays with top altcoins. There are lots of them nowadays.",
