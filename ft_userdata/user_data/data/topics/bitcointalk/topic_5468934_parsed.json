I tell all in the short hope you will get it.",

A piece of advise where to start and to pass through, that's really what I need rn but I'm for crytpo@100% ¬† HTML, CSS, JAVA or Javascript can help you in your Web development career (Never used PHP). I know a friend of mine who is a full time web developer and he said once you can never learn enough. It's hard, but you have to keep going. As he is leaning a bit of new things everyday.When it's crypto, this isn't as simple as web developing, it's the next level. So before going to the coding side, I would suggest you to know the basic term of crypto like what is crypto, what's a blockchain, how transactions works, what fuels the crypto, how does a wallet operates. You know? The ground level basics. Then you can start exploring different sectors of crypto.If you have a lot of time, you might be interested in reading these books below.https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paperhttps://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/https://learnmeabitcoin.com/",
