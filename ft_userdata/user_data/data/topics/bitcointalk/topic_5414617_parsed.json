The key takeaway from that thread is to take all 'advice' from so-called 'Experts' you come across on youtube, twitter, et al with a large dose of salt.Beyond that - spend a few days scanning through the various thread here in the Forum. Most often the titles will give a good hint to what they are about.",

Perhaps invest in an Asic Miner and scale from there.Mining is not profitable for most people. That's because they spend high retail prices for equipment, pay top dollar for electricity, and don't understand crypto markets.You should start out spending the least amount of money possible, and learn for fun as a hobby.Once you are experienced and knowledgeable you will know how to scale from there.Good luck!",

Of course most are also worthless or damn close to it.Thing is -- this is the Bitcoin area where the sole topic of discussion is BTC. Not the altcoin mining area where all discussion of alts belongs.",

Are there no other altcoins to mining using GPUs just because ETH went POS?This is exactly what I am thinking, the market fluctuates so much. No one is making much mining right now, I even saw news stories about mining companies going under. But it would be a great time to get a discount on mining hardware. I always wanted to mine, but the price of electricity is too much where I live, it would be very difficult to break even let alone make a profit. Plus, I got tiered rates, so using a miner makes all the electricity in the house more expensive, which must be calculated in to the cost. Good luck!",

For a start, one issue is running bfgminer...Who's instructions which are located where?Using bfgminer raises the question of what are you trying to mine with? A GPU?(if so - wrong area as GPU's are beyond useless for mining BTC but can work for some altcoins) Some very very old ASIC-based miner that requires an external controller?We don't have crystal balls to know what hardware you are using and something like that is rather vital information you need to provide...",
