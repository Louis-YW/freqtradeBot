There is nothing hard about support zone, it is just a price that a coin is not going further below, even if the coin slightly go below the price, it would rise back not long. Example is when bitcoin has been around $28000 recently which shows a very strong support at that level. The opposite is the resistant zone.",

The level where buying pressure is there and usually takes a huge volume of selling to break through, that ends up being a support level and these are usually the prices where investors have bought the coin previously. Historically there are many support levels which people have been placing buy orders at and keep them strong.Think of it as a big bunch of buy orders to negate most of the sell orders such that the price does not drop below that. Opposite to this will be the resistance level which you can now make out on your own.The use of these levels is to plan your buying point and whether you should play it safe and buy at even lower to maximize profits on the opposite side when you sell.",

This is the most simple definition I can recall for you. In other words, the name of the Support zone gives us the whole idea of giving support (help or indications) to traders to conclude beneficial signals from market behavior. In this way, traders and even holders can save more money. You demanded a chart, I will take an example of BTC pair which consists of a support zone tagged as 12,200$. sourceThese support zones are not always correct. As we all know the market is so unpredictable but so far these support and resistance zones are helping us out in many ways like when the BTC hit its ATL (All Time Low) in the previous cycle which was around $16k. This price was considered the lowest point to which BTC can go and not below it. So $16k was the support zone for BTC.You may ask now, What is Resistance? That's the opposite of the support point, Which is the point you have set on any asset or commodity from which the price will not go above and you decide accordingly to sell or buy your trades.",

We have Resistance and Support zone on the charts, it's very easy to spot them out when trading because they served as the pillars that guide one into getting clear view on when the market will have a breakout with additional pumping and dumping. Reading complex crypto related PDFs inother to get access more knowledge in the market. We have both technical and fundamental analysis in the market, it depends on the crucial path you want to anticipate.

Think of it as a safe house for the price, and it is unlikely to fall below it.So, when the price reaches the support area, the possibility that the price will decrease is small, and it is the period of the beginning of the rise again.As for the reason for naming it as a region, which is because it is impossible to determine the price with a specific number, but rather the price range of this range, the price is the support area.The current support range is from 26k to 28k.",

In most cases, when the price reaches the support level, it bounces off upwards and trades around that level.However, when the selling pressure is too much, it can break downwards.You can use a few tools and indicators to determine Resistance and support levels such as the Fibonacci Retracement, Trend lines, Fixed Range Volume Profile etcOpen up and account in tradingview. You will learn a lot about technical analysis",

Let me explain my words What is a support line or region the point which has greater Buying liquidity \"Means that on that particular point, there are huge buying Limit orders and sentiments\" Such points where we check greater buying limit orders and sentiments call it to support if the volume o that point is huge then we call it Strong Support level if the volume is low we call it weak support level and In reflection to you can call Resistance. Our prediction for the accuracy of the Support and Resistance level can be wrong or right in our analysis but Support and resistance levels are known as Strong or Weak.If still curious how and why or more just quote me I will try to cover up related things to the query.

Here is the simplified answer to your question:Support zone is the price point where investors are interested in purchasing the coin in bulk and they place orders worth millions of dollars in that price point, sometimes selling pressure can break that support zone. Resistance zone is the price point where most sellers are interested in selling the coin in bulk worth of millions of dollars and make some profit from their long positions, that zone can also break with higher buying pressure.The traders who have advanced knowledge of reading charts, and they have technical knowledge of various useful indicators can determine those support and resistance points. It's not that hard to have that skill all you need is to give proper time to trading, and learn from your mistakes.",

For example, the $25200 price in the daily chart was once a resistance zone that price hardly can't break since February but it finally breaks above resistance in March. In the next few weeks, if the correction happens that $25,200 could be the support zone which is where you might wanna buy more BTC to gain in the next spike.",

Those are what we are talking about but to be fair during bear markets support points do not matter and we crash below them fairly easily, and during bull runs the resistance doesn't matter and we go above them anytime we want as well. That is why we shouldn't really be worried about these lines anymore since in this market it doesn't really matter and we shouldn't be worrying about them at all.I hope that the best thing we can do right now would be having some sort of understanding that if the market wants to move a direction, it will move that direction ignoring everything else.",

I am sure you will have a lot of fun doing it and getting the freedom you want and quitting your current job /s.Support is just like a floor, when you jump and it holds you despite gravity on the planet. Similarly, in trading, support is a zone or an area where the price will come and bounce back up without going down further.The Opposite of that is resistance, just like your room ceiling. You can't jump and break over it, that's how it's in trading. Price reaches a certain point and drops back slowly or suddenly downwards and that area is the resistance zone.A complete guide for you to learn more about these topics: https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/Also, the price needs to be on that zone multiple time for it to be declared a support or resistance zone, not once.

Then when it broke it and tested it again it was know as support. Very common technical analysis.Problem is it doesn’t always work like in the $20K example. It failed as resistance and failed later as support. This is why you need more tools to trade such as market sentiment and perhaps some order flows.

That means if the market was to crash, it's likely the price that the price of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurency would fall to and this usually happens that way because they're lots of buy orders waiting to be filled at that particular price.To spot the support level you also have to understand the resistance level, resistance is all about the price where the market has a selling pressure from traders wanting to take profits. If Bitcoin price was to continue rising then the new support level will be $30k since that was the previous resistance before it crossed it just few days back.",

In fact, they are happy when they are able to identify it and if the candlesticks correspond with other indicators based on their trading strategy, they go for the big kill.  In simpliest form: the support zone is basically where the buyer resides and it is when the demand is increasing in the market. What do I mean by that? When the price hit the support zone, the probability of the price to bounce or to go up is really high because this is the area of the buyers. The psychology of the buyers will drastically change because they know that the price is cheap when it hit the support level. But don't get me wrong because trading is probability game so there are no sure that the price may bounce if it hit support. You should also be aware that the price is usually moving between support and resistance. The resistance is when the seller resides, it is where the supply increases. For sellers, they think that the price is now expensive and they think that it will now go down so they are selling in resistance level. Identifying support and resistance is hard when you are a beginner and it will take days or weeks for you to master plotting support and resistance levels but once you master it, you will immediately see a lot of opportunities in the market. One of the ways in order to make money in the market is by buying at the support level and selling at te resistance level. This strategy calls swin trading and you can easily make money by using the volatility of the market as you advantage.",
