If someone is not careful,Â  future trading can wreck someone's life in just few seconds, minutes, hours or days. But the chance to make more money is in future trading is higher if learned. If I should go for one, I will prefer to trade, but that does not mean I can leave gambling too because trading and gambling are different and I like the fun I derived from gambling. Some people are not gambling for money, but traders are not trading for fun.",

To be honest, if future less risky compared with gambling caused by it needs needs process to liquidate all of your money compared with gambling that will make you able to lose in seconds. I will always doing both. There's no need to pick one of them since you have the ability to do both of activities at the same time.

Futures unlike gambling. The main thing in future must be consistency. The more money you put in the future and the more profit you will get.

They're both potentially harmful, so we'll choose with the one that best suits our personality traits. Gambling is simple, but trading, particularly futures trading, is more complicated; crypto-related pdfs must be thoroughly study. Futures trading and gambling are very different, even if they both speak the same language of making a great deal of profit. I preferred trading to some kind of risky unplanned segment of gambling, and I would rather stick with one pattern than parts that keep my gains running. Futures trading is the crude oil of trading, yet it is entirely dependent on the leverages we activated throughout our deals.",

Which one do you actually find to be more easier and I believe that futures trading is also capable of giving someone life-changing money but which one do you believe is less risky than the other? I prefer to do futures trading than gambling, because I see that futures trading can be analyzed and our chances of being able to get profit from futures trading are also greater according to our analysis and skills. And if discussing both, of course futures trading is much more challenging, because we need to analyze the market and enter at the right time to avoid losses. But even so, I also gamble and think that it is just entertainment, if I can win that's good, if I lose, that's okay because I use spare money and it doesn't matter.",

Even though both have a high chance of losing money, I will choose future trading over gambling because I know that traders can sometimes make more money than gamblers can in many different games. Trading is better in my opinion than gambling even though it requires knowledge and analysis, which I think is difficult for most people to learn, but if we should try, I think future trading is better than gambling.But in my opinion, trading is far better than gambling because it has a higher potential to affect someone's life than gambling, as you can see from the money we lost when we gambled is more than we do in trading and we didn't gain from it in gambling while in trading we lost ang gain multiple of money that is been lose.",

Gambling doesn't require that much knowledge, so for sure majority will simply prefer gambling over futures trading. Unless you yourself have the tools and understanding on how trading works, then you can go either world and play with your money and see how it goes for you.So for me, easy answer is gambling, landbase or online will be a great experience. I used to play a lot on traditional based casinos but since the advent of covid-19 and everyone is playing home, then online for me now.",

I think both are risky and they can give life-changing opportunity but it requires usually time and experience and it doesn't give you all that overnight. Moreover, I think trading is a skill to learn if you want a less riskier endeavor if you know how to plan and have always stop-loss at hand. Just don't go all-in on both.",

Learning about trading is quite difficult and the comparison with activities that do not require special knowledge is unbalanced, you have to compare trading with other things that are the same or the difficulty is not much different and both can make money if you understand it.Gamblers will of course prefer to gamble but do not rule out the possibility that gamblers are also traders who use gambling activities as a way to release boredom, which will be a question of which of the two activities they engage in first.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on June 23, 2023, 05:29:06 AMWhich one do you actually find to be more easier and I believe that futures trading is also capable of giving someone life-changing money but which one do you believe is less risky than the other?

I think both of them usually are the same thing and I know many people will disagree claiming that in future trading you have more chances of winning.I would say to these persons that it is the same as both in gambling and future trading,predicting the future is involved which is not a consistent way to make money as when we gamble we win 1 time and lose 100 times thus to relate to the future predicting,we predict it right one time and we predict wrong another 100 times,not much difference in my opinion between the two except that you can easily make more people come to trading than you can make them come to gambling,meaning trading is not seen as bad as gambling.",

      "body": "I think gambling is perceived as \"an easy way out \" but whether this is met is subjective. The reason for that phrase is that gambling requires little or no training, the most of training for gambling is to know how to bet and whether what you bet is going to be successful or not depends on your luck. That is, gambling is a lucky game. On the other part to trading, I have heard people talk of professional trade or trader and if there is anything of such name professional, that means there are amateurs. It means trading is knowledge based and the height of it which is futures requires high level of training, knowledge and experience to be successful. Both gambling and futures trading are risky in their nature but if knowledge is required and not just luck it means the risk for futures trading can be reduced if proper training is adopted. Quote from: X-ray on June 23, 2023, 06:08:24 AMFutures unlike gambling. The main thing in future must be consistency. The more money you put in the future and the more profit you will get. I think this allusion will be for both gambling and futures trading because in gambling you can increase your staking power for greater profit and for two different bettors who use different staking money, they won't be rewarded with the same potential profit. However for futures trading, I would think even with smaller capital, you can be building it gradually until the capital increase.",

Well, I think that futures may also be somewhat considered as a gamble; however, generally, it is not a form of gambling. Futures trading mostly depends on the skills you have. On the other hand, most gambling games rely solely on luck.For me, it is easier to gamble than to engage in futures trading. However, we do not have good odds here compared to futures trading, since gambling is based on chance. Moreover, it is important to be reminded that there is a house edge over the player, which decreases the chance of making a profit",

Earning money consistently is more guaranteed in future trading than gambling, however the rigorous journey to becoming a successful future trader will always discourage newbies who do wanted quick money to get involve in it, future trading is the riskiest form of trading and for a trader to have an edge over the market such a trader must have undergone a thorough learning process of skills and knowledge acquisition required to become profitable trader, this is based on my own personal experience because I had once switch over to future trading and unfortunately I had a sad experience of account liquidation, however with some little knowledge a gambler can have a mixed result i.e losses and wins.",

If you ask about what is more riskier then both if you are not careful on what you are doing on both platforms.
