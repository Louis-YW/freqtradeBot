Person wey dey innocent or old school  fit translate am something else. But na the koko and matter be that. As we dey young so, na so we dey hunt for our freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of movement. As person dey mature na so him want make them allow am talk. Na so him wan contribute for every conversation whether e consine am or not. Him wan chuk mouth for any Mattias. But as person don dey grow old again, na so him go know say, there's power and wisdom in silence. When you don't talk necessarily, you save more words for the future use. And na so u go leave people inside incognita mode. E dey okay make life be like that. As for freedom of association and movement, as plenty of us dey mature na so we wan dey jump from one place to another con dey wan make plenty OGs at same time. We want make people dey hail us, make.dem sabi say we dey exist. Always trying to become relevant and get some validations or blueticks from people. But as you don dey grow, na so you go still realize say e no be anything. Na as we dey get that freedom of association, na so we dey pursue freedom of movement. Every place we wan go, we wan follow-follow and we wan dey waka, waka go different places, including places wey fit spoil our character (na that one be the illegal place wey u mention). We wan pull up with guys, we wan make dem hear us for street and na plenty reasons why youngsters dey quick-quick push themselves go early grave be that.Quote from: EluguHcman on September 24, 2023, 10:15:47 AMClearly at OP, ur family and trustees no fit save guard u where dem supposed harm u just by telling them ur whereabouts. Just as ur storyline, if the guys has told their parents (trustees) about their where to or whereabouts and they kidnapers hit them, how the family (trustees) want take give save guard response to that scenes?You talk am well, mate. Telling your family your whereabouts is not just enough. Being able to identify your boundaries as in places and periods to move around will be very helpful. Also make you try to understand the terrain wey u dey enter go really help a long way because most places wey these kind things they happen deybget signature (track records) unless on exceptional cases. So e good make we discipline ourselves well and monitor our movements as well as people around us (the passersby) and the environment at large. When you notice Surugege dance (suspicion), no body need tell you japa.Prayer na the roadblock to any evil and devil irrespective of how much them be or the number of attacks. No weapon that is fashioned against you shall prosper, and you shall confute every tongue that rises against you in judgment which also includes ill-fated attacks from enemies and frenemies. Person wey God don protect, man no fit harm am no matter how them gather. As a person you suppose get this mindset after you don exhaust all other precautionary measures because for this our country, not even the family and friends, dey secure again. And kidnappers no dey send numbers of target before them hit.To back up your prayers na to set up emergency numbers for your phone so you fit phone a friend or family when you're in danger. Also try make you know how to dial the 911 number so that you can reach out to the security deposits close to your vicinity. Some of them they work and dem fit rescue you sharply. No just underrated any options in the event it happens (God forbid) and learn how to shout and cry out loud when that could bring a solution to the situation.",

The way the world be now things dey happen well well and na most of those people wey we trust dey betray us so that is why there is need to inform people around you about your whereabouts as it will be easy to run investigation incase of any difficulties. No claim say you be big boy or big girl o, at least if you no value yourself e get people wey value and look up to you so no make them look confused because of your careless ness.Moreover, it is important to tell people around you about your activities as they might also guide you incase they sense danger.

That means assuming everyone has bitcoin and wherever they go they can take it anytime and anywhere?It's best if friendship is better not to know about finances and what is invested including social media because it can trigger someone to collect home information, names, cellphone numbers, activities from time to time and even signs of bitcoin ownership, can be from screenshots or status (threads) on social media that are shared.telling if possible to the home person before leaving for the destination and the road taken can be a solution and can use hidden cameras such as cctv on clothes, pants, rings etc. which may later be useful for searching or becoming evidence.This type of crime is quite high in other countries, although the motive is different but preventing and anticipating when it happens can make handling and searching faster. may we all be blessed friends.",

Shae una kno say, kidnappers dey work with information, so keep your Bitcoin investment from people wey you no trust make them no keep u for bush then collect your investment. Wisdom Dem say, e dey profitable to direct person.This your matter need to be taking serious because no place safe this country now ooo. Last week a friend of mine call me tall is friend was missing, which dey know were him go and him no inform any body where him dey go and e tell me say e never ty wen they had contact and then said may God guide him home, as am speaking now he came back yesterday which I dey very happy to hear the good and I didn't bother to ask about wetin do am because so many things have to kept screat because well have ears.It very important to tell your people where you are go so that if dey wan find make e dey easy for them, also warn your family members to usually keep there were about screat, this happened to me which I lost my uncle that his neighbour make arrangements with the kidnappers am, to cut the story shout my escape from the hand of the kidnappers and my uncle try to inform his people about is where about and that how the neighbour try and inform the kidnappers and they wet there to kill him.",
