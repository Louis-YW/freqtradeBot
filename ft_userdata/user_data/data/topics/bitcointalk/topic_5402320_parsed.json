  "content": "Hello! I'm looking for a Disney+ Middle East and North Africa account, I want to be able to watch its content but I don't live in those countries so unfortunately I cannot create an account since I don't have phone number for it, neither do I have a credit card from those countries. I have a VPN and everything solved out, so if anyone is able to provide me with an account that would be appreciated. Please tell me your price, I don't wanna use it for that long so a month would be fine, if I end up wanting to use it more I'll pay accordingly. Before I'm buying it if you aren't someone with any kind of reputation, I would like some kind of proof that you indeed have it since I've been scammed before.",
