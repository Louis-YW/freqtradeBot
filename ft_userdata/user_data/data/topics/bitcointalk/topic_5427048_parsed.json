Because cryptocurrency system has the power to directly challenge bank's dominance. So it's no wonder that banks do not like it in any shape or form.Warren Buffet, Jemie Dimon and many other central banks have always raised their voice against cryptocurrency and it will continue to happen! We just need to ignore such things!",

Banks do not want bitcoin to become popular and therefore they spread this negative information so people panic sell and do not adopt bitcoin.  I'm not a crypto analyst, but the year 2022 wasn't fair for people into Bitcoin due to it's constant bear market and huge attack, which banks know that too well. So to me, I see this as a strategy by banks to scared people away from Bitcoin into preferring banks with a false prediction as we journey into the new year. But moreover, it's no longer a new thing, as it's been a normal routine about banks spreading fake news about Bitcoin just to install fear into the minds of people, of which their main targets are always newbies who have little or no knowledge about Bitcoin. But despite what, Bitcoin will always prevail irrespective of the market turbulent movement.",

If they can't beat Bitcoin, they would eventually gonna join and embrace it in the future.Like in the Philippines, UnionBank instead taking the right approach to co-exist with Bitcoin instead of being against it like most of the banks.

Due to the decentralised nature of Bitcoins, no government can control Bitcoin, that is they cannot impose tax on it. This is the reason for which the government is against Bitcoins, and not making it as a legal tender. They advising all the banks to thoroughly moderate all the transactions associated with cryptocurrencies. Basically people using cryptos over bank due to the financial freedom.

Ofcourse fiat (as offered by banks) would be more used because it is simply more widely acceptable than cryptocurrencies as supported by governments. No matter how popular cryprocurrencies become, banks would still be there for people who are not interested to this technology. Why would be people not interested? Risk, complexity of chains, and such. Not all people are knowledgeable of how blockchain works and teaching them won't aid this gap especially if they are not really interested with it (such as with old people). But that's fine, as long as people of this industry are making use of this blockchain technology in accordance with their purpose, either investment or currency matters.",

This is the same list the bank likes to do, which contains surprises that may or may not happen (it includes things like Biden getting impeached). It's not exactly unfounded, since they see tech stocks being the trigger with multiple bankruptcies in the forecast (we already know the biggest ones are laying off big time). So it's not a \"wish\" as you say, neither is it a \"reality\", but a worst case scenario. And really, if that's the worst, expect a huge bounce from 5k.It's not as bad a FUD as media has made it out to be, it's really just predictions. The same team predicted a USD/CNY pact in 2019, and then Covid happened, and they predicted 2022 to be not just Covid recovery but accelerated growth in global economy too, and we know how that turned out heh.",

They see bitcoin as a threat as they couldn’t make any make any profits holding peoples coins and so, they’re automatically against it. I’ve seen numerous negative predictions and forecasts about bitcoin and it’s price. Predictions that always turn out wrong. With the number of times bitcoin has supposedly died and miraculously risen over and over, it’s no surprise there are folks who would choose to “worship” bitcoin.",

First of all, using common sense should make it clear, that if BTC were to drop even lower than now, there are quite a few very wealthy potential investors, happy to jump in waaaaay before $5k. Around the 13k mark, 11k mark 8k mark... etc.Secondly, like everyone is already stating: Oh, a bank spreading FUD about Bitcoin. What's new exactly?.  And if you already post a screenshot of some random mainstream media blah-article, at least link to the full article so everyone can get some context (if there is any).",

Bitcoin is creating an alternative to legacy banking. If bitcoin gets adopted widely, that would mean less legacy banking adoption and that means less bankers to have in payroll. They are desperately trying to secure their jobs by attacking bitcoin with the hopes of driving people away from it. Thanks to the internet, these strategies never work because people are informing each other and seeing through their scam easily.I still think though legacy banking and bitcoin can coexist together. Bitcoin is not perfect enough to replace legacy banking.",

One can be that they want to decrease its popularity, but it can also be just to ensure that people keep trusting the banks and store money there, not wanting to risk with the volatility of Bitcoin. Also, it can be done, so that the price falls down as people engage in panic selling, and banks can buy low to sell high later. While Bitcoin is in principle a competitor of banks because it doesn't require them and thus empowers people, banks don't need to oppose Bitcoin: they can try to position themselves as crypto-friendly, offer to hodl the crypto funds of their customers or offer them to invest in Bitcoin. In any case, there's no reason to believe such predictions as $5k price, regardless of who makes them.",
