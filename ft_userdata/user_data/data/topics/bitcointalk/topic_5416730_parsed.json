I don't even see binaries.When we say open source, we mean that source codes are not encrypted.No that is not what the word \"open source\" means/is supposed to be used for. Look on any website to see the correct definition. Like the website of the inventors of open-source definition, for one: https://opensource.org/docs/osdWhile I believe you when you say your code is not encrypted, this does not make it open-source (being a FOSS developer myself).Quote from: realarlong on October 12, 2022, 01:12:02 PMWe have two products, the first is payid19.com, the second is our self-hosted software.We have banned some of our members using payid19.com for cheating people.This is something that is included in our terms and that all payment gateways do.The banning part, I understand, but you should really use another term than \"self-host\" because that particular word also means something I can run on my own server. Use a word like \"in-house\" or \"enterprise\" or something like that. The way your advertisement is written, is very misleading because your payment processor is actually a proprietary product according to your own explanation.PS. Acquaint yourself with forum rules and put all your replies in one post instead of multi-posting.",

What makes your unencrypted services better than them since most of the time they're also unencrypted (but not disclosed to the public, hence closed source). I'm pretty sure you understand the differences and just use the term for marketing purpose, but keep in mind that you'll get into trouble sooner or later if one of your experienced customers find out.",
