Also price gouging companies that refuse to send things by boat because \"air is only double the cost for a quarter of the time\".The majority of flights are taken by a small number of people so it's not exactly an equal split/necessity to subsidise them compared to things like national public transport via bus or train.The US banning pow will just move it elsewhere anyway, if it even goes through - how will they convince countries that are mostly renewable/nuclear to ban it?",

They should look on which sectors that mainly use high energy and produce gas emission, don't only look on POW. They're just close their eyes when someone pointing out banking sectors are consume a lot energy.I just wondering why there's no one speak up on US congress and say if Bitcoin is more green than banking sectors?",

First of all, they can't \"ban\" proof of work, they can ban bitcoin mining in their own land but that's it, you could always move to another nation and continue there if you are a rich miner, if you spent 2+ million dollars on equipment, you could literally just go a bit north or south and continue.However, what bitcoin maximalists like me do not realize that there are other ways and we do not have to keep doing this. Yes, airline industry is spending more energy, but just because they do, we do not have to do it as well, let's get rid of it and move on. ETH will do it soon, I hope it will be an example to everyone and we could move to staking which would be a lot better.",

I wonder what percentage of the world's youth support the claim of proof of work needing to be banned? This latest move which comes only a few days after russia announced they would support international crypto transactions in the country. I wonder if proof of work bans will become recognized under international sanctions against russia. If they are passed. Rather than as a form of climate change policy.US states like texas will have a difficult time with these proposals. Texas has a booming bitcoin mining industry powered by their newly constructed wind farms. It is possible that US states like texas and florida will choose to oppose these forms of regulation. And that the entire issue will come to resemble something similar to prohibition on alcoholic beverages of eras past.",

Basic premise, according to their summary report, is the typical climate change activism garbage and debunked arguments attributing excessive environmental burdens with crypto mining and usage.Report cites that electricity usage in the U.S associated with crypto assets to be 0.9-1.7 percent. They want you to believe that an estimated <2% of electricity usage from crypto somehow create a climate change crisis and that the crypto mining industry needs to be heavily regulated.Does anyone actually buy this nonsense?",

The problem is that if they go against centralized giant miners, that may have an impact, probably short term, on the price of Bitcoin. Long term, we will find ways to outsource the mining to different countries. In fact I would say this ban of proof of work would only truly hurt Bitcoin if they banned proof-of-work mining in countries which actually offer good incentives for mining in the first place. Cheap electricity, cheap storage place, lax regulation laws and so on. But nonetheless the title of this thread is misleading. I would not say the US congress set to consider legislation for banning proof of work but rather that they are weighing their options. And I do not think they would consider redundant measures viable. Miners will find other ways and places to mine.All the US would do is deprive itself of taxes from mining operations.",

It's unfair to focus or targeting such a small industry that isn't even all bad for the environment (because it can be done with clean energy), when there are things that are obviously very bad for environment and should be limited because they can't be done in totally eco-friendly ways. But also, I agree with others that even if mining is banned in the US, it will be only a temporary issue, after which miners will relocate and resume operations.Also, since China banned mining for, allegedly, environmental reasons, why not wait and see if the ban on mining made China for environmentally friendly than it used to be before? Unfortunately, I can't find the data for 2022 and 2021, so it's a bit hard to assess for now, but it would be smart to wait and see if emissions are even reduced when mining is banned (I doubt they are).",

What will change radically for you?Let's now compare your life with no transportation, no industry no usage of fossil fuel. How long do you think the world economy will last?Yes, there are really stupid things that burn a ton more energy than PoW, I would love to see some numbers comparing how much energy GPU mining for ETH burns compared to the GPU editing clips for youtube and TikTok, but for god's sake, don't compare with stuff without which the world would collapse in a month.Those comparisons are just as stupid as the whole idea of banning crypto mining.Quote from: Lucius on September 09, 2022, 02:05:18 PMAlthough banning POW in the US would not mean the end of Bitcoin in that country, it would not be good for Bitcoin globally. The influence that country has on the rest of the world would mean that other countries would follow this example, especially the EU, where there has been a lot of talk lately.The influence will be minimal because all the countries in the EU and in east Asia that might take further steps already have high electricity prices and the number of miners here is just minimal. I was talking to some friends who are in GPU mining and they've said that even without the Ethereum change the returns are just ridiculous. If I were to mine on national grid prices I would be listing my miners now on eBay in a second. Only two countries would matter Canada and Australia, both of which have like a ton of energy that can't go anywhere.But overall yeah, IF this actually happens it would be bad.",
