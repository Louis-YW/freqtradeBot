  "content": "Good morning/evening everybody.We are a small team of software engineers, and were puzzled with a question for a while - why the decentralized casinos are not well adopted yet.So, we created a little MVP that looks promising. Want to share it with you and OF CAUSE it would be really nice to hear your feedback.It is in test now and uses testUSDC ERC-20 token. Deployed on Polygon.  Any ideas, proposals, collaboration offers ARE HEARTILY WELCOMED.The first game we deployed is roulette - it is here : roulette.truecasino.orgThe main website is here: truecasino.orgRandom number is generated using commit-and-reveal scheme. We published it here:https://medium.com/@truecasino_org/random-number-generation-in-a-high-frequency-decentralized-betting-a9b60746eaf7Please, share your opinion if we need to continue.Kind regards,Zorro (Andrey)",

I am happy if this trend continues as there are demand for it.I've read the roadmap and i have to ask what are the requirements for incentivised test participants? Is it just following the steps in your site? I am asking because you are talking about \"Qualifying participants\" and \"winning\" TrueCasino CHIPs which makes me think that there are limited number of participants and they are chosen somehow.",

It will last for 1 month, before the contracts audit.Since there is quite an amount in the winning pool, we want the participants to make some preparations, like to retweet the post. Number of participants is not limited.How to choose the winner? Since we are in blockchain space - of course via smart contract. The details will follow.",

The link to the casino will be through metamask? They could do very good things if they consider it that way, have something different.",

You know people don't want wait too long if they already bored playing rouletteThank you janggernaut ,FUN means fun. It is not a token or currency. We think it is nice when users can see the interface before they connect a wallet.We are in a test phase now. If you connect a wallet and mint some test USDT tokens in Wallet dialog you would be able to buy CHIP. And CHIP - yes, it is our currency that is equal one stable coin.We promise to be up and running in April 2023 in production with at least 4 games.",

If you loose the bet then that sound is like he was shot in the chest and killed.   I wish I could show myself laughing right now, you guys would start chain reaction of laughing for sure. That is really nuts. I saw the settings, I know there are controls but without decent music there is no fun in the game. Also, its odd that when I bet third time, though my chips were on the right number it stated I did not won anything? Was it just preview or real casino link. Someone verify this by loosing the chips. Hope so you will stand out good in the coming days.",
