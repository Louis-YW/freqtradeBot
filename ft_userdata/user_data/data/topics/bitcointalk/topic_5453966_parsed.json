      "body": "For me it is going to be mostly about being comfortable and not styles. We must take care of our feet and protect them for when we get older and we can stay healthy and mobile. It is hard to find a perfect fit for our feet. But I am going to say it is affordable for me to use Nike flex control sneakers. It really makes my feet feel comfortable if I have them. Adidas racer is a other good sneaker I can wear for comfort.",
