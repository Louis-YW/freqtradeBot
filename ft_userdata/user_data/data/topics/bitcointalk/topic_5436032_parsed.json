At least, that's what they thought was happening  when they noticed intrusions on their infrastructures, Bitzlato's admins were posting: \"We are being hacked, they are taking money from us\"This times, the hackers are in reality the police.  France; Spain, The Netherlands, Portugal, America, Interpol... All togetherThis p2p custodial crypto exchange was used as a money laundering scheme, crypto tumbler, illicits funds etc, for 5% in fees. Most of the funds were coming from Hydra Market by the way ($700 mln), and more than 4 billion euros would have passed through it since 2018.The owner knew it and said it himself \"they are all crooks\" and he was glad to not apply any KYC.Glad, until arrested in The US...https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-bitzlato-cryptocurrency-exchange-charged-unlicensed-moneyhttps://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-treasury-dept-says-has-identified-bitzlato-ltd-money-laundering-concern-2023-01-18/",

They are starting to target p2p trading websites, and funny thing is that CZ and Binance are the main snitches who helped identify and locate Bizlato owner and seize funds from them.Binance is now officially working as government agents and I wouldn't trust them with anything, especially if you are holding coins there or you have their cards... consider everything is directly reported to all governments.I never used Bizlato because they kept low profile and I see all their domains have been seized by authorities, but for people who are interested how Bitzlato looked before, you can check out their archived pages:https://web.archive.org/web/20230106055055/https://bitzlato.com/",

Since then, the company runs and develops mining equipment, data centers, and even provides client mining services in several countries.In 2016, Bitzlato branched further into online crypto services by launching an affordable, safe, and secure Bitcoin P2P exchange service on a popular messaging service Telegram - a mobile BTC banker @BTC_CHANGE_BOT.As the usage of the service grew, the Bitzlato team launched more Telegram exchange bots, including the ones for buying and selling Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). As a result, it became the second-best P2P exchange in Russia in terms of the trading volume.In 2018, Bitzlato launched yet another new service - a web version of already existing P2P exchangers along with a cryptocurrency exchange. Besides, the exchange went through a rebranding and changed its name from ChangeBot into Bitzlato. Since then, all of the exchange’s services are interconnected, meaning that you can make use of all of them via a single user account.https://cryptonews.com/reviews/bitzlato/",

      "body": "Bitzlato isn't a very popular crypto exchange, but it looks like they were comfortable with being unpopular so they can do all sorts of illegal deals with scammers from the hydra market and other places, the news says the owner knew about it all, that means the exchange was so comfortable helping scammers move their funds, while they make their own percentage from it.QuoteBitzlato has marketed itself as requiring minimal identification from its users, specifying that “neither selfies nor passports [are] required.” On occasions when Bitzlato did direct users to submit identifying information, it repeatedly allowed them to provide information belonging to “straw man” registrants.A centralized exchange with deficient KYC system is surely a scam exchange, KYC isn't something that true bitcoiners like, that's why crypto people are advised to use decentralized exchanges if they don't want to do KYC, but if you use a centralized exchange you have to pass a strong KYC process, and if they allow you easily cheat the process, that should tell you they are a scam exchange.This was Bitzlato's shady dealings, every centralized exchange has their own skeleton to hide that may one day bring problems for them. Think of people who can leave their funds in an exchange like Bitzlato, even if they were not caught by the authorities, they would have still caused people to lose their money through another event. This is just another event to repeat the warning that people should not leave their funds on an exchange, and they should find out deep things about the exchanges they use.",

Was a really a case of defiance against the state and or just unlimited greed hidden behind claims of freedom?",

There is nothing concerning about the takedown of this exchange. However, as I mentioned in another thread, what should be concerning is much of the transactions of Bitzlato has been with the darknet marketplace Hydra, there are also transactions with a Russian ponzi scheme and with Binance which might imply that the exchange is being used as a part of a moneylaundering scheme. News of a crackdown on Binance would certainly cause another big dump.Approximately two-thirds of Bitzlato’s top receiving and sending counterparties are associated with darknet markets or scams. For example, Bitzlato’s top three receiving counterparties, by total amount of BTC received between May 2018 and September 2022 were: (1) Binance, a VASP; (2) the Russia-connected darknet market Hydra; and (3) the alleged Russia-based Ponzi scheme “TheFiniko.”Source https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf",

As it was not a scam company, neither it was a money laundering company. The charges that were brought against me — not having proper license to operate in the US. Not money laundering charges. It would be very easy to find out if you read the court documents and not in the controlled media resources that followed the direction of the former US administration. Now since the US government has shifted its direction in regards to crypto next 4 years will be very interesting. Unfortunately, I am just an entrepreneur and don’t have the power and resources the governments have to fight them in media battle. I have shared my story on my website Legkodymov.com (that contains the legal documents of my case, as legal documents is the first and only source of truthful information) and well as in this article (it’s in Russian but can easily be autotraslated). https://habr.com/ru/articles/853162/",
