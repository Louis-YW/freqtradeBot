  "content": "During the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, a new billionaire was minted every 30 hours, according to a new report by Oxfam International. The report, called “Profiting from Pain”, highlights how the pandemic rapidly widened the gap between the world’s richest and poorest - with 573 of the world’s richest people becoming billionaires during that time.Meanwhile, the pandemic has created new pharmaceutical billionaires, profiting from the monopolies their companies hold over vaccines, treatments, tests, and personal protective equipment, the report said. “As billionaires gather in Davos, Switzerland, in person for the first time in over two years, they have a lot to celebrate. During the COVID-19 pandemic their mountain of wealth has reached unprecedented and dizzying heights. The pandemic – full of sorrow and disruption for most of humanity – has been one of the best times in recorded history for the billionaire class,” read the report.The chart unveils four key points:https://blogs.imf.org/2021/11/09/the-unequal-covid-saving-and-wealth-surge/-The overall increase in net wealth, in percent of disposable income, was considerably larger during the pandemic (between the end of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021) than during normal times (between the end of 2014 and end of 2019).-It was driven mainly by valuation changes (due to booming equity and housing prices) as well as, to some extent, by the “COVID saving surge” (with a jump in “other assets,” including bank deposits).-This overall increase in net wealth was also unevenly distributed, with much of it accruing to people at the top of the distribution. Indeed, the equity price boom mostly benefitted the rich, while lockdowns more heavily affected spending on dining and travel, which make a larger part of wealthier households’ consumption habits. Additionally, government support, in the form of direct stimulus or support to firms, also benefitted the saving of wealthier households compared to poorer households that were more likely to spend the extra cash.-At the same time, the distribution of wealth across groups did not change much, as the increases in net wealth were relatively in line with the pre-pandemic shares in the wealth distribution.In 2022, it is expected that millions of people with fall into extreme poverty every 33 hours. According to the report, 263 million people are predicted to fall into extreme poverty this year, citing the cost of living crisis as one of the many driving factors. While the billionaires who control these assets are set to profit even more, Oxfam warns hundreds of millions could be priced out of staying alive.Oxfam International’s investigations also concluded that 2,668 billionaires own $12.7 trillion (€11.91 trillion) of the planet’s wealth, with the world’s 10 richest men owning more than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The report highlighted key industries which are thriving throughout the cost of living crisis. For instance, whilst global food prices have spiralled 33.6 per cent in the last year, global food giant Cargill has increased their wealth by $14.4 billion (€13.49 billion), 65 per cent since 2020.https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/05/25/covid-created-a-new-billionaire-every-30-hours-while-many-face-extreme-poverty-report-says",

Countries where stimulus packages was distributed to their citizens and business in a bid to assist are having the economic effects of COVID a lot lesser than countries where no stimulus packages where sent. The poor who were managing the little they had before the virus in such countries like mine are now faced with the reality of the very high standard of living and the rich who previously had establishments like the food industry and Real Estate are taking a full swipe at the situation and are getting richer. So yes, Bad governance and some government's inability to provide assistance amidst the rising cost of living has aided COVID in widening the gap between the rich and the poor.",

      "body": "This is very unfortunate. It does seem that bad events affect people with fewer resources more heavily than others, but it's another thing when someone is actually profiting from a situation that causes lots of suffering to others. I'm a social democrat, and I think that there should either be high taxes or, rather, other forms of contributing to society and giving those in most unfortunate circumstances a lift with one's fortune. Some people are so rich that neither they nor their children or close relatives will use up the wealth in their lifetimes. So, in fact, if they gave a very significant part of it away to something that matters (for example, a private high-quality university in a developing country with financial aid for bright students, building hospitals or organizing training for doctors where they are heavily needed, donating to highly reputable charities), and they could make the world a better place, which actually is likely to also give them joy because of giving meaning to their lives. It's really sad that many people don't see it this way, and don't feel inclined to bring about meaningful change instead of stacking up the wealth they'll never use. I think that the world, with strong coordinated efforts, could at least ensure people don't die from hunger. I hope at some point, we'll get there.",

If you're living paycheck to paycheck, or are barely able to add to your savings every month on a regular salaried job, the best you might be hoping for is home ownership which is fully paid off by retirement to become your nest egg. However once you reach a certain level of wealth, the money they hold on assets like company stocks will pay them out a regular dividend (i.e. a share of company profits) which is often automatically reinvested or can be used to sustain a lifestyle without ever breaking that initial capital. Their money buys further income while most people will never have that level of freedom.",

A lot of people already suffers from the effect of these world events, covid-19, Russia - Ukraine war and there goes the high price of oil which results to a high inflation rate.I guess it will never change the fact that the rich will be richer and the poor gets poorer. We have to make our own way of survival from these catastrophies that's happening and making the lives of most harder.We say that we don't have to rely on the government but they also have to take action which is necessary for the majority to at least ease the burden of most people that are living under the poverty line.",

I don't think it was pandemic-specific, although there are some contributing factors of COVID such as those mentioned.When you have a lot of money, it is easier to keep getting richer because you can consume a lot and have enough left over to keep investing. Someone with a medium or low income can make the effort to save and invest but most of the spending is consumption. If you invest a little bit, maybe tomorrow you will be better off financially but you won't have a lot of money. On the other hand, the very rich can invest a lot, and the ball gets bigger and bigger.",

It's like there was a pause button (heck it was even decreasing imo) for the poor while the rich had a fast-forward button.
