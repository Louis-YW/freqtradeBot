  "content": "This kind of thing happens all over the place... where police and other people save unborn babies at times... even when the mother is still alive. So, now we see how evil the medical is, that they would promote abortions - baby killing - for profit, and as an excuse say that they are protecting the mother from the harm of quack abortions.Police action proves unborn babies are alive and worth protectingQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-08-police-prove-unborn-babies-alive-worth-protecting.html#A pregnant mother was shot dead in Philadelphia the other day. And thanks to police officers who quickly arrived on the scene, her unborn baby – yes, baby, not fetus – was able to be saved.Proving once again that an unborn child is, in fact, a child and not just a clump of cells, the saving of this precious life deserves attention as it completely destroys the false narrative of the abortion cultists.According to reports, the mother, 19-year-old Matayah Haynes of Camden, N.J., was 34 weeks pregnant when she was shot in the head in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philly.Police officers rushed her baby to Temple University Hospital after realizing that it was still alive, even without its mother, said the Philadelphia Police Department in a statement.At the time, the baby was in critical condition but stable, officers confirmed.The shooting happened in the early morning hours around 1 a.m. The shooter is believed to have been a man driving a black or blue Chevrolet Camaro or Dodge Charger.A pregnant woman is TWO people, not just oneFurther details about the case are irrelevant for the purposes of this article, other than to say that a pregnant woman – and yes, only a real biological woman can get pregnant – is not just one person but two....",

      "body": "Is a fetus a child the day before it is born? How about the hour before it is born? It is a child all the way back to conception, because nobody has the ability or right to truly determine the dividing line between fetus (or other) and child. Actually, fetus is simply a stage in a person's life.When a woman allows herself to be in a position of becoming pregnant, her body is no longer hers. She has accepted a sacred trust for the baby she bears. The man is the grantor. The woman is the trustee. The child is the beneficiary. And as long as the woman understands this, she will easily receive help from God to bear the child; this help is built into nature, and is there for believers and unbelievers alike... for the benefit of the child.There are a lot of things that are wrong with this world, because of freedom and because of sin. Someone has said: \"Might makes right.\" That's not true. Might or strength only makes what happens. Often it is very wrong. Pregnancy only makes the woman a trustee of the property being built inside her to be given to the child/beneficiary. Her body is no longer her own for 9 months.This subject has been hashed around for a long time. Voluntary abortion, when there are no extenuating circumstances, is first degree murder, no matter what the laws or the courts say.",

But there are almost countless numbers of women, young and old, who are out there enticing guys all over the place to have sex with them. Stop this, so that they aren't enticed later to have an abortion, and maybe kill their own child.",

To say that it is not a person is a personal judgment call. Err on the side of safety for a person until we find out for a fact that it is not a person.Note that, to find this out, we would have to contact God and get the answer as to when He injected the soul into that body. To do this, we only need look at the Bible to see that way back at the beginning, God:1. commanded that people multiply on the earth;2. set up laws that made killing a person in the tummy of a pregnant woman to be murder.The soul is there from conception. Like the body, it may not be developed fully. But it is there in pattern form, at least; abortion is murder.",

But bravo to those police men for saving the life of the 35 weeks old baby in the womb (which is approximately 8months some weeks. so because of this issue i had to make some research about when does a fetus in the womb begins and this is what i got.QuoteWhat is a fetus?The fetal stage begins at 10 weeks from the last period and lasts until birth (2). By the beginning of this stage, all the major organ systems have formed, but are immature (2). From this point on, the fetus will primarily be growing and tissues will be maturing. There is no exact timing of fetal “viability” (or ability to survive outside the uterus), but a fetus that is at least 24 weeks may be viable if given intensive care after birth (2). Before 30 weeks gestational age, a fetus is less likely to survive than an older fetus because their lungs and brains are immature (2).Major milestones during the fetal stage (2):Weeks 10-13: the fetus is undergoing rapid growth, kidneys begin producing urineWeeks 14-17: external genitalia has formed, coordinated limb movements, bones are hardening, eye movement beginsWeeks 18-21: eyebrows and head hair are visible, formation of the fetal uterus and vaginaWeeks 22-26: the fetus is gaining weight, fingernails are presentWeeks 27-30: lungs and brain are developed to the point that the fetus would likely survive if born at this point and given intensive care; eyelids are open, toenails are visible, the fetus is putting on fatwhich means that a baby from 30weeks old pregnancy can survive if born.. and the lady shot dead had 35weeks old pregnancy sourcehttps://helloclue.com/articles/pregnancy-birth-and-postpartum/what-is-the-difference-between-an-embryo-a-fetus-and-a-baby#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20exact%20timing,brains%20are%20immature%20(2).",

I disagree with you, but understand how you feel that way. However...If you take a container of saltwater, stick a couple of electrodes in it, and run an electric current through the saltwater, you get hydrolysis. Do it the same way every time, and you get the same results every time. But nobody really knows what the water, the salt, the electrodes, and the electricity really are basically.There are theories about what they are. And there are theories about why they do what they do. And some of the theories might be very accurate. But they are still theories... science theories, if you will.When anyone believes that a science theory is correct, he has a religion going for himself in that theory... because he doesn't really know it. It's still a theory, a strong educated guess. So we see that ultimately science is based on religion of what people believe, because nobody knows enough about the basics of everything to know what's really going on in science.Further. The various religions all take lots of science for granted in how they are formed, in what makes up the religion. God created the Heavens and the Earth. Lots of science in that.Quote from: Cnut237 on June 14, 2022, 08:39:03 AMQuote from: BADecker on June 13, 2022, 04:41:24 PMwe only need look at the Bible to see that way back at the beginning, God:1. commanded that people multiply on the earth;2. set up laws that made killing a person in the tummy of a pregnant woman to be murder.Back in the beginning, though, didn't God also endorse mass murder, rape and general mayhem? The OT is full of that stuff. I don't think this guy should be held up as a role model for ethical behaviour.This would take a big explanation to do it right. To say it simply, God doesn't endorse \"mass murder, rape and general mayhem.\" He allows it, because mankind have made it part of their lives, and God is using that stuff to save mankind from their own destruction.We don't know how the final destruction of the universe will come about. Our science has nothing more than theories about that. In fact, science is so weak that scientists can barely find evidence of what the soul really is, and how it might remain alive after the life of the body has been terminated.",

So we see that ultimately science is based on religion of what people believe, because nobody knows enough about the basics of everything to know what's really going on in science.Science isn't religion. Consider science to be a synonym for reason and logic.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_methodThe scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century (with notable practitioners in previous centuries). It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings.Compare this with religion, which is basically: 'Hey guys, there's this book that some unknown people wrote a couple of thousand years ago, let's believe this instead of facts and stuff!'Quote from: BADecker on June 14, 2022, 02:39:46 PMnobody really knows what the water, the salt, the electrodes, and the electricity really are basically.Science has a very detailed understanding of water, look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaterWhereas religion thinks that water is just wet stuff that you can drink, or if you're one particular special guy, you can sometimes walk on.Quote from: BADecker on June 14, 2022, 02:39:46 PMGod created the Heavens and the Earth.
