So far I've been buying bitcoin in the range from ~$2k up until ~$50k and will most likely keep buying once bitcoin goes over $100k. DCA ftw.",

I think you are only afraid now because bitcoin pump to a recent high but don't worry, if $34k becomes a strong support, we can see an upside move before the end of the month because there is a monthly candle that bitcoin must close and if indeed ETF motion is still positive, it will stay above that price. So you have nothing to fear if you are holding but if you are short term trader take your profit and re-examine the market again.You can also buy at this 34k and use a trailing stop loss or just use stop loss. It will help you minimize the lost, that's why you are a trader, you should use it for proper risk management.",

If you're holding for the long term, then the current market hype doesn't matter much. What we're witnessing might just be a temporary market frenzy, and prices could go up or down. No one can guarantee where the price will go, but if you're holding for the long haul, you should be fine.You bought at 31k, and if you look at it now, that's already an instant profit. But since you're thinking of buying more at a higher price, I assume you're in it for the long term. I'm pretty sure that when the bull run comes, you'll likely enjoy even more profit if you intend to sell. However, as I mentioned, make sure you have a clear goal in mind.",

It is true that you pay a higher price for less BTC, but that problem stems from the fact that you are always waiting for some kind of sign, and how long have you been given the opportunity to invest below $30k, and even below $20k? Bear market periods are the best for accumulation, and the same thing has been repeated with some minor variations for at least ten years.Quote from: lunder0592 on October 24, 2023, 11:29:34 AM...but is 35k te expensive to buy bitcoin?The same question was asked when the price of BTC was $1000 and $10 000, and your question is actually a good answer - let's put it this way, anything under $100 000 is cheap",

Although the price currently is still at the point where one can buy too but it would be nice you buy with your spare cash as the market is volatile. If you plan holding for a long time then you can buy as profit is guaranteed for a long time holder wereas halving is just six months from now you could be at advantage making more profit.

But if they delay it then we might see some consolidation at the current price tag and if they go against it then we might see BTC at 29k maybe (Hard guess).Overall, if you are planning to hold for longer period of time like the next ATH then it does not matter if you buy at 35k or not because you have to increase your number of satoshies.",

Mind you that some of these people who have started asking questions about Bitcoin, would sell in the next correction period, only to return when the next pump happens, rinse and repeat stuff.OP, i guess you are not buying one Bitcoin, so you prolly should forget about what the price of one Bitcoin is and accumulate what you can afford to lose. Buying at intervals irrespective of the price is what we call DCA, and if you are a newbie with limited understanding, using that srategy would save you the headache of trying to time the market.",

We might all be speculating a correction too and the price to fall below $30k but that is not certain, so it will be a very huge risk trying to wait for a fall now which might not come soon considering how unpredictable bitcoin. The OP seems to be on a right part of accumulating at varying price which seems he is using the DCA method, I would advise he continues doing that gradually and be stashing more satoshi.

It is expected that the bitcoin price might exceed its ATH sometime next year, giving you the opportunity to make profit. But these forecasts are not certain so the best option is to have a long-term plan. A long-term plan is necessary because the price might not get to your target which will necessitate longer hodling. I will also suggest that you start preparing for the bull run early using DCA because it will be cheaper and less risky.     Quote from: Faisal2202 on October 24, 2023, 01:31:57 PMIf you had bought at the ranges of 26k, 27k, 30k, and 31k then you must be making some profit now.

How long do you plan for your investment? This question is important because an investment plan like 4 years or 6 years will be easily with investment plan in 1 or 2 years. Because Bitcoin historically has its cycle last 4 years for each. If you only can hold your coins in 2 years, that will be good if 2 years are bullish but will be nightmare if 2 years are bearish.You can understand it better with https://dcabtc.com/Choose investment period: 2 or 4 years and when you start. You can try with two different starts, one in start of bear market and one with start of bull market.You can use another website with ROI chart for Bitcoin with time frame from 1 month to 10 years.",

Today the price looks expensive because there's a rise that's now making the rounds but tomorrow (next 1year) this same price will now be looking a lower amount because by then it might be 2x higher than what it is today. If you have a plan of hodling long then this price at $35 isn't  anything near expensive when  correlated with bitcoin market cap.Have you stop to consider how you felt when you bought at 26k/27k/30k and now the price has bounced up to 35k doesn't that says much that in the coming month's we're going to see a more higher price than this? Keep DCAing mate the only time bitcoin would be said to be expensive is when it gets to it's market cap.",

We might all be speculating a correction too and the price to fall below $30k but that is not certain, so it will be a very huge risk trying to wait for a fall now which might not come soon considering how unpredictable bitcoin. Exactly, so the best practice for him might be to divide the capital into parts, and only invest some part of it in BTC at the current rate, and when BTC will come a little down, then invest another part. Or set buy limit orders, I don't know why, but I have a strong feeling that BTC will come back to 32k (Note* Do not trade on feelings). Which does not make a big difference if you have a small capital to invest but vice versa.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 24, 2023, 01:57:41 PMThe OP seems to be on a right part of accumulating at varying price which seems he is using the DCA method, I would advise he continues doing that gradually and be stashing more satoshi. Should the price falls, the DCA done will cover the loses, should the price increases the DCA will still maximizes the profit. I can not agree more with you, that's the benefit of doing DCA, buying at $35k might be an expensive deal but DCA will make it cheap one. Because in the end, a holder wants to increase the number of satoshis he/he holding onto. And if Op will buy at $35k the satoshies will increase. But OP did not make it clear that, if he is planning to do DCA or Lump-Sum, because he just said he wanted to buy more but to him, $35k is an expensive price tag. I will just say, divide the capital, do DCA with that, try to remain more active, because this week is full of surprises.",

It's not really that you can see the price more than the price now.Then if your goal is to invest long term why not buy while the price is still half of the previous ATH?

However, I think you should allow it retrace and make a little correction before you buy. With that, you will be  buying at discounted rate. It has to drop to pick momentum again, given the way it skyrocketed yesterday and today. I expect price correction to take it to $30k to $31k.",

Maybe you missed that part. I suggest if he had money, and wanted to do Lump-sum then he should not do that because in his reply he did not mention that either he wanted to hold those BTC and buy at the current price of $35k by doing DCA or Lump sum. If you really think if OP wants to book profit in 2024 or 2025, maybe in the upcoming Bull run, then why are you saying buying at $40k is not right because IMHO, BTC is going to cross $40k and if the OP or anyone will buy A $40k then by holding, they are not going to make lose.
