You don't need the password. Just try restoring the wallet instead of using the already existing wallet file.",

I hope it is not that because it is a risky practice.If he simply means that he can't remember the password he has set in an app like Ledger Live, the seeds should be enough for him, as Royse777 says.",

      "body": "If you generated a wallet already, with seed phrase, keys and addresses, you ought to backup your seed phrase offline, like on paper. Did you backup the seed phrase offline like that?If you do not have the backup but depending to first access the wallet with the password to get your seed phrase, you can not be able to do that.But if the password is short, or you remember some characters and only remains just like 2 or 3 characters that you have forgotten, you can use Btcrecover:",

      "body": "5 characters will be fairly easily brute forcible using btcrecover.First of all, tell us what it is exactly are you trying to brute force? It sounds like it is a passphrase extension to a seed phrase?Secondly, do you know an address from this wallet, preferably the first one? If you do, it will be much easier to brute force, but it is still possible if you don't by using an address database.btcrecover has some fairly straightforward instructions on the website, but I'm happy to guide you through setting it up if you get stuck.",

Obviously your values will vary depending on your hardware. A very quick test shows I can get a little under this out of the box, so could probably get quite a bit over this with a little optimization.Still, assuming 5 random characters from the set of lower case, upper case, and numbers, 10k attempts per second would only take a little over a day to exhaust the search space. Add in symbols and use the full 95 character ASCII set then you are still only looking at 9 days to perform a complete search, so 4.5 days on average to crack the passphrase.",
