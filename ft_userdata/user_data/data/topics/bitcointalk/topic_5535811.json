      "body": "A beautiful initiative. I think I came across your pre launched thread some time ago. Okay a little observationHaven't checked everything I tried the survey on Been your own Bank And I'm curious what trading has to do with holding? And I scrolled through your list well on the B section I saw some BIP and was surprised that BIP 38 wasn't there but there was BIP 65(less popular in my opinion). Well I know it's going to grow bigger. So Kudos. Will check it out later.",

      "body": "I like the design overall, and the idea, too. But to me, it all looks a little too big on a Full HD laptop at 100% size. Also, I believe adding a search button somewhere convenient (right before the letters start, for instance) would still be useful for those who don't want to do Ctrl F or scroll through.It will become even more relevant when there are more and more words added (which, I presume, is what will happen?).And a bit more work on Related Terms would be nice (SegWit for Bitcoin Cash page, for example). Or 'Wikification' approach, where you make hyperlinks for keywords in the text which have their own Glossary pages.",

Take a look and let me know your thoughts – suggestions for additions or improvements are appreciated! Nice initiative OP , it's really nice to have something like this but from my viewpoint it seems a little too big on first hand display. I think you should make the tabs a little smaller. Also I glanced through most of them and let's just say I like the B section the most. Probably because I like technical stuff or it just packs more interesting stuff.Anyways as for other sections or keywords you should consider adding more words just to spice things up and ensure almost any important term searched there returns a result.",

I have to scroll back to take me back to the homepage.Overall, this is good. I can recommend this to newbies to help them understand more about Bitcoin and other terminology related to cryptocurrency.",
