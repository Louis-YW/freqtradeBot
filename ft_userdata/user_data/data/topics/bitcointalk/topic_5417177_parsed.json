Just that it is still very much worth it to post this.More than 30% of Canadians plan to purchase crypto by 2024, says OSC headSome people said a period of time will shock people when the price of bitcoin will no more rise using the 4 years cycle. Some even said that bitcoin market is matured already that this bull run trends may not become possible by 2024. But the good news is, you should still believe in bitcoin, it will not disappoint you in the next cycle.According to Ontario Securities Commission head, the chief executive officer, Grant Vingoe, he said that they know from their research that 30% of Canadians are willing to invest in crypto asset by 2024.Quote“We know from our own research (being published later this month) that more than 30 per cent of Canadians plan to buy crypto assets in the next year [...] It is a challenge to bar non-compliant firms from offering services in Canada. With a limited budget and finite Enforcement staff to cover our entire capital markets, there is only so much we can do. But we are making progress.”I believe if this kind of research is conducted in many other countries, more people will want to invest in crypto by 2024. And what should we expect by that time and 2025? Bull run.",

There would be some bull and bear market before 2024. But I am only saying that time investment would likely be huge which will drive bitcoin to all-time-high.Quote from: mk4 on October 15, 2022, 07:36:37 AMEven if this data is totally accurate, who's to say that they wouldn't change their mind?

Most of them panic sold.If it turns out as planned, there won't be bull market by early 2024. Even if bull market started it, it won't yet be significant. It would be a good time to hold if invested early before halving. I so much believe in 2024 halving to drive bitcoin to all-time-high.",

Most of surveys have low quality so that they won't accurately represent for a bigger size or population in society.Moreover, from plans to real activities are a long journey with uncountable challenge. People can or can not finish their plans and they can stop their plans any time. Assume this survey is correct, it is a good news for cryptocurrency adoption but we must wait to see real changes in future.More realistically, maybe many of us plan to buy a house but very a few of use actually buy a house. This example will wake you up from the survey result.",

Though I don't think the article specified a Bitcoin buy? I reckon they'd only ever buy Bitcoin once the bull run is happening (or has already happened) as we've all seen with newbie investors, it wouldn't be odd for them to invest in some random shitcoin and lose their money in the process imo.

In the end, they don't even claim that these people will invest in Bitcoin, but in crypto - which means that they will invest in useless projects that promise big profits, and in the end 9 out of 10 such projects fail.",
