This would bring me to a 40% profit for the year in which case i'd just take the cash and slap into the s&p500 and probably end the year at a 50% profit which is kinda insane",

      "body": "Your decision, if you're too satisfied with that 40% gain then sell it. No one forces you to sell or wait and hold. We've got our own satisfaction in terms of profit and whether it's less or more, profit is profit.Since you've got a strategy ready to be deployed, just do what you think suits your investment style and if that technique will be for your portfolio's betterment then do what's necessary.Also, don't forget the forum rules about bumping a thread because you only bump a thread once per 24 hours and your original post isn't even yet passed on 24 hours so, no need to bump.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM13. Bumps, \"updates\" are limited to once per 24 hours per thread. Bumping multiple threads at the same time is allowed if it's not annoying. [2][e]",
