If you closed a trade at a 10 pip loss and your entire wallet balance disappeared, it is possible that there was an error or issue with the trading platform or provider you are using. I would recommend checking your account and transaction history carefully to see if there are any other transactions that might explain the missing funds.",

Let me here from youAre you trading with Forex? Pips is for Forex trading if I am not wrong.With Bitcoin, you will gain best profit by holding it a few years and it is better if those years are between two halvings. If you can hold your bitcoin through two continuous bull runs, you will have no risk to get loss if history won't change itself.Trading is worse than investing and holding. Spot trading is bad. Margin and Future trading are worse so is Forex trading.",

      "body": "Anyway, looking at the trading history will answer that.I'm reminded of \"reduced only\" advanced orders in futures trading which are inactive by default, so my question is do you close the position against the previous order with a larger amount to reduce the rest of your wallet balance?",

Forex dealing with pips and lotsize while crypto does deals with profits and leverages. The trader might have missed out on one essential setups using his broker because there's limitless errors that occured daily, even the slightest mistakes counts in trading. One need to be confident and confirmed proper entries before taking on the market. Trading is unpredictable it can either go according to plan or go the other way round, scattering all plans and hitting SL.",

Let me here from youIt is not possible for a 10 pip move against you to take your entire wallet balance of $1000. If you are losing money on a trade, it is likely because you were using leverage, which multiplies the size of your trade and the potential losses associated with it. It is important to ensure you understand the risks associated with leverage before trading.kindly tell us how much leverage you used in that trade",

Let me here from youErrors made can not be reversed but they can be corrected in case of next time. However checking from your end, you might have open the trade with hugh lotsize, like 10.0 lotsize. $1000 is a standard capital for trade setups and making profits is all trader's priority in the market. There's every tendency for a faulty setups in the exchange, before using any trading exchange, terms and conditions should be taken good note of. One never knows the basic functions charges of these exchange, there are many faulty system out there, and we need to be extremely careful not to fall victims for them.",
