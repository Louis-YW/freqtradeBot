      "body": "As far as I can see, you do have set the proper datadir and conf parameters (pointing to your external drive). The problem seems to be your cookie file. It tries to read the .cookie.tmp from the default root directory, and not from your pointed external datadir. It's unable to open it and so it shuts down. Do you include the cookie location somewhere in the configuration file? Try backing that cookie file up, and delete it. Restart Core afterwards.",

Why are you doing that? It's possible that the process just can't write there or the directory /root/bitcoin-core/.bitcoin doesn't exist.Quoterpccookiefile=\"/root/bitcoin-core/.bitcoin/.cookie\"I'd remove this altogether. Bitcoin Core will save the cookie in the data directory, which for all intents and purposes is where it should live.Also do consider sharing the command-line and / or service file that you use to run Bitcoin Core.",
