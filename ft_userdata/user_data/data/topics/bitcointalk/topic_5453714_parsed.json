Here he talks about how his house was robbed, but the idiot robber just passed by his Pc which had a piece of paper sitting next to it that said “public and private keys” right on it lol. He laughs at what morons they were. Reminds me of the time my car was robbed of about $10 in change but they left my $600 radar detector and $2000 dvd player just sitting there lol.

      "body": "Lol, this is actually what happened to unsmart thief's; they were focused on the physical cash, not knowing they could have gained more from just stealing the laptop, or even having an idea of what crypto currency is, and that private key is just like someone's bank access. They could have gone for it and even asked for system access to help them move out the coin before even leaving the house.This is really funny, but Mr. Beast making this public could actually draw more attention to him, like people could actually target him for real this time knowing that he is a crypto holder and how he makes mockery of the robbers who chose to steal a few bucks over a crypto private key, which could have given them thousands.",

This was years ag ago when bitcoin was not as popular as it is now, I’m sure robbers wouldn’t make that kind of mistake again It’s a very stupid way to store one’s seed phrase, I believe he said he stored his seed phrase on his desktop screen not a piece of paper.",

Unfortunately, the robber has no knowledge about private keys but I think the time will come Bitcoin becomes popular and well-known all people will know how Bitcoin will work including robbers, and there will be no moron robbers at all. This is a lesson to learn, never save or store your private on your laptop or anywhere else that is obviously easy to steal.",

I'm not exactly sure that's the takeaway message from what happened to Mr. Beast.  Maybe if the robber had actually noticed and stolen that bitcoin it would, but this is like the opposite of that.That's not to say that if you own bitcoin you should keep everything locked up tight as if you had stacks of cash in your home--you absolutely should, but the lesson I learned from this is that the typical home-robbery perpetrator is still most likely looking for physical valuables like cash, gold, etc.I'm not all that familiar with Mr. Beast, but these big Youtube personalities, man....they'd better step up their home security, because I imagine a lot of outlaws know they're pretty rich and thus are, or will, become the target of break-ins just like this one.",

This means the robber is very understanding of the crypto. Maybe today, the robber is not looking for the goods and a pile of money again in your house, but a small thing like a flash disk, hardware wallet, or laminating paper where a robber is very sure if that inscription is 12/24 mnemonic seed or private key. Maybe better from today, we have to hide our crypto in different ways, maybe we can tuck it in an unexpected place like a wall hole, electrical switch location, or in floor tiles (just for example) where the robber didn't expect it. It's up to you, If you feel you have an unexpected place in your house and are safe, you have to try it but be very sure that place is safe from anything like flood, fire, and humans.https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-millionaire-escaped-armed-robber-looking-to-drain-his-cryptocurrency-wallets/",

They referred to the robber as a fucking moron in the YouTube video clip since he was foolish and never imagined what a private key implies, even though he wanted to access it through the laptop he took.It was a good idea that he kept the private keys somewhere else than his laptop, which is never a good idea. The video clip has simply taught thieves more about what a private key is and how to use one if they stumble across one or want to breach someone who holds a bitcoin savings account. He should be more cautious the next time because the robbers will be smarter than before after seeing this video footage.",

Lesson here, not all robbers are there stupid, hide your keys!There is a saying in my region that day's that \"what you don't know is bigger than you. These criminals acted out of ignorance because they know nothing about Bitcoin. If knew about Bitcoin, they wouldn't have stolen any thing except those keys. This story reminds us of our most important responsibility as bitcoiners, which is how to secure our keys. I have never seen any conventional bank manager keeping the keys to the bank's vault on the table, they ensure it is always safe.The story also informs us that many people are still not aware of the currency called Bitcoin. Therefore we need to increase Bitcoin awareness through diverse means that are convenient to use. More people need to be aware of this currency which can promote privacy and can also be a good investment scheme.",

But there's also the funny owner who wrote down his private keys on a piece of paper and openly display it for everyone to see. This is amusing. This is a classic story of the pot calling the kettle black. LOL!Anyway, there are precious lessons here, both for the robber and for Mr. Beast. And for everybody else, especially those who are not as rich as Mr. Beast, there's a reason why it's called private keys.",
