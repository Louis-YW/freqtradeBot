      "body": "Semi-serious question : is it your own content or is it a plagiarism?here is my wild guess : it is an AI written content. Just asked chatgpt : \"How to Avoid Plagiarism?\"And here is the answerQuoteAvoiding plagiarism is crucial when creating any type of written work, whether it's an academic paper, a blog post, a report, or any other form of content. Plagiarism occurs when you use someone else's words, ideas, or work without proper attribution or without permission. To avoid plagiarism, follow these guidelines:Understand What Plagiarism Is:Familiarize yourself with different forms of plagiarism, such as direct copying, paraphrasing without proper citation, and self-plagiarism (using your own previously published work without citation).Cite Your Sources:Whenever you use someone else's ideas, quotes, or data, make sure to provide proper citations. Use a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) as required by your institution or publication.Use Quotation Marks:When directly quoting someone else's words, enclose the text in quotation marks and provide the source in your citation.Paraphrase Properly:If you need to rephrase someone else's work or ideas, ensure that you completely rewrite the content in your own words. You should still provide a citation to acknowledge the source of the original idea.Attribute Ideas:Even if you're not directly quoting or paraphrasing, you should still credit the source if you're using someone else's ideas or concepts. Provide proper attribution to the original author.Use Plagiarism Detection Tools:Many institutions and online platforms use plagiarism detection tools like Turnitin or Copyscape to identify copied content. You can also use these tools to check your work before submitting it.Keep Detailed Notes:While conducting research, keep organized notes that clearly distinguish your own thoughts from information obtained from external sources. This will make it easier to cite sources accurately later.Understand Fair Use:Familiarize yourself with the concept of fair use, which allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission. Be sure to adhere to the rules of fair use when incorporating copyrighted material into your work.Create Original Work:Whenever possible, strive to generate original content and ideas. Plagiarism is not just about copying; it also involves presenting someone else's ideas as your own.Seek Permission:If you plan to use copyrighted material extensively or in a way that exceeds fair use, seek permission from the copyright holder. This is especially important for images, graphics, and multimedia content.Be Careful with Self-Plagiarism:If you're reusing content from your previous work, make it clear in your current work and cite your previous publication.Proofread and Edit:Carefully review your work to ensure that all sources are properly cited and that you haven't accidentally plagiarized any content. Editing and proofreading can help catch unintentional plagiarism.Seek Guidance:If you're unsure about how to properly cite a source or have questions about plagiarism, consult your institution's guidelines, a writing center, or a professor for clarification.Plagiarism is a serious ethical and academic offense that can have severe consequences, including academic penalties and damage to your reputation. By following these guidelines and practicing proper citation and attribution, you can avoid plagiarism and maintain your integrity as a writer or researcher.It looks a bit like your post.",

      "body": "Base on the forum I would say the easiest and simplest way to avoid plagiarism is to cite or reference the source or author no to long talk about that. On a broader level i would say stick to share only about what you know and if necessary quote direct from a source what you copied. One can easily get caught up if you decide to continually paraphrase other people’s work",

However, if a text has below 10% test it is considered ok but if it is above 20% the content is considered highly plagiarize.  You should mention here that, the percentage of accepting Plagiarism is zero on Bitcointalk. This means, if you are found guilty of making plagiarized posts then your account will be banned permanently without any warnings. So you/we have to be careful before making posts that might contain plagiarism content. When the era of AI tools started, many members here on BTT were banned permanently just because they were using AI bots to create answers or messages to post here. Which is immoral and against the rules of this forum too. So please, note that the acceptance percentage here on BTT is zero and you should edit the post and write it down. I know you have made this post generally to represent the message that some platforms do provide some compensation but here on BTT, moderators, have no mercy for plagiarized posterQuote from: RioBlemz on September 13, 2023, 04:01:15 PMBEST WAYS TO CHECK FOR PLAGIARISM.........HOW TO REMOVE PLAGIARISM..........To be very honest, we don't really have to be involved in unnecessary work just to make your content plagiarized-free. This forum is simply a discussion platform where we reply to each other like we do discussions on chat but here the difference is we can not make single word, or single line messages. This means, we have to convey all the messages at once.",
