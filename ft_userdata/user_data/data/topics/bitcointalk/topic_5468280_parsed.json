  "content": "Some of you may grew an idea that I am mad at some specific users or brands. Such as Rollbit, JollyGood, Ratimov and some others. You do not engage in a discussion when I am laud against the wrong of the users or brands because it personally do not or did not effecting you. But when it does then you come to my PM with your requests. It shows you are motivated by personal benefits and you are selfish.This is an anonymous place. It just does not make sense to have a personal relationship with a person, take their words seriously and react. Here considering someone as friend and enemy are both weird. A friend knows everything about his friend, an enemy does his study based on the physical existence of the person he dislike, at-least he will know your home and office address. You do not know any verified information about me, none of you never saw me. So I am not your friend, nor your enemy. Bitcoin is everything for me. With my life I believe Bitcoin is the financial freedom against all monopoly of these so called governments who are corrupted. People are the power, not a selected circle. Bitcoin will bring the power back to the people. The forum is the biggest place for bitcoin to receive support which mean this is an important place for bitcoin and it's ecosystem. The well being of the forum is my main concern, not individuals. I work to protect this forum not an individual.I am not motivated by personal benefits too, I am not influenced by any earning from the forum. Yes, it does give me some stash but I do not work for it. It comes automatically because the managers think I deserve it. If no managers want me in their campaigns so be it. I am not here to earn the bread and butter.Here is the reason of this thread: Please do not PM me and ask favor to add/remove a specific user or to leave a feedback because something effected you personally. I have no interest in personal conflicts, if a matter is important for forum well being as a whole then you are most welcome. I will speak up.The title is relevant.",

The good point that you have is the fact that you want no one to PM you to add or remove a feedback which I think some people are abusing trust system on this forum.But exceptional case can be when you tag someone and the person requested for you to remove a feedback in a way he can even be begging you about it. If you are not the type that leave such negative feedback but some strong people asking you for it to suit their own preference, that is not a good idea by those people at all, people should be left alone to decide what is what for themselves.The point I think is not good is that you are insinuating that people should not have friend online. As for me I have friends on this forum. But friends are different from friends. I do not trust any friend online because they may want scam and I do not leave room for that, but I have some preference of the ones that we are friends and none can offend me because I am not a fool.",

Just don't worry too much, 2 days ago I could barely visit any board, so I can say I have missed a lot of topics on this board, the ones which are not part of a cartel signature bots lets call them, they are so busy with their lives, sometimes they spend time to read and intervene if neccessary, so don't expect some knights with shiny armors, some people are afraid to lose their campaign payments, after all many people are actually living off by campaign payments, so they prefer surviving over honor.Only those who believe in God, would sacrifice their own benefits to defend the oppressed to please God, and God does not abandon such people, these events are a test to prove our worthiness, yes we might lose our jobs/ positions even our lives, but does it really matter when God is with us? These events might scare the hell out of people, but when you have God on your side, what is there to be afraid of?Should I pm you my phone number, just in case anyone bothered you.ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤­Edit, anyhow, this post should be considered as my resume for hitting on girls, so if a single young girl is out there, this is me.

I faced this problem many times. Long ago I used to be with a long term signature campaign, I was with them for long time, automatically they thought anything they will ask will be accepted. So they asked for unfair advantages to defend their brand several times, I tried to ignore but at some point I had to reply that I will inspect the case and only response with fair judgement. They did not like it of course.I don't prefer lobbying and get biased. As long as any argument is fair and clear I have no problem to speak for it even if that seems like it will create a negative impact on my account. I think I have already done that many times.",

Yes, trust can be a bit tricky on the internet, but it is not entirely nonexistent. You may not know someone personally, but you can still trust some individuals or websites based on their reputation. For example, when you shop on a well-known and reputable online store, you trust that they will deliver your order as expected. Similarly, you trust your online bank that they have a secure website and provide encryption for your data, and that they will keep your data safe. Also, when you read reviews or recommendations from people on social media or review sites, you are placing some trust in their opinions to make informed decisions, even though they are just some \"random anonymous individuals\". So, yeah! Trust is still very much a part of the online world.",

An example is the services offered on this forum by the supposed users we know nothing about, we read their service page, get interested, then proceed to checking the trust score and feedbacks from other users, then find the user worthy, then we trust the user immediately and send money for to him or her for a service they have not delivered to us, but we do this because we trust that him or her will deliver.That is trust.",

If he can earn $1m in a year by honest work, you could trust him with $1m, if you trust him with $2m, then you are fine with trusting \"services\" with usual amounts such as $200, $1000, since it shows you never had 2m to begin with.That's monetary trust, while there is another form called trusting the judgement of a person, and from what OP is complaining about, it appears he has found out that you can rarely trust someone's judgements around here, because they only care about themselves and not what is right.But yeah, haha hah fits the situation when all you know about trust is based on your forum experience, you have a lot to learn.Bottom line, you can't find more than 10 people with good judgement calls here, and 10 is a generous estimation.",

What you are trying to explain is a physical friendship, but it's more than that, and once there is a connection and communication, the deal is done.Mind you, friendship could be deceptive or genuine be it physical or virtual, and for friendship to start virtually (like in this forum) doesn't mean it has not advanced physically, you can't investigate everyone on this. I know of many from my local board that are now bonding physically, you never can tell the power of forums.Even if they do not see doesn't mean they cannot virtually form a strong bond and alliance.",
