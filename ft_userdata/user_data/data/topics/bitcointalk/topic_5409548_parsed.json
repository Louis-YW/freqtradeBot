Mastering the movement is not easy, I can say that no traders can master this one since its a day to day basis and what happened today might not happen tomorrow, so again be flexible learn everything about trading and use many strategy as much as possible depends on the situation.",

Also mastering the market price without any trading analysis may likely result to loss.",

It's true that it's not all about the price because any price the market shows, you're adapting it and you can make profit from within. That's why many traders are learning from experiences.And at the same time, they're having the best learning experiences because they're applying what they've learned.",

We can't be used on something if we don't do it regularly. Continuous trading will put a trader in different scenarios and that will be the challenge here.Mastering the market shouldn't be the term but be used on seeing how the market behaves. Since crypto is volatile, we need to build experience on how to deal with these. Once we progress, we can form a strategy on our own depending on the market situation.",

When Bitcoin is driven down by the FED and its meetings you know the steering wheel is out of the hands of the market and in the hands of the manipulators. Trying to trade in this environment is very risky and almost impossible because what you're doing is gambling trying to predict if they will hike rates or not and if this will crash the price or not. Wait until the market starts being driven by the market, like when we get to the next having.",

Natural markets run and every second can change. This is because the situation of individuals, companies, and institutions, which for example make purchases or sales without providing information, is the only factor where the market is truly real.The alternative that may be more often used as a reference is news from valid sources that can be accounted for. Then match it with market movements and then the method of reading is with technical analysis (as a scientific measuring tool in minimizing the inaccuracy of speculation).",

Some complained cause they always rushing to buy when the market is good and hyped and when some whales pull off some funds they panic sell and tell us they loss which eventually lead to a greater picture of losses. Honestly if you are down with a major project just find a way to dca or earn out of it like staking or holding it off.Â  Until you recovered the loss value and sold it off at a nice profit again.

Second if you are really interested in trading it then you have to be prepared to take the risk. I just think we should avoid trading greed because we basically never really know what will happen to the next price.Buying on the dip is a good strategy if we really believe in the potential profit we can make in the long run. But I don't think this method will be as good as expected if it is applied to random altcoin that we never know and know about their use cases, so I only agree if this is practiced on bitcoin or some of the top altcoin.",

It could be there's a pattern in the market movement but that gives a guarantee that you will guess it right, some of our predictions lead to a failed outcome in trading. So choose your best trading strategies, change them if it will not work, and have consistent losses.Mastering sometimes helps and doesn't rely upon it, you should always have an exit point to avoid further losses and stop-loss should be the best strategy after all. That's why I prefer investing in Bitcoin compared to making a profit on trading, buying in a DCA way is pretty good as of now IMO.",
