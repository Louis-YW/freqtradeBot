  "content": "Is it about working harder or working smarter? Most of us grew up with the mentality that you can only become successful by working hard but from experience you can become successful by working smarter. Most people have confused working hard with working smart but we must understand that both nomenclatures connote different things. Working hard means spending more time working just to get a result whereas working smart means working strategically without necessarily spending more time to get a result. Experience shows that people who work smart have better chances of achieving success and people who work hard may not get the required result. Smart workers rely on information to keep pushing whereas hard workers just keep trying without paying attention to the importance of information. The capitalist is a smart worker and has always galvanized people to do the work for them but then they get the bulk of the profit. A labourer is a hard worker but in the long run, ends little compared to the time and energy they exert.",
