  "content": "It isn't a story that job opportunities are scarce in some developing countries. Graduate strive to survive after there higher education. Taking Nigeria as an example, it is seen that unemployment rate keep increasing with time. Majority of our graduate strive for living by engaging in commercial transport like okada, tricycle etc. Introducing entrepreneur to people at early stage (in school) can help to reduce unemployment in the society. A cousin of mine that studied accountancy in school is now living his life on music he learnt through an entrepreneural scheme in his secondary school days. Entrepreneur teaches some skills which formal education may not likely teach. Â Some of these include:1. PREPARE STUDENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.ðŸ‘‰We live in an age of unprecedented global and technological transformation. Today's students face an uncertain future full of complex global, social, and environmental issues.ðŸ‘‰According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs survey, half of today's work activities could be automated by 2055, creating completely new roles, responsibilities, and challenges for the future workforce.ðŸ‘‰Therefore, we cannot predict exactly what our students will need to know after they graduate.ðŸ‘‰Entrepreneurship-focused programs teach students crucial life skills that will help them navigate this uncertain future.ðŸ‘‰These skills include problem-solving, teamwork, empathy, as well as learning to accept failure as a part of the growth process2. LEAVE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY AND COLLABORATION.ðŸ‘‰Entrepreneurship education encourages creativity, innovation, and collaboration. ðŸ‘‰These attributes are highly valued by the top colleges in the world and will serve your child well beyond middle school and high school.3. TEACH PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION.ðŸ‘‰Students need to learn how to identify problems before they learn how to solve them. Problem-solving has been taught in schools for decades â€” but the same cannot be said for problem identification.ðŸ‘‰Traditionally, problem-solving is taught by presenting students with issues that are already clearly defined by someone else.ðŸ‘‰In the real world, problems can only be solved when they have been properly identified and described. Entrepreneurship education teaches children to identify problems they have never encountered before â€” a skill that will be very useful in tomorrowâ€™s world.4. MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.ðŸ‘‰Entrepreneurs seek to solve problems, meet needs, and ease pain points with the help of their products and services. They are hard-wired to make a difference and make the world a better place.ðŸ‘‰By participating in entrepreneurship programs, students donâ€™t just become ready to create their own futures â€” they become ready to change the world.Reference: https://www.marlborough.org/news/~board/stem/post/five-benefits-of-entrepreneurship-education-to-students#:~:text=Entrepreneurship%20education%20encourages%20creativity%2C%20innovation,middle%20school%20and%20high%20school.CONCLUSION: World economy can be made better if more job are created. Job creation can be made easy if individuals can creat job for themselves. During this job creation, he/she will still employ some people to his/her organization, therefore helping government to solve part of the problem caused by unemployment.",

But being in the actual could also change the situation and the student may think of better or worst things.If it's a course that's about entrepreneurship, I believe that the great things won't be learned in school about this skill.

Story short, I have to change my thinking and my way seeing life, usually not what I studied today in school I have known to be with but rather skill.

A country that has high level of entrepreneurs will always have a thriving economy, China is a good example, there are a lot of startups coming from China, their citizens are constantly providing solutions to world problems and making profit off it. Iâ€™m of the opinion that if a country increases its production, its economy will also grow.",

Even in advanced countries, the main drivers of the economy are not the government but entrepreneurs. In my country currently, entrepreneurial education has been included in the scheme of work of students in high school to collages. This has led to an increase in self-employed people in society. But these businesses sometimes face tough challenges that make most of them collapse after a few years of establishment. Some of those problems are double taxation, hyperinflation, lack of basic amenities such as unstable electric power supply, and difficulty to access loan facilities. Entrepreneurs are the drivers of the economy, but the government must create an enabling environment that will make these businesses survive. In many developed countries the government ensures that businesses are protected against external competitors. Just recently some counties in Europe announced that they would soon stop the importation of cheap grains from Ukraine because it was harming the local grain producers.",

In my school country, their curriculum just prints students to be workers and employees, so that case, after graduation almost 95% of students register with the company to be employers. There is no curriculum that teaches how to become an entrepreneur, and how to be creative to make a own job. Because of that, so many children of entrepreneurs not going to our local school, they send their children to foreign school where can change their children's mind about how to be entrepreneurs.",

Each person has their own talents, but not everyone can reveal them correctly. By teaching entrepreneurial skills, teachers should develop creativity in children and encourage them toÂ feel free to express their opinions, regardless of their age. If teachers listen more seriously to children's ideas and motivate them to develop, a person grows up more talented, which ultimately encourages them to create their own projects and build their own business.",

This staffing contradiction looks unresolvable on a mass scale, although happy exceptions certainly occur.This personnel contradiction will be further exacerbated if we find the courage to admit that many established entrepreneurs have long lost their lively entrepreneurial spirit and turned into hired managers of their well-established businesses or into idle owners reaping the fruits of their success. They can share their success story with students, but without a lively entrepreneurial spirit, their personal experience is of little use to students; for them, such a teacher is just an example of a \"systematic survivor's error.\" People with a lively entrepreneurial spirit are more likely to be found among startup founders who do not yet have sufficient authority for the audience, because they cannot present any significant attributes of success - they are just on their way to them.",
