  "content": "Political power is a weapon though transient. With it, new nations are built while others are crushed. The older participants require the zealousness in the youths to succeed, and without a youthful support base they won't succeed. How do you get youths' support and availability because a question political elites ask themselves always. They commitment has a huge prize tag, and so, make attempts at getting 'cheap labour' from the youths. A hungry man would beg for anything to survive, and unemployed people are always available. Therefore, hunger and unemployment become a choice weapon over the years. Elite African politicians empoverish their people to command loyalty from them. This is the foundation of every seemingly successful African politician. Then, the arm the most gullible ones to defend their interest at all cost, a do or die indoctrination. With this, a small army is formed to tackle oppoents opponents, leaving deaths and destructions in their wake. This private army gives them protection at events especially towards elections. Drugs are made available, free foods, and more drugs. Then a token of cash reward caps a successful bloody mission. Nothing has changed over the years except the advancement of this antics.",

So more like an economically vibrant youthful population, will not easily succumb their political shenanigans. To a large extent I agree with you, a financial liberated society has an extent to which they can accept some things, this reminds me a lot about Machiavellian principles and its application in reality.",

      "body": "Africa has been a centre of deprivation and merginilaztion of citizens' right and this has turned political thuggery into a lucrative venture since the wealth of the Nation is in the hand of a few corrupt politicians, they use the stolen commonwealth of the nation to sponsor their evil political agendas and since politics in the African content is a do or die affairs only the strong evil one succeed into political offices through bloodshed and intimidation of the political opponent. This development has led to hundreds of thousands of death of both the political thugs and other citizens who are caught up in the web of this blood thirsty politicians and their evil activities, this have also led to escalated crimes such as kidnapping, terrorism and banditry which is as a result of access to arms and animation that are shared to thugs during the election by politicians, these tools are used to carry out that crime when the election is over and thugs become an idol African democracy is far from being ideal like every other state that practices such a system of government that allow elections, and this has not changed over time since history it rather getting worst of every election must witness a blood bath high rate of kidnapping of a political opponent and every other evil that the politicians use youths to perpetuate.",

The made promises they can't fulfill just to get our vote during Election and after the election they do nothing about what they promised the people. They're very good at this, after another year again, they will made another promise on the things that the people are lacking. They would Still vote for them. Then, intimidating is another political weapons to get people obey anti people's policy of the government. They made laws that are not suitable for the people, then use political will like the police and military to force the law on the people.Lastly, corruption, using public funds for selfish interest. These are what has kept Africa in darkness.",

Poverty, religion, tribalism, and illiteracy are a few I can mention. A poor man will always be controlled by money because his family is hungry and he needs money to feed them. So these politicians can cajole them to sell their votes and engage in electoral fraud and thuggery. Religion and tribalism are instruments of dividing and deceiving the people to vote based on these lines. Muslim candidates will always persuade the people to vote for them not based on their competence but because of their religious beliefs and vice versa. To misinform the people politicians deprive them of quality education so that they cannot know the truth. Until we realize that we are being deceived, used, and dumped by this politician, they will keep having a free day.",

It is as though it already lives in their blood to be used as political weapon by these politicians.The average African that is literate always find a means of making there life better amidst the bad government they live within, but during electoral campaign processes their brains are being reformed to being used as a political tool for that moment because of the money they’re given which won’t last them a whole week. Only the highly skilled and well educated youths stay away from this act completely although you can still find some behaving as the less educated ones because it’s generic and lives in the blood with them.",

      "body": "Poverty, Illiteracy, greed, and Ignorance have been the strongest tools of politicians in Africa.When people are poor, they can take peanuts from politicians and support them. Even if these people do not like or trust these politicians they will still vote for them because they've been given something that will sustain them for at least a day.It gets worst when these poor people are illiterate. They just do whatever they're told and this makes it even easier for the politicians to manipulate them. All the politicians need to do is buy whoever the illiterates in the community trust and they have gotten the rest. If you look at the thugs they mostly use for elections, most of them are illiterates. People who can't think for themselves. They just follow whoever leads them. These things are very well structured in a way that people won't understand. You might look at this and wonder \"What about the rich and educated people in the society that still support these corrupt politicians?'. That is where ignorance and greed come in. These rich and/or educated folks may stand to gain by supporting the cancer that is eating up that state. Some may have nothing to gain, but they support them because of one ignorant reason or the other. One of these reasons may be because the person is from their tribe or a tribe they want. Very few times that politicians win elections in Africa because the people actually believe in them or their vision, mission, or policies. They mostly win the elections by how well they can use the tools at their disposal. That is why it's going to be very difficult for African countries to get better because politicians have the people in a chokehold through these weapons and without these weapons, the people will be free to choose whomever they actually want and they will choose better leaders.Electricity, good transportation, good educational systems, security, impartial judiciary, employment, and reduced corruption to the minimum are a few of the main things that the people in these countries really want but if the government provides these things for them what would they campaign with? These politicians are so void of ideas to the extent that they will fail woefully as politicians in a better system. They're only smart when it comes to corruption. And even to a large extent, they are daft in that area too, they just prosper because they can always get away with it even if they're caught.",
