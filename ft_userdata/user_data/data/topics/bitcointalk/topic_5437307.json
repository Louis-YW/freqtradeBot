Use BestChange!, just let you know maybe you have another question to Bestchange.Quote from: https://www.bestchange.com/What Bitcoin wallet services are suitable for the BestChange faucet?You can use any service that works with Bitcoin blockchain directly, for example:Blockchain — well-known wallet;Coinbase Wallet — wallet from a popular crypto exchange;Bitcoin Core — official wallet;Binance — well-known crypto exchange.The following list is merely advisory. BestChange does not respond as an official partner of presented resources.You cannot use micropayment gateways in the BestChange faucet, such as FaucetBox, BitChest, Bitcoin-Cloud, FaucetPay etc. Please use the original addresses of Bitcoin-wallets.Many payment systems allow creating Bitcoin wallets, but often they have minimal amounts for transactions and additional fees, and if you transfer to such wallets an amount less than the one specified in the service’s rules, the service will take 100% of the transaction.The following services and payment systems have restrictions and are not suitable for receiving funds from our faucet:Cryptonator — minimal amount is 10 000 Satoshi;WebMoney — minimal amount is 10 000 Satoshi;Payeer — minimal amount is 50 000 Satoshi.When ordering a withdrawal, make sure your wallet does not have restrictions on topping up the balance. It will be impossible to cancel the transaction or revert it, and you will lose all the ordered amount.",

Well, BestChange faucet doesn't accept those.However, I've made a test and it works just fine with legacy (1*) addresses. Probably it'll also work with SegWit compatible addresses (3*).So if you want to use that faucet you'll need to learn to make yourself one more wallet, which this time will need to be either Legacy, either SegWit compatible.Edit: if you want to create a Legacy wallet's seed for Electrum, you go into console and typeCode:make_seed(128, \"\", \"standard\")Then you'll make a new wallet off this seed.",

But i really don't want to create a new wallet just for this, it would be very confusing to have more than 1 seed phrase. Do you guys know any faucet platforms that support bc1 bitcoin addresses?",

Do you guys know any faucet platforms that support bc1 bitcoin addresses?I don't know why you're seems so obsessed with Bitcoin faucet when you can only able to earn around 10-100 Satoshi for every hour which is wasting time. Most of Bitcoin faucet sites are only offer for their own wallet/exchange/provider, not many will accept other wallet. You can also consider to use Samourai wallet, it's one of good Bitcoin wallet that offer privacy (if you need it) and they offer you legacy, native segwit and non-native segwit address without need to convert anything, you only need to save 1 seed phrase.",

But thanks for your suggestion about samourai wallet, i will look into it later.Quote from: LoyceV on January 30, 2023, 10:36:25 AMYou can get 6 sats on LN, if you install a custodial wallet, you'll instantly get it.Thanks for the info.Thanks for the discussion everyone, it looks like i really need to have another wallet to be able to claim the faucet at Bestchange. i appreciate your time and i'm going to lock this topic.",
