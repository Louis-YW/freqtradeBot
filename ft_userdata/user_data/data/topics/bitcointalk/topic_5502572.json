He is a smart guy, he understands the monetary system very well, he understands inflation, he is a very good investor, he has amassed a net worth of $80M, and he is relatively young, he is not like Buffet who will never understand Bitcoin in what little time he has left. I think part of his attitude is also the interests he has. He's invested in gold and emerging markets through his fund, which is what he's trying to sell. But he has been talking for some time about making a shitcoin backed by gold, so he is not completely opposed to cryptocurrencies. But his obsession with Bitcoin being a Ponzi and going to 0 for more than a decade is ridiculous.",

Some core critics ended up swallowing their pride and embracing Bitcoin. But I think Peter Schiff is too proud to accept the truth openly. In May this year, I got from an online blog that he said he wished he bought Bitcoin in 2010. Some of these critics might be secret investors, after all, Bitcoin's transactions are pseudonymous.",

Considering that talking about gold obviously doesn't have much effect, he found something to use as bait. As for his son, it's a story a few years old when they were fighting on social media (maybe they still do). At the time, it wasn't entirely clear to me whether his son was really against his father's ideas or was just helping him in what he was doing otherwise.Besides, does Peter know that Bitcoin as a currency is banned in Turkey?",

He was an ambassador for that circus then he was became evangelical about how the industry was in need of immediate crypto regulation.Last time I saw him talk about cryptocurrency was while advertising his new venture WonderFi which swallowed up another cryptocurrency exchange when he suddenly wanted to run an exchange. So in his eyes, to undo the wrongs of him being the face of one of the biggest cryptoexchange collapses in recent times.As for his son being into bitcoin, this might just be one of those ploys to get a narrative for one of his own turning against \"the man\" so to get some clout out of his elderly followers to do a search of what bitcoin is.His company does take payment in BTC after all.",

What is called financial revolutionary guidance means revolutionary coin is considered.  So it's meant to say that if Bitcoin didn't overperform, people wouldn't even consider it a revolutionary financial asset. But in fact, Bitcoin has proved that there is no better asset than Bitcoin which can reach its price milestone within a few years. Yes, we do not condone that Gold is a bad investment asset, but we also do not say that Gold is better than Bitcoin. A hint is sufficient for the rest of the discerning servants.",

What is called financial revolutionary guidance means revolutionary coin is considered. ~snip~There are various reasons why people have a bad opinion about BTC, whether it is that they are not intelligent enough to understand what it is all about, or they are just very angry because they did not understand what it was about in time, so now they are expressing their anger through negativity towards BTC in the hope that it will fail one day. Let's be realistic, the average person in an average country is instrumentalized to such an extent that he blindly listens to the mainstream media, which is of course the service of every government that influences public opinion through them. If you look at the past, the same media have declared BTC \"dead\" somewhere around 500 times so far, and probably thousands of articles have been written where BTC was brought into the context of scams, money laundering, terrorist financing and of course bad impact on the environment.When you look at all this in a wider context, it is clear why the adaptation of BTC among people is relatively low considering that it has been around for 15 years.",

Dependent on the state that they reside in of course.Remember each States of the US have different age requirements to do things such as legal age to drink for instance.Schiff looks around 60 years old so his son has to be no younger than 16. So if he still is living with him (daddy warbucks ) then he would have to abide by his father's rules of the house.Wouldn't you agree?",
