Where I gamble depends on the day. I like to wager a little at the sportsbook on Sundays at a fiat casino close to my house. The thing I enjoy betting on the most is sports, not slots or table games. Betting on a sporting event can occupy way more time than any slot machine might and cost me much less money.You should probably move this to gambling discussion board IMO.",

The Fiat displayed is better, even if all I have on the account is USDT or Bitcoin, but when it comes to which currency is favourable for me to use for gambling I will always pick crypto. Sports bet, I don't use to like it but a friend advised me to move closer to football fans and to also watch some football matches, that's where I started to like football out of all other sports games. Still, I like Slots too because of it's simplicity and less time consuming. I  don't want I have a specific Casino is my favourite casino I have open account on up to five different casinos online hand I don't have a specific casino that I use most times I just pick one and make my deposit on the casino to try my luck for the week I have accounts on fortunejack I also have account on stake.com and I also to use Roll bit casino too.I am a responsible gambler because I am far from gambling addiction, it is not very important to me to gamble I only gamble when I feel like gambling unlike people who always feel the urge to gamble everyday I don't see myself doing the same thing, I am very cautious with gambling and I know that losing my money is more possible than winning some money, this is why I am not too into gambling.",

Stake.comQuote from: raybucks on October 17, 2023, 07:27:42 AMAre you a responsible gambler?Without a doubt. Because after that 10 percent is gone I let go and don't play until I get more funds. There are times I would deposit some LTC or BNB but it's a rare thing because most of the time I can make my initial fund last for a week and maybe more if I keep on winning so I won't really have to cut some of my next salaries and I just keep on saving them. I am curious why the OP did this. Is this some kind of a social survey or a school project or something?",
