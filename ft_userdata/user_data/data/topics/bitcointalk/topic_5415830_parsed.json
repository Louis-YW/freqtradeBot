The channel operator buys a large number of tokens.2. Afterward, the channel operator publishes a \"signal\" telling everyone in the channel to buy the same token.3. The price rises as the channel members start buying.4. The channel operator sells all of her tokens as the price rises and makes a profit.5. Channel members eventually stop buying and start selling.6. The price plummets because there are no more buyers.7. Channel members are stuck with worthless tokens.",

Are you looking for groups to share trading signals? first, I want to remind you that there are no reliable signals, they are all scams. They give you a free signal at first and then they charge you if you want to continue to receive signals from them or they will tempt you to invest in some pump and dump project, where they pre-purchase a large number of tokens then exhort people to buy so they silently sell tokens to everyone at a higher price. In the end, they are the beneficiaries, no one else. Almost all channels from telegram or discord are intended to lure members to scam and not give you knowledge or any benefit to the community. Stay away from them, try to learn, gain knowledge and make yourself your own signal provider.",

If you also want to employ it on your own discord server (as a collection of different servers into one channel so that you don't have to visit them all), it would only work if the so-called \"signals\" channels of discord were an announcement channel, where you can follow it on your own discord server whenever someone publishes something.

And usually, when the bot or any of the admins have welcomed and mentions you on the chat, it will notify you through your registered email there. So, that means that it's an automated notification for you every time that they include you to their post. I don't know the other features yet since I barely use it but that's one of my experience and have observed it for a long time.To give you an idea about signals, there could really be a lot of people that are interested on it. But in reality, it's not worth it when you're already part of it in a long time and much worse if they'll ask you to pay for subscription or just to not be kicked out of the group.",

Ask the admins if they could do @everyone every time or better yet, setup optional roles to ping using well known bots like probot, carl bot, etc. Depending on their setup, you could also try getting pinged for every messages in a single channel (e.g. #thisisachannel) by right clicking the said channel > notification settings > all messages.",

Personally lurking in this forum is the best choice if you're trying to learn or read about tech, history, and stuff like that.
