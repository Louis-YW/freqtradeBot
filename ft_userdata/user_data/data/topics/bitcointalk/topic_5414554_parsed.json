I've not reset my password so I wouldn't know but I k ow there's people who've had accounts locked before after they've changed email address as it sends a link to autolock and account for 7 days (I think) and whoever breached their email got the link.Stake a bitcoin address first here and ensure you're confident on signing a message with it: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=996318.0I can't say this'll be foolproof but it's probably the best way - unless you have one staked already you can sign just in case you do get locked out.",

Depending on the browser it should be somewhere in Settings > Passwords > Saved Logins > Search \"Bitcointalk\" > View password.Some people do not like something like that. When they are registering or login in using such browser, there would be an option to save the password or not. If not saved, the password would not be saved on the broswer and nothing would be seen if you want to access the password again.Some people that are privacy and security conscious do not like saving password like that because it can be accessed through the browser which create a means for hackers to get hold of someone's password. On browsers like Chrome, users can sign in through email and all the password saved through the browser and the likes (like apps) would be synchronising with Google cloud.All I knew before was that Chrome would first ask for login, but I was surprised when I noticed my chrome logged me in through my email on my new android device. I have some password used for somethings in past  which I clicked on save (save password) and I just checked right now, everything can be seen just through the Chrome and other means that it can be accessed. I understand that you know all these, but I am surprised to notice that I did not sign in on Chrome but it now sign people in automatically. I checked on of my relative phone just now also, but Android 12 (mine is android 11), the 'password' has even be changed to 'password manager' by android/chrome developers. Not a safe means at all as Google cloud, iClod and other online clouds are not recommended for saving sensitive passwords.This could be a means some people's social media account, exchange account (especially if 2FA is not included) and many other accounts can be attacked by hackers.",
