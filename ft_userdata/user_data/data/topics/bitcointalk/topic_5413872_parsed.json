This doesn't scratch the surface of what the US traded with China which is $656b and that of Taiwan: $114b which includes some of the world's most advanced semi conductors. A possible attack of China to Taiwan will sure be a global depression.Taiwan who broke out of China in 1949 during the end of china's civil war and believe to be an independent state but China sees differently. I just hope Xi would have a change of mind tho.",

Their economy is spluttering right now and this zero Covid strategy is a diabolical mess. At least in the very short term, until dictator Xi is confirmed again for his third term later this year, there won't be any changes to his strategy. He most likely would want to rebuild broken economic ties because stunted growth makes the CCP look very well again.",

I understand that the United States is trying not to be in support of oppression, but the tensions between China and Taiwan has become tenser since the visit Nancy Pelosi against strict warning issued by China that that would be a provocative.  The economic danger if China goes to war with taiwan will be devastating and will affect all other countries of te world that depend on China majorly for some goods.",

I think Many countries will be affected by the Sino-Taiwan War because a lot of manufacturing is running in that region. The government should set regular payments to these companies and adjust prices and so on. Since this matter is kept under the radar, it makes contact with different countries even more vulnerable.I don't think it will be a big problem. Binance This is a young research company with great potential and innovation. I think what we need to think about is the economic crisis that will come if this happens and what will happen to Binance if NATO implements zero trading, if that happens, will happen to all of us.

Taiwan is responsible for a large portion of semiconductor manufacturing and Taiwan will destroy these manufacturing facilities rather than allow China to get their hands on them.

Realising this China might avoid the invasion over Taiwan. The recent truth that caused world Countries suffer is the invasion over Ukraine by Russia.China should think if it’s Taiwan really worth it, or better to have a good relation with them instead of making such pressure. War is not good at all, it can cost a lot of lives and money which is not good and with this, WW3 can happen any time. My country is on the middle of these countries, probably we might ended up the battle ground for bigger countries especially with China and US, so I hope there’s still a solution for this and not the war.I believe you hit the point, China should think if Taiwan is really worth as much as they can lose. I guess China knows that and they will not make a move, but they will not forget it either, that will be like a cloud over Taiwan, as it was until now. So except for big words, something we often come from China, I don't think we will see anything here, at least that would be the best option.

There could be a general decrease in confidence in cryptocurrencies if the market perceives them as being too closely linked to China. This could lead to a sell-off and a sharp decline in prices. A ban on Binance will definitely make Crypto seem like a China's product to an average Joe. Economic sanctions on China will definitely damage US's economy as well. Will they really consider it tho? I think travel bans and arms embargoes will be the first to be enacted. Arms embargoes can be a cruel one and may lead to direct military conflict with China as the initiator.

I hope they would think more than twice before pursuing invasionbecause it could possibly cause another global crisis again. The whole world could suffer because of them. no more wars - we already have done so much damage to the world. Earlier - there was COVID  - then Russia - USA Afghan crisis -  then floods and famine. Now china and Taiwan war is in making - The world needs healing. The problem is, we don't know what these top officials of both countries are thinking.Either they will lower their pride and do what is both beneficial to them.Or be aggressive and wage war.
