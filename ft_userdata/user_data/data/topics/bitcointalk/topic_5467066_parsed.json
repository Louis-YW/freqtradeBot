  "content": "Is Bitcoin hodling more important? well I have read a couple of post which always talk about owning Bitcoins which is definitely a good idea especially as someone in the crypto space however will hodling Bitcoin be important without proper understanding of Bitcoin and the crypto space? Of course not. Now before I got to know about Bitcoin talk I had heard a lot about Bitcoin and due to the vague information I had gotten without research I joined the group of person who thought Bitcoin was a get rich quick scheme or scam therefore I was limited by that idea. However joining this forum brought me a good sense of understanding of what the crypto space is about. Now my point is Bitcoin can always be owned as well the knowledge can also be gotten how ever it is of optimum importance to first understand Bitcoin¬† because;¬†1. Understanding Bitcoin first gives you a more solid knowledge of security. and this is very important to avoid loss of funds.2. It gives you a stronger sense of marketing especially for those who hold for sales during bull. it will give you the strategy of knowing when to sell and hodl.3. It helps you understand the power of decentralization and it's benefits to you as an investor amongst many others.Generally it takes someone with good knowledge of Bitcoin to scam or hack someone with hodlings so how can one counter Bitcoin fraud or asset loss without proper understanding of Bitcoin?lastly you can always earn Bitcoins once you have a solid knowledge of it .you can even earn Bitcoins indirectly by teaching others or even running a local exchange and lots more. so newbies out there do not rush into buying Bitcoin without first understanding¬† Bitcoin which can even be done by engaging in important discussions on the forum expecially those of experts and experienced investors. remember knowledge is power.Good luck mate don't forget to keep your keys safe üòÅ",

Without knowledge, you are exposed to potential risk which might make you regret ever using Bitcoin. A lot of people has this thinking that Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, but of course it isn't. You make profit from how much you invested into Bitcoin. so I still don't know why some of them still have that wrong idea about Bitcoin investment. It's very important to learn from people who are genuine experts of Bitcoin technology and not people who has just a little idea of it and goes out there impacting the wrong information about Bitcoin to other.",

What good does knowing the theory of how to live and stay healthy do to you if you are sick, unhealthy, and dying? Very little. If you are talking from a take-profit perspective, it's easy for you to see if your investment brought you profit without much underlying knowledge. For anything more serious, you are going to have to understand the theory and the reasons everything works and is set up the way they are.",

But in a more difficult attack, take note that all the hacker needs is your keys or seed phrase, so they don't have to be BTC geniuses, they simply have to be skilled in hacking and social engineering to be able to compromise your device and steal that keys.

As if the title you explained is not correct.Because I think knowledge is needed in holdings. If you don't have knowledge of a cryptocurrency asset that you want to hold, the coins that you choose will surely be a useless garbage. But if you have knowledge about Bitcoin or other crypto you can choose the right coins that you want to hold.It's easy to hold, the hard part is that you don't know if the asset you're holding is right because you have no knowledge of it.

So what if a person knows that Bitcoin is cool but, in reality, will not be able to practice with it? Practice is always important for me. A person can invest in Bitcoin with a minimum of knowledge, including the storage rule, and then use DCA, again learning how to avoid mistakes during transactions. And in the meantime, at your own discretion, study certain aspects of crypto, in particular Bitcoin. I liked the health comparison.

It helps you understand the power of decentralization and it's benefits to you as an investor amongst many others.Decentralization though might be an overstatement, we have heard it a lot in the beginning and we thought that this might be the reason why people are into Bitcoin and crypto in general. But once Bitcoin become a investment scheme, a store of value, money, then it changes the complexion of decentralization.
