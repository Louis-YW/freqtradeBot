  "content": "Today, I've signed up on Bitcointalk because it seems to be really interesting for a lot of Bitcoin contributions. It is interesting to see, how Satoshi achieved to grow Bitcoin community and how he created a very good coin, making it possible to establish Bitcoin and Bitcointalk was very important to make it succesfull. Satoshi build Bitcoin and as a coder, he really listened to community feedback and tried to explained it because Bitcoin was (and is) still very technical. Bitcoin is a great technological piece because Bitcoin needs to be safe from hacker. Much money is stored in Bitcoin network and if it's not safe, we are screwed, everyone. But Satoshi was good coder, he made it safe. Bitcoin is safe now for 10+ years and many hacker tried to hack Bitcoin. No hacker succeeded because Bitcoin is proven to be safe. It is very, very unlikely for Bitcoin to be proven unsafe after 10 years of hacker review. I don't read hacker news but it's common sense. I'm not coder, so I don't understand it but of course I tried to have education because education is always important for any issue. Like for Bitcoin, we can already summarize a few points: - not your keys, not your coins- decentralisation is important- always research first to avoid scam or shitcoinI hope, I'm not late for Bitcoin because Bitcoin already grew a lot. Also, Bitcointalk has many established member. I try to make a good contribution, I try to be polite ofcourse. Bitcointalk has many interesting topic. Everyone who knows Bitcoin should know Bitcointalk. And we can learn A LOT from Bitcointalk. Happy to be here and learn.",

What did you mean about hack Bitcoin?About network attack, Bitcoin network has very high hashrate, very decentralized and risk to have such attacks is very slim.How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?More important, if an attacker does such an attack, Bitcoin price will be dumped to the hell and even the attacker will not get much money from it.Practice with Bitcoin confirmation risk calculatorshttps://web.archive.org/web/20181231045818/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.htmlhttps://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-confirmation-risk-calculator/",

I guess I have seen this many times, yet I am not bored with it. I consider myself a newbie, and sometimes I feel like I write too muchÂ  It's also true that someone might be a newbie in this forum, but still, they know many things about technology. I know some skillful coders and I invited them to Bitcointalk, but they said they don't have time for BitcoinTalk.",
