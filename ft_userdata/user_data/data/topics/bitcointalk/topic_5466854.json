Their is issue on reputation or meta I seen many accounts that is being linked together because of such issues and its mostly Nigerian, if we take our time as new Nigerian who is learning in forum, we are suppose to know all this challenges and avoid them2) plagiarism: we make post of plagiarism and when you make such post of plagiarism you can be caught on act, and why people plagiarism is to make a quality posts, but it's because we are ignorant of act that is why we don't remember to add link when we copy some information from Internet to what we post, when you add the link of what copied is not against the forum rules and regulations, I have seen where such discussions took place in bitcointalk. I'm saying this do to some of the topics I have seen before now in forum. 3) unintentional: what I understand in forum is that their is no mistake that occur in forum that will be called unintentional, they feel that your mistake is intentional, to limit committing crimes in forum is to make sure that you cross examined your post before posting, in newbie board such thread is also stamp pin in Upper of beginners and help board. Let us bring things that will make our board to be lively 4) Paraphrasing: I know this words is something we have already heard often to some boards but it's important to make sure we avoid such things so that we will not be tag, Paraphrasing is like someone committing same crime with plagiarism but both are different in Spelling but same in crime, let us avoid such things so that we shall breath.",

E no matter weda you no plan scam anybody for this forum or comkit any crime but for the fack ur wallet dey linked to scammers or law breakers own without having a convincing reason why both accounts exchange that particular crypto. Better you just avoid dealing with anybody om the forum unless the transaction will be recorded on the forum so in the future you mong nneed explain yourself. Many people account has been wrongly tagged because dem get wallets connection. Dem no go immediately tag you bitbe go out attention for tyou account and probably exposed other small mistakes wey you been dun make away dem for fit over look but as more evidence dey show for you account, you no go get better standing point and fit get ur account tagged.

All the rules and their consequences dey bodly printed out. When you join any platforms normally you supposed just look for the laws wey dey guide the place so if you no do am, you no fit blame ignorance. And many of the laws dem for here wey lead to you getting banned are ethical laws like no copy person work so why you go go copy wetin another man write dey talk say na ur own (taking all the credit). There's no excuse for ignorance my broda, do well and you self go enjoy your stay for here. Here sweet when you understand how to do things so ask questions make u no go be escape goat.",

Normally sef a person is not supposed to just join a new club without understanding how things are being done there so they don’t end up breaking the rules. Ignorance no be excuse for adults because as an adult you suppose seek for knowledge.  Quote from: Riginac111 on September 15, 2023, 06:40:58 AM I notice in our local board some of our people doesn't follow scopes of the forum or the rules and regulations of the forum that is why they get tag and ban, we do receive tag because Were are ignorant of law or act. It like the price they pay for not seeking for knowledge first, I don’t feel bad for them being banned and tagged because understanding the forum should be the first thing before proceeding to other aspects. Quote from: Riginac111 on September 15, 2023, 06:40:58 AM1) linking of wallet address with another wallet: some of us is facing challenging today because of wallets linking and transacting with what that is not necessary, like giving  gas to another wallet and mostly using BNB. Their is issue on reputation or meta I seen many accounts that is being linked together because of such issues and its mostly Nigerian, if we take our time as new Nigerian who is learning in forum, we are suppose to know all this challenges and avoid themAlot of people don’t know about Linking of wallet address, when you send out coins to another user on the forum the two accounts gets link and if the transaction didn’t take place inside the forum it will be seen as that one user owns the two accounts and the two accounts get tagged. I don see people wey dem query for meta also and e no end well. The thing be say nobody go teach us all these things cos no be school be dis so na we suppose put eye for all this things make we understand how e be so we no go get any problem for this forum. Quote from: Riginac111 on September 15, 2023, 06:40:58 AM2) plagiarism: we make post of plagiarism and when you make such post of plagiarism you can be caught on act, and why people plagiarism is to make a quality posts, but it's because we are ignorant of act that is why we don't remember to add link when we copy some information from Internet to what we post, when you add the link of what copied is not against the forum rules and regulations, I have seen where such discussions took place in bitcointalk.

Especially this Wallet linking issue, alot of people don’t know about this na why dem de fall victim for am. Most people who participate in bounties and some who gt multiple accounts mistakenly send coins to another wallet wey don enroll for forum and weather na your own or not if the transaction no take place for forum na problem e be be dat. All this little little mistakes de happen everyday and e good as you bring this up to create awareness for this our LB because most if these defaulters na naija people and all na ignorance cause am. I con de wish say dem go fit pin this thread make e de up so New members go fit easily see am make dem get d information early before they will make any of these mistakes.",

I'm saying this do to some of the topics I have seen before now in forum. OP, I enjoyed the manner in which you were able to connect your topic to the post by streamlining it to forum when making instances. Unfortunately, many people are perennial in their act of stealing other people's intellectual property which is totally wrong and unacceptable. Writers battle with this phase of their career like no other where you will craft out a beautiful epistle and the next thing is, you will find another person reposting it without sending you any form of acknowledgement or referencing. It is good to find out that this forum has continually worked on rewarding originality towards putting up a self-written posts here. Originality is imperative!Quote3) unintentional: what I understand in forum is that their is no mistake that occur in forum that will be called unintentional, they feel that your mistake is intentional, to limit committing crimes in forum is to make sure that you cross examined your post before posting, in newbie board such thread is also stamp pin in Upper of beginners and help board. Let us bring things that will make our board to be livelyLike I advised a newbie earlier, you need to be intentional in any post or topic you created and make sure it aligns with the guidelines of the forum. Sadly enough, many people have this non-chalant attitude of dumping posts without a review. I'm not saying I'm perfect either. But it will do just great if you could pause a sec, and go over it again. Learn to do Previews before posting.Quote4) Paraphrasing: I know this words is something we have already heard often to some boards but it's important to make sure we avoid such things so that we will not be tag, Paraphrasing is like someone committing same crime with plagiarism but both are different in Spelling but same in crime, let us avoid such things so that we shall breath.I have realized that you cannot impress anybody on this forum, so maintain the originality and speak in the simplest way you could communicate. Since English no be your first language, take am slowly, you must not be grandiose in your choice of words. Make I use this opportunity take encourage us say make we dey take out of our time even, to improve on our vocabulary, sha.",

So far you have listed some key points that really affects newbies here and as a matter of fact, these points you have listed are what is standing as a big challenge to members of our local board because they have no knowledge about them.The key major challenges faced by newbies are plagiarism and exchange of gas between wallets which is a major error and should not be in the first place. Newbies are not the only ones facing this but old members here as well because they fail to understand the fact that could nail them if it is being discovered that there are linking wallets from different accounts. It is obvious that people still do not understand that copying online without reference is more amount to plagiarism and that is intellectual theft crime committed so it is obvious when caught, the culprit would face sanctions. So you can see ignorance is not an excuse in the eyes of the law. Who ever keeps lose",

There might be such a thing as ignorance and the law doesn’t give 2 cents about your ignorance but not times, you find people weighing in on their actions because, they just want to do it anyway and they do.

The thing be say, matter like this done Dey very actioned here but, if e happen say in the real world with all these hunt for scammers, them manage line this things up, way this person go point this person or name this person to own this and that, your directly implicated. Even if you no be scammer. So, e go good to avoid any of such individuals when discovered to avoid explaining yourself in any eventuality.",

Let me borrow the word that says \"when you get to Rome, behave like the Romes\" but it's unfortunate that some persons are just adamant and ignorant to breaking the laws even while being aware.When I was introduced to the forum by q friend, he orally hinted me about the of the terms and conditions in the forum and also instructed me to stay in the boards that I'd be most communicable with in the moment that I'm still a newbie.I personally love self learning which prompted me to hover over the forum for awhile before reacting with posting.Getting to the beginners and help section a remarkable opportunity for me otherwise I'd had actually took my social life into the forum.So, I was actually able to adapt to the forum terms and policies so lawfully abiding.This has as much built my bitcoin a great impact to my bitcoin investment quest.",
