  "content": "Google Play has updated its store policy to allow for new ways to transact blockchain-based digital content within apps and games. The move comes as a response to the growing interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other tokenized digital assets, which offer unique and engaging experiences for users.Updates to Cryptocurrencies and related products policy (August 2023)Google provides translated versions of our Help Center, though they are not meant to change the content of our policies. The English version is the official language we use to enforce our policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.In September 2023, Google will update the Cryptocurrencies and related products policy to clarify the scope and requirements for the advertisement of blockchain- based games involving NFTs.Beginning September 15, 2023, advertisers offering FT games that do not promote gambling-related content may advertise those products and services when they meet the following requirements and are certified by Google.Promotion of blockchain-based games involving NFTs.Examples: NFT games that allow players to purchase in-game items, like virtual apparel for a player's characters, weaponry, or armor with better stats, consumed or used in a game to enhance a user's experience or aid users in advancing the game.For NFT games, the following are not allowed:* Promotion of games where players can wager or stake NFTs in exchange for the opportunity to win anything of real-world value (including other NFTs).Examples (non-exhaustive): Games that allow players to stake NFTs in exchange for fungible tokens such as cryptocurrencies.* Promotion of social casino games that reward NFT.* Examples (non-exhaustive): Simulated casino gambling (for example, poker, slots or roulette) that offer the opportunity to win NFTs.( Promotion of \"real money gambling\" destinations. This includes gambling-related advertisements that appear on your game's destination.Do you believe that this update from Google Play will drive the adoption of NFTs in mobile games?

Thanks for the advice I appreciate it.Partially, I agree with you about wallet creation and minimizing barriers to NFT adoption. However, cryptocurrency is definitely going to become more mainstream and when AAA games will implement crypto it will be a game-changing moment for the industry.But have you asked yourself why they don't do it if it's such a game changer? Because the average person, when he needs money, goes to work and when he needs relaxation, he plays a computer game. Attempts to explain to him that items obtained in the game can be in the form of NFTs and tranfered on blockcha... (this is where the average person's attention ends and if the game is not already turned on, a negative review on Steam is sent, the money is refunded and another game is purchased). Moreover, in my opinion, blockchain is used where trust is not enough. That's why bitcoin is a great invention, because storing your life savings in something over which another entity has complete control is not the best solution. However, this is not the case with computer games and computer games items. Steam Community Market where you can trade knives from CSgo is more than a dream come true for an ordinary player and the risk that steam will run away with the knives and leave players without these \"valuable skins\" is zero. None of them will pay extra 5$ eth transaction fee to be sure his skin is on blackchain and no one will steal it as long as his 12 words are safe.In 2050-2100, when whole world will be gamified NFT in AAA games will be a must have. Not in 2023-2050.",

Are they modifying their policies because they love technology or to attract people? They're doing this to maximize profits. Remember that Google sets the rules: what's allowed and what's not. A cohesive body for distributed assets? So funny.NFTs may become popular in mobile games. Google sets trends, so they probably will. Keep our eyes open.
