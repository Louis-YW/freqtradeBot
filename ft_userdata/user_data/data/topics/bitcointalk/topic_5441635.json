  "content": "QuoteOn 21 February, Bitcoin BTC mining researcher Jaran Mellerud published a report on the state of Bitcoin mining in Iceland. He noted that the European country is the world’s largest hash rate producer per capita.According to Hashrate Index, Iceland has become one of Europe’s last Bitcoin mining havens. In addition, the island nation has vast amounts of stranded hydro and geothermal energy.The researcher estimated that the country’s BTC mining industry consumes around 120 megawatts of electricity. This equates to a global hash rate of 1.3%, which isn’t much. Iceland, on the other hand, has a population of around 370,000 people, making it the largest hash rate producer per capita.Iceland is the most electricity-rich country in the world, thanks to its volcanoes and waterfalls. It generates nearly twice as much as the second-placed country on the list, Norway, Europe’s largest Bitcoin mining hub. In fact, the two countries are the only ones in the world that are entirely powered by renewable energy.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/r6TBb8z/energy-per-capita.jpgBitcoin miners have, however, reported that obtaining energy allocations for new data centers is becoming increasingly difficult in Iceland. This implies that the potential for growth will most likely remain at current levels in the foreseeable future.In December 2021, National Iceland electrical company Landsvirkjun reduced the amount of power it will provide to certain industries, including Bitcoin mining. The reasons cited for this decision were a series of issues, including a problem at a power station, low hydro-reservoir levels and accessing energy from an external supplier.United Kingdom-based mining group Cloud Hashing relocated 100 miners to Iceland in 2013. HydroMiner GmbH, an Austrian company, raised approximately $2.8 million in its initial coin offering in November 2017 to install mining rigs directly at Icelandic power plants.The network hash rate reached an all-time high of 318 exahashes per second (EH/s) this week. It is now hovering just below those levels, having risen by 25% since the beginning of the year.https://ambcrypto.com/iceland-is-europes-last-bitcoin-mining-refuge-but-concerns-emerge/....Iceland is known as the only country in the entire world who jailed bankers for their role in the 2008 financial crisis. This factoid could contribute to bitcoin miners pursuing it as politically neutral territory where they might someday build an industry. Iceland's cold weather is also claimed to drastically reduce server cooling costs. The high number of geothermal power plants in the area producing electricity in an environmentally friendly manner at low cost also could make the country attractive for crypto mining ventures.I'm not certain if iceland could be considered europe's last crypto mining refuge. But it is an interesting claim. Is it possible that bitcoin's dive below $20k was more damaging to the global crypto mining industry than realized?",

And the government of this nation deserves some praise for being friendly to bitcoin. The reason for the difficulty in getting electricity allocation seems to be genuine and when the situation improves I believe more miners would be brought on board. Like you rightly pointed out the drop in the price of bitcoin has some negative impact on the profitability of mining which in turn will affect the economic benefits that Iceland receives from this important sector. But with the gradual recovery of the price of bitcoin, we might start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.",

That would be ridiculous.Increasing the capacity of the geothermal industry would require massive investments. I don't know how \"crypto friendly\" Iceland currently is and will this \"crypto friendly status quo\" remain in the future.  Perhaps the crypto haters and FUDsters in the country would try to stop any investments that are related to the crypto mining industry because \"Bitcoin/crypto is wasting energy.\" or some random BS explanation.",

Besides, who would invest in billions in energy capacity for something that might be totally unprofitable even with current prices in one year, thus the government wouldn't gain a penny and it would be left with extra capacity nobody needs.The clear indicator of why this won't work is there for everyone to see!Remember Bukele's geothermal volcano mining?",

Europe is not that cold frosted place in which you stay in the dark and cold under 10 meters of snow for months, not even the northern countries are like that.Actually, he is right. Northern European countries, overall, Nordic Countries are very cold for a long time. Actually, they aren't as cold as they were years ago but still they have very long dark winters. And it's right again that they are the most progressive countries, at least in IT industry. There are a lot of very popular Swedish companies: Skype, Spotify, Ikea, Ericsson, etc.Have a look at The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). Nordic countries are leading in charts. This doesn't mean that other European countries aren't doing well, not definitely but if we keep in mind the population of Nordic countries, they are definitely doing very well.While we may say that cold climate pushes them to innovate and improve their quality of life, the first question that remains unanswered for me is: Why did humans decide to settle and live in cold climates when humans feel more comfortable in warm? But this is a question of history, not economics",

The problem starts when human's start colonizing a place or corner of the land and start doing their chores. We are greedy. They will build mega structures of geothermal plants, mining farms, more people residing nearby in the want of having hob opportunities etc. This can trigger the nature in negative way because what Iceland has currently is due to it's less population and geo location. Soon if it gets populated all of sudden then it may impact the nearby nature, change the environmental conditions, glaciers, sea life anything can start disturbing with this.

Well, if this is true then it will be a big problem to many and considering the next halving where it will lower the amount of the miner that can be mined, it will surely affect our supply but I think its value will be more reasonable, they just have to hold on tight for now and look for a possible alternatives.",

But this is a question of history, not economics  Maybe it used to be warmer there than today, or maybe people simply got used to the cold, considering that the seas that surround those countries are still very rich in fish and other sea creatures that serve as food for humans. Regardless of the fact that I live much further south, I personally would rather choose such a climate than one in which the summer temperatures regularly exceed 40 degrees Celsius, with the addition that in the last ten years we have also had regular strong summer storms accompanied by strong winds, rain and hail.As for geothermal energy, it is not specific only to Iceland in the sense that it exists there, but that they actually use it to the maximum. When we look at the map of geothermal sources in Europe, it is evident that in some parts there are far more of them than in Iceland, but they are not very little used. Denmark and Hungary have perhaps the greatest potential, and some other countries are already seriously thinking about building more geothermal power plants, because it is actually clean energy that is under our feet. Taking everything into account, maybe Iceland is not the last refuge for crypto miners - although the anti-mining movement in the EU has been very active in recent years.",
