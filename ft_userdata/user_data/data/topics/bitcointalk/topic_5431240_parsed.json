Today a newbie has opened a thread:Quotemaking 500-1000usd daily in poker must read i need a partner!Quote from: mellytinker on December 24, 2022, 05:51:21 AMi have a poker way to make money i will show u it fully if we can work together, not alot of money is needed , why i need money? because i was in debt im making but small amounts we can scal this up i would be fully transparent lets make this money if ure interested send me your discordI think it is quite clear. For starters, there are very few people today who make that kind of money playing poker, although there are. But if you are able to earn approximately $0.25M a year and you open that thread, one of two things; either you are a scammer, which is the most likely, or you manage your finances terribly, so whoever believes you also has a high risk of losing their money.The flag:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3070",

I would certainly refer the flag reference to the web archive of that page or some quote that you will make elsewhere. In this way, it points to a thread that the OP can delete, and thus your basis for giving a red flag will also be deleted.in case of deleting the reference, there are alternatives like Loyce.club or ninjastic.space but many users don't use it or don't even know about it.",

The flag:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3070You have warned the members here, especially those who are involved in poker gambling properly, (points), the risk of losing money is greater than the techniques or tricks used by @mellytinker.I'm pretty sure if he invites users here to place poker bets with the methods and tricks he uses, that's a real lie, It's very clear that @mellytinker wants to cheat, he can't always win. Poker bets need instinct, practice and real lessons, especially online poker.I'm not sure if he can understand how many combinations of each card from low to high cards, that's an online site, not poker in a land casino, if there are people who can increase their winnings of course they will do it themselves to make money, obviously this is an act of fraud, the flag is supported.",

I don't believe it, the trick will only benefit him and I think it is one of the scams that needs to be fought. The end points is don't trust anyone else with your money, in fact we always recommend people withdraw their funds from centralized exchanges, so what's the point of trusting a newbie and financed it to gamble. Flags should be supported I guess.I also get some beginners have the same idea, but they do it in a different game or something else like sports betting, investing or futures trading. Everything they say can't be trusted, I think it's an attempt at scam.",
