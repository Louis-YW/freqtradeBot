Those that keep their cash on deposit with them are also eligible for a modest amount of passive income that they offer. The world of cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, has progressed to the point where it can now give a contemporary alternative to traditional financial institutions.Tectonic provides its users with the ability to earn passive income as well as obtain quick loans. Thanks to its cutting-edge technology and suite of essential functions, the platform has quickly emerged as a preferred choice in the financial industry. Let’s take a look at what Tectonic crypto is and how it works.SubscribeJoin us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for?What Is Tectonic Crypto?Tectonic is basically a money market protocol with cutting-edge technology based on a decentralized, noncustodial, and algorithmic platform. Users are able to borrow liquidity through a streamlined process with the Tectonic protocol, allowing them to take advantage of passive yield. Tectonic crypto runs on a cross-chain money market that enables users to earn passive interest and borrow liquidity quickly.When users make deposits of their digital currencies with the platform, they are eligible to receive a healthy return on those investments. Moreover, token holders have the ability to stake their tokens in order to gain incentives. The yield is immediately available and is depending on how the market is performing at the time.Users of Tectonic have the additional option of borrowing liquidity in order to acquire a quick loan. To differentiate itself from other platforms of a similar nature, the protocol was designed with advanced security features and an open-source architecture. Independent audits of Tectonic smart contracts are carried out by reputable third parties for the benefit of the platform’s users.Gary Or, who was also one of the co-founders of Crypto.com and served as its former chief technology officer, is the brains behind Particle B, the company that introduced Tectonic in December of 2021. Particle B is an incubator or accelerator based on the blockchain that provides support for high-value initiatives in the cryptocurrency market. The Tectonic platform utilizes the Cronos network. As a result of this, the native token of Tectonic, known as TONIC, is frequently referred to as TONIC crypto. In point of fact, it was designed to function as a token for use in the cryptocurrency market.How Does Tectonic Crypto Work?Tectonic crypto holders receive benefits as a result of their contributions to the liquidity pool in the form of interest and other perks as part of a complex incentive structure. Traders of TONIC can borrow liquidity for shorting and farming, while holders of TONIC can access many other cryptocurrencies through the platform without having to liquidate their TONIC holdings. Traders and farmers can borrow liquidity for shorting and farming. The other cryptocurrencies could be utilized for bonding, taking part in initial coin offerings, and a variety of other activities.At a level of detail that is more granular, the Tectonic liquidity pool is controlled by smart contracts. This pool is the accumulation of the contributions made by users. These crypto assets are fungible in nature due to the fact that smart contracts are used to regulate their ownership. The quick processing of withdrawal requests is then enabled by these smart contracts. The assets that are held in the Tectonic liquidity pool can also be utilized as collateral for loans made in a variety of other cryptocurrencies.Tectonic crypto was designed with a number of useful methods and features pre-installed for its users. As an illustration, it keeps a 10% liquidity cushion, and it’s also in the process of building an insurance fund right now. The fund will protect the pool against losses that may occur as a result of crypto assets that have been borrowed from the pool but are not returned to it. In addition to this, the platform keeps an adjustable APY that is determined by the current state of the market. This bolsters the return that TONIC crypto holders can expect to get.Tectonic Crypto’s Main FeaturesEven if there are now other cross-chain money market systems in operation, Tectonic crypto differentiates itself from the competition in a significant way. Not only was it skillfully crafted with a range of features that allow borrowing and the generation of passive income, but its developers are also continuously making improvements to the platform.It is necessary for the community as well as the stakeholders to provide their approval for the upgrades before users can reap the benefits of them. Let’s have a look at the features of Tectonic that contribute to its functionality and make it one of a kind.1. TONIC StakingStaking is one of the ways that current holders of TONIC tokens can profit from those tokens in the not-too-distant future, as was previously explained. This functionality, which is still in the process of being developed, will make it possible for holders of TONIC to earn passive yield incentives simply by staking their cryptocurrency assets using the TONIC staking module.The borrowers on the site are responsible for paying the transaction costs, which in turn produce the rewards. The TONIC insurance fund will also be supported through staking, and the platform’s governance activities will make use of the funds. When it becomes available, users will be able to access it using the website’s navigation menu once the staking feature has been implemented.Users only need to input the total number of TONIC tokens that they intend to stake and then submit their order in order to complete the straightforward process. The procedure of unstaking is just as straightforward, but there is a 10-day cool-down period that ensures the assets will not be immediately accessible to users.2. Maturity Lock VaultsMaturity Lock Vaults, which are part of the Tectonic crypto platform, provide yet another potential route for the generation of passive yield. The holders of tokens have the option of selecting from a variety of set time periods to support the network’s long-term growth, ranging from six months to 48 months.When held for longer periods of time in the Maturity Lock Vault, the yield achieves much greater levels. The incentives that will be delivered to these holders will be in the form of TONIC tokens, and they will originate from the community. Token holders are required to stake a minimum of 100 tokens in order to make a contribution to a Maturity Lock Vault. When this objective has been met, the Maturity Lock Vault feature will become active.3. Supplying Assets to TectonicTONIC holders have the ability to make contributions to the liquidity pool, which in turn enables users to borrow from the pool. The distribution of tokens is controlled by smart contracts. Due to the way the platform was designed, the pool can be used in a variety of different ways. In exchange for contributing their crypto assets to the pool, users are rewarded with tTokens.Due to this, they will be able to collect their original tokens from the pool at a later time. The percentage of interest earned on deposits serves as the basis for calculating the value of tTokens. The economic concept of supply and demand serves as the foundation for this particular interest rate.4. Borrowing Assets from TectonicUsers may borrow assets in the form of the many cryptocurrencies that are readily available from the liquidity pool. Other than TONIC, supporting cryptocurrencies include CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, and TUSD. This allows users to obtain liquidity without selling their TONIC tokens. Tectonic crypto manages a collateral factor, which is a ratio of the user’s assets to the funds available for borrowing.In the case that the value of the collateralized assets decreases, certain assets will be liquidated and a liquidation discount will be applied. This liquidation procedure can be prevented if the user improves their collateral or makes partial loan repayments. Borrowed funds are subject to a rate of interest that is compounded.5. Insurance FundThe Tectonic Insurance Fund is currently being developed, and its release is anticipated to take place in the not-too-distant future. The fund’s balance increases as a result of the compounded interest rate, which is something that each borrower is liable for paying. 10% of the interest that is collected is going to be put into the insurance fund. The insurance fund’s primary objective is to establish a financial cushion that will shield the pool from any losses that may be incurred as a result of non-liquidated loans.6. Liquidation MechanismThe liquidation mechanism is activated when the collateral factor on an existing loan is not met, such as through a fall in collateral value or a rise in the amount borrowed. The goal of liquidation is to preserve the Tectonic protocol’s solvency. On the Tectonic interface’s user dashboard is a Lava Bar. Once the Lava Bar reaches its peak, it may be liquidated. As the bar fills up, users can repay a percentage of their unpaid balance or add collateral to avoid liquidation.7. TectonicCoreThe TectonicCore is the risk management layer of the Tectonic protocol. It manages the collateral factor, which determines the minimum collateral demanded from a user and initiates the liquidation method. Whenever a user provides a transaction request, the TectonicCore processes approval or refusal. On a profound level, the TectonicCore calculates a risk score by comparing hazards to user balances.Tectonic Crypto Road Map & ObjectivesAlthough Tectonic was released in December of 2021, the platform has continued to undergo development since that time. The announcement in February 2022 that staking will be developed extensively was a significant step in the after-launch development of Tectonic crypto. Users who have staked tokens are eligible for a passive income that is supported by the loan costs paid by borrowers.Early users who took part in the wallet snapshot in January 2022 were eligible to receive a token airdrop, which could be staked according to the user’s preferences. The token airdrop received a contribution equal to 0.1% of the total quantity of tokens. In the near future, Tectonic plans to strengthen the community governance system it has in place. For instance, in the not-too-distant future, it is anticipated that certain aspects of the collateral factor would be managed by the community.This, as well as other parts of governance, are dependent on the platform’s ability to continue to expand. Tectonic is also working toward the establishment of an insurance fund, as was discussed earlier. The insurance fund will receive a contribution equal to 10% of the total amount that is charged for loan interest. In the event that a loan cannot be repaid, the insurance fund will contribute more money to the liquidity pool that serves those funds. This will be beneficial to the platform’s overall financial health moving forward.The creators of Tectonic crypto prioritized the development of a platform that gives stakeholders and the community of TONIC crypto holders control over the governance of the network. In order to determine each component of the Tectonic protocol, the development team held discussions with members of the community and various stakeholders. This covers the distribution of tokens, the collateralization ratio, the interest rate structure, and other important features of the platform’s functionality.The design and architecture of the Tectonic protocol are derived from Compound, which is a well-established protocol that has been subjected to exhaustive auditing and testing. Tectonic protocol is an innovative protocol that intends to provide its users with a number of benefits, such as rapid loans and the guarantee of a consistent stream of passive income. This is one of the ways that Tectonic protocol hopes to fulfill the demands of its customers.TONIC Crypto TokenomicsThe Tectonic platform is a Cronos-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) system. Its native token is referred to as TONIC. At launch, there were a total of 500 trillion TONIC tokens available for purchase. The Tectonic crypto team was awarded a portion of the tokens equal to 23% of the total. 13% of the tokens went to the ecosystem reserve. Another 13% is dedicated to the upkeep and protection of the network. In addition, as was stated before, the airdrop only utilized 0.1% of the total token supply.The remaining 50.9% is available for use as rewards and incentives for the community. Lending and borrowing are two activities that can be assisted through the utilization of tokens. Those that contribute tokens are rewarded with a passive income for their efforts, but those who borrow liquidity can utilize their cryptocurrencies for shorting, initial coin offerings (ICOs), yield farming, or staking.Is Tectonic Crypto Legitimate?A significant number of cryptocurrency users and investors cite their primary worry as being security. After undergoing stringent auditing and testing, the Compound protocol has earned the justifiable reputation of being one of the most secure protocols currently in operation. Given that the Tectonic crypto protocol derives from the Compound protocol, it already has a comprehensive set of safety precautions.In addition, SlowMist, a security assessor for blockchain ecosystems, has confirmed that Tectonic’s security procedures are adequate by conducting an audit on the platform. Despite the fact that these precautions have been taken to ensure safety, it is essential to remember that the Tectonic protocol has only been operational since December 2021. The platform, as well as the token, are both still undergoing continuous development.In addition, despite the fact that it is utilized for both the generation of passive income and for borrowing, the usability of the platform has not yet been fully demonstrated, and it is continuing to develop as the team works to advance its expansion. Users should proceed with extreme caution until the Tectonic platform has been thoroughly validated despite the fact that it is a legitimate platform.Is TONIC Crypto a Good Investment?Due to the exceptionally low price of a TONIC token at the moment, purchasing a significant quantity of tokens now involves only a marginal financial outlay. Although an increase in price is anticipated over the next few years, there is a high degree of uncertainty around it. However, because there is such a low barrier to entry, the risk that is taken on by investors is relatively low.TONIC crypto holders are eligible for financial benefits provided by Tectonic crypto. For instance, the benefits of staking can be used to generate passive income, and extra returns can be obtained by securing tokens in vaults. Borrowers will be accountable for paying interest on any funds that they borrow; nevertheless, they will also benefit from the loans that they take out.For instance, they can borrow against their TONIC tokens for potentially profitable farming, staking, and other activities without having to cash in their tokens first. Tectonic incorporates a number of different procedures and features that serve to protect the authenticity of its liquidity pool. This gives those who stake coins and contribute to the pool the backing they need for their investments.Among the preventative steps are the forthcoming distribution of an insurance fund and the implementation of a liquidity mechanism. In the long run, it is possible that purchasing TONIC tokens will be financially profitable for the investor. However, because there are a lot of things that could influence the value of the token, there are certain concerns to think about.In addition, despite the existence of the Tectonic Insurance Fund and the liquidity mechanism, there is still the possibility of incurring a loss from the liquidity pool. This risk is a result of how recently the platform was released. In light of these considerations, users of the TONIC token should approach decisions regarding investments with a cautious approach.The Future of Tectonic CryptoIn the cryptocurrency industry, Tectonic crypto is a well-designed platform, and both its design and its functionality have evolved over time since the platform’s initial launch. The formation of an insurance fund that will be funded by the interest that borrowers pay is one of the upcoming changes that are scheduled to be implemented in Tectonic. To be more specific, 10% of that interest will be collected, and it will function as financial assurance in the event that a portion of the loans is not liquidated effectively.Additionally, developers are working on the creation and launch of a staking system that will allow holders of TONIC tokens to earn incentives. This mechanism is currently in the works. As a result of the way this feature of the platform is designed, users are incentivized to keep their holdings, which ultimately contributes to a larger liquidity pool. These are only a few of the many Tectonic developments that are now in the planning stages.In the not-too-distant future, the collateral component that must be met in order to borrow liquidity from the Tectonic pool will also be adjusted. Specifically, the team responsible for managing the platform is in charge of determining the criteria and ratios for the collateral component. In the not-too-distant future, they will be controlled through the procedures of community government.The developers of Tectonic crypto are constantly engaging in discussions with the community and the many parties involved in the project in order to discover new possibilities for expansion and advancement. Despite the fact that Tectonic is a relatively new cryptocurrency platform, it has been thoughtfully developed with both safety and functionality in mind. It gives customers the opportunity to earn passive income as well as instantaneously borrow cryptocurrency assets. It is a platform with a lot of potential right now and in the future thanks to its numerous existing features as well as the planned developments.FAQsWhat is Tectonic?Tectonic is an algorithmic money market system that is decentralized and does not include custodial services.
