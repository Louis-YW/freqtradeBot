But I believe if the country had just one unified religion things would have changed a bit. So my country people make una reason this matter how e for be if to say we get one Religion. To me religion is not the course of dispute in our society. In as much as we don't speak same language, there is actually no way everyone can belong to one religion. Individuals can still live together happily irrespective of their various religion. There is absolutely no way everyone can believe in one thing because of the way we were brought up. I mean something you believe and it works for you how can someone convince you to leave it and join what he or she believes that works for them as well. Let's take for an instance someone that grows up seeing the parents worshipping idols and all their practices are in consonant with how they believe the idol works for them and surely it does works for them, you can see that there's no way you can tell such a family to deviate from what works for them. Likewise, someone that grows up in a Christian home seeing the family being committed to things of God like going to church, worshipping God and praising God and being hopeful that God alone can answer their prayers, you will see that it will be very hard to convince such person to leave Christianity and follow whatever you believe as well. So I believe if we can still live together even marry each other irrespective of our languages, our tribes and our ethnic group, we can still progress together despite our various religious beliefs  (religion). What matters most is bringing forth things that will bring progress and development in the society.",

Religion is not not our problem as a people, a lot of Nigerians are religious tolerant, there is great unity in our diversity.  The average Nigerian knows the problem of Nigeria, religion is the least. When those of them in power want to share the national cake, they don't look at religion. Let no one deceive you that our situation as a people is religious related.The Christians and Muslims in Nigeria are living in harmony, Goodluck Jonathan was a Christian president in Nigeria, did Nigeria turn to London during his time, the answer is no. Same thing when Buhari was president of Nigeria, as a Muslim president what was the difference, nothing.So look inward careful, you will see our problem but religion is the least of it.",

Islam and Christian religion no be even our religion so why we go accept only one, we get our traditional religion and other religions that are peaceful. No be say dem popular go make use think say they're better. We get Hinduism, Sikhism, Atheism, Buddhism etc dem many and accepting all legally go do more good then banning others and only accepting one, e go limit our thinking growth.

You dey suggest say make the religion dey unified as you feel say conflict go dey reduced that way but I see say e no go fit dey easy. Why? All religions get their accepted dogma wey followers sopoz adhere to without question and this dey lead to inflexibility and intolerance to other beliefs so e go hard to convince people to forsake their religion for another.

Some no no book and them no also get sence. And na this set of people naim dey leed us. Am them dey power dey suppress the educated ones because the have money generated out of greediness. They no the truth and always hide it. Because if the truth is reviled they will not enjoy what dey have embesled. this set of people have bought the military, judiciary, and electoral system. When someone owns all this thing I mentioned above in a country how can dey progress? This arms of government were made for justice not for privacy.So in conclusion to wetting op dey talk, religious unity no ft make the country better pass like this.

Is Afghanistan not a Muslim country, didn't they have dispute within the country? They fought each other every day because of politics, so forget this subjects narrative.If you think religion is the problem of Nigeria then you have not been to many places in Nigeria. You see ignorance and ethnicity, these are the two major problems of this country. Religion is fuel by ignorance, when you meet with educated man + religious person, you will understand that religion is just what people put on faces when they are ignarant. Whether it's from a Muslim or Christian, they are both peaceful people, only the ignorance and religious extremist bring problems.Another problem of this country is ethnicity, if you Participated in the last election, you will understand how bitter and tribal bigots some regions are when it comes to anything that is beneficial to the country, we fight each other as if we don't value our friendship, our culture and believes but when an outsiders offended us, we all become one and fight for injustice. For example, look at Mohbad death and how everyone forgot tribes and fourth for justice for him, that's what voice of the people can do instead of the daily abuse on social media especially on Twitter(now called X).",
