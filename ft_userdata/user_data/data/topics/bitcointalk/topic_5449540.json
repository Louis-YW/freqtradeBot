  "content": "Hi everyone,Today I want to introduce a website where you can register your digital products and sell them using Bitcoin.This website is similar to the old Satoshi box and also has an onion domain for anonymous access.Basically you can give a Bitcoin wallet address to the website and when a customer makes a successful payment, he gets access to the product and the amount will be sent to your bitcoin wallet address automatically.On this website you can create an account and manage your products and share product links in other platforms so customers can buy your products through the website.website:https://satoshitext.com/",
