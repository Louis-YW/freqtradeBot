  "content": "I'd like to clarify that this topic is distinguished from businesses or entrepreneurs involved in gambling as businesses, such as casino companies, etc., but with a focus on gamblers. I know there are many people who regard themselves as professionals at playing gambling games, but do you ever think that one can make gambling a full-time job and career because of his or her deep knowledge of the games? Can someone bet with little or no loss because it is one of the most unpredictable games to play?Gambling to my understanding, is a trial-and-error game with uncertain outcomes, unpredictability, and luck. Therefore, professional gamblers must exhibit a deeper than usual understanding of the games, the statistical probabilities, and a high level of risk management skills.However, it is critical to realize the risks involved, which include unstable financial circumstances and potential addiction problems. So, pursuing a gambling career should be approached with serious caution, and gamblers ought to be well-informed about the accompanying problems. Furthermore, I believe that having various sources of income and taking calculated risks will be highly beneficial.But, in a broader sense, can you make gambling a career path, abandoning all other sources of income to focus entirely on it?If so, why?If not, please advise!",

I know there are many people who regard themselves as professionals at playing gambling games, but do you ever think that one can make gambling a full-time job and career because of his or her deep knowledge of the games?My classmate was a guy of such sort. He really dedicated all his time to figuring out how to beat slot machines, exploring various loopholes. Nevertheless, he eventually ended up producing slot machines himself. This is an example of how a dedicated gamer, spending a lot of time searching for the perfect strategy in the game and turning the game into his actual job, ultimately understood the system so well that he switched sides and stopped playing.",

Moreover, they also understand how to manage their bankroll and to that extent they can be claiming professional. It is not a full time job even though some gamblers who don't have other source(s) of income have seen it that way of trier to know if it can help them to survive but really, it is not long lasting.",

Gambling is more risky than trading and even casinos provide Provably Fair games for gamblers, the risk is still higher than trading.It's harder to beat the casino games than beating the market and I believe we know beating the market in trading is not easy. You can get profit with investment in the market but in trading, it is super harder and very minority of traders get profit with trading.With gambling, gambling responsible is a vital condition and if a gambler fails to do it, losing a life money will come as a consequence of irresponsible gambling. Building a career, a full time job with gambling is harder than building a career, a full time job with trading or investment as gambling is more probability-based than trading.",

Even if we are smart enough to play gambling, we can only increase the chance or possibility of winning, and there is no guarantee at all. And if we talk about work, then we have to know clearly about what we will do and how much wages we will get, while in gambling it is full of uncertainties, where we can lose and we can also have the opportunity to win. Where sometimes the amount of loss we experience is much greater than the profits we get while gambling.And if you consider that this gambling is a sure source of income and so you make gambling a career path, so you prefer to leave all other sources of income and focus entirely on gambling. Then I'm sure that in just a few short years you won't be able to afford to go back to the casino because you've run out of capital to do so.So my advice is to continue to assume that gambling is just a means to get pleasure. And only in Play in your free time without having to interfere with other activities",

You see, gambling is a game of wits, probability, and luck. Even if you are smart and have a skill in a game, you will never win if you don't have luck and you are not in the probability of winning. For anyone who's dreaming of making money in gambling and being a professional, we can't stop them. The only thing we can do is give them advice and warning on what path they will take because gambling will only give you two paths: the path to wealth and the path to poverty. For me, I don't recommend gambling as a profession. No, not all have a shot at it. Just treat gambling as a plaything; play whenever you have extra money. Who knows, you may hit a jackpot someday, but don't hope.",

Although you have the freedom of choice but try to choose something more reasonable and use your common sense in thinking to consider whatever place is suitable or not to make a profession.Especially if you have a family which of course your responsibilities are quite large in the real world, you need money for sure and must always be there when the need calls you, while the results of gambling are always unpredictable, what if you are always difficult to get lucky? I can't imagine what your condition will be full of various pressures whether it's from the pressure of need or pressure from the impact of gambling which will greatly interfere with your mental and psychological. So the point is that this profession is really not recommended, it's better to find a sure thing that can give you a fixed salary without the risk of gambling for your safety as well.",
