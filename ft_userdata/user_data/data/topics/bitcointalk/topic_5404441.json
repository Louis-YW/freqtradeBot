Having access to the recharge system and rake back can be quite appealing to potential buyers.No, It's not appealing at all, It will be stressful for the new buyer especially if the account is already KYC or even if it's not because of the sudden change of the IP of the user that might freeze the account once the casino notice this changes. The casino account is non-transferable or not for sale. The OP can recover the account too by claiming that he was hacked since he has the original IP or KYC that will prove the real ownership of this account.This is a gamble while you are already gambling.",
