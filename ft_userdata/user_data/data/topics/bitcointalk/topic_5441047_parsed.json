But i still feel insecure inside of me...(and i know adding a passphrase or using 256bits will even double down the security, totally get it)I'm still not sure if someday i wake up, all my funds could have all gone..",

On the other hand, how safe you keep your keys can also determine if your coins gets stolen or not. The people you think are the most trusted can be the ones to steal from you.so when It comes to your wallet or anything related to your coins, you should keep them personal. Even your wife can be a treat, I don't trust anyone when it comes to funds lol.Quote from: AicecreaME on February 24, 2023, 05:36:17 AMDon't store all the eggs in just one basket, and as long as you're using a hardwallet or cold wallet, rest assure it is safe as long as you keep your private keys safe as well.

And yes you shouldn't keep all your assets in one wallet, try sharing them in different secured location. This is very important so even when one of your wallet gets hacked or stolen, you would be rest assured that you still have something to hope on. But by Gods grace, non of our funds will be stolen.",

Bank passwords are only allowed 8 characters no more and no less, and of course, most use a combination of birth date or first child's name, or some other combination of numbers and letters. But some people don't worry about that, but with bitcoin private keys that use 128-bit keys, they still hesitate and feel less secure. Bitcoin keys use RSA and ECDSA technology which is the most secure key chains today because if you want to brute-force it takes tens or even hundreds of years for ordinary computers, but for Quantum Computers it only takes years. and Quantum computers are also not cheap and not sold commercially. Then, why are some people still intimidated by 128-bit keys and want more? They may be too paranoid that nothing is safe. No system is safe, but the main security is the users themselves. It is the user's job how each password is secured properly and not exposed by others. One of them is by securing the device used. If the user is careless, then it is not the system that is less secure but the user himself does not maximize it.",
