It seems you are under some kind influence! Money launderers do not use Bitcoin. They have access to better tools and currencies to launder money. Have you ever heard of Zcash or XMR? Have you ever heard of NFT, especially those nonsense JPG images? These are way better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not much useful for money laundering to be honest. Don't believe everything you see on movies. They are just as useless as your perception about Bitcoin. Get a life! Cheers!",

If I go with your definition then we also have dirty fiat, dirty gold, dirty silver and dirty... what not? Are you sure bitcoin is the only way to launder the money. Money laundering has been around since very long and they continue to do so no matter what type of currency they their hands on. I am seeing a discussion where they are always blaming the bitcoin. However, criminals has already broken then code of using the fiat for such activities. At least in the case of Bitcoin it can be traced back from the sources however same is highly difficult when it comes to old notes in the fiat. In case of precious metals like gold, you can literally have unmarked assets at your hands to launder the money. People are even setting up fake businesses and paying the bills amongst each other so that they can launder the money and even pay the taxes for same. I think Bitcoin is really new to the field and should be targeted less as compare to previously available modes of transaction.",

Whatever the reason buddy take a sip of whatever you drank before the post and go to bed because your parents will be angry if they found you posting shit and nonsense by using their PC or smartphone.Keep in mind also Bitcoin is not for the Kids..

If you use it for a bad purpose, it will become bad. You said it yourself, people can use money too for dirty business. Does that make money bad? NO, obviously not. I don't know what you are trying to say here just by pointing out Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin can be sent and received anonymously, and it could be sent at any location on earth. It is an easy way to stay out of the radar and do illegal transactions. But as it is in circulation, those coins could end up in any wallet. So why would that make any difference? It only matters how you got that Bitcoin, and for what purpose you are using it for. If you want to trade and grow your money, just do that. Why should you be concerned if it comes from a dirty wallet? Bitcoin is decentralized and as long as you can keep it decentralized, this won't matter.
