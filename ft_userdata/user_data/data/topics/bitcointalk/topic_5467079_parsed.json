I do not think using AI is bad if it can provide authentic data that can speed up our working force. There is some negative impact on our society that can be alarming after a few days. The development of creativity and creative thinking in the human mind will be less important because people will try to use AI for that. Our society will be so heavily dependent on AI that certain skills will fade away from human nature and AI will replace them.",

I recently wrote an article about the Impact of AI on the job sector. And in writing of that article (during research), I found that QuoteAI might replace 85 million jobs by 2025, but in the same report, they say it will also generate 97 million new jobs too. This means we are going to create 12 million new jobs with the rise of AI.sourceI hope these statements have cleared your doubts about AI. And believe me, AI might have destroyed the constructive reasoning of some students but those who have progressive mindsets are using AI to increase their productivity. You tell me, if you can easily find an error and correct it using AI then why would you spend a hell lot of time on AI? And as a content writer, I also thought that AI would replace us, but not, people still need content writers and they also hire people to write AI content for them. This means, people can make AI content but it needs proofreading which can not be done by every person. Only those who have the skills can do it.",

There are numerous advantages it can bring to any organization or individual but then, when you think of cost of maintenance and how it's performance rate is limited, there's a rethink to whether a purchase is worth it. I've not been acutely affected by AI but a friend in the medical field was affected as they were forced to give up their jobs because the organization felt it was a way to save money since AI does most of their duties. I wouldn't call AI a menace yet, an upgraded way to hasten up tasks? Yes. But in life, what has its pros will have cons that would outweigh the good in some cases.",

I see it being used at my workplace for all sorts of things, some people are asking it to write database queries for them and while it is quite good, using some advanced techniques, it still has room for improvement and for company purposes you cannot give it too much proprietary data. It's also been excellent for writing articles or even in certain circumstances giving the outline for a personal review - if you plug in the right criteria it can get very close to human writing styles.",

The designer is still needed. They may be able to generate an image based on prompt input, but as far as I am concerned, they still lack the ability to generate a wonderful logo. Besides, there are other aspects like User Experience, which require human perception.This also applies to code. Any system that is complex enough, and even a bare essential functionality of a simple system needs to be tested. The one who has the ability is of course the engineer. It would be a catastrophe if a system is purely coded by an AI without human intervention. By human intervention, is the thing that sensitive for example security and many other things.",

And this has happened to school students who use AI more often than using their brains to complete their assignments.This can hinder the development of the human brain, which should be able to be more creative in making things. But because AI can help them complete each task, they leave it to AI to complete it. The convenience provided by AI seems to tempt humans to look for solutions through AI without any desire to try it themselves.Gradually, humans will become too lazy to do anything because AI can do everything well and quickly.

It depends on how we use it, because in my experience, AI really helps a lot if its utilized properly and accordingly. It makes every work easier and faster, but it doesn't mean that we always have to be dependent to it because its purpose is to serve as an aid for us and not to be a total replacement. So, to answer that question, AI has affected my job positively. The question here right now is, to what extent should we use AI?",

I also don't use it for my PhD-related work of writing academic texts. As a private tutor, I often use ChatGPT to help me brainstorm topics, summarize the information I find, come up with tasks. I don't use whatever it gives me, it's more like I cherry-pick what I need, and add something myself, but it's still useful. As a translator, I sometimes consult with ChatGPT about specific fragments of text or terms to brainstorm potential interpretations and translations.

According to my understanding, Al is a generation that creates stupidity for students in the future.The economy will be destroyed when the next generation of children will only rely on Al, they will not have intellectual thoughts in developing the economy in the future, they will only rely on Al as a method of thinking.",
