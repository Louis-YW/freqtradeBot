I couldn't find a topic where we discussed this, but in general the advice is to use a search outside the forum.Maybe these two topics can be useful.A Complete Guideline to use forum search button properly[Tips] Guide for forum search",

For example, you can filter out results based on post's age. Message age is set at 0 to 9999 days by default, so it searches through the entire history of forum. You might want to change it to 0 to 30, for example, and you will get posts within the last month.

We all know the forum is not really modern and having all the features that is why the new forum software is in progress until that we can use the alternative ways as mentioned above.",

In fact, he can also find out how many people have used the word \"sir\" since the tool was created by Tryninja. I rarely use forum search features to find anything faster including bitcoin addresses or even something like that. So ninjastic.space has been helping me all along. Credit to Tryninja for providing such a great tool to this community.",

I have tried a couple of times myself and, it's on the contrary.Could you believe i was trying to search some names (although this function has been opposing everyone's privacy and I guess it was made not synchronize any longer) I couldn't find the names in question instead, I was given different names , dormant accounts etc. It doesn't really look like it's working,. Does it?Talk more of key-words.I'm not seeing an efficacy in the search engines at all; yunno, it's different it when you're not sure of what you're looking for - if it'd be there or not - but , it's a different case trying to find something I'm sure I could get but, the results turns out null. Maybe ninjastick would save our ass? I haven't tested it either.Sandra 👩‍🦱",

I’d say it is a deliberate delimitation to save on resources or whatnot.As a side note, there is a site that was mentioned on the forum years ago, that surprisingly is still running, and allegedly pretends to facilitate searching the forum. I won’t mention the name, because I don’t intend to give it any nominal publicity (I’d still consider it dodgy), but it seems built on smf and returns 10 pages of results by default (100 results per page). You can page until the 100th page easily before encountering an error. The point being that Bitcointalk's 5 page limitation on search results seems deliberate.",
