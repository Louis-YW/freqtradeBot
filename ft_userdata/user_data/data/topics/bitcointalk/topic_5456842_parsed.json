She asked questions about which projects I am currently buying and if I know anything about crypto mining and these brought us good discussions for a while, later she claimed she no longer work for MEXC that she is now a Binance Employee..at first it makes sense because this discussion lasted for months. I let all this in because she helped, I never let my guide down in any way, I was also waiting for a possible scam habit like referring me to a link, sending me a suspicious link, or a copycat website to steal my fund, I don't trust anyone online.Fast forward to days ago, I brought up the issue surrounding Binance and SEC, for discussion sake, you know, to learn one or two things, to my own surprise, she knew nothing about that, this was where things aren't looking right, she never knew that Binance got sued.That's when I started asking questions, and she end up blocking me, I guess we are having those good conversations for months to make me lose my guard, she must be waiting for a perfect time to use me and rob me.Since she once helped me, she planned to use that on me and take advantage of me I guess, this is where I learned that not following what is happening in the crypto space as an investor is wrong.It's good to always stay informed about what's happening around crypto lately, get a crypto news app on your phone or subscribe to crypto news feeds online to stay informed, this person was busted because she knew nothing that's presently happening with the exchange company she claimed she is working for.",

A determine scammer can go an extra mile just to convince you that they are  legit they can even do what you never expected from them. One thing I do is to avoid any messages I recieve from those that claim they work with the company without any proof, the only time I reply them is when I'm bored a feel the need to make a mockery of them by giving them replies that make it seems like I am really falling for their scam. It always funny to read their reply when they finally found out that I have been playing all along.QuoteIt's good to always stay informed about what's happening around crypto lately, get a crypto news app on your phone or subscribe to crypto news feeds online to stay informed, this person was busted because she knew nothing that's presently happening with the exchange company she claimed she is working for.  Learning more about you're involved in does not just protect you from scammers ( like in your case ) it also help you t be aware of any new event that might affect your business, and also help you make perfect decisions most times.",

      "body": "Former Binance employee here. The first red flag shoud have been that she pretends to work with Binance just after the end of her contract with MEXC. If you already worked for some CEXs, you know that you won't be hired before at least 6 months (in general but could be more long depending of the position) after your precedent contract with another CEX. MEXC and Binance respect this. This is to avoid the exchanges of sensitives or strategic informations between companies (even if you are just a chat support agent, no matter which position you had in the company).Even if they are for the same financial group / owners, it is not tolerated to switch between CEXs quickly.You cannot stop to work for MEXC and one week after start to work for Coinbase/Binance for example, your contract makes that forbidden and this is not negociable. The second CEX won't hire you because of that ; and it is quite a small world, it is difficult to hide your previous positions with other companies.+ people working for customer support for Binance are not allowed to tell other people on the internet that they do this job during their contract, they would be potentially targeted if they did something like that (imagine how many people would harass them with bullshit questions or trying to access their network etc.. etc..)",

This kind of apps end up creating FUD in the industry and you panic and lose your funds. I did not subscribe to this news channels neither do I even send them. If I have important information to know I would create a thread here and I will get the answer needed. Besides I don't think that bitcoin is ending today and there is no FUD against bitcoin and I am a long-time investor who is not interested in day-to-day price.
