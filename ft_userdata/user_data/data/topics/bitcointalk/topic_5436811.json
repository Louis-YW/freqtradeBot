That is unacceptable.Zelensky must show some balls and arrest the corrupted officials.They should not be tried for just corruption but economic sabotage and treason. These official are aware that Ukraine solely depends on aid from other nations to survive, yet they had the impetus to steal from a bleeding nation. These official inflated contracts and collected bribes thereby sabotaging the struggling economy of Ukraine. They have also betrayed the country because Ukraine trusted them and entrusted the destiny of this suffering citizens to them, but they betrayed the people. My only fear is that the citizens and the military might start loosing confidence in the government of Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy which would have a negative effect in the battlefield. If soldiers no longer trust thier leaders, they will not fight like patriots. I also pray Zelenskyy's hands are clean because if it is discovered that he is also involved in this criminal activity, it might be the beginning of the end of Ukraine resistance.",
