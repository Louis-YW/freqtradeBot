IMO, I see bitcoin as a life savior for us to get away from this inflation trap because banks are making money out of thin air which makes the value of money to go lower and lower while our salaries are increasing proportional to the inflation so who bought money years back now made a life fortune out of it.2. It highly depends on what the other countries do because if the countries push cryptocurrencies towards regulations and making it as legal then our government may have no choice than following the trend.3. Yes, I managed to increasing my earnings at least 30 to 40% per annum by trading the crypto currencies but regretting about missing the earlier trains.4. It is subjective to every individual and how they spend their money and bitcoin is just a tool to save the value of money so if they use it wisely then for sure it can get you fincnaical freedom and I beleive it in the same way.",

      "body": "What do you guys think about Bitcoin?An amazing innovation that has changed the way finance used to look a decade back. At the moment it is one of the most transparent ways to do trade & make payments online.What do you think the government will do about Bitcoin or other crypto in the next 5 years time?In my opinion, it is hard to predict what government would do about Bitcoin as I feel they are clueless about it. One thing I am certain that they would come up with regulations but that would take some time.  Has Bitcoin changed your living standard?Yes, to an extent it has changed the way I was living a few years back and I think it would continue to upgrade my living standard in the coming years. Do you think Bitcoin can get you financial freedom?Financial freedom is a distant dream for me as I joined this bandwagon very late. If I had been part of its ecosystem in 2011 then I could have achieved somewhat financial freedom in 2023.",
