  "content": "1. Choose stats based on the betSounds simple enough, but a lot of times, we don’t study the right stats. For example, let’s say we’re thinking of betting over or under an MLB pitcher prop.The total is 10.5 strikeouts. The most important stat to study isn’t how many strikeouts the pitcher averages, but how many strikeouts the pitcher has had versus today’s opponent.We must take it even further for the stats to be more relevant. How many strike outs has the pitcher had versus today’s playing opponents. Baseball players don’t play ever day. They often do, but not all the time and turnover happens a lot in a 162 game season.Always think of and choose relevant stats based on the wager.2. Look at relevant stats in relation to each otherWe can continue with our MLB pitcher example to illustrate the second most important use of stats on our list. But let’s switch it up.Let’s talk about an NFL against the spread bet. Suppose Team A is -3.5 to cover the spread against Team B.You determine the most important stat is Team A’s ability to pass the ball. Team A ranks second in passing yards per game. Ah, but after looking at Team B’s passing defense stat, you realize Team B is excellent defending against the pass.Do you ditch the bet? Not necessarily. What if you see that Team A’s RB1 averages 5.4 yards per carry? Now what do you do?The most relevant stat in a situation like this isn’t even a stat. It’s the head coaches and offensive coordinators ability to change strategy depending on the opponent. So if the HC and OC are willing to lean on the rushing attack to open up the passing attack, your bet on Team A might still be a good play.3. Use trends to support or deny the validity of statistical informationLet’s say you see that the head coach and offensive coordinator have leaned on the passing attack in every game of the season. They leaned on the passing attack last season.That doesn’t mean they won’t change the strategy for this particular game. But it does mean the chances of the two changing the strategy isn’t great.So you could be making a losing bet. Stats may be valid overall, the Bills did average over 28 points per game last season, but may not be valid for every game, the Bills also scored less than 28 in 7-of-17 regular season games.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/3ac5d62",

      "body": "The last part you cut out in your post was the best part of the guide. We sometimes forget the other factors that make the bet fail and overestimate the favorites. On the other hand, it's worth pushing your luck at times because players can pop off at the right time and it could last for several games. Others take advantage of it whenever they see the same lines being offered because the odds providers can take a few days or weeks before they notice something off.Quote from: nitrobetting on September 03, 2023, 09:52:22 PMDo you ditch the bet? Not necessarily. What if you see that Team A’s RB1 averages 5.4 yards per carry? Now what do you do?When i'm in this situation, i'd usually buy a point because I always get the feeling they'll fall short in covering the original line but still cover the alternate lines.",

      "body": "There are simply too many human elements that might influence the outcome of every Sport event. You are focused on the historical statistics, but the \"human\" element can drastically influence that. A lot of pitchers and players hide the fact that they have \"hidden\" injuries that influence their game or they might not be in a good head space (something happening in their personal life) and even if they are professionals, this still influence their performance. Yes, the historical data can give you a trend to work with, but any player can have a off day.",

The thing is sports data won't tell you what will happen in a match tomorrow. You will only stay ahead of some people who have no clue.You are still at risk of losing your money because you don't know how the team or the fighter will play it's game.

But using stats only would result in instant losses in my opinion.What's the point of checking if the stats support your bet or not if you have already made the bet? Stats are supposed to be checked before making the bet so that you can find good reasoning for placing your bet on a certain team or a player (if it's a PvP match) based on the stats that you have analyzed. If you already know the teams and players and have decided to place your bet just based on that, you don't need to check any stats after already making the bet.However, I don't recommend making a bet without doing proper research and analyzing the facts and figures from the past about both teams playing so that after you make the bet, you may have peace of mind that you have selected the right team and have placed your bet on the perfect candidate.",

Basing up on my own behavior in terms of betting on sports then i do usually making this kind of stuff on where trying out to compare stats on which who do have the upperhand or on which one is really the underdog for a particular match.Although there are really that ways or methods on how a bettor would be handling out himself on times that they would really be choosing up their bets.",
