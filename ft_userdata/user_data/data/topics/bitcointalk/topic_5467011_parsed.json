  "content": "So you have been a gambler for at least 1year. Before Covid, you were a regular at the physical casino in your locality. You gambled with fiat. But when Covid hit, you discovered online casinos. You didn't need to gamble with fiat anymore but with cryptocurrencies. You tried out many online casinos but finally settled for one or two. There's no perfect casinos but you have stuck with this one occasionally trying out new casinos as advertised on the forum or out there but you still return to your favorite casinos. What are the features in your favorite casinos that you like that makes you keep going back and what are the features that you don't like at your favorite casino but you overlook them and still play there?",

As for casinos only, I generally like the ones that I have used before. One thing that I noticed about casinos is that the games are offered by third party and the casino sites are not poor but good. What that can let me like a casino more is their promotional offers.",

Being able to deposited,  wager and withdrawals without kyc is what make me to stick with any casinos be it for short term and long-term base,  even though the casino is a KYC casino but still allows me to play for a specific period and under strict regulations.",

I can move tokens from my fav to Stake. How expensive it will be to move those tokens around into your casino wallet,  I talking about the gas fees from your staking pool to your online casino wallet,  this could only be helpful and considerable if the token is owned by the casino and being given some form of bonuses since it the native token of the casinos. I also sought after such casinos that offer special bonuses for those gambling using the native coins against other deposit coins,  because this will motivate the players to buy into the tokens and at the same time earn special rewards for their usage on the casino.",

It's just something that is there and you might not be able to request anything. It's going to be a constant trigger to you if you always notice it or something.Personally, I don't really like the withdrawal fees. It's just somewhat annoyed by it because you need to have an amount for it that would be deducted from your balance. I got no choice but I think the casinos can manage to do something about it if they pool it together or something. Idk.",

      "body": "As someone who has a fast internet connection, I dislike the games that still take a long time to load their content properly. It's not the platform per se, but more on the provider's end. I've experienced this with slots more frequently, and I don't know why they don't cache these games into the platform or whatever tech they need to do, but it would help the end user get to the game quicker. Another thing is some of the UI/UX elements that just doesn't work properly. It gets fixed after a day or two, especially the dropdowns if raised to the proper channels. But when you need them to work, they sometimes don't, and you'll have to find a work around (e.g. for withdrawals tab or deposits tab) else you're going to waste your money or you'll never have access to those funds.",

Active support whenever you do need itIn speaking about those issues or something that i dont like then which is sending me out those email letters even i havent checked out that subscription link or button.Dont know on why they do enforce it out but its not something that a big issue for me as long you would really be that comfortable on where you are playing at then this what matter the most. There are really sites that would really be able to hook out our interest and despite on having  tons of options in the marketbut still we do really end up on going back into the place which we do feel comfortable and contented.

And since over time,  I have deposited and withdrawn from stake without being asked for any form of KYC at any point in time,  this makes me feel more secure and privacy-oriented.",

I don't know the reason behind it but I'm just going in with the flow. Same game provider, same online casino game, same strategy - these were all effective only on my preferred casinos right now.

I also don't mind having to submit KYC if Casinos like DuelBit, stake or roobet because they are popular casinos at the moment. Regarding the UI, it will be a problem or challenge for every casino.
