Basketball Sportsbots were giving 600$/month profit share and now 27$. Ice Hockey, from 500 to 9$…. Is this due to an internal decision to decrease sharing profits with sportsbots or decrease in revenue?Rollbit also publish their daily sports revenue. If someone were to follow them, he would know if they decreased dramatically as well or not. I remember when I first bought it was supposed to be 10% profit share with the sportsbots.",

You can check the announcement for the Rollbot or if there's a term written about Rollbot profit sharing that it will decrease the percentage on a certain date. It's either Rollbit profit decrease significantly or they adjust the percentage unknowingly.You can refer to this https://whitepaper.rollbot.com/rollbot/sports-rollbots/utility/profit-sharing",

OP it is not everything need topic creation. Now you want Rolllbit to come here to answer or you want \"we\" the forum users to answer you? As the first commentator said it, you would have used the thread as comment in Rollbit ANN thread which would have given you instant answer to your question. Anything profit share is a personal decision by the company and it is not for the gamblers to involve in it. Or you would have contact the customer care service to know the reason. There are some things (questions) you have to use your five organs. Well I am not aware of what you bring to the forum. But probably others might have heard. So the needed answer will be given.",

I remember when I first bought it was supposed to be 10% profit share with the sportsbots.Its called 'profit share' for a reasonIm not sure which month are you referring that $600/month and $500/month profit share from but if it was a couple of months before thats probably because all the reguler football league were on break thus people switch to another sports to bet on and because the reguler season has already started, probably they shift back to it thus lowering the volume on some other sports.The other reason that I could think of is that the house is losing on both of those sports thus making the profit on it lower than usual which resulting in lower 'profit share'",

      "body": "Possibly there might have been a decrease or decline in profit sharing based on their terms of agreement but any ways that is non of our business here as it solely concerns the rollbit board of directors and co. This should not have warranted a new thread as the subject matter does not in any ways concerns the public or if it does would it not have been better you nourish your curiosity on their announcement thread so that their representative would attend to your inquest with immediate effect.If I may ask, are you a share holder, investor or what?  Because these questions are basically asked by them to inquiring to know what must have warranted such a decision but however, it would make no meaning asking because as a shareholder or investor, you already know what really is going on and the resolution behind such decision.",

So if Rollbit have reduced they profit merging it then means that the revenue of the casino has decreased and they have to reduce their expenditure to meet up with operational demands.",

      "body": "When I saw this thread, I had a thought of it because it is obvious how the shares could just reduce that way with a long margin. It is possible that there have been low turn up from fans who watch their games both online streaming and watching live from their sport center. Maybe just as other members reply says that this might be as a result of the fact that other other sports activities going on break which must have had a side effect on the games as at that  period. So in that case when there is low turn up, there is every tendency that the profit or revenue would be minimal compared to the previous ones. So therefore would be shared accordingly as received for that period.",
