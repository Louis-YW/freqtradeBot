Find a project, stock up on tools for bounty, such as google table, open a new topic, make sure that participants bounty fulfill the conditions, distribute rewards.",

Firstly, being a newbie means your forum rank has certain limitations as compared to other ranks. You can learn more about this in this topic: Forum ranks/positions/badges Secondly, since you have a non-existent forum reputation, it might be tough to get many project owners to work with you. Perhaps you could start by actively participating in the forum and building your rank, and then consider running bounty campaigns? I hope this suggestion helps.",

So high likely that you are just wasting your time.",

If you don't have any of these, there's really no way for you to get into the role as you need people to actually trust you to do things and handle finances on their behalf. If we're talking about the difficulty of the job, it certainly is one of the easiest thing to do there, and you just have to be organized in order to succeed. But what matters most is being fit for the job: are you trustworthy enough to take this role and would people do as you say so long as it's what the team needs?",

It's better for OP for first get himself familiar with each and everything within this forum as well as in cryptocurrency industry in general.",

First think you need to consider is your own weapon before asking any questions. Try putting your self as a project and imagine if you can hire yourself into becoming a bounty manager. Reputable bounty managers do have their own weapon such as experience, portfolio and more importantly skills to make projects choose them over others.",

Even with automating most things you would need to know how to deal with cheaters and i have no idea hot to verify original content especially in the time of artificial intelligence.
