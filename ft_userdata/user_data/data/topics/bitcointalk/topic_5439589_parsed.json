The fee is around 5%, no KYC and it's safe. Wallets such as Ledger, Atomic wallet, Exodus and others have this.It's much less stress than dealing with some obvious scammers.",

The user is a wallet with an exchange function from where there is a chance of scams. Can't, you see that a newbie (posting time of this thread) trying to take 1000$ while no one trusts a newbie for 5$ only? If OP can get 1000$ then what will happen to the sender?",
