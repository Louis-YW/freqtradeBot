You don't need to like enroll in reliable courses just to be able to understand crypto. Take advantage of this community, go to different threads, read and read. And maybe in the beginning, it's better to take notes and write it down so that you can go back if you forgot about something. Just save the money that you will enroll to courses and used it to invest it in bitcoin or crypto. Best of luck to your journey.",

Almost all (if not 100%) cryptocurrencies are scams, frauds, ponzi schemes, etc. Your best bet is to stick with bitcoin because it is the only asset that is truly decentralized so there is nobody that can print more on a whim and reduce the amount that you have in relation to the total of 21,000,000. That being said, I would start with a lot of reading here on this forum as well as all of the best bitcoin books: https://www.whatisbitcoin.com/best-bitcoin-books as well as a lot of the articles on Bitcoin Magazine: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/Beyond that, I would just suggest that you keep stay curious, keep asking questions, and be teachable. Bitcoin is a journey and takes a lot of time to fully understand and use so be patient and enjoy your journey. It's a truly beautiful experience.¬† Welcome to Bitcoin.",
