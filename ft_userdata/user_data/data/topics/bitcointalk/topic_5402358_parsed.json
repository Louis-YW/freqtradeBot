      "body": "The entire market is bleeding and not just Ethereum, but I think it is not good to pause withdrawals just because of the extreme market condition, I smell something fishy about it Hmmm, sounds like it has a looming crypto crisis when the market continues to dump in the following days, and all of this drama will cause widespread panic selling especially for novice users, Its just my speculation, but it's not far from happening, hopefully, the market will recover soon.",
