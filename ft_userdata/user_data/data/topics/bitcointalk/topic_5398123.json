Or maybe its an alloy. But they state weight is 15 grams. Must be 2 different sizes.I'm pretty sure there is only 1 size- 1/2 oz and metal is Ag- fine silver (0.999).  All the COA's I've come across seem to at the least have the following in common- 1/2 oz, Ag 0.999, and 40mm diameter.  The coin didn't seem overtly or abnormally thin but just a little thinner than a coin of similar diameter with a 1 oz weight.  My guess would be they traded 1/2 oz for selective gilding.  OP updated with PCGS coin info link.",
