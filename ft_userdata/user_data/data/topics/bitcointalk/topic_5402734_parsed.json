It's probably some list of warnings he's known all along either in PM or while surfing the forum. But of course it's a different case which may not be constructive to the OP's question without any explanation from him.Quote from: theymos on June 16, 2022, 12:48:46 AMIf we could automatically detect phishing with 100% accuracy, we'd just prevent the PM from being sent.

Also, note that often accounts are hacked and used to send phishing PMs, so don't rely on the fact that the sender is trustworthy.Of course we must remain vigilant against any suspicious attempts at PM, this requires us to be extra careful before opening any link. So it's clear that not all pm containing such warnings are phishing, but must be verified by the recipient of the pm if they really want to open the link. But of course there is a security issue if we receive the warning in PM so it will most likely ignore it if we can't verify that the site is really genuine.",
