You have not lost any actual money, just your perceived winnings from not being able to wager at your desired level, which a bookmaker is under no obligation to fulfill? What a joke of an \"accusation\".",

You lost more than a million in valid bets, right? Did they scam you?If they don't allow you to bet more than 2 BTC, then how is it a problem? If you think the limit was too low for you, then why not look for alternatives.Quote dont tell around you are a fair bookie. when i win they limit my winnings competitions even your team is telling me what should i bet and lost. Casinos are a business in case you didn't know, and the limiting happens all the time. If you think the limiting is unfair, then I suggest you should stop gamblingThis is in no way a scam accusation, as Sportsbet did not scam you.",

      "body": "If you lost more than millions already you should thank them for limiting your account.. Usually the story goes the other way around where someone is deep in red and they keep getting enticing bonuses to keep losing.Kudos to sportsbet (if true), for dealing with a problematic gambler.",

Do you mind to give a tad bit more of patience while I am trying to hail someone from SB to look into your case more closely? I am PMing them right now and hopefully they'll attend to it soonest they can.",
