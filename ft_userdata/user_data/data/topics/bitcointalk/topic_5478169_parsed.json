There is no source of this information because I just did a quick search. However, people are free to move Bitcoin from one wallet to another so I don't see anything special about this news. I don't really care about such news because they are orchestrated to promote FUD.",

You know the pattern.But by that time, the price might be higher and could be around $100k so that makes sense to some new folks in the community.
