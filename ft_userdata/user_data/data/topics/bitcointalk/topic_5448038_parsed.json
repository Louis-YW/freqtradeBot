If you think you are doing it with out government support, you are wrong, in my opinion. It's government that provides you with protection from both external(those that might attack your country) and internal(those that might attack your business) enemies. It's thanks to the government you can buy the equipment without being scammed, and it's thanks to the government you can return it and take your money back if the quality is bad.But if you just mean that we shouldn't wait for the government to provide us with proper job, I totally agree with you. Be the master of your own fate. And I wish you all the best regarding your business.",

If they are not active or do not put social amenities in place, it will be kind of hard for us to set up our businesses. As the above member has mentioned, we need them to provide a few security measures, human rights laws, etc. Without those laws to govern us to some extent, we will be living like canivorous animals; we will always want to feed on the next person's holding.¬†When it comes to job creation, we just need a little bit of support from the government to do that. Statistically, private individuals are the highest employers of labor, which means the job creation part is gradually leaving the government's hands. If one depends on the government for employment opportunities before he or she can make a living, then that person might end up being lazy and poor for the rest of his life. Government¬† Job creation can never be enough for its entire population. So making and earning a living is in your own hands. Learn a skill, look for what you are good at, and create your own job.",

Attending school with the aim of getting government job is absolutely wrong and that's why especially in my country, entrepreneurs skills are mandatory in all higher institutions in order to reduce the expectations and reliance on government. Government itself is suffering from both external and internal debt and as such can not carter or employ everyone. However, it's the duty of government to provide enabling environment for people to practice the entrepreneur skills learned during their school days or outside the school and as well as providing security for them and their property.",

So many countries rely more on capitalism this days which actually draws the line that acquiring school education doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre guaranteed a job.

Everyone can create their own opportunities and success through learning, skills, efforts and creativity. Entrepreneurship is a great way to create your own opportunities and make money. However, it is also risky and requires a lot of knowledge and experience. Therefore, you need to prepare carefully, learn and evaluate the market, products, competitors, as well as regulations related to business. I'm glad to hear you've started a popcorn business and have workers under you. This shows that you know how to create your own opportunities and bring value to the community. However, make sure that your work complies with the laws and regulations relevant to the business.",

Because you have not yet adapted enough to the current working environment, I do not like the slightly negative way of looking at the problem, although I can see that the job is facing many difficulties for employees, but try asking questions if there is no problem. The management history of the government apparatus shows whether people have the capacity to help each other through difficult periods of the economy. And never deny that it is important that the government has a sustainable economic development strategy and is accountable to the people to ensure a better future for everyone.",

Although, you may need SME loans or grants from the government to kick-start your idea, business, or enterprise. So in a sense you are depending on the government.Despite this, to survive in the pure sense, you need the government to provide an enabling environment, to make policies that are favourable for businesses to grow etc. So you see, the government is needed to survive whichever way we choose to look at it.",
