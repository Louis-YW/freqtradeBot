If it is like that, the person did not ignore the person that quoted the ignored user, why should it not be visible? That would be wrong if not visible. It is what the person is posting that makes you to ignore him, not because someone is quoting him.Some poor posters can become a good poster, this may even lead to the user that ignored the user to think otherwise if what he is later posting is good. The awareness may start from the quote. But there are other reasons a user is included on ignore list.",

It would be nice to have the quote of the ignored user to be collapsed (and while we're at it, collapse/reduce wall-quotes and large images too) but hiding the whole post would be too harsh IMO.I see this as most appropriate reason why theymos don't snip/hide the post who quote the post of the ignored user.",

Furthermore, if you click on 'Check post history of this user', even you ignored that user, you will still see all of his posts in post history page.So the ignore on a specific user works differently than when you ignore a specific board by using 'Ignore Boards Preferences' which will hide all posts in that board.If a display name of one user is changed, the old display name will still remain the same in quoted posts. It won't be changed to a new display name. If theymos does make it for display / username changes, it won't be applied for quoted postsIt perhaps because it was coded like it intentionally but I am more keen on a first theory.",

Why don't we have the option to ignore someone permanently in such a way that we don't see their post without removing them from our ignore list?Ignoring a user does not delete the user's memberships from the server. It just tells the system, so that user's posts do not appear when you are reading a topic.In turn, everything that each user writes in their post is their responsibility, whether it is a quote from other users or not. Speaking in a more technical way without being complex. We can say that for the site, the quote is not from the other user, it is from the user who posted it. For the site, qoute is just a function to highlight a text, and which allows you to create a link to another post or site.Therefore, when I quoted your post, that content is mine, I can edit, change or replace it. Referring to its origin. But I have all the power to touch this content, not you, because this post is mine.",

Even if you ignore a person, you are still going to find some things they write as in the case you mention or if you are not logged in. But you can also ignore with your eyes what he says, which is what I do most of the time in those cases. Can't you do that? Block either if you are curious and hit show/hide.I think things are fine the way they are.In my case I've been ignoring 4 or 5 of those who have been on the forum for a long time and post regularly and I've very rarely read a snippet of what they say since I ignored them.",
