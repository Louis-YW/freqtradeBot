It would be nice you move it to reputation board for further discussions.  OP I doubt the credibility and reliability of your claims and how true it is. I checked your profile to see for myself but it's unfortunate and my  thoughts were correct. You just cannot put up this claims of yours without any evidence to back it up. Nobody would give you attention coupled with the fact that your presence here is questionable.",

If you do not win, then it must be rigged? Usually high rollers win these contests ya know, just because a person has a big lead in the 1st day or week doesn't mean they will hold it. A high roller can wipe out a lead in an hour if they want. I think you need to definitely provide proof if you plan on making allegations like this.",

In addition, I don't think fake accounts can do anything to players? The most damage it could do would be manipulation of the leaderboards of say highest wins/highest betters etc. since they can change that at will. Personal experience with games like dice, crash, etc. I don't think a game exists where the odds are affected by the number of players that bet, at least I haven't tried one (or I'm just that dumb to not remember about it).",

As long as you're not working behind the casino, you will not know about the truth.This kind of allegation almost happen in all casinos where there is wagering competition. Even in reputable site like Stake, there were some people who think that Stake use fake accounts or their own accounts to take the top prizes of the wagering competition. Similar as this one, the allegation is baseless without any solid evidence because most cases will always be based on feeling and assumption. Imo, in this kind of thing, what we need to do as players is to trust the casino because like what you said that only person who are behind the casino who know the truth.",

I know that there are casinos that are using other accounts for customer engagements, but not in directly altering the outcome of the games that the people are playing. If this is true, then it's a serious matter since they are straight up conning their players off of their money. It's easy to say that X casino is using bots and alt accounts to lessen the chances of other people winning, but substantial evidence needs to be presented before the said casino is judged by the whole community without facts.",

True. All allegations will be pending and on hold until genuine proofs and evidences come out. On the eyes of many gamblers, it looks like  you are ruining the reputation of this casino without providing clear evidences at first. And you can’t blame them for that. However, if these said allegations are true, at least you have created an early awareness not just for regular players in this casino, but as well as those who plan to start gambling in Megaplay. For now, time is the only ultimate teller. Lets just wait for the real investigations to start so we can also make final judgement on this certain casino if this one is guilty or not.",

If someone from the team working at the casino decides to speak about such manipulations and gather some \"real evidence\" I will probably pay more attention to that. But just \"words\" from someone who didn't make it in a wager race don't have any value. I busted my bankroll too many times in trying to compete in different races. We play hard and we risk a lot and sometimes we simply lose. It's hard to compete with a limited bankroll and to catch up with high rollers... I am not taking any sides here, I am just saying if you think there is something suspicious about the place where you gamble move to another place.",
