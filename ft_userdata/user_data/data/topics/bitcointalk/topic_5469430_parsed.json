  "content": "Engineers and software engineers in the house, I use to have a phone, old device to be precise. It doesn't have anything on the phone except for wallet, it's android electrum.When I installed the wallet and create seed phrase, I was given seed phrase, I backed it up long time ago but I change where I was staying and I lost the back up. Since I had the wallet on that phone, I didn't bother to redo the back up.2 days ago, the phone refuse to come back online, I tried everything I can but it never and I took the phone to a Engineer, he checked the phone and I was told the phone panel is dead.   The problem is, changing the panel is like changing the internal organs of the phone, and I don't know if there is anything they can changed in the panel from the old phone to the new phone that will contain my wallet. It's a dumb question but I wish there is a way from software engineers here.Please, help.",

You made a mistake of not backing up your wallet again. And I wonder why you were that lasy to back it up. if the device can still be recognized by a computer when connected via USB, data recovery software might help. However, this usually requires enabling USB debugging on the device, which can't be done if the screen is dead. If you had nothing in the wallet, I will advice you to forget about it and get a new wallet. You might want to check this if it would be of help in any wayhttps://techcabal.com/2021/08/05/move-data-from-damaged-phone-to-new-phone/",

      "body": "I don't know how possible this could be because mobile devices operate separately from computer devices. Mobile phones don't usually have separate storage; in the main phone's storage, your files are not the only thing in it; there are other phone inbuilt software on them, which makes it possible for your phone to function as it was programmed. If not, the only way could have been to get a new device or the same model. Look for a good engineer who can transfer the memory circuits from the dead panel to a newer one and see if it will work, but even if it does, the phone will need to be formatted before everything can come back to normal. The only place I believe you could have a little more chance of recovering your private key is if you have backed it up in a file on the phone and not just inside the electrum wallet alone.",

I don't have idea about chips and motherboards. Two engineers told me the same thing, the only way for the phone to work again is replacement of the panel and that is only possible if they have the same phone as the damage one before the transfer can be possible, if really not for the wallet, I will have just trash it but that is what I may do at the end.

Even if it's possible which I doubt, it will cost a lot of money. Funny enough, the data might still be available after changing the motherboard but will not be accessible depending on the phone storage system. I will just suggest that OP should forfeit the amount in the wallet and move on because there's no guarantee of getting every data on the phone even after paying for it and the motherboard is temper with.

Only a few technicians have a tool to dump data from eMMC like jTag tools. Because this tool is pretty expensive.So I suggest find a professional technician who knows more about data recovery because they can able to dump the data or transfer the eMMC chip to a new host(motherboard).It's not cheap unless you do it by yourself but the problem is you don't know if the eMMC is still ok or dead.Do you mind to tell us what unit model your phone is? Maybe I can give you some DIY guides that can help to dump the data from eMMC I know some free jTag tools but limited supported units and if the",

You need more than one backup for a wallet and you already learned a lesson.How to backup a seed phraseQuoteBefore we get into any specific backup methods, the first question you should answer is: how many backups do you actually need? One may not be enough!Consider the device (if any) that is being used to store your keys for regular use. Does that device allow you to export the seed phrase whenever you want? If not, you need more than one backup. Assume that you only have one backup - if that backup gets lost / stolen / destroyed / inaccessible for any reason, then you now only have one copy of your seed phrase and you may not have any way to create additional copies if your key management device does not allow exporting the seed phrase. As such, in this situation you would need to create a new wallet, backup the seed phrase, and move all of your funds to the new wallet - all while praying that nothing goes wrong with your sole remaining set of keys (such as the device breaking or getting wiped.)QuoteSince I had the wallet on that phone, I didn't bother to redo the back up.When you write down seed in your backups, you have to test accuracy of your writing initially. If you fail to recover your wallet from that backup, check typo and fix your writing typo. Later you should regularly check up your backup. If they are broken, make new ones to replace old backups.When you knew you lost your only backup, but did not mind to make a new one, it's bad practice.Quote2 days ago, the phone refuse to come back online, I tried everything I can but it never and I took the phone to a Engineer, he checked the phone and I was told the phone panel is dead.It's bad news but you can also assume you lost  your coin to the engineer as well. I don't assume the engineer is a bad man but when you give your device with bitcoin inside to someone else, you must assume you afford to lose it.",

Since I had the wallet on that phone, I didn't bother to redo the back up.This is something I don't understand why you did what you did or rather decided to do nothing to remove the single point of failure which now struck you.You moved to a new place, you lost your mnemonic recovery words backup, you had only your wallet on a mobile device that can be stolen, lost or malfunction without the ability to restore your wallet because there was no redundant backup. Mobile Electrum can show you the recovery words again, you could've created a new backup. I have no idea why you chose not to do so.But even worse, as you lost your recovery words backup, someone else could've found it at your old place and steal your funds. Never considered this possibility which would've been completely out of your control? This alone, not knowing where your recovery words backup is or has been left, should've urged you to move your funds to a new wallet for which you could've created a new and safe backup (better some more redundant backups, actually).It's kind of poking into wounds but it's obviously necessary to highlight such reckless behavior. Especially now that you have your malfunction with your only device with your wallet and no abiltity at the moment to restore your wallet and access to your funds.Quote from: Antotena on October 06, 2023, 02:53:31 PM2 days ago, the phone refuse to come back online, I tried everything I can but it never and I took the phone to a Engineer, he checked the phone and I was told the phone panel is dead.   Was this a mobile phone repair expert? This is likely the easiest answer for him to state the obvious. Have you asked another repair expert to assess the current state of your device?",
