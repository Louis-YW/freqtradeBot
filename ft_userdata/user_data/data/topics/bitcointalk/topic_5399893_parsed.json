The project was launched in 2019 by a team formerly involved in building the Colu project aimed at bringing local currencies to the blockchain. The ProblemThe currently existing financial system falls way short of the objective of providing the people globally with access to fast, frictionless payments, attractive financial services and passive income opportunities. This is especially relevant for the developing countries. Hundreds of millions of people there lack access even to the basic banking services, let alone access to more advanced financial opportunities. They also often have to transact using highly unstable fiat currencies, prone to episodes of sudden profound devaluation.At the same time, even in the poorest countries, the pace of mobile phone adoption has been staggering. In sub-Saharan Africa, more people have access to mobile phones than to clean drinking water. In addition to this, the rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has finally created the possibility for potentially anyone on the planet to send and receive funds without the permission of any entity, using currencies that cannot be manipulated.    What the crypto industry still lacksHowever, while we are observing a lot of activity in the crypto space (especially in the crypto asset markets, and the DeFi and NFT sectors), genuine mass adoption of crypto payments and DeFi is still not there.The currently available products and tools, with their complicated and disparate UX, are mostly geared towards sophisticated crypto users with significant financial means.  How we go about itOur approach to bringing crypto payments and DeFi to the masses primarily consists in empowering other projects, businesses, organizations and communities to adopt crypto payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).This is achieved by providing clients with convenient, mobile-first tools for creating and managing token-powered environments, as well as for onboarding users to those and enabling them to interact.  Platform ComponentsThe Fuse platform has three main components: 1) The Fuse Network blockchain. The EVM-compatible public blockchain is the decentralized, permissionless backbone of the Fuse platform and ecosystem. 2) The mobile-centric open-source technology stack for adopting token payments. This includes the Fuse Studio backend and the Fuse Wallet technology. 3) A set of reference decentralized finance (DeFi) products and tools. The goal of these is to pave the way for the initial adoption of the platform. Network Overview and Key MetricsFuse Network is the decentralized EVM-compatible public blockchain that powers the Fuse platform and ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Fuse Network.The Fuse Network blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) for achieving consensus. The consensus is secured by a significant number of independent validators, only one of which is run by the Fuse core team.Validators are also responsible for the most important type of governance on Fuse, namely, adopting the network protocol changes via Fuse Improvement Proposals (FIPs). The native token of the network is called FUSE. New FUSE tokens are issued with every added block and are also use to pay for gas, just like ETH on Ethereum. The Fuse Network blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on Fuse is around 5 seconds, and it currently costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.In its present capacity, the Fuse Network blockchain is capable of processing around 120 native token transfers and 60 ERC20 token transfers per second. The faster processing of native token transfers is due to the fact that they do not involve computations run on the network's virtual machine. ..... continue reading here = https://docs.fuse.io/general/learn-about-the-fuse-platform/fuse-overview",

I thought it was an advertisement for another little-known project and passed this coin by. In the end, the price was almost $2, but it didn't last long. Now the project is back to the same values when I first read about it. And I wonder if this project will be able to repeat that in the near future.",

If they managed to stay around then the next problem would be more competition as more project will claim to be the next big thing in crypto. We'll see more \"higher TPS\" and \"cheaper fees\" kind of marketing slogans.",
