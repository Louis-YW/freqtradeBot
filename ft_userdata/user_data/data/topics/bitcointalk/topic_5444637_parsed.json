Also the failure of SVB and collapse of few companies would force ppl to convert their assets into BTC. The USDC collapse was also shocking along with SVB (although short lived) and CZ said he is converting most of his stables into BTC, ETH for safety in his most recent tweet.Lets see if the current situation could trigger a bull run. The panic dump is most likely over imo.Quote from: rat03gopoh on March 13, 2023, 02:41:32 AMIt's good news that everyone has the opportunity to raise their sats every time people fear just because of the news of a big financial institution's failure.Non-believers will never learn actually. They sold during mtgox collapse, during binance regulation fud, during ftx hack, now during svb collapse. Its gonna be the same story everytime again and again. Only few real ppl who got heavy faith (like us), gonna make it.",

Plenty of fiat currencies fall the same percentaces. When the bank fails and you can get you USD back it 100% loss of funds (- the 250K, so anything over that).All currencies are floating. They can go up alot or lose alot.$1000/20000 is only 5%.When BTC in the demoninator then it will be \"stable\" all other currecies will be seen to fluctate against BTC",

Fiat has been existing before bitcoin and controlled by the government, people prefer what the government have say on, but not knowing what bitcoin can offer them. Some people knows what bitcoin can offer them but their business nature and the country they live and operating businesses are mostly friendly to fiat. Some people will even not get it right at all.

This SVB drama would only make people in crypto realize that keeping their coins in centralized exchanges is the same things as keeping your money in an SVB account where somebody can mismanage it and make very wrong decisions which would make you lose your money. I don't think this saga favour the crypto industry, I think it only encourages people not to trust centralized exchanges.",

But I'm not happy that these banks fail, and that doesn't benefit bitcoin either. If the bank's bankruptcy does not stop but spreads, it is a dangerous sign for the world economy and will negatively impact the world. Once the economy is in trouble, bitcoin won't benefit too much. Banks are still the backbone of the world's financial system, and if it fails, they will cause so many problems that we can't even imagine.",
