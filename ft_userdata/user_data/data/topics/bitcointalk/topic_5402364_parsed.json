If everyone is competing against each other as well as the house, it creates a far more immersive and collaborative experience.

Well, it is really a boost for gambling society but I don't think that this thing will boost irresponsible people in the society.  Being irresponsible is a choice it is rooted deep in the personality of a person.  So whether they are involved in gambling or not, if they tend to be irresponsible, they will be irresponsible.",

It becomes easier to win as the objective shifts towards defeating your human opponents rather than the game which is a positive.On the negative side, rewards are distributed across multiple winners, reducing potential profits below what they would be outside of multiplayer gaming.There definitely are positives and negatives present, both of which trend towards canceling each other out. It is nice to have a more forgiving format of gambling with higher error tolerances which multiplayer can definitely provide.",

Every game where we connect to server and chat is multiplayer. I think he meant players not competing each other which kind of a grey part when all the reason gamers play is to enjoy racing to a goal. Developers have this social community games in mind since the lock down which the popularity of Axie Infinity grew so much because it has its all in one game. With Axie, the players are not enjoying the game and socializing but also making money out of it.
