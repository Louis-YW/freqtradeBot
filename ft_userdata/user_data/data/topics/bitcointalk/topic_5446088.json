The problem is not with bitcoin and it doesn't have any drawbacks as you mentioned but it's the Government itself that thinks it will lose the power to retain its votes and lose the credibility to rule the nation if it gave away financial freedom to everyone. Finance is the key to running the nation and holds the power to print money and run the system.Think for a sec, everything is getting traded in bitcoin payments. Who would pay taxes? Who would care about what's getting shared in their savings or earnings? Everyone will be happy to run their own free system and benefits. About the employment part, whatever you mentioned are just wats to utilise bitcoin they are not any sort of employment opportunity.",

Bitcoin might increase job opportunities for jobless people if the government is open for new innovations and will support bitcoin instead of banning it. But I think it’s really hard for a centralized government to adopt a decentralized cryptocurrency especially if they can never control its existence. However, there’s always a positive chance that the government will start to support bitcoin in the future, we just need to wait for the government to embrace bitcoin as it may take long years of processing before it’s bound to happen.",

That maybe what’s supposed to happen if only the government creates a favorable action towards bitcoin,  but it turned out that there’s no centralized government that would want to embrace a decentralized currency because they believe it will never do good in the people in the long run. They only consider bitcoin as a hype or FUD, and when it’s gone people will just regret trusting it. That’s how the government sees bitcoin, so expect that accepting bitcoin if ever will still take long years of investigation before they will realize that it’s an asset rather than a threat or obstacle to the government.",

Assuming government can easily understand the power of bitcoin in improving self dependency by citizens of different nations.Not all governments refused the positive aspects of events when it comes to what will profit the masses.  They are somehow slow in Bitcoin adoption because they are not only deciding for themselves but for the entire nation.  One wrong move will make their economic status in jargon.  So don't compare the personal adoption to national adoption, they have different points of focus.  Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 23, 2023, 07:06:08 PMIf IMF and UN can come together to strength the values and important of bitcoin as centralize legal digital currency with independence network system to act on digital market and helps in improving I.T for youths all over the world.It does not need IMF and UN, each country is independent to decide what is good for their own country.  It just needs a decisive leader just like in El Salvador to adopt and implement Bitcoin to their country.  After all, they need to have it established in their country to make the full benefits of Bitcoin before reaching out for other country deals.Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 23, 2023, 07:06:08 PMBitcoin easily create stable jobs in different uniforms.Buying and selling of bitcoin virtual cards, bitcoin pay points agents, ATM machine, bitcoin gifts cards, extension of campaign teams, and monopoly of market.

If it is job opportunities related to currencies, then that is long ago existing with fiat such as with banking. And if you are trying to point out taking advantage of the market peice volatility, that is also the reason why this technology is not having support from the governments because for them it would put people into risk. Also, the undying issue of taxation in this industry. I would be fine earning profit from this industry on many ways, without recognition from the government. In the first place, if government will be chained in this industry, all of our profits would be taxed and that is simply in contrast with this technology's nature.",

It's not like a magic bean that will be the end of it all. Although I have heard much worst, like Bitcoin will help solve poverty, blah blah blah. Why not just let it run it's natural course. It is still very young, just 10 years or so. Maybe in the next decade we will see what it can actually do to us.",

Let's give it but it's more about the companies that will adopt bitcoin and they're the ones to produce those jobs. It's too optimistic to think that it will eradicate most of those problems but we're there, it's just a matter that not everything gonna to turn on it on an instant which solves most of them. Because in reality, it just can't and we have to stick in the reality that there's still some limits that it can't do in the capacity of everyone even if we're very much optimistic with its potential.

Before, we thought that government interference is gonna bring a lot to the market, and yes that's for the market but not to bitcoin alone. And we've seen with all of these regulations coming from exchanges, crypto services but they still can't stop bitcoin however, the market's where we're moving with can be regulated by them.",

They know for a fact BTC will help the government, they just don't look after the welfare of the citizen. If fighting against its adoption is what they want to do, they will fail miserably just as what happens to banks nowadays. The bank's and government's failure will still result in the adoption of BTC. The money devaluation will make people decide on better assets like gold and silver but these are not the type that they can just transact easily. It's BTC that will adopt easily.",
