Now, in a very recent interview in New York Times per Forbes, Sam claimed that although he admitted to have failed in many aspects of the management of FTX he actually got no intention to defraud anybody - meaning he is as clean as white as far as allegations leveled against him while being the man at the helm of the company. Who here think that Sam is just another victim of circumstances and not really the villain in this chaotic and far-reaching story of collapse?",

Most people that commits crime never accepts that they are guilty. Their lawyers would always argue or give reasons or the circumstances that necessitated the criminal offence. From the link OP provided Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledged that he made some mistakes but failed accept that he knew that is actions were risky or financially unsound. John Ray the new CEO of FTX has unveiled that the firm he was assign to rescue is in a total mess and past mangers failed to apply simple risk management principles. It is alarming to know that a multi-billion dollar firm like FTX don't have a risk management department. Which means that Sam, his friends and family had unlimited access to depositors funds and they used it the way they liked. Most of these successful technological or crypto firms might have been founded by young entrepreneurs but it is important they employ experienced staff that are proficient in management practices, especially in investment and risk management.",

That is not much different than mechanisms of forced liquidation on other exchanges and similar to bank liquidation too.Sum up, he should know very well about extremely high risk of using FTT token as collateral for his company loan. He can not say he did not know about that risk and is innocent.QuoteHe might not really be thinking of taking people's money away, but that's basically what it means when he made huge withdrawals of his users' money and moved them to Alameda, donated to politicians, squandered on expensive properties in the Bahamas, gave away to his parents for them to splurge, lend to some companies, and so on. Sam Bankman-Fried probably didn't think of running away with his users' money, but his irresponsibility, his childish financial management, is equally damaging.  Think or not think to run away with customer money, it is not a matter.  A serious matter is he and his colleagues used customer money without any inform to them and any permission from their customers. That is enough to be called as guilty but worse they used such capital for their own benefits (buying expensive real estates, building up their reputation with politicians, etc.). All of these were not done for benefit of FTX customers at any scale.",

Think of Two Gun Crowley in Dale Carnegies' book, Despite being a murderer, in his letter he said: ‘Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one – one that would do nobody any harm.’ Even Al Capone didn't blame himself for disturbing Chicago. Therefore, SBF, has millions of reasons to prove he's not guilty. And blaming or condemning him won't help as he won't condemn himself. I'd say, until he is tried in the court of law for his carelessness SBF will always tell the world he's a good man who tried to save the cryptocurrency market.",

Even though he hasn't been proven guilty, his actions and conduct which led to FTX going underwater is capable of keeping him lol in prison for 20yrs. That's a lot for an \"innocent man\" if you ask me. Quoting him in an interview, he said; \"I have a duty to explain what happened..I don't see what good is accomplished by me just sitting locked in a room pretending the outside world doesn't exist\".. Will all this change the fact that that many investors funds have been carted away by some careless businessman? I doubt not.",

In addition to this, I even watched Sam Bankman-Fried interview an interview with a well-known influencer, Tifanny Fong, who also revealed in the interview here that he is innocent and knows nothing about what happened in Ftx... Here it seems It also appears that he paid Tifanny Fong just from my own assessment, but I'm not sure, But that's what I had been thinking of it.",

All other justifications for loyalty and devotion to the cause are a desperate attempt to remove suspicion from yourself.
