      "body": "Thats my bet from previous month\"QuoteSo what do you guys think?  Up above 25k USD by end of March or still below it?QuoteAbove. I'm short term bullish (next 2-3 months). The recovery we already had is nothing compared to amount of pain we have had before. We did not even hit a 0.236 fib lvl yet (long term from top to the bottom). There is a lot to space to go up even if its not the beginning of new bull run and we are about to see a new lower low few months after.Now i'm also bullish. Maybe not Super Duper Bullish, because nothing is certain yet and 28k is also a strong resistance. I'm almost all assets bullish till may/jun when we will most likely see a strong pullback due to makro bearish signals.",

I still hesitate to confirm that the bearish situation will not happen again even though the chart shows a nice increase. I saw a Long-Legged Doji candle in recent days. Although it is not entirely likely to happen, I think $30K could happen if the FUD against Bitcoin is not too strong this month.",

A couple of months maybe?We should try to break 30 this month but that is without any government intervention/manipulation. I'm sure you know about the attempt by the US gov to keep us below 30k by spewing lies about mining and selling silk road coins. Coins they were holding for 9 years and 2 bull markets. They did not sell at 60 thousand but are willing to sell now, just because bitcoin is starting to be seen as an escape from the falling banking system. Also, why are you guys all spammers?

Tax returns already so this might be one good reasons for many to just invest on small or big their refund is as the banking system is collapsing right now.Breaking $28,000 though might be a challenge, but once it is broken we can go to $30,000 and more.That's if the individual is wise enough, but for those bitcoin enthusiast, this is no brainer. Instead of buying something from the money that they are going to get, for sure they will throw it in bitcoin and wait for the next bull run to happen and make massive gains from that investment.",

Seeing the current situation we can say that we are moving high just like what we experienced in the past years before halving. Should I say that history repeats itself? Maybe yes or maybe no but the sentiment of the market shows the same, it recovers after the bear season and it continues to pump before halving until the next bull season cycle.

However, the price has increased from where it was at the end of February. I believe that from now until the next bull run, the closing price at the end of each month will be higher than the previous. Let's see how the month of April turns out at the end; I'm hoping it to hit 32K before the month ends.I know, everyone is looking for the $30k price return last March, but there were some correction that time, even go as low as $26,xxx and I thought that we ill continue to go down that time. But the good news is that the investors really push for the price to go to $28k again and that is our price at the end of March. But as I have been saying, $28,500 is the big resistance, and although we just higher that that, the price right now is peg around it. So hopefully there will be no retracement and wanted to see how we can maintain this price level. Because if we do, then once we jump to $29k, it's easy to break that round numbers of $30k just like how we break $20k around January-February. And with that said, I will be bullish as well for the month of April, still many reasons for investors or even average joe like us to buy and continue to invest and just HODL. The price is still very cheap and at a discount and we may never seen the price in the $20k'ish as this will be the new $4k price (which we all wish back then in 2020).",

But it's always possible there will be more announcements of anti-crypto attacks from the SEC this month which would hurt the market.I think Bitcoin will spend most of the month in the high-20k's but I do think it'll break above $30k at some point this month.

But couldn't participate in the pull because I don't actually know the option to chose. This is because I didn't buy my bitcoin at once. I am buying on weekly DCA and I as such wouldn't know the level of bullish I am. I just noticed the increment of the fiat value of my bitcoin and that's all. I believe if bitcoin falls back to below $25k, I'll also notice a significant decrease in price. Are there such ways to know how bullish when on DCA?",

Yet, it was not just easy as I can imagine. With the volatility of the market, it was too hard to think that we are continuously moving high as certainly dump/correction happens. If the price of Bitcoin will just reach $30k this month, that was already a great improvement and I was confident that it comes to happen.

Very unpredictable and if you are trading in the hourly chart, you can benefit from it by just using the RSI. I'm more bullish as well knowing how many months we're going down since the start of 2022.I manage to earn $23 trying to make some satoshis in one day in the spot market with the very small capital I have.

We are a year away from the halving, and although the bull run usually takes place a year after the halving, normally a year before it there is also a rise. Coming from the lows we've had, the most likely scenario is to go up gradually this month, staying in the range between 30 and 35K.",
