Add some money and you got proper mobo no need for headache.GA-B250-FinTech is also a very good solution, but lately I prefer that the motherboard have USB connectors for raisers. It seems to me that this is more reliable and helps to avoid beginner mistakes when the raiser is connected to the motherboard incorrectly.",

Miners don’t use this method now.If you want to mine coins for a long time, then my experience has taught me to use new equipment. In the interval of 2-4 years you will lose more on failures and time on setup and so on. What you want to do will only work as a temporary solution, but nothing more.",
