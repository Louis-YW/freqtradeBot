      "body": "Similar case to this: How can this gambling related issue be handled?But what evidence do you have that it is the boy that gambled? What if it is his brother that gave him the booking code and called the cashier that his brother his coming to give him the booking code? Are you sure it is the boy that bet or another person that bet and gave the boy the booking code? Underage gambling is common in some countries, if it is like that, it would worth your attention if your relative or brother happens to be an underage and gambling, then you can refer to what people posted on the thread that I provided the link above.The issue of underage gambling can only perfectly be solved by the gambling regulatory body in your country.",

It's their parents that should control this kids and really emphasized what gambling addiction could lead them in the future.",

They can work somewhere in their spare time, buy and sell things, these are good things. The bad part is when they start gambling for easy money. They may be lucky at first. Even if they have unlucky times, they can win after a while. They will put 1 and get 3-5-10-20 whatever. If they lose they will say next time ill win and i'll cover my losses. In this way, they can live for several years. They may make bad choices to find money. Stealing money from their families, being sellers of illegal things etc. If they are not very successful in gambling, which 97-98% will bad at it. At the end they will drown in debt. They get older, they missed many opportunity probably they wont know how to make money in real life. In this way, they will have wasted a life. This might be seems bad scenario but I had a friend couple years ago this story based on his life. One small wrong decision can affect your whole life like a domino effect.",

They might not be able to control the drive to gamble which might really have a negative affect on them. Most of them are not working, which means that the money they use in gambling was given to them as gifts from their parents or relative. The challenge now is that most of them might go to the extent of stealing from their relatives to satisfy their gambling drive when they don't have access to funds. Gambling can also be a big distraction from their educational pursuit. Instead of focusing on their studies some of these underaged gamblers would be carried away by match results and predictions. They might even use money meant for their schooling to play gamble. By the time the become adults, they are now full blown gamble addicts that can even use their belongings to gamble.",

It is strictly prohibited here. So I don't know how is the law being applied in your country, it is probably a common practice there.As parenthood, we should not ask our kids to do this if they are underage because the chances of being a gambling addict are very close.",

I have ever gambled when myself was still under the legal age but to be honest i was only doing it once or two times and that's related with football. The problem is always be on the young guy will not have ability to control his emotion. I did know that if i would do that for so long and that might make me become addicted with it and i just preventing myself to did it even further. The main concern about restricting the under age gamblers are related with emotional by the gamblers. Remember that if young gamblers didn't have active income and they may stole from their family to be used for gambling and this is the bad thing that being prevented by implemented underage gambling has not allowed to play.",

Younger people might not be able to properly control their emotions, realize that an addiction is building or even how to get out of such an addiction after it formed. It can also have a stunting effect as as it distracts from more wholesome pursuits around that age",

This happens for everyone, not only kids but also adults. But, we can't deny that most kids will not be able to control their emotion very well on gambling, cannot analyze which one must be, and probably cannot control their willingness to stop gambling even after losing much. Although we know that each country has different age restirctions about kids doing gambling. Like what I ever created topic here:Age restriction in gambling But, generally, kids have weakness on gambling. I know that some kids may be good enough in gambling, even they are able to control themselves and can earn much money. But, I am sure enough that most of them cannot do that.

To prevent underage gambling, as well as malicious criminal activities. This is one of the examples where KYC actually makes a little bit of sense. I've said this before, but not all KYC is a bad idea. Unfortunately, a lot of cryptocurrency gambling websites don't have this requirement which makes it a lot easier for underage people to gamble. I'm not saying that they should implement KYC though, I'm just saying this is unfortunately unavoidable without compromising other users privacy.",
