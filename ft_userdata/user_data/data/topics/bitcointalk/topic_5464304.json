Your well broken and detailed answers, could add extra meaning to this thread, my thoughts and resolve or put an end to an extra minute spent basking in thoughts about this question. Cheers",

CheersWell you get those points for the answer of this topic. Actually getting answers from this forum feels simpler and easier to understand. Instead of having to read long articles with convoluted and circling language that makes us tired and lazy to read because articles are difficult to arrive at the answers we want. Finding answers here also gives us the freedom to respond again if there are still things we don't understand. So often the discussion becomes quite long. And learning through discussion is actually easier to remember. Rather than learning through the interaction of 1 party. 2-party interaction is a more effective method. But apart from all that, it will still come back to each individual. I personally read from the internet and then ask here if there is something I don't understand from what I read on blogs or other articles. And conversely, sometimes we also help answer questions here by attaching the answers we get from reading in articles on other news or educational sites out there, including sources, of course.",

      "body": "Well, from my perspective, online forum like bitcointalk.org offer a certain dose of authenticity that's hard to beat. You're communicating with actual users, not just reading curated content. It's like tapping into a collective knowledge pool, and sometimes the back-and-forth discussions can really uncover insights that might not be found elsewhere. And, in my opinion, the interactive nature lets you throw in specific questions and get answers that feel more tailored compared to other platforms.",

      "body": "QuoteRe: Why do you prefer getting answers here?People prefer to get answers here rather than on Google because it all comes from individual opinion, as everyone will give answers based on what they understand and on personal experience, so you, as the person who asks the question, will have different choices to make from the responses of different members, and the answers that are given are also verified by others so that the inquirer is not misled.And secondly, not every question can be answered by Google or any search engine with a detailed explanation of how you might understand it, but here in the forum you are given a lot of choices to choose from.",

CheersMembers are almost guaranteed to receive answers which come so quickly especially on the active boards. Curious minds tend to like that. And it seems interest, passion and rewards (not necessarily monetary rewards) move others to give helpful answers. But all these would be abit difficult without the useful moderations",
