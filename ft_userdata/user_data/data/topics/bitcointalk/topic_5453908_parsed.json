This lead to so many images posted on the forum through them being broken at the time.I think this was the first thread [1] on the issue.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452415.20- Jay -",

From the business perspective imgur tend to loose more because they lost the traffic that they would have generated from our forum members and other platforms the stop supporting. Also, they have tarnish their image as users will start resorting to other image hosting sites. Thank God we now have our own image hosting site created by a forum member.",

I don't even bother to browse the site let alone to create an account. I knew them through this forumAs far as I know, Imgur still primarily focuses on image hosting, and it remains one of the most popular image hosting sites on the internet. But in recent years, they also include video hosting, community features such as commenting and upvoting, and the ability to create memes using their built-in meme generator tool.

Although most of my images do not have those errors because I did not use Imgur to host them, but it's good imgur chosed to restore back to the old domain; otherwise, they would have lost a lot of customers, and perhaps some people are already making their choices for Talkimg.com to improve their image.",
