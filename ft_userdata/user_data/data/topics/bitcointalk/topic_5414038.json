Failing that, I was wondering if any of you had any advice / tips on how to go about finding testers? Being a Bitcoin product, on the rather nascent Layer 2 Network 'Lightning', the niche is quite small Feel free to share the link with anyone you think might be interested, and please feel free to provide feedback, either public of private",

We should make it clearer that it's a 50:50 coin toss.\"I expect to know who's generating that random number\" - this is generated by Ruby, as described in /fair, using the code:```(0...100).to_a.sample(random: Random.new(Random.new.seed.to_i))```This seed allows our users to run the code locally and verify that they got the same number we did. What more would you like to know?As for routing - we have lots of capacity in our channels. Should be plenty to handle a 1000 satoshi bet. Are you sure you followed steps 1 and 2 in order? If you make a request (step 2) before paying the invoice (step 1) it won't execute...(And thanks for the feedback!)",

I have not received anything back, so I assume the coin isn't being tossed in the background. https://i.ibb.co/cbTbbdN/image.pngI'm the developer. I'll answer your comments. > Okay, so the thousand satoshis were successfully routed to you this timeThere's a ton of reasons why sats are not routed properly through lightning.I don't know if your wallet has issues or if the node your wallet uses has issues. This is the feedback that I got from LND core developers when trying to troubleshoot this.I \"fixed\" your issue by resetting mission control on our lightning node.This erases previous routing failures. I don't know why you had a routing failure to start with and I'm not responsible for that either, as your transactions don't run through my node. If it was a routing failure coming from a payout then please by all means report it and we will sort it. Payouts come out of our node. For the record we are aiming for users that are using battle tested software(WoS, Zeus, LND, Alby)If your setup is non-standard please don't use my app   Would you mind explaining a little bit what's behind this? And perhaps answer the two previous questions:It's explained on the fair section of the app -> https://roll.satsumo.xyz/#/fair and was written by my colleague. But I'll give you a TL;DR in bullets as I think its a format thats easy to digest1) You pay us an invoice - the invoice becomes settled and has a preimage2) the Preimage is a series of bytes on the invoice, as per -> https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/lightning.proto#L3260-L32653) We decode that preimage and turn it into a NUMERICAL value. The \"algorithm\" to construct that number is here https://roll.satsumo.xyz/images/seed-generation.svg 4) That number is YOUR SEED. that SEED is a DETERMINISTIC INPUT for a randomness function. For the same input you get the same output, this is why its verifiable6) We send you that seed back alongside with the code snippet that determines wether you win or not7) You run the code and verify your resultThe preimage, so in fact, the input, is generated by lightning and nothing to do with us. Hence fair.So again, to answer your comment> If I do it locally, and hand it over to you, with source code transparent, can't I cheat the game? Analogously, if I don't do it locally, and you hand me over the seed, can't you cheat me?You have access to your seed the entire time, its automatically generated when you pay us, you have access to it, we have access to it. There's no cheating. The code is the same as shown in https://roll.satsumo.xyz/#/fair> I think I've found a bug. I've sent another 1,000, but your page has stuck here. It doesn't do anything. I have not received anything back, so I assume the coin isn't being tossed in the background. It could be issues with your internet connection - Did it just froze forever? You would need to show me some sort of error message or failed HTTP request. Otherwise I wouldn't know if its something to do with your setup or connection. You're the first person to run into all of these issues.",

Lightning protocol code snippets where provided> Refusing to answer to your clients' simple questions is an asshole policy. With all the respect.Complete lies, your questions were answered, multiple times in different ways.I genuinely challenge your state of mental health for carrying on with this conversation, specially after you failed to back your claims with data.Again, don't you think readers are suspicious about the fact that you said you were \"too busy and didn't care  the enough\" to dig up the code and debate me. yet you still have the time and care the enough to mumble the same thing over and over again? You're literally in a corner mumbling hurr durr my seed hurr durr can't verify hurr durr this is a scam.It was answered. it's verifiable. I thank whoever developed lightning for this tech because its awesome, it solves a problem and it works!This is the internet, anyone with a keyboard can post N-times and gain clout on a forum, its not indicative of knowledge on a domain nor skill. I am a biz owner defending his business. And as I said before, this gives me promotion as it continues to bump the thread.Unlike you I do have the time and I do care enough to refute poorly held claims. I've backed it every time",

The seed is a product of the preimage on your paid invoice, which we generate using the Ruby programming language like soMeanwhile on post #8:Quote from: shellandbull on September 21, 2022, 06:43:17 PMThe preimage, so in fact, the input, is generated by lightning and nothing to do with us. Hence fair.Later, I posted this:Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on September 21, 2022, 08:02:08 PMLook after your wording. You're the one who's generating the invoice, and thus the pre-image. Isn't that correct? Your server decides what my invoice will be. The pre-image you generate is strictly correlated with my seed. What prevents you from generating an invoice with non-random pre-image?And got this as response:Quote from: shellandbull on September 22, 2022, 06:52:19 AMNo its not correct. The lightning implementation generates an invoice. We run an LND instance on voltage, we communicate to it server-side.From the above, I conclude that either you or a third party runs a Lightning node you connect to, server-side, and which generates the invoice whose pre-image clients use as seeds. Therefore, it's entirely possible for the entity that controls the Lightning node to pass an invoice with non-random pre-image. Isn't that correct?",
