Such small amounts are simply not worth transferring, because the withdrawal/service fee may be higher than the amount you have now, so accumulate sats and in the meantime look for a non-custodial wallet.",

Quote from: Lucius on November 12, 2022, 11:15:41 AMWhat you need to know is that when you have a larger amount of BTC in your exchange account, you should consider transferring it to a non-custodial crypto wallet so that only you have control over your private keys. Such small amounts are simply not worth transferring, because the withdrawal/service fee may be higher than the amount you have now, so accumulate sats and in the meantime look for a non-custodial wallet.Unfortunately, the withdrawal costs basically forces you to keep on there, unless they're using an exchange with no withdrawal costs. If it's the latter, I'd say bugger keeping it on the exchange, and get it out as soon as possible, since this is your learning stage, and you don't want to be picking up bad habits for the future.",

Do keep in mind that a bearish market is perfect for buying so don't regret your decision, you make a right one.A friendly piece of advice for you- if you buy more bitcoin to invest don't keep it on the exchange transfer them to your wallet, and gain knowledge about wallets, there are different types of wallets. I personally use a desktop wallet (electrum). Always do your own research before taking any action with your coins.",

Bitcoin might be facing a little challenge currently but I am very sure that it would bounce back. Your investment is a smart one and you wouldn't regret it. But I want to encourage you to be very patient because Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme that most ignorant people claim it is. You must also ensure that you keep your investment safe and secret. Although these centralized platform cannot be trusted but you must ensure that you keep your phone and email password safe to avoid fraud. Also ensure only people you trust are aware of your investment to avoid been targeted by criminals that may think you have become wealthy. Yes, most people are unaware that Bitcoin can be bought in units. They feel that you can only buy it as a whole, which might make them feel that you can afford $16,869.12.",

This is the mobile version, right? It's amazing what you can buy even for a small amount of ~5$.If you are planning larger purchases in the future (say, starting from $50), then don't be too lazy to test services like bisq or bestchange. You may find a seller with better conditions.I wish you that the balance of your wallet, albeit little by little, but constantly grows and is always safe.",

Crypto become shit pump and dump because of wallets that holding huge chunk of Bitcoin.This movement is good if everyone will follow and do the courage to buy even with small amount while whales is unloading there coins. It's time for retail investors to purchase whale coins at discount price and not the typical scenario that retail buy at top and sell on bottom. Good job OP!",

Nevermind the amount; there's no big or small investment. The moment you've engaged to investments, it takes courage 'coz not everyone will do it for the sake of seeking profit. It is a small step to some but on another point of view, it is a big step towards profit seeking attitude or behavior. Continue learning new things; there are other ways to make your investment bigger, you just have to learn and choose which one would best suit you as an investor.Also be open for ups and downs on your first investment. The nature of the market value of cryptos, is volatile. There are periods wherein a particular trend is evident which I believe you are aware already (hoping that you really are because it is the conflict for the new investors out there).",

I heard that the one that just failed had that option, I just don't know if it was valid for everyone or for those who bought their tokens. I think the OP has no choice for now, but if he continues with investments and collects a significant amount (for him personally), he should ask for advice on which non-custodial wallet to choose - even a respectable desktop crypto wallet can serve well for smaller amounts.",

Likewise, as a newbie, I bought a few dollars worth of bitcoin in 2018. Being a beginner, I did not know about all the intricacies of wallets and bought them through Web Money. And only after I began to study the forum deeper did I realize that I should not trust such wallets.Even if bitcoin starts to rise sharply, your profit will not be big, but it is always nice to realize that you, although small, are already a bitcoin holder to some extent.

Starting something is usually the most difficult thing to do,  but as you have started, with some dedication you can keep it going with a little more discipline and in a little time your portfolio will greatly improve. As an extra advice due to the current situation in cryptocurrency, you should know that exchanges are not the place to store your bitcoin, and since you're making an effort to get bitcoins for yourself you should also make an effort to keep it safe.",
