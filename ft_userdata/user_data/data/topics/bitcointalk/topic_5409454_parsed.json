Screenshot it and upload it to pic sharing site like IMGUR, we have no way of knowing if you're telling the truth, this is not a hearsay section we must base it on facts like screenshots of transaction records like your deposit, screenshot your proof that you send them an email with the date highlighted so you can prove that you indeed created a ticket for your issue, you have to show something not just words.",
