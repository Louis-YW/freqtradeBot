Bitcoin has been helping lots of people perform decentralised functions where they would be freedom for all.This is also what those against Bitcoin has been trying to fight and that Includes the government. Bitcoin would also want to speak on how easy and seamless a transaction can be compared to what we have from the traditional method, how someone from the comfort of their place can send fund without requiring the permission of anyone.",

But don't you think we already know that? Bitcoin is a decentralized system where everything, including the entire Blockchain, is transparent and open for anyone to see. There's nothing about Bitcoin that it would want to tell that isn't already known. If someone has spent some time studying Bitcoin, they'll know that its transparency and open-source nature mean that every transaction it's ever made is visible on the blockchain. This includes the very first block, Genesis block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto and all subsequent transactions, including the ones between Satoshi and Hal Finney. Anyone who can access the blockchain can check and follow Bitcoin's entire journey since it started.",

To the scammers, thieves, shady bounty operators, spammers & big-money exit-planners: We will add to the blockchain ledger/history a huge F-YOU!!! for tainting the reputation of this community in the mainstream Global marketplace.

Whereas, one thing I think it would have requested from us is nothing else than to just \"buy and hodl long term\", because just as we just saw Bitcoin hitting a new All-time-High of recent, thats not the last All-time-High it will ever hit, because inasmuch as the demand and year passes by, so is it's value likely to keep increasing overtime. Hence, it remains the best asset for keeping long term investment, far better than fiat. And one beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that it is divisible into smaller Satoshi's, making it easily accessible by both the rich and poor masses.",

Every means, method, and strategy of investing in Bitcoin are not secrets, as they are openly being discussed. There are some big investors in Bitcoin who have actually shared their investment strategies; Michael Sailor is one of them, and there are some other big investors who have shared their investment strategies too, but the thing is that some of the strategies that are used by some of those whales might be unfavorable to newbies that are just starting off their journey.Â Even if Bitcoin could speak, there's nothing it's going to tell you if not, \"buy the dip and hold.\" Buying Bitcoin during every dip and holding it till the price pumps is one of the common investment strategies that everyone is using, so what more of a secret do you want Bitcoin to speak and tell you?Â While investing in an asset, the aim is usually to hold onto that asset until it becomes very profitable and yields the actual profit or results that you were expecting before you invested in that asset. So, what more is Bitcoin to its investors? It is also an asset that you buy and hold until you have achieved your desired profits.",

LOL. It's quite fortunate that bitcoin can't talk because otherwise there would be a lot of people who would start going crazier thinking how they could buy it. The advantages of bitcoin will only be discovered by people who know and dare to take risks because there are many people who have abundant wealth but they do not dare to invest in it. So bitcoin cannot talk is another advantage that cannot affect the sleep of rich people who are unable to see bitcoin potential.I will ask what language it would be used in if bitcoin could talk because we never know which nationality its creator belongs to. That means Bitcoin can become another race like an imitation human and it will be quite troublesome when he can speak one language because it will be difficult to understand the language I use.",
