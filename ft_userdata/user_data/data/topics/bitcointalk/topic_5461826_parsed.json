      "body": "What’s the exact rate per week or bi weekly because that’s important in able to attract tester here in the forum. Also Bitcoin payment is only accepted currency on this services board or else your thread will be move on altcoin services board. I remember same beta tester job like this before but the payment is based on the bug which the player can find by playing. Can you confirmed the terms for receiving payments? Lastly, use trusted campaign manager to handle this beta test of yours if you are really serious to hire quality tester here.",

      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk platform. I was wondering if you could drop the link to the website so we could assess it as well. From the assessment, you could get tangible reviews while your beta testing is ongoing. This will enable you achieve maximum results while you render services to the masses.As you have been told earlier, this board only accepts Bitcoin as payment means and not altcoin otherwise your thread would be moved to altcoin discussion board. So it would be nice you reconsider your stand and make a change immediately otherwise you will not be able to get the attention you required here.Lastly, I will advise you to seek the expertise of a reputable manger here for the beta testing and possibly your promotion and advertising after you are done with your beta testing. You can contact Royse777 as he has vast experience  in managing campaigns, reviews and beta testing. Doing this would give you a better chance of getting the publicity you desire here and in the casino industry.",
