The only easiest way to explain bitcoin is by not talking about it, there is no obligation for anyone to explain bitcoin to people because without explanation bitcoin has given evidence in its journey.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on March 02, 2023, 01:45:06 AMRight now, one million satoshi's is only 235 dollars...That's a lot less scary than owning one whole bitcoin, and can make the investor feel good about the position they have in the bitcoin market. Hey! They own an entire hundredth of a bitcoin. Now all they have to do is repeat that same purchase over the course of however much time and they could easily reach one bitcoin. This is especially true if they have a steady, recession proof job.It's scarier trying to talk about bitcoin to the uninitiated, people who are curious about bitcoin will inevitably create their own portion of knowledge, thus will try to learn to understand bitcoin as an investment concept. In most cases the advice will be of no use to those who do nothing, because the risks and fluctuations of bitcoin will bring them to a stage of incompetence.Anyone can buy bitcoins in any amount, but very few people want to do it slowly to start buying, because of greed and wanting to get rich quickly from the investment being made. So it ends up in financial turmoil at a level of stability, especially in times of recession and inflation, investments have stages to apply and do not represent any amount to run, because adjustments need to be made to control risk under any circumstances.",

But fortunately, there are fewer and fewer such people every year, and if people can read, then the network is full of resources for different levels of understanding. I don't think you need to explain anything yourself from the very beginning. Let the person first understand that he needs it, and after reading some of the resources that advise him on education, he should definitely have questions that you, OP, can explain in detail.For me, this is the simplest and most resource-intensive process, since there is nothing difficult about self-education; you just need to support a person along this path.",

That always gives the vibe that it is something dubious since there are very schemes like that. After people understand and see the improvement that bitcoin has brought then I introduce to the aspect of bitcoins that still hold profit by buying and just keeping it.",

I personally use an analogy that bases itself with what the person is most familiar of. For example, I had a sneakerhead in my friend's circle ask me about bitcoin and how to invest in it, being the informed friend that I am, I made things easier for him by putting it to a language he can easily understand. The explanation goes a little like this. \"Say, you're a shoemaker (miner), everytime you make a full Jordan 1 shoe, you get paid accordingly (mining rewards), so it only makes sense to invest on a powerful shoemaking tool (mining rig). That's how bitcoin mining works. however, just like with shoemaking, resources for it does not come infinitely (limited supply of bitcoin), so the less resources there for making shoes (less bitcoins to be mined), the more expensive it will become.\" That's basically how mining works. \"As with bitcoin investing, suppose that you are a sneakerhead (investor), not that you aren't right now. You own and resell shoes but a lot of them aren't really flipping for expensive prices, then you come across a certain jordan variant that could go for a high price or a low price, depending on the season (bitcoin's volatile nature and the bull and bear market), that's basically bitcoin investing.\" That's pretty much how our discussion went. I implore people to make things easier for the people who ask them so they don't go back and forth.",
