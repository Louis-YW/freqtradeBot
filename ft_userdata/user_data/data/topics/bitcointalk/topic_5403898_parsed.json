  "content": "Hi metaI discovered this user HumanityWhole that seems to be rather more frequent on the Politics and Society board. Apparently this user seems to own a blog site which I don't want to reference to avoid promotion of the site as I think that's part of his or her intent for chosen post pattern but, the user tends to create more topic than necessary. Talking about abstract things, infinite existence, immortality and lots more. Just imagine what his doing to the Politics and Society board!Is this allowed?How can a single individual have over 12 threads on a single page that is supposed to hold a total of 38 threads and most of this posts are pasted on the forum the same day (within the range of 3 days). User gives no concern to contributions on the subject as to other users contributions and even with almost zero(0) replis on most of them, the user continues to create more threads. Perhaps, the intent is just to get clicks on referenced links.It's one way to promote spam if you ask me and somehow, user tends to be the host. Although, due to its abstract nature, its not getting much attention but, that might not be for long.I explained my displeasure in one, only to note several others.Perhaps it's some new way to do some cheap click advertising. What's your take on this?",

As far as I know there are no limit to set unless you have a newbie jail. A user can make as many posts as they want and create as many topics as they want. That's not a problem. If you find something zero value, something that is spam immediately report it to the moderator. The moderators have a level of tolerance before they give the user a warning if not ban him. Few warnings without being changing the old habit then he will be banned today or tomorrow.",

No dedicated moderator, theoretically global moderators, and patrollers (well and, admins) are the only ones that'll see reports there. The latter obviously only posts made by newbies that have been reported, which doesn't happen often. Maybe the P&S section needs a dedicated moderator, otherwise there will be no end to spam and zero value posts and threads in that section, suchmoon complained about a similar posting habit of another member in this thread, but i don't think anything has been done till this time. If member's make legitimate complaints like this and nothing happens, then that is only an encouragement for more spammers and surely they will increase. HumanityWhole is only here to advertise his off-forum site and not to discuss bitcoin or anything, if not, how then can you explain a member with thread after thread and with no engagement in them, yet he opens more and concludes them all with a link to his site.",

Although, I felt with the no response on most of the threads created so far by this user, he ought to have realise how his post is received by the community and maybe develop a better approach to create posts that would b engaging. It would help the user even up to the blog site and not leveraging the Unofficial rule of the forum just to see how it would go. There might not be rules as to how frequent a user might create threads but, users should create threads that they are really interested in discussing and not just post with the intent of living it there. OP just wants to gain clicks on his links and not discuss as the case is should have been with threads created on the forum.It's surprising that a much pronounced board like Politics and Society comes without a moderator. If gambling board could have one, I suppose the P&H should have one too. I see that the rules to this board was crated by Flying Hellfish and possibly its moderation but the user haven't been active for almost a year.

Plus, they didn't have many if any posts actually interacting after posting the threads. I can only nuke, and therefore deciding against that, since I thought a temporary ban would likely be better. That's up to the globals/admins though. They might deem the removal of the posts, enough of a warning. If the user continues, I'd say report it, and further action will likely be taken.

I may have forgotten something.In this case, it was clear to me that the user was posting these articles for the sole purpose of advertising their site. They were sprung around the forum, not only Politics, and society. They rarely if ever contributed back to the discussion. They were also all posted within a short period of time, even ones that were made several days ago, were all bunched up within a few hours of each other if I recall correctly, at the very least the same day. However, just to be clear; when you say referral, referrals usually mean in terms of interneting (that's a word, right?), a referral that someone earns from, probably better described as a affiliate link. That wouldn't be allowed, unless specific conditions were met. However, when a site posts a tracking link (which could be confused with a referral link, as they're effectively the same) to their own site, for them to track how many visitors they receive specifically from their Bitcointalk thread, that's generally okay. However, not for everything thread, as that's advertisement spam. Usually, this method is seen on announcement threads, as it does make sense there.

Not because of the sheer amount of spam, but the fact you're going to piss users off no matter what stance you take. There's going to be complaints made, and ultimately it's going to be a difficult job picking out what's spam, and what's isn't. Personally, and I know this is going to be seen as detrimental to a lot of users there, but most things should be left, as long as there's some sort of discussion. However, there needs to be substance, and I'm not saying correct substance, but a explanation or reason to believe what they're posting. You know, if someone posts \"god is great\", and that's all, that to me is spam. However, that would likely be argued as censorship by some, but its really not. You need someone to be objective, without any sort of bias at all. So, really they shouldn't care what the person is saying, but rather if it's substantial enough. That's ultimately why the P&S section has struggled over the years I'd say. It's a great section, some proper good posters there, and some of the most interesting discussions are had there, that comes with some big personalities, with some absolutely crazy stances, but you need someone to be able to separate that craziness, and apply objective based moderating. Also, due to the nature of the discussions; there's plenty of drama there. The ideal candidate probably isn't someone that routinely gets involved with discussion honestly  so they don't build up these subconscious feelings towards users that they've gotten into debates with which effects how they moderate. theymos has his work cut out for him with that section .",

Â The key difference with this case; is they aren't directly copying the content from their website, and pasting it here. Whereas, the quoted user above was doing exactly that, then providing the source, but the intention of posting was mainly for the purpose of advertising since they're obviously related to the site. There was no additional content or thoughts or anything. Copy contents of website, paste, probably never return back to the thread, and instead copy another of their articles, and repeat. So, as per the guideline I quoted above; one would be deemed substantial, as well as useful. Â While, the other doesn't quite qualify under that for me, due to the nature of how it was posted i.e directly copying it without anything else, intentions etc. I guess someone could argue that it was somewhat substantial, due to it not being low quality on its own, but the nature of how it was taken, and putting on here is what makes it rather unsubstantial to me. When you combine all the things together, including the amount of threads that were created in a small period of time, I think there's a clear difference between them.I do think it's generally good practice to keep somewhat related threads into one though. So, I do get your point there, and is somewhat enforced, especially when you look at marketplace threads involving similar or the same items/services.",
