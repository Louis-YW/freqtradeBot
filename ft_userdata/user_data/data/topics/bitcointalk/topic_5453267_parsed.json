So i am interested on what are your insights on choosing those almost 40 coins and what makes you think they all of them will be a part of next bull run? Have you read their whitepapers and how about their competition? Reason for 0x can't really be the marketcap alone. Otherwise you could pick just random low caps and say that they are rising next bull run because of it. And volume can and is being constantly faked.",

As we all know or if others still don't know, most of these alts that have reached their peak already. They're the ones that has hard time into reaching another peak or all time high. But if that's what you think that shall bring you 10x of profit on the next bull run.Then, it's a good luck to everybody who holds it and we shall see if you'll be accurate then.",

Don't make a joke here, mate. That's ok for the low token price projects on your list, but what about Litecoin (LTC), Aptos (APT), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX)?It's improbable that the coins I mentioned will gain at least 10x in the upcoming bullrun. They are big project coins that have got a big market cap as well. I doubt your experience that you said you have been trading since 2019.  Hmmm...",

Be careful do not be fooled by the possibility of easy earningsHave to agree on this one, on his priority list I didn’t see any good coins that can potentially pump in the next cycle of bull run so I also suggest the same thing, be careful on dealing with them and make sure you do analyze well to avoid losing more money. The market is down today, this is the best time to accumulate good coins, better to look at the top coins rather than taking risk with the small projects.",

It's good if you have studied their projects so you can see the opportunities of each coin.There are a few coins I don't know about, especially the new ones, but hopefully the new ones do have a good chance of going high. We all hope that the coins we have can provide benefits, but we must know that the competition between altcoins will be increasingly fierce, making us more careful to look for them. And once you're confident about the coins, you should be able to hold on to them and maybe buy some more when the price drops.",

Be careful do not be fooled by the possibility of easy earningsThat's the same thoughts as mine. I want to know how much OP has invested on each of them, maybe they're just like $50-$100 and that's it suggesting these, all of it to everybody as if they'll reach 10x soon.Be careful with your choice because you'll not know if all of them are going to be as good as they are. It's good to have lesser coins in your portfolio but they're the best performing assets than to have a bunch of them but most of them you're unsure if they'll perform well or not.",
