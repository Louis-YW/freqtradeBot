  "content": "The Shiba Predator „QOM“Introduction / about me: I am not a developer or Businessman. I am just your everyday Poor Boy enjoying simple life.I got inspired by the Idee of decentralization but there were few real decentralized projects out there.Until I found out about QOM from a friend even though it doesn’t have fancy tokenomics or redistribution and burn plans…..It has a real Qommunity where everyone helps each other so that we all succeed and reach our goal to Flip Shiba.We follow Ryoshi vision that 1000 Flowers can blossom if given the right infrastructure.Thank you, Kodai.As the rest was already written down, I don t want to repeat more words and leave you with some links to the original that started all this:Website: https://www.qompredator.financeCoin Market Cap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-predator/EtherScan: https://etherscan.io/token/0xa71d0588EAf47f12B13cF8eC750430d21DF04974Stocktwits: https://stocktwits.com/symbol/QOM.XMedium: https://medium.com/@kodaibigbearTwitter: https://twitter.com/ShibaPredator1 Telegram: https://t.me/JoinQOMshibapredatorNFT: https://qom.cardsSee you soon Qomrade.And always do what your heart tells you.",
