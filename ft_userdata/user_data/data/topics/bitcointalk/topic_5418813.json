And I'm wondering what's really the issues. Now considering the following• Assuming their Accounts were banned from the platform, is it possible for developers to drain their merit bags and redistribute it to active users.• Apart from Satoshi, Are there any importantance of keeping dead and inactive accounts of over 4 to 6 years.• Is there a track record of the total number of Merit available on the platform, just curious to know",

The forum does not delete members' accounts and they do not represent any problem - I see no reason why you consider it a problem at all? Merits are not something that is limited and should be taken away from inactive members, because there are members of the forum who are merit sources and they receive certain amounts of merit from the forum which they then distribute.Also, for each merit that someone sends to someone, 0.5 sMerits are created, which means that when you get 2 merits, you can send one to someone.

Also why reclaim their username for someone else just to take it? One extra person having that name is going to leave another person wanting it and not being able to have it - what if it becomes a contest too after those 4 years have passed to see who can register the name first? And then what do you do with the threads and posts of people who's profiles have been inactive (the guest title stands out a lot on old threads) and if you're banned, I don't think you should get chance to recover your profile that username should be gone with the ban..",

They’re two different counters. Bear in mind that sMerits are what you award, not Merits. That’s to say, when you \"merit someone\", you’re really sending from your available sMerits, which will decrease, and incrementing the recipients Merit counter, which will never decrease (unless he’s been really naughty).Having said that, there is no point in eliminating Merits from inactive accounts. What’s more, it would do nothing other than mess-up all the ranking system, bearing in mind that it derived from a combination of Merits and Activity (i.e. it would lead to de-ranking accounts).sMerits from inactive accounts could at some point decay, although if it hasn’t happened by now, there doesn’t seem to be much point in it. It has been discussed before whether remaining unused airdropped sMerits should still remain, and whatever the opinions expressed, they still remain unaltered. They are not really a limited resources (from a forum’s perspective), so there is no need to recollect them in order to redistribute them in any way.Quote• Apart from Satoshi, Are there any importantance of keeping dead and inactive accounts of over 4 to 6 years.It’s part of the history and discussion on the forum. Deleting accounts would likely also require either deleting all the account’s posts, or assigning them to an anonymous account. The former would create gaps when reading through threads, and the latter wouldn’t do any good either.Quote• Is there a track record of the total number of Merit available on the platform, just curious to knowMerits yes: Some forum members keep track of this information through a range of solutions (webs, dashboards, files).sMerits no.",

The former would create gaps when reading through threads, and the latter wouldn’t do any good either.I'd like to continue arguing in favor of leaving history on the forum intact. If we delete a user's account and its past posts, then we not only run into issues with referencing those past posts but also with preventing the community from viewing and accessing any questions that were answered by them. As such, admins should only delete a user's account in the case of extreme misconduct; deleting them simply because they left the community is not grounds for removal.",

And I'm wondering what's really the issues.Life happens. Sometimes, death can cause a user to be inactive. In fact, that's the most scary part of my thought whenever I notice a user has been inactive that long. Otherwise, I don't think anyone who was here before Bitcoin became popular would want to go cold now that it's gathering momentum. There are users who have ceased posting here but they're still active reading comments here. For those who have stopped posting and reading here, there's certainly something wrong.Quote• Assuming their Accounts were banned from the platform, is it possible for developers to drain their merit bags and redistribute it to active users.There wouldn't be any need for that since merit doesn't have any monetary load on it. Theymos can send as many of it as he wants to merit sources to distribute and redistribute. No big deal.Quote• Apart from Satoshi, Are there any importantance of keeping dead and inactive accounts of over 4 to 6 years.There was argument against that in the past.
