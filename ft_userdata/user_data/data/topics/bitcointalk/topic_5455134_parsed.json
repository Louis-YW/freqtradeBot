  "content": "I have some investment in Leveraged tokens in Mexc exchange which are Doge5L, Eth5L. But I am astonished when I saw that my 35$ investment goes to almost 0. When Eth was around 1750 $ then I invested in EthBull but Eth now at around 1870$ but my assets are almost 0. I am holding almost 4/5 months are day by day it's decreasing though Doge and Eth pumped a little. So my request to every beginners who want to trade leveraged tokens don't hold it for long term as they are getting lower day by day. You can hold it for short term but I will suggest you not to do this. I think it's better to trade futures trading with low leverage than trading with these leveraged tokens.",

If you want to trade leverage token on both exchanges, you will see a warning, about how it should be used for short time trading and how risky it is. On Bybit:   On Kucoin:If you click on the product information on Kucoin, you will see better explanation. Is it not like that on MEXC too? The exchanges I see such tokens, there are always warning about it.",

When you don't know what you are doing, you can not manage risk and liquidations will come.QuoteI think it's better to trade futures trading with low leverage than trading with these leveraged tokens. Trading with Futures is another bad choice from you. By trading with Leverages, Leveraged tokens, Futures, you are making exchanges richer but making yourself poorer.If you trade, trade with Spot only. Never click on Future, Leverage tabs and click on Agree to their terms to activate those trading tabs. After you activating those tabs, it will be very hard for you to control your greed and not use those derivative trading tabs.",

Tokens can be minted by developers but Proof of Work coins can not be minted but only can be mined with time by miners.This topic discusses about a more risky thing, trading with leveraged tokens. With leverages, it is bigger risk than with tokens in Spot trading.Tokens are usually useless in utility and have very high in their inflation so token price mostly will decrease with time. Like the US. dollar, fiat currencies have their decreasing purchasing power with time, inflationary tokens will have decreasing prices with time.If you hold those tokens, you lose.If you trade those tokens with leverages, like Short you will be killed by bounces.If you trade them with leverages for Long, you will be killed by market fud, token crashes.",

Quicker than you can utter \"blockchain,\" they can evaporate your investment capital. Your adventure, is an unadulterated portrayal of 'decay', which, in the financial lingo, signifies \"the marketplace swiped my assets whilst I was occupied toasting to DOGE's rate climb.\"However, don't get it twisted. Leveraged tokens aren't universally appalling. They resemble those ludicrously hot chicken wings you find at a local bar. While they may not be for everyone, there's a certain subset of risk-loving individuals who savour the rush. To the novices out there, here's a piece of advice: steer clear of leveraged tokens unless you're well-versed in their workings. Failing to do so is akin to showing up at a firefight armed with only a butter knife!",

Maybe some don't actually know what it entails further more before they badge into it, trading on itself has its own demands and risk while those that go on leverage trading do not have a good understanding of some of these conditions attached because they will not have the opportunity to make any readjustment while reading than to embrace the outcome that comes in after the trading, there's nothing to leverage on when trading than to get yourself the readiness for it right before you start trading.",
