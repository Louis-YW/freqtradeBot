There's a low chance for the result to not go that way but that's already included in there odds computation. Sometimes its good bet live if the result is not what many expecting or vice versa. At the end, This is still gambling and anything is possible to occur so answering odds value question, It's worth to pick a love bet for someone that was supposed to be dominating the game but somehow have a bad start because this only happens rarely and the odds usually increase at that particular moment.Yesterday in the WNBA, Connecticut Suns played against Washington Mystics.Prematch Suns were 1.30 and Mystics 3.50Washington led by 17 in the first half, were completely dominant. Then you got 2 quarters of opposite domination by the Suns.It ended 66-66 and went into an Overtime.Once the OT started the odds were 1.50 on the Suns (some sites offered only 1.40) - The Suns played at home and the momentum completely changed towards them - stll, it's risky but they won by 2 points.",

It seems to me that after Timmy equalized the score in sets, it was necessary to bet on him, since in fact he was able to equalize the game, but the odds for his victory were very large, since Djokovic remained a clear favorite. In the end, Djokovic won, but if he lost, then everyone who bet on him with a seemingly good odds of 1.25 would lose a lot of money - the profit was not worth the risk.",

The live bet you mentioned is a good example IMO as sometimes it's better to wait for favs to trail a bit before placing a bet so you'd get better odds and handicap. For the second example, there's still value but I think it's less compared to the first example as the totals tend to adjust much faster depending on the pace of the match but there are cases where the games is expected to go under but surprising go over and still hit the pre live total.",

With enough practice and a keen eye you could probably make it profitable, I was once able to pick something like 8 winning bets in a row for a free competition, although that's an extremely rare event - most of the time you'd barely be able to pick 2 or 3 correct in a row at a coin toss. Mispricing does happen and only someone who is very close to the sport is likely to know all the characteristics of who will win a certain event, in-play betting does have a lot more potential to disrupt the odds and give an individual an advantage.",

If you keep betting on the favored team and you place 10 bets you may find that even though you won all 10 you are just 10% up on your money and just 1 loss would completely wipe you out. If you keep betting on the underdogs and losing 9/10 bets you may find that even after winning just 1 out of 10 you are also up 10% total and just one more win would put you at 50% so what's next? bet on the winner again and get a few cents on the dollar or go for the underdog with the potential of doubling your money.

It's just somehow bookmakers have managed to scare off bettors from taking chances that comes up in the game until it eludes them due to time. Even at that, its quite risky too as in competitive events, so long as there is time, there is the possibility of a come back. You can imagine the results of the 2nd leg of the UCL semi finals between Real Madrid and Manchester City. Where R. Marhez managed to extend the aggregate to a 2 goals upto the 90th minute. I guess if you to pick a bet a that point you would go for Manchester City and that's for sure supposed to be a valued bet andbyet somehow, Real Madrid still did a come back, won and advanced to the finals. Its just the game!",
