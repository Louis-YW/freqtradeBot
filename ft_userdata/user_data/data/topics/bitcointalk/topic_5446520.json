There is a big problem on how the public see the bitcoin because the 1st ever thought that pops in their mind is something negative and I don't blame them because there are reasons or past history why they have thoughts thats comes to them like that. One of the reasons that I've been thinking is what they perceive when they first hear or read the word bitcoin, we usually consume a lot of contents not only in television but of course in a lot of social media platforms. One of them are the articles online or influencers who shares their opinion of the bitcoin. If the public watch or consume negative opinions or story regarding bitcoin, their mental perspective to it will immediately turn to bad. So when the topic regarding bitcoin brought up, they usually says negative because of what they perceived in the past. My question is how we can turn their perspective into positive? I have good motive on that because I also want them to have a better lives by understanding how it works and also how we can chance their way of living by using it.",

      "body": "Yes the vast majority of the public either doesn't know what Bitcoin is or thinking it is something negative.Usually they think:1. It's bad for the environment (it isn't, its actual a huge benefit)2. It's a scam or pyramid scheme / ponzi or some other scheme the don't know the actual definition of3. It's outdated tech (lol)4. It's only good for criminals5. It'll just be banned6. It's a bubble (and they apparently don't know its been through several market cycles)7. It's something people lose money on / it's going to zero (lol facepalm)I think I hit all the major misconceptions / negative views.How do we fix these. Simple: education! There is so much misinformation about Bitcoin passed around by people who don't have a clue about it and those people greatly outnumber the people who are actually educated on Bitcoin. We as a community need very good very public educational resources to point people to. As more and more people get educated on Bitcoin eventually the momentum will swing in favor of education instead of misinformation. But we're a very long way from that. It would of course help if some big people in media and politics were educated on Bitcoin and could spread the world. As currently its the government that is engaging in the next big attack on Bitcoin.",

Ofcourse people in this industry would be on the contrary; we see the potential more than the risk. But both sides are indeed true; this technology created huge profit potential for its users but risk will always be there because of the nature of market price volatility.Quote from: Ndabagi01 on March 27, 2023, 09:31:45 PMPeople are usually resistant to changing their minds about an invention once they have formed an opinion about it.

For now, sharing our knowledge to those who are interested would be a good thing to do than to contribute with baseless accusations on this industry.",

We don't, we just let them discover what bitcoin is, what benefits they can get from it and see how it goes for it. It's going to be difficult to turn someone perspective not just to bitcoin but in any other aspects in our lives, it is what it is. They either will have to believed on it or not.Even Satoshi himself said this:Quote “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” We can tell anyone that is the positive or even negative things about bitcoin and let them decide for themselves if they want to join the bandwagon or not. Just like what we are seeing right now, there is a banking crisis or even during the height of Covid-19. We don't tell people the get their money out and put into bitcoin because the bank is failing or to hedge their wealth on it because there is pandemic.",

Those that succeeded just clearly demonstrated that they are superior to the previous technology. Bitcoin can't do the same with banks and fiat currency.",

It is used for money laundering and the crypto market is used in the black market, all these are just things to say to those who can't afford it and understand what technology it is they use these lame excuses. Scirty hate those things which they can't understand & control. So be confident about the positive impacts and stay with it.When these people will realize you will be superior to them because you recognized the true financial freedom before them. At that time you can ask about the stupidity that these people use to say when it was in struggling age.",

Some other people will need longer time to absorb new things but they can still change their minds. The last type are people who would prefer to stick with what they are familiar with like fiat currencies, banks and they will never accept Bitcoin.",

Usually, if you hear news like this, some people who are curious will immediately find out what bitcoin is.        - The second one is the opposite of the information above, if the information above is curious because someone is experiencing profits, now this one is the opposite, which is curious when I hear that someone has suffered a big loss and the loss came from investing in bitcoin.       - the third is accidental, sometimes not a few people know bitcoin by accident, whether it's when opening a website, or passing on the social media.people in the 3 point criteria above are likely to look for information about bitcoin on various platforms or websites. here is the important point, if only the news that was first seen was good about bitcoin, it would definitely have a good impact, but what about when the first search about bitcoin was presented with oblique news about bitcoin, of course there were 2 possibilities that would happen, if people who saw the information This negative is people who are curious because at first they see the news about the benefits they get from bitcoin, of course the question will arise, \"why is this like this\" and will definitely look for other information.but when those who read this information are curious people because at first they saw someone's loss from bitcoin, they will definitely stop here.then if the person reading this information is someone who initially accidentally knows bitcoin, chances are they will stop or look for information again, it depends on how curious they are.This is just my assumption, please let me know if I'm not quite right or wrong",
