Whatever he said before about Bitcoin that is not good, he even said before that even if Bitcoin becomes 25$, he still won't buy it. But what happened?Quote\"Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invested $500 million in Brazil's Nubank in June 2021 ahead of its initial public offering (IPO) later that year. Buffett's Nubank holding is thought to be now worth around $840 million after he plowed another $250 million into the startup bank during its IPO.”https://cryptopotato.com/this-is-warren-buffetts-top-stock-in-2023-hint-its-got-something-to-do-with-crypto/There is really no secret that cannot be revealed, the truth will reveal, now what is this NUBANK?QuoteThe Berlin-based neobank – N26 – established a cryptocurrency service that will enable customers to buy and sell 100 cryptocurrencies.The largest fintech bank in Latin America – Nubank – also hopped on the bandwagon, launching its own cryptocurrency in Brazil. Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway – the conglomerate holding company spearheaded by the famed investor and crypto critic Warren Buffett – is among the financial backers of the banking institution.source: https://cryptopotato.com/these-banks-are-venturing-into-crypto-despite-ongoing-bear-market/Did W. Buffett do this without knowing that Nubank is crypto-friendly? For me, I don't believe he doesn't know this. But why did he still speak negatively about Bitcoin? What is its purpose? Because if he is really anti-Bitcoin (W. Buffet), then this is how we will know: does the title I made in this discussion fit him? Why does he have to utter derogatory words about Bitcoin?He talks about the negatives of Bitcoin, but the one he invested in, NUBANK, is crypto-friendly and already launched his own cryptocurrency called \"Nucoin\".This means that W. Buffett has a personal interest in why he is always criticizing Bitcoin, because he probably thinks that when many people panic about what he will say and there is a dump in the market value of Bitcoin, he will take advantage of the opportunity to buy large holdings. It's just that what he wanted to happen didn't happen; this is just my assessment based on the information I found here.Warren Buffett statement Beforehttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/buffett-backed-digital-bank-nubank-to-launch-its-own-cryptocurrency.htmlWhat do you think?",

They have made out such criticism but in behind they are really that accumulating. Why they do that? They are really that tending to drive the price down whenever the market would really be that making out some negative reaction about it. Knowing that WB does have some influence then it might neither be having a significant effect or not.So as a crypto investor then better get used to this because sentiments and news like this do usually happen and do really goes out in the market and this isnt something that new anymore.Whether on what names we do called into these people or person which \"THEY DONT REALLY CARE\". They would really always getting in line on what they do have in minds in speaking about financial steps and actionsand as long they could really be able to benefit out then it would really be their main goal.No matter how many times they would be vomit out but later on they would really be just simply eat those vomit again and it do seems that there's nothing happened.If you arent that wise on investing world then you wont really be able to make money and this is what they are doing.",

I think number one, to the point of ridiculousness, is Peter Schiff. I do not agree with that. In Buffett's case, his criticisms of bitcoin are quite similar to gold. He doesn't like it because it doesn't produce anything, it doesn't pay rents or dividends. The fact that he has invested in this company that now offers crypto-services is normal to a certain extent, since the cryptocurrency market is getting bigger and bigger and covers many areas of society. He also spent a long time without changing his cell phone and without investing in technology, finally he changed his cell phone and bought shares of Apple, being his biggest investment.For the little time he has left to live, do not give so much importance to what he says.",

For sure though that he knows that NuBank is crypto friendly, but then again, if we talk about profits, it doesn't matter to this billionaire as they will continue to invest which they think will be big someday, including a crypto friendly bank.",

Does he just attack Bitcoin repeatedly even if unprovoked? I'm not sure if he even speaks about Bitcoin if not asked for his opinion. But if asked, he's frank about his dislike of it. The man is a brilliant investor and he makes investments in companies which he believes would succeed. Whatever that company does, he probably doesn't dictate. So it's not really that huge of a conflict. This is probably just like JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan is serious about Bitcoin adoption. On the contrary, its CEO, Jamie Dimon, calls Bitcoin a fraud, a pet rock, and a waste of time. In any case, don't give too much weight to the words of these people. Their goal is money. They can say one thing and do another. That's not a problem for as long as they earn.",

He has also shown interest in technology companies like Apple in the past, so his investment in Nubank may be more about the fintech industry than a shift in his view on cryptocurrencies.It’s true that Buffett has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, dismissing them as risky and worthless. He has even referred to Bitcoin as \"rat poison squared\".https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/warren-buffett-best-quotes-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-investing-rat-poison-squared-2021-1-1029974898Your title is a bit harsh, but it does make a point.

It means that he really knows that he will benefit a lot from Bitcoin as well, and in reality, it seems that he has succeeded in this matter, and for sure, he is positioned to sell his Bitcoin holdings after the halving.",

We don't know what's actually on Buffett's mind, but one thing is clear to me: anything he says is bad for Bitcoin.The crucial point is that we or we must have accumulated Bitcoin during its halving's next year or during the bull run. If Buffett's remarks irritate you, remember why he said them. Perhaps that isn't so difficult to grasp.",

As a businessman who has been vociferous against Bitcoin, I doubt he'd go back on his words. Not like it hasn't happened in past times of other anti bitcoiners, but him alongside his partner, Charles Munger have made it clear on their stand against it. I'm not really surprised about this and I will not label it the way the op did because to him it's just business and anywhere there stands to be profit, he'd invest. Infact this is not the first time he's putting his money into the digital sector as in 2019, he also put heavy money into a digital payments company,  StoneCo. Still in Brazil. In another angle, this is good news because it will help push mainstream acceptance and a possible adoption of the Blockchain. Everyone is entitled to his opinion and so far Warren Buffett has given it and while there's those who have listened to him and entertained FUD, there's still others who have gone ahead and invested.

There are other top investors like Sc Us (ttgp), Ltd, Galileo (ptc) Ltd and Capital Research Global Investors, so Warren might not have much influence.
