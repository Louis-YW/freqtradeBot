  "content": "Hey everyone üëãWe launched a decentralized application, called BorB. It allows you to make predictions whether the market will be bullish or bearish, and earn up to 80%. ¬†BorB was established to revolutionize the prediction market industry and greatly simplify decentralized derivatives trading experience.The main value of the application is non-custodiality. The user keeps private keys and assets on their own side, without providing to a third party. Thus, it is possible to use the platform having zero trust.By transferring to the blockchain, we made the mechanics independent, honest and transparent. All according to the new philosophy of web3, where power is no longer concentrated in the hands of corporations and brokers. Everyone gets an equal opportunity to earn. For opening positions, results, profitability, payments, quotes, etc. smart contracts are now responsible. It is controlled by program code and technologically does not depend on the human factor. We just administer and support the system and take 1% commission fee.The platform has 3 main protocols:1. TradeTo make a profit, a trader needs to make a prediction whether the price in 5 minutes, an hour, or a day will be higher/lower than the current price. And this prediction must be correct. Guessed, earned 80% of the deposit. Didn't guess, lost. No accounts, registrations, confirmations and KYC. Full digital sovereignty. The interaction takes place directly with the smart contract, simply by connecting the wallet.Of course, not everyone can earn. Money doesn't appear out of nowhere. The winners earn the money of the losers. This is how the entire financial system works. We see on VERY large statistics that it is possible to predict the price movement. Some do it a little better than others. Average win rate is 53.08%2.EarnBorB blockchain-based referral program opens a way for protocols, websites, wallets and individuals to earn USDT and USDC stablecoins. It is a system of a smart-contracts that settle the split of commissions from the trade volumes on the protocol to referrals (protocol commission 50%, referral commission - 50%). Lifetime! 3. SupplyInstead of brokerage money, there are liquidity pools. When a trader makes a wrong prediction and loses money, they just settle in liquidity pools. Profitable trades are also paid out to traders from these pools.Liquidity pools are formed by investors. These are the so-called ‚Äúco-owners‚Äù of the business, who receive all the profit from the losses of traders. You invest stablecoins: USDC or USDT into the pool, in return you get Token+. These are LP tokens of the pool, which are the guarantor of a contribution to a specific liquidity pool, and determine your share of the commission received from transactions in this pool. All coins are public, on smart contracts and no one has access to them, except for the depositor himself. Profit is distributed to all contributors of the pool every day and automatically reinvested back into the pool. To return your contribution and profit interest, you need to return these LP tokens.In order to keep the APY at a high level, the limits for deposits in pools are initially limited to $10M. Further restrictions can be lifted. These and other questions will be decided by contributors, by voting. Governance tokens (DAO) will be distributed among all participants, and not built on a hierarchy. No public sales or airdrops. The more tokens, the more weighty the vote.There is no conflict of interest, like classic brokers with traders, here either. The main thing is not to allow large drawdowns. The built-in risk management algorithm regulates the balance of each pool from a strong skew, and reduces the payout percentage (maximum 80%, minimum 20%) if the yield falls. The yield of the system should always be 2-4%. Under such conditions, successful traders take money from unsuccessful ones, and pools earn on volume.There are no boundaries in crypto. Crypto traders from around the world can make predictions on the platform 24/7. The Chinese are particularly interested. Asians just love betting. Therefore, from asians, as well as americans and indians it is planned to receive the main profitability of the pools. Join now;)Possible risks:1. Hacking smart contracts. No matter what anyone says, but any protocol is subject to attacks. You can make an audit for vulnerabilities by yourself, all smart contracts are public.2. Drawdown of liquidity pools. A situation in which traders always make correct predictions. Or, roughly speaking, a crowd of martingale-drivers enters a strong trend and sucks it dry, and at the same time the pool reserves.Although this is a zero-sum game and the expected value is not in favor of the trader, and the martingale is almost like a verdict, anyway we have to warn about all the risks.Thank you for your attention. All the best!borb.fi",
