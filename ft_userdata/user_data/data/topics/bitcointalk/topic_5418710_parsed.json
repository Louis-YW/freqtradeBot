Don't you think the readers deserve some warnings about this?You are right that's why I try to mention if KYC is needed or not. There are a few casinos which officialy don't accept US players but in reality their top VIPs are from the US. So it depends.

Personally I am very happy with my Ledger. Maybe you are right and using the word \"best\" isn't but that's pretty subjective and it's also the writing style. The best depends on one's needs.About the anonymity what's the main concern? They pass your details after the purchase?And fixed.

Thanks will include it.2. As with other articles the word best is subjective. I get your point but it still depends on a few factors. In general, I have to say I really appreciate yours and everyone else's feedback. I know there is a long way to go and its very very helpful.",

The event of a hacking is mentioned at some point but I personally am very happy with it thats why I have it there. Would you recommend a more safe and private hardware wallet?",

Those annoying regulations are there for a reason. Most crypto casinos are licensed in Curacao. The common thing for almost all Curacao-licensed gambling platforms I have checked is that they don't accept players from the United States. Suggesting ways to circumvent that can get the players in a lot of problems when and if it's time to withdraw their winnings. There is one thing casinos hate more than people breaking their rules and terms and that's winners. If you won, but you broke their rules and they find out, be sure that their TOS (that you agreed to) is their protection. They will confiscate your winnings, maybe even the initial deposits. Using VPNs or socks to cheat the system works just fine if you are losing. Not so much when they decide to take a closer look at who you are. Stolen identities ad fake IDs are even worse, and I hope you aren't suggesting things like that in your articles.",
