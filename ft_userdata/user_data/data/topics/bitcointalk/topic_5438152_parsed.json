Designed to run in parallel with mugle chain, Mugle Smart Chain adds smart contract functions to create assets on the chain and determine its purpose and usage rules. Assets created on Mugle Smart Chain are easier to use and protected by open source code rather than a centralized organization.Mugle Smart Chain forked from the Ethereum code base, and modifications to the supply function.Mugle Smart Chain specs- Algorithm: Ethash- Block Time: 12 Second- Block Reward: 50000 MUGLEToken distribution- Team allocation 6000000000- Foundation allocation 6000000000Mugle Smart Chain background- Website https://mugle.org/- Mugle genesis topic  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406583.0",
