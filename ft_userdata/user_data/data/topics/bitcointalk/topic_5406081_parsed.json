But when I'm on Chrome and I click a link that is supposed to call up the metamask,(for example, like clicking the Connect button on Pancakeswap) nothing happens. The screen just stares at me. I have cleared metamask and Chrome cache. Still nothing. I'm at my wit's end. The Metamask works perfect with other browsers like Firefox and Edge, but not with Chrome, no wayAnyone with a solution?

Would appreciate itHave you tried it with any other browser? I am using Metamask with Chrome browser and there seems to be no problem with it. My connection to DEX and exchange exchanges is still working normally, I just made a trade last night and everything is still working well. When was the last time you used it, you can try again now and we know what your mistake is, it would be better to have a picture",

Runs no problem, try setting your Chrome settings to the initial settings alias default, who knows if there are settings that make it limited",

I also tried connecting to Uniswap, but it stuck at Connecting loading pop up page.Looking it up on Reddit, there is an user 4 days ago that said:Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBArmy/comments/vup6ba/unable_to_confirm_swap_on_shibaswap/*RESOLVED* For anyone experiencing this issue, do not use the Chrome browser. There is some type of bug that prevents the transaction from going through. Instead use FireFox.",

I remember I installed an anti-browser popup or popunder browser extension, right before the issues with Metamask started off. That should be the cause. Why haven't I thought of it.

That's pure genius from you, mate. Thanks. Let me check it out You can give feed back after the anti-browser popup deactivation to verify if that was the case and reason metamask pop was not active.There is always an advantage and disadvantage of anything, this action as manage to block both the annoying and important popup, maybe if there is option to chose which popup to be allowed nd which to be blocked will be better.",

If you are not on the bsc network on metamask, it may not react or it gives warnings such as make sure you choose the right network. But it is also very interesting that he does not react at all. First, I suggest clearing your browser's cache or cookies. Apart from that, chrome may be asking for updates and if you don't do these updates, it may cause problems. But if you've done all of them and still doesn't work, back up your wallet and try deleting the chrome browser and reinstalling it, maybe the problem will be fixed.",

Would appreciate itWorks fine with me all my transactions on metamask are on chrome and it all went through, it pops up when it triggers by the exchanges, something is restricting or stopping it from popping up it could be another extension or the setting in your anti-virus, better check or disable your extensions and check what causes it, or reinstall your chrome and get the latest version of Chrome.Or try this solution I got on one forum QuoteOK I just got this working. What I had to to do was change from Binance Chain back to ETH chain before I put in my password. Then it connected fine and then asked if it should change back to Binance chain on itâ€™s own (I think 1inch site actually did the asking about changing chains not MM) when it tried to connect to BSC site.Anyway it is working now without having to reinstall.https://community.metamask.io/t/metamask-web-browser-extension-wont-open/228/4",

Unfortunately, I don't know what the reason others are able to use it finely. I do install it with bare configuration with both Chrome and also the Metamask extension. I guess as a temporary usage, you can use other browsers in the meanwhile, like Firefox for example, but if you are already getting used to a chromium-based browser, Brave browser seems like a good option.",

I also heard my friend complain to me yesterday, I asked him to switch to another browser and everything is back to normal.",
