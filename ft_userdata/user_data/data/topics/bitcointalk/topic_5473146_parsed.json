You should be aware that transactions are irreversible and if your funds have been gone by now, there's no way to access and recover them.Government access token?They're joking and don't get fooled.",

Quote from: slavic43 on November 08, 2023, 01:52:48 AMThey were saying it's only available on the Darkweb and the most experienced Crypto traders know about this. Why it should only be available there? When most of the illegal things are happening there and don't forget that most scams are also there. That's a lot of money that they're trying to suck from their victims and how much was it that you're about to recover on your wallet that seemed t o be gone already because I'm guessing that you've been phished before, right?",
