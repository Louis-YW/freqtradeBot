I mean there is no wrong with taking and following the signals until and unless we make ourselves completely responsible for the losses or profit. Many newbies follow these signals on a regular basis and take trades accordingly but, lately they make losses and complains the signal provider. So yes these signals cannot be 100% correct, just use them when you can’t yourself analyse the market for some reasons.",

There are times that we tend to make loses and that do not mean that mistake can not happen. In case you intend to use any crypto signal, you need to make sure that you are trading with what you know you can afford to lose because the market can dance to any direction and if we are not trading in that direction, we can make loses. With any signals you want to use, it will be cool you you can also learn how to trade on your own so that you will not be ignorant about the crypto market and using the signals you get blindly without trying to know the crypto analyst choose to trade in such direction.",

It's better to invest in courses and learn for yourself. first and foremost, if they have high accuracy, they should be doing this on their own as they can take advantage of such rare opportunity to earn money. however, as we can see, most trading signal groups are just milking these naive users who want to earn quick profits. if the OP wants to check out how these signal groups are performing, better try those free groups first and get the feel how they are doing it. you will only get disappointed to these paid groups because they will likely screw your funds.",

But using this signals does not mean I will be 100% certain that am going to win the trade as I still proceed with caution knowing fully well that their is no 100% prediction anything can still happen in between.

Especially in this day and age, it's a bit annoying to look at because what you see is just like that. What I'm talking about is trading group signals. Sometimes I also see people who say they are analyst traders and offer to join their telegram channels to earn a lot from trading.I don't like the way of hyping because it's not realistic, and you can see in his promotion that he only says sweet words to make you fall for what he's saying; that's the tactic used. So, if the viewers are not aware, they will really fall out of curiosity. So being cautious, at least, isn't bad, right?",

All I can say is that we should not rely our trade trades on others' signals, maybe would be better if we don't have time to trade, but if we have time, it is better that we analyze the market by ourselves.Although they are profitable and professional traders, we do not know what they are thinking",

The absence of negative comments is evidence of that. It is not possible for a service used by ordinary people to obtain 100% positive evaluation without any negative evaluation for every 1000. Rating, Google services don't get that.If the accuracy is 80%, they do not need to make it paid because they are already sure of the chances of achieving a good return on investment and with 80% they will make profits, so they do not need additional money.Don't waste your money.

They are charging from you life time membership cost and some of them are blocked you after the paid to their service. Also some of crypto signals are copy trading. You will be lose 100%. Also some of them are written fake reviews them self. So newcomers are caught to this kind of scams. I never used crypto signals. I have my own strategy. So it is better to build your own strategy.

If it falls, so do the alts (usually much more than BTC). There are hardly any coins here that can break out of the pattern, only KASPA comes to mind here among the better-known coins, which - as yet - does not follow BTC in its price movements.I have tried to follow \"known\" crypto signals via a bot in 2017. The result was that the signals were 50% wrong. So I could have flipped a coin as well. You also have to be very careful with crypto signal providers. The temptation for scams and manipulations is very high, and with unknown coins there is also a high risk of slipping into a pump & dump scheme.",

I have stopped following trading signals since I realized most of the signals are wrong while joining the trading signals group. As long as I have traded following the trading signals, none of the coins have increased in value according to their signals, so I decided that we must rely on ourselves to trade. Since then I have been trying to learn about trading myself without relying on others and trying to trade by understanding the market movement.

Because I have more confidence in my own analysis and abilities. Although actually I can't be said to be an expert in trading on the crypto market. However, I am grateful because I always get profits which can be said to be quite large. In addition, the reason I don't use crypto signals is because I am afraid that my own dependency and abilities will not develop well. Because if I use crypto signals, I only follow the orders of the crypto trading signal platform. So even though at first I found it very difficult, especially in terms of learning (in the crypto field). However, after I went through difficult times when trading crypto by doing it independently. in terms of my abilities and experience, have increased very rapidly.But even so, I don't consider crypto signals a bad platform. Because after all, the crypto signal platform does make it easy for crypto traders to get better results when trading. However, I personally don't take that route and prefer to trade independently and learn on my own.",

Success in crypto exchanging involves not fair precision but also risk management, timing, and understanding market patterns. Undoubtedly, seeing positive surveys can be consoling. Be that as it may, it's fundamental to keep in mind that online surveys might not continuously deliver the complete picture.",
