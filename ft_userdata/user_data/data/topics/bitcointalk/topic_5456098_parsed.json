Are you that ignorant and so naive this is the stupidest answer I've come across here in this forum you are helping scammers to do their thing with your template and of course, you design to make it attractive so people will invest. You will be out of business if people stop investing in HYIPQuoteSo, if you don't know about HYIP and how it works, do not post anything here. I used to be a senior member of the old forum Moneymakergroup and investing in HYIP is one of the platforms I invest in so I know 100% how it works.",
