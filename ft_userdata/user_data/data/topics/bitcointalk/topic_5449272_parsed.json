Does anyone know?Yes it can and I mean Bitmain L1 I don't know about this but Bitmain it is 4900 Mhsh for 3450 watt power consumption,not the most efficient I would say as we have the L7 at 9500 Mhsh and near the same power consumption from Bitmain.They both use the scrypt algorithm as long as I know and this has been heavily the case with such devices,they have always been used to dual mine Litecoin plus Dogecoin,especially after Dogecoin hit that all time high as before very few persons were dual mining,they were all just mining Litecoin which was more profitable at the time.",

      "body": "It's called merged mining, mining 2 or more coins with the same hash. It depends on the pool not the miner. Any LTC miner can merge mine if the pool offers it.Actually any miner of any algorithm can merge mine but Scrypt is the most popular.Dual mining is different, it mines 2 coins of different algorithms with seperate hash. ASICs can't dual mine.",
