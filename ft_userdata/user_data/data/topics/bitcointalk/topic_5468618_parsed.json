Clicking on this button causes a delay in browsing because I get a cloudflare error related to checking whether you are a robot. It seems that the reason is that you are requesting many responses. It is also not easier to search, as you will have to wait and then click C+F5 and the number of pages that are loaded is limited.Open https://ninjastic.space/ and use the search feature using topic ID, which you will get by copying the link to the topic and you will find a unique number in it, which is topic ID. available options at https://ninjastic.space/ are good and faster",

That's if I'm using my PC, and using the view all option makes it easier for me to read through those few pages without even realising how far I have gone by just reading through comments.Â Aside from the above situation, I don't see it necessary to use the view all, as it might turn out to be complicated on my end, especially if there is something that I am looking for in that particular thread. I either check the first few pages and then go straight to the last page.",

I go back and click, this time correctly, on the page I wanted to go to. By the way, out of curiosity I tried for the first time in my life, this time from PC, letting it load and I don't like it. I prefer it separated by pages. Or I don't know if it's that I'm more used to the other option, but I see that the answers so far are along the same lines.

It was probably implemented at the beginning, which was a time when there was still a lot of printing, people still printed emails, still bought the paper newspaper and either didn't have internet on their mobile or hardly used it at all, especially compared to today.",

However, I don't know if the cloudflare thing happens once a day if I used the \"all\" option or within certain hours after using it the first time in a day because there are a few time I've had to use it that it didn't pass me through that verification stress; just like now that I tried it several times within a few minutes.Again, the \"all\" option would mean I'm more likely to miss a particular poster I may want to quote later as I may not remember on what page I read their post if I'm trying to recall.
