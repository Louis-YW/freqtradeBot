And as long as the demand for social media is still there, people will never realize that but will continue to believe that bitcoin could be the key for fast financial stability and security. However, I don’t mean to generalize all newbies are thinking like that, but the fact that most of the newbies these days get aggressive to learn bitcoin so they can invest or trade, that proves that these people are completely convinced that bitcoin is a get rich quick to achieve financial stability.",

The testimony of how Bitcoin has made people move from being poor to becoming wealthy overnight is what most people have conceived in their minds before coming into Bitcoin. The first information you had about something left the person with the decision of what they would believe, so to answer your questions directly, one of the main reasons why some see bitcoin as a means of escaping poverty is because of misinformation. Until they make their own research, some will still live on with that belief.",

      "body": "Due to its profit potential as an investment of course. However, this impression is not advisable. Look at how volatile the market price of Bitcoin; it moves depending on volume and demand which means there's no certainty of its market value whether it would go up or not. Also, how would you define financial stability? For me it is a state where someone has no problem with daily expenses and other bills including needs and wants. Bitcoin is a profitable investment but profit won't be taking place on a daily basis. This misconception is also why many people are in panic whenever a crash is happening. No single investment could give you a financial stability unless you are having millions of worth into it. But if you are a casual investor then this expectation might not be met, unfortunately.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 24, 2024, 11:06:28 AMBitcoin is not a gateway to financial stability.

It could be a hedge though to inflation and preserved our wealth and everyone can jump on the bandwagon, from the elites and wealthy people to average joe like the majority of us here.",

So you see a lot of misformed person's wanting to invest in Bitcoin with the hope of getting back their interest in a short time, because of what they where told, not knowing that it doesn't work like that.

However, considering that Bitcoin has only been around for less than 2 decades and that it is purely digital, it can be argued that its durability is questionable. The other three components make sense to me.As for improving society and decreasing corruption, such claims need more elaboration that can explain how that can happen. Maybe some corruption risks can be reduced due to transparency of BTC transactions, for example, but that can work only if 'the elites' publicly declare their wallet addresses. As for improving society, Bitcoin can be used for charity and other important work, but so can any other kind of money.",
