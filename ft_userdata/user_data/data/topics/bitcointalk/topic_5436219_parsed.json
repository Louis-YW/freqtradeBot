I don't know if the multiplier of that game is the same as the game I mentioned where you spin and if there's a combo then the multiplier increases each combo where the max combo in the game I mentioned is X5 for normal spins and when during free spins (scatter) then the multiplier is up to X10. I luckily got up to X10 many times.",

If your goal is to play for profit and you are hoping for the streamer to get the jackpot then you also need to make sure that your capital is big because you will likely ran out of funds just before the streamer gets it since their funds are much bigger than their viewers.

You should definitely check that out if you like these kind of games.
