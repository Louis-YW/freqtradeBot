  "content": "Bitcoin started as an idea which was first believed in by the Ideologist by the person or group of persons named Satoshi Nakamoto  but today it's not longer an idea but one which has come to stay.Centuries ago (6,000 years or so) the entire world 🌎 bought and sold or traded by barter and there was a problem of rate or measure of exchange of goods to goods or goods to services and vice versa  until an idea of legal tender or money sprouted up by some persons or group of people who introduced legal tender (metal coins money) and there was a shift from trading by barter to trading with legal tender (Metal coins money) see References (https://www.creditkarma.com/money/i/history-of-money#:~:text=The%20barter%20system%20likely%20originated,gave%20way%20to%20modern%20currency.)Today, in this era came another striking idea by Satoshi Nakamoto which gave birth to another paradigm shift in buying and selling or trading wit higher transaction speed,throughput, reliability, on the clock ⌚ functionality (24/7 hours operations) etc as against the traditional banking or other firms handling legal tender (Metal coins money) which a lot of people have tried (tested) and trusted which is the Bitcoin now and the idea and solutions or benefits emanating from it that has stood the test of time.Bitcoin today has achieved a lot in the web3 domain such as  I. Fiat dominance ( No Fiat currency now can equate to      1BTC today)  ii. Making traditional banking system less relevant in swift      transacting both local and international.  iii. Making one's wealth, net worth or capacity balance      unexposed to third party such as account officers in the      banks, spouses, friends, close ones, relatives etc which      enhances high security and protection of the person and      reduces theft, robbery etc   iv. Shopping from a distance (from home or while at home)      with ease.Bitcoin has lots of potentials and yet to be tapped potentials and benefits in the future or coming years which is yet to be seen now and to me it seemed to lie or be embedded in it's halving cycle or life and from my observational point of view the more the halving occurs the more it's potentials and benefits unfolds.Web3 to me, as I look ahead, seem to me to be the entire world or globe 🌎 comprising of the 7 continents revolving on a spot (Bitcoin) and Blockchain is the connector or linker 🔗 in chain-like ⛓️ fashion and multiple dimensions spanning the globe (7 continents) aiding not only multi dimensional transactions but also enhances seemless activities at one's convenient.While Bitcoin is to me like the padlock (key) of which is used to luck or bind together the points where the terminals of the chains at the edge intercepts of which to me is the point that effects lots of changes on the system for now because Bitcoin gapping is tremendous.Please your opinions, thoughts and corrections arewelcomed.",

It is never possible to get an accurate idea of what time the Bitcoin market is.The position in Bitcoin today is not going to be in this position in the future but can move towards more bright possibilities.Bitcoin in 2009 and Bitcoin in 2024 are not the same. In the course of this period, there has been a stark difference in the price of Bitcoin.However, it can be said for sure that Bitcoin will go to a higher position in the future in the position of Bitcoin in 2024.",

Of course, there will always be issues and problems that it had face and will face in the next decade. But I believed it will continue and there are no stopping this revolution.",

Fiat dominance ( No Fiat currency now can equate to      1BTC today)fiat wasn't created to have a value that can't be used for the purchase of simple item. If fiat goes anywhere close to the hight Bitcoin has atained, it will automatically loose it relevance.Quote from: Value.Virtue on July 21, 2024, 10:55:48 PM  ii. Making traditional banking system less relevant in swift      transacting both local and international. Bitcoin is decentralized and isn't in any form of competition with the traditional banking system. Regardless of the level of Bitcoin adoption in the global space, the traditional banking system will still be in use unless an alternative system comes into existence but even at that, the system has to be totally regulated by the government. What makes the financial sector balanced is a combination of both Bitcoin that's a representation of the decentralized system and the fiat that stands very useful in the centralized system. You can't assume that one is better than another.Quote from: Value.Virtue on July 21, 2024, 10:55:48 PM  iii. Making one's wealth, net worth or capacity balance      unexposed to third party such as account officers in the      banks, spouses, friends, close ones, relatives etc which      enhances high security and protection of the person and      reduces theft, robbery etcI agree totally with you on this. I personally fancy the fact that I can be very wealthy and yet no one has the knowledge about it and I can just live a low profile life if that's what I want which is what the centralized banking system can't offer.Quote from: Value.Virtue on July 21, 2024, 10:55:48 PM   iv. Shopping from a distance (from home or while at home)      with ease.the banking system can also do this but the difference and the uniqueness that makes the use of Bitcoin a more preferable option is that you can carry out international transaction at ease without converting from one currency to another.we have to learn how to create a balance in our concept of the advantage of Bitcoin over any other asset in the financial space. I believe that Bitcoin is the best digital asset but that's never a reason to discredit the fiat or to assume it's of zero relevance at all. In a smaller scaled transaction, the fiat is very relevant but when we talk about the broader picture and we're looking at doing international transaction or we are looking at a digital assets that is worth holding for the long term, that's where Bitcoin will always remain the best today, tomorrow and in the future.",

I concur with your thoughts and ideas that Bitcoin might still hold many mysteries yet to be unfold and changed the way we conduct transactions and see value (money) in this digital era and the possibility of any occurrence regarding it's volatile nature, one who loves honey and goes to harvest it from the bunch of honey Bee 🐝 should also think about it's sting or should know that it stings (crypto be volatile) that is to say, who wants to invest into Bitcoin or crypto should also consider it's volatile nature and take responsibility.",
