  "content": "Moody’s Cuts China Credit Outlook to Negative on Rising Debthttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-05/moody-s-cuts-china-credit-outlook-to-negative-on-rising-debt?embedded-checkout=trueStatement from Moody:https://ratings.moodys.com/ratings-news/412128QuoteIn light of China's government's consistently stated policy objective, over the medium term, Moody's expects its property sector to remain smaller in proportion to the entire economy than it was before the property correction that started in 2021. As a result, RLGs face a structural loss of land sales revenue, which accounted for 37% of their revenue (excluding transfers from the central government) in 2022. Regions that relied most heavily on land sales are unable to materially offset the loss in revenue from other sources and will face financial strain for the foreseeable future, in Moody's view. Loss of land sales revenue reduces the ability of RLGs to support LGFVs and other local SOEs, including some entities highly reliant on RLG funding. Moody's expects further evidence of crystallization of contingent liabilities to materialize, which means that financial support to RLGs and SOEs will be provided by the government and wider public sector.Instances of LGFV and local SOE financing stress have increased in the past year, and in Moody's view, market financing will remain challenging for entities from provinces such as Yunnan and Guizhou, where domestic bond market spreads remain very wide. More generally, if RLG support is durably impaired, debt sustainability will be at risk for LGFVs and local SOEs with particularly high leverage and/or low revenue coverage of interest payments.Moody's estimates that around one third of the amount of SOE debt outstanding – equal to about 40% of GDP – has interest coverage below 1, which generally indicates weak debt sustainability. These developments include the central government's approval for RLG bond issuances of over RMB1.3 trillion between 1 October and 7 November 2023 for repayment of upcoming LGFV bond maturities for the weakest provinces; the central government's announcement of a planned RMB1.0 trillion special treasury bond issuance to fund RLG post disaster construction; and a RMB1.6 trillion increase in central government transfers to RLGs in 2022 compared to 2021, which partly but only temporarily offset the RMB2.0 trillion of lost land sales revenue.TLDRThe real estate is so much in debt and local government rely so much on sales of land for those that is a vicious circle in which money has to be put in to keep a thing that just redistributes money around with a lot of inefficiency.So the government has to bail out local governments and real estate constructors so they don't go bankrupt and end up bankrupting the govemermnt itself, that's why the public debt of China is somewhere between 250% and 300% depending on what statistics China itself publishes, but the money that kept funding this debt is not in danger as the real estate market cools so suddenly a ton of it becomes impossible to pay back.Speaking of the BTC implications, this should make in theory a few chinese go from real estate investment to either gold or bitcoin but...there is a problem with the second one! ;)So don't get your hopes up on anything significant moving into BTC, unfortunately.",

The logic is simple, why did they think that they are the only people who are using their money or credit on something like this? Did they think UK, France, Germany and most important USA was \"incapable\" of doing this? It was obvious from the start that it would hurt the people, because others are not doing it, so there must have been a reason for not doing it there, they should have looked why those nations are not doing it. Saudis are now doing it, but they are smart, first they get the money to do it, and then do not use too much debt, and not like they care about their people all that much, so they are building stuff with what they have, not debt for the future.",

The real estate market is drowning in debt, and it's hooked on land sales that just can't last forever. This unsustainable model is a ticking time bomb for China's economy, and it could explode with consequences that ripple across the entire world.But there's a tiny glimmer of hope in this darkness. The government has faced tough situations before, and maybe they can pull it off again. If they can figure out how to diversify local governments' income and wean them off land sales, they might just avert disaster.",

As there was a global recession, it affected them only in the background, but they were still growing at almost double-digit GDP during the crisis years. They may need to suffer one to moderate real estate growth.Quote from: Haunebu on December 10, 2023, 06:31:35 PMCan't believe that their dumbass government is actually thinking of invading Taiwan in between all of this.Politicians often use things like that to cover up other problems.",

The CCCP take the wrong approach though, as they are constantly trying to prop it up and defy a natural boom/bust cycle. A lot of excess can build up in boom years, which is often only trimmed back by a period of bust. The complexity of the \"communist\" market system will also make things harder to unravel because nobody likes reporting failure all throughout the chain. This can hide a lot of problems and make the eventual outcome much worse than necessary.",

But no matter how much money comes back, one thing is for sure, they all cost money, and China has been building all this on their own population debt, now, somebody is going to pay, and unfortunately for them, they can't print dollars.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on December 11, 2023, 09:34:01 AMI have a feeling the average Chinese person is going to flock to gold rather than bitcoin if they have a choice.  I'm still not clear on how legal or even popular bitcoin is in China, but I'd imagine the government has the same opinion about it as the US government does, i.e, that it's a threat to their power over their citizens.  Why gold ownership doesn't represent the same threat is beyond me, but whatever.If we compare the steps the US has taken against bitcoin compared to China, well, there is no comparison. China is terrorized about capital flight, there is no way at any point in the future if the commies are still in power you're going to have the same freedom on purchasing Bitcoins as you do in the US.As for Gold, it's pretty simple, when was the last time you were able to pay somebody or someone with gold?Smuggle wealth out of the country?[url-https://www.ladbible.com/news/man-found-with-2lbs-of-gold-up-his-bum-after-acting-suspiciously-20220423]Man Found With 2lbs Of Gold Up His Bum After 'Acting Suspiciously' At Airport[/url]I find this a bit hard...and long...and painful to do compared to Bitcoin.",

Criptocurrency investments are not really encouraged in China. So chances are that, gold will be preferred by the Chinese people. Honestly, when it comes to capital protection, Bitcoin is a bad choice. Also I really do not want a whole lot of Chinese population to get into Bitcoin. With lot of Chinese people comes lot of Chinese hackers and a lot of Chinese exchanges. Not good for the ecosystem.",
