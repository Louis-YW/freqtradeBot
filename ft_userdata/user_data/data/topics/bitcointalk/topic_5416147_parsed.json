We hope you enjoy your stay here and promote your site well as other casinos.I like the site's design, and the background color, white and blue, gives a new experience seeing the new casino have that color. I see that you plan to add software for iPhone and Android, while I also see an app installation to integrate with the browser. Perhaps, by giving an app to the gamblers, it will ease playing gambling on your site without visiting the site and accessing their dashboard.",

What's the reason you have such rule when your casino didn't even have gambling license? The reason why casinos have mandatory KYC rule is due to license, while casinos without license are have option to not have mandatory KYC rule.However I see you have a lot providers and games that I've not played before, I might interested to create a new account on your casino if there's a good promotion.",

Most other casinos may have a limit on how much to withdraw in daily basis or per 24 hours, but max winning is just non senses for me. The terms can be reasonable if players win the amount in an in-house game but it is not reasonable if the players win it in 3rd party games. I wonder how if someone win lets say €50,000 on 3rd party game? Where the other €25,000 go while basically it should be for player, will the casino take the other €25,000 and give the €25,000 for players or players will get the other €25,000 in the next day?",
