He also said that many posts have been deleted, suddenly merit distribution has been started.Let's begin.I registered in this forum in 4/25/2013 . I was regularly active in this forum till 2018. After that suddenly due to family and personal problems I could not active in the forum like before.Then after becoming active once in 1/3/2021, I thought I will be active regularly from now on, so I changed the password once. My luck was bad then, again I had to fight for my family. Then I thought that after becoming active, I will start from zero. Moreover, many of my posts were of poor quality. So I deleted almost all my posts.Also, a forum member can delete his own post, this is not an anti-forum act. So anyone can do this.I forgot the password so i 6/17/2023 date reset the password through email. Then I use new email and strong password to strengthen security.I don't see anything wrong in doing this for the security of my account. Hope you understand.And Starting a word game for all forum members especially new members to gain knowledge and share good things about the forum, it ended on 3rd July. I think merit doesn't matter, they all can learn a lot from it. hugeblack mate , please respond.",

He also said that many posts have been deleted, suddenly merit distribution has been started.Whatever reason you state, the activity you are carrying out is suspicious, be it the merits you are distributing, deleting your own posts, your activities and so on, but @hugeblack's suspicion, against you is a natural thing, considering the activity you are doing, the account was bought or hacked.Maybe you should convince @hugeblack, in this case, whatever he asks or reasonable proof, that's the best way. However, I noticed elsewhere that there is something strange about the Merit you are giving these two users.1. Rbolisna2. Honey$11I saw both of their transactions, whether it's your Alt or something else, my assumption is for the OP, you have a low ranked Alt, by buying a high rated account and have quite a lot of sMerit reserves, you easily distribute to your lower ranked Alts to go to the next level.Example: the evidence that I got and I saw, against the two accounts below.Proof:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x466979990fc4c451c51f484a8622293a44a56f7fcc667688627d0ac6748e4219Quote from: Rbolisna on January 22, 2023, 10:51:47 AMForum Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3515042 BSC Wallet Address: 0xdc8dEb9286dA8faaE67f8C9469cB930685AdCB3d[ Archive ]Quote from: Madu$11 on June 27, 2023, 11:32:10 PMForum Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3462377 BSC Wallet Address: 0x31cD13A31E9bbb21cC9F1244bBD532D91Edd24d7[ Archive ]Proof:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;u=3515042https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;u=3462377The two addresses above are related to the two accounts above, I'm sure if you don't delete your post, maybe more evidence can be found, who are you, the real or fake owner.But if I dive deeper into the investigation, I can find the accounts you distribute Merit ranked Jr. members, connected to each other.",

They are definitely what has transpired between you and the account, i expect you to make this thread assuming none of these were found to be true, so why are you so nervous about having a feedback which you deserve base on what has happened, it's what was done on your account but you don't want to accept that fact.Quote from: deadsea33 on July 08, 2023, 03:30:22 PMThen after becoming active once in 1/3/2021, I thought I will be active regularly from now on, so I changed the password once.

It will vanish the doubt and I think no one will then think of leaving you any feedback.[...]That'll probably be a bit problematic, I can't find OP posted any address in the past other than the one he made this week enrolling on several campaigns and seems completely new.The merit history, though, provided something that's quite interesting and worth scrutinizing, thanks lovesmayfamilis for that. For example, though Ninjastic and Loyce's archiever didn't perfectly cover that far in the past, so I have to take a ballpark, this merit is likely belongs to this post in the cluster, While these two belongs to a well archived one, Quote from: https://ninjastic.space/post/52658129I just wanted to say goodbye to this community.I have no more any kind of personal participation in ixcoin.Or maybe I was wrong, after all, I am not that talented on digging evidences from the past, there are far better members on this field. But, I don't think it mattered much. One thing that caught my eyes is that OP said this,Quote from: deadsea33 on July 08, 2023, 03:30:22 PM[...]I registered in this forum in 4/25/2013 .

I thought you're too busy for family and personal problem, OP? And how exactly being a treasurer for a project can be considered as a poor quality that you deleted all of the post related to ixcoin? Can you please explain these?",
