  "content": "It appears another judge has done uncle Gary's job for him again hehehe. On a case against Uniswap, another judge of Southern District of New York has ruled that Ethereum is a commodity and refused to use the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged, according to the article.This is a victory for the cryptospace and another good legal precedent. Also, this judge will also be hearing the case of SEC vs. Coinbase.A New York court classified popular cryptocurrencies ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) as \"commodities\" while dismissing a proposed class action lawsuit against leading decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap in a Wednesday filing.The court's opinion on its dismissal of the class action suit could influence future litigation against decentralized protocols and perhaps even those alleging violation of U.S. securities laws.Judge Polk Failla also oversees the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase.Source https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/31/us-court-calls-eth-a-commodity-while-tossing-investor-suit-against-uniswap/",

      "body": "It was indeed a landmark judgment that gave birth to two important precedents. The first precedent is that decentralized platforms like Uniswap will not be held accountable for tokens issued and traded on their protocol. Rather the issuers of such scam tokens should be traced and held responsible for the scam token that made investors lose money. Secondly classifying Ethereum as a commodity removes its regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and puts the coin under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) just like Bitcoin.",

The infinite supply of Ethereum might be a challenge in categorizing it as a commodity. However, the issue of grouping cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities is a complicated one that goes beyond the limited or unlimited supply. It has always been a subject of litigation over these years. This is because other characteristics of commodities such as uniformity and fungibility are also considered. Just like how agencies and intentional organization regulates the supply of some commodities it is also possible that the Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will place restrictions on the supply of Ethereum. I am not an advocate of Ethereum and don't even own a wei and I believe that Bitcoin is a perfect example of a commodity because it has all the characteristics.",

If it is according to your opinion, okay, they are securities. However, there are 2 judges that have already have made 2 favorable rulings saying that they are not securities. Also, bonds and ETH might not be like comparing apples and oranges. ETH is also used for gas fees to use the Ethereum network very much like a commodity being used to run different industries.However, I do not disagree that these are man made and some of these projects might be a scam but under an environment with unclear and undefined crypto regulations because the SEC refuses to make them clear, the judges are doing uncle Gary's job for him.

Thus, guidelines for crypto projects already exist based on judicial practice. You can't sell tokens. Typically, projects sell a stake in the company to qualified investors.But this complicates the market and does not give the ordinary user the opportunity to participate at the beginning, as was the case in 2017 at the ICO.",

My only problem is that many nations are under the influence of the US. These nations sheepishly follow the US monetary policies without due consideration.
