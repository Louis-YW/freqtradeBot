We're talking about the season is here and we're done with the bull run and the bear market is in. Of all of those, we've got the best so far but if we'll relate it to every bull and bear run. It's likely that the best bull run is going to replace and will be better than this one. And as you ask about the altcoin season, what do we usually see before it? A bitcoin push and pump, so should you be seeing the sign, make sure that you still got bitcoin with you.",

If you are buying right now expect to play long because the market is still volatile and maybe, the next bull will happen in the next halving, nothing is sure here though. Alt season will always follow Bitcoin so if the price of BTC is still down, we canâ€™t expect for the price of altcoins to rise, they are following the same trend.",

Even the next halving canâ€™t guarantee bull run but we are hoping for this, I see this as the only reason for another bull run. Maybe, if the economy of big countries starts to recover, Bitcoin might follow that and thatâ€™s a good one for us. Be patient for now and hold only good coins.",

When will it be?Please share your thoughts on this ðŸ™‚ No one can know when the next bull season will be, but it will undoubtedly come some day after months or years from now, but the most important question is what currencies do you hold and wait for them to explode when the bull season comes? Undoubtedly, if you have promising coins that have use cases and have a huge market value, and are listed on thousands of exchanges, then these coins will give you a lot of money, no matter when, but the most important thing is to wait patiently and not to sell at a loss for whatever reason.",

If it is not mistaken, Bitcoin halving will be 2024, won't it? So, it is impossible for Bitcoin to pump again after that at least until 2025? And the altcoin season will be following? But, this is only a prediction, because sometimes, market is very unpredictable and surprising. Sometimes, market doesn't follow the previous cycle of bull and bear run. Just wait for it and we can do it while preparing to buy only top coins that have probabilities to rise up. Mostly, time to add more Bitcoin.",

Once the bitcoin turns bullish we can expect the market of altcoins to pump. In the past it has happened in similar way. Once after the price of bitcoin experience big growth, at some point the price movements won't be big. By the time altcoins keep rising and even that can't be easily understood that the altcoins season have begun.",
