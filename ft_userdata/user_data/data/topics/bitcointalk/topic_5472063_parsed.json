Comparing future price predictions to current sales prices isn't truly a valid correlation.Â  Otherwise the guy who bought pizza for 10K Bitcoins would have probably already gone insane.Â  Instead, he said he was happy that it helped the network.That would be like going back through past transactional history on the forum and being like \"dang you paid 1 BTC for that in 2013! What!\"",
