This patented technology ensures that private keys are generated and stored in the hardware while enabling backups through device pairing. That way, the seed doesn’t have to be translated into recovery phrases or be exposed to human error, phishing, or theft. Hugware is the safest and simplest hardware wallet every crypto novice needs while providing a solid recovery plan for your investments\". They also tout their NFTs/their token/DeFi and that they can also store your photos and files on the wallet. It all makes zero sense.   I read their TOS, completely shows that they are super shady.  They set up the TOS so they can't be liable for absolutely anything.  Where are they based out of, you guessed it...Singapore, crypto scam haven. I would love for you Mr Robots to break down some of this supposed tech they claim to have, like their Hugware deal.https://www.ukiss.io/",

They are basically transfering the seed to another device, they call it A-Key.QuoteHugware comes in a pair. During setup, the master seed is generated in the Authentication Key (A-Key) and synchronised with the Rescue Key (R-Key). Use the A-Key to manage your crypto assets and keep your R-Key for when you need to recover access in the future. Our state-of-the-art key pairing feature lets users do away with recovery phrases, thereby minimising instances of human error, phishing, and theft. However, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your Hugware. Store your devices in a safe location and guard your authentication with a strong PIN.https://www.ukiss.io/userguide/I think it is interesting to see people creating different things and another kind of back ups.However, I really fell much safer using the traditional seed in a piece of paper and restoring it anywhere. I would have to study this HW a lot before usage, until I understand what would happen if my both devices break for example.",

Will probably just lock this now.",
