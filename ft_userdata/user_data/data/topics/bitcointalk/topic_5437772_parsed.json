      "body": "Bitcoin or cryptocurrency value is determined by human need, in case all institutions, and retail investors stay away from it, which means we don't need it anymore, then it will surely die, let alone not increase in price. But this is unlikely because everyone is aware that bitcoin is a precious asset, and its value will continue to increase sharply in the future. So if someone sells all of their bitcoins, there will always be someone willing to buy them all back.",

Most of the prices are set by the market (retail) and institutions buy around that price in private dealings - if there's less institutions to buy, there might be more demand from the sell side on the markets which could temporarily stunt growth but then the same lack of selling will happen as people expect the prices to go higher anyway/later.",

But the situation will be the same as a bear market in my opinion, and it will only take time for bitcoin to climb again.If we look, from time to time more and more people are interested in bitcoin, so if bitcoin loses the big investors from the institutions that the OP said, then I really believe that bitcoin will find other big investors again.",

The only reason this woluld happen, would be regulations that make it either unprofitable or illegal. However, due to the many different zones of legislations in the world this will not happen mutually all around the globe.If there is a monetary incentive to do so, institutional investors, including governments, will continue to invest in crypto and especially Bitcoin. That's just a given in open markets.",

Those institutional investors are also heavy speculators, so they must have thought the impact of their departure from crypto market would be even deeper, but thankfully it wasn't and long term investors were able to hold the price considerably. Good news is that each new cycle the influence of institutional investors is decreasing more yet.At some point their influence must be tied with the dominance of every other average investors united focused on long term goals, what could balance volatility to more stable levels.",

Well you need to go back in charts where there wasn't institutional investors. That's what would happen, although back then many individuals were buying because everyone knew institutional investors were coming in any time. I feel like many of them enjoyed dumping at institutions later on. There are of course ton of more individuals now but i can't see prices being anywhere near here without real players. And then there's the reason WHY would they leave. Because that reason would most likely be more catastrophic then result of them leaving.",

There is indeed a decline in the number of traditional investors, including institutional investors. In fact, this was not noticed in the first place because there is a demand for bitcoin from everyone, not only from the investing institutions, and if someone gave up his investment in bitcoin, he will certainly sell it to someone who needs it.https://www.coindesk.com/powered-by-consensus/ftx-collapse-crypto-investors-retreat/There are great concerns about the continuation of the crisis caused by the collapse of both the Luna network and the Ftx platform. Some of these concerns were expressed by one of the analysts of the MtGox platform, assuming that the price of Bitcoin will drop to $13,000 by the summer.https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-expects-crypto-market-to-face-weeks-of-deleveraging-warns-bitcoin-price-could-drop-to-13k/The mere fact that such statements are issued is capable of influencing the course of investment institutions, especially since MtGox is also an investment institution.",

If the institutional investors decides to opt out of the cryptocurrency market, it’ll definitely affect the price of the cryptocurrencies as they play a big role in price change in the market. Sooner or later, the price will rise back but not at the expense of the so called investors again but the big players who would be the big exchanges. The government can only have an effect in the price change if the use of cryptocurrency is been regularized by them, but without that, exchanges become the main focus to affect the price change of the cryptocurrencies prices henceforth. This has never happen in a world full of transitional process and new inventions, bitcoin potential amongst other cryptocurrencies is very clear, I don’t see the institutional investors leaving it for anything now again.",

No it can't go anywhere if institutional investors will back off and the one who remains are the small fish. Bitcoin move base on demand so if there's less demand for it so maybe we cannot move faster as we can see it happening these days.But this scenario like institutional investor leaving will not happen because you know people where they can benefit they are in and bitcoin gain more and more huge popularity so for sure they will stick with it then it can also gather more other investor since hype is on bitcoin side especially it gather more attention coming from the media.",

It would be very possible for cryptocurrencies to develop slowly and even stagnate without significant price growth if institutional investors stay away from the crypto space and stop investing in crypto. A very simple example for this is when there are many people who used to use a product for certain needs in their lives, then the price of the product will obviously experience an increase in price and better development.But when a product starts to be abandoned by many of its users at a certain time, the development of the product and its price will not experience any more significant changes and even the product will no longer be produced because the demand for it has begun to decrease. Likewise with crypto when users such as investors start to distance themselves from crypto investments, there will not be many cryptos that get better development. So in my opinion, I hope you are enlightened.",

It won't happen, institutional investor wants to make money always. If the existing ones decide to move to some other markets there will be definitely new ones which will decide to trade this market. So this will be a never ending circle. Big or smart money will always be there in every market and will be a major reason for market cycles. And even if it decides to part ways I think the next big guns will realise the vaccum and decide to make cartels of their own to manipulate market. So this smart money will always stay.",
