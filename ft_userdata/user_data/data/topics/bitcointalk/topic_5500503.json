  "content": "On January 3rd 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto created the Bitcoin network as a form of cryptocurrency. It was the first time in the history of money that someone was introduced a form of money that is absolutely intangible, does not exist in a any physical form; which means that it was introduced as a form of money can be used as a means of exchange yet can not be touched or physically felt.More importantly, Bitcoin was introduced as a form of money that is completely decentralized. Bitcoin network was introduced as a system of money that totally forbids any form of control by governmental or private institutions including the brain or brains behind it's existence. Bitcoin was created to run on a digital ledger called the  blockchain technology. This system of money was completely new to human existence when it was first introduced as there's never been a similar system of money that was ever adopted as a means of exchange and that was why many people who got the knowledge of Bitcoin at it's early stage of existence never believed that it was going to be a successful project. It was because of the numerous uncertainties surrounding the possibility of the digital coin to succeed that made many people who got the first hand information about Bitcoin to  neglect it even when it would've cost them very little or no money to own hundreds and thousands of bitcoins then. Despite the doubt by majority of the people who were introduced to Bitcoin as it's earliest stage about the possibility of the coin to achieve the projected purposes it was created for, Bitcoin went on to defile all odds and successfully become first cryptocurrency project that was approved as a means of exchange and store of value in global market.Today, Bitcoin is currently used as a means of exchange many countries and provinces of the world and just 15 years after Bitcoin was launched, a piece of Bitcoin is currently a little above 65,000 US dollars. The people who never believed that it'll become a successful project hence failed to invest in it when it was first introduced are now living a life of deep regret. Bitcoin today is considered as the future global currency because of it's ability to solve global financial problems like allowing people from different parts of the world to transmit money at will, anywhere in the world and at any given time. Bitcoin is no longer solving the financial problems of 50-80 million people in one particular country instead, it's now solving the problems of more than 7 billion people and that's why Bitcoin network will continue to expand across the globe until it finally becomes a legal system of money in all parts of the world.Considering the rate at which Bitcoin is spreading across the globe, it might be globally accepted as a means of exchange in all parts of the world in 10 years to come.",

Yes, there could be increasing number of financial institutions that already recognized about bitcoin, but still majority of the world governments have still not accepted bitcoin as a currency, although the legalization of bitcoin has successfully done. As long as bitcoin remains decentralized, I don’t think this will come to possibility. Knowing the government won’t certainly adapt if they can’t totally control it in return, that’s how greedy the government is, or shall I say the officials sitting in their respective positions.",

You wont really be needing up to be that techy or having those complicated words on trying out to explain something into someonespecially about Bitcoin or crypto as a whole. If you wouldnt really be still having that kind of knowledge and experience then it would really be that understandable that you would really be that hindering yourself on making up those kind of explanations on which you would really be that afraid that they might scold or tend to point out fingers if ever you would really be making out some explanation about it but just like on what i have said  that keywords or even just that an introduction would really be just that enough because we know that googling information nowadays would really be just that simple as 1,2,3.If you would really be tending to share it up then it would really be just that depending on you. Just make it sure that you should really be telling about the most precise information at leasteven if the basic but at least you have told them about on what you do know. Also, dont tend to forgot when it comes to the risks involved since this is where someone would really be mainly having problems when other people are really that expecting too much out of it.",

Bitcoin as a new kind of investment rather than a new kind of money is what is the new trend  due to the fact that fluctuation in transaction fees hurts those who use it as a payment method while from little to no problem if we treat Bitcoin as an investment since we are not that frequent to do transactions especially if we are a long term hodler.",
