  "content": "Part 1 ExplainationTRX is making a good movement in a bearish environment and I will not be surprised if Tron will hit 15 to 18 cents in the coming days there are many reasons for that explained below. I am not sure about ATH but i am quite sure about the heavy rally in the TRX in the coming weeks if the market Crashes more TRX will Resist its value because of BTC. Why its TRX Time:It is TRX because TRX is making heavy developments one of the major is the recent algorithmic stable coin named USDD. Directly impact the TRX price if TRX uses the same Model as LUNA made with UST example is here LUNA started from $10 to $119 within a short time. The USDD is more impressive as compared to the UST of LUNA.HOW USDD is more Impressive:  USDD is more impressive and its impact will be more Quick because Terra Luna made 1-year efforts to collect the UST Market cap of $18B and setting up reserves and the results are here, But according to the Tron Reserve DAO Justin SUN organizing the $10B initial Reserves for USDD look up the venture capitalists @AlamedaResearch @ambergroup_io @Polonniex Fund Raising Partners. Just imagine the Big Community of these VEntures when Demand the USDD where TRX will go (IF TRX burned on back of USDD demand increase).Other Reasons for Demand of USDD:Anchor Protocol was introduced to attract the investment in the UST with a high yield offer of 19% in stable coin on the side similar to what Tron's protocol will offer the 30% of Yield. This may lead to the transfer of the capital from UST to USDD.  TRX has also initialized the burning system of the TRX and if it keeps up due to Supply to demand ratio Long Term Positive effect can be calculated as already explained above.Source News: https://twitter.com/trondao/status/1522458725625204736 Part 2 Newcomers to TRXIntroduction to TRX Chain:Tron is one of the finest projects with one of few fastest transaction processors cheap, reliable, and particularly targeted for the gaming industry. TRX is based on the Prof of Stake principles. TRX chain was introduced to fix the issues with the ETH network as transaction costs and time. Developed by the Tron Foundation LTD released in the year 2018.The analysis is based on the current developments in Tron Chain. This analysis is for the Educational Purpose and Not a Financial Advice because if the market crashes may be Tron will not perform as we are expecting so be careful.   OLD is GOLDDYOR",

Tron entering the meta could also take it to 1$, but as far i am concern with this token, it has high competition and it has to struggle more to get into pieceAnd plz try to write more but in less words thanks",

I think its a bit late but its worth it its trend for the algorithmic coins. In my Point of view that will be interesting to see how it performs in the panic situation.",

Market will be now more Decentralized in terms lf Stable assets as Now more Holding Choices available.",

This is just another stanle coin that backed huge investors so how come TRX holders will directly benefits on it in the long run? Tron investors is just using it for hyping there token and nothing more. I expect that TRX will dump soon once no one already buying the hype of this new stablecoin.

I still use TRX and I am getting some from staking on more places...But some people don't like TRX generally, they don't think it's decentralized as they claim they are! There are other things as well, but I didn't find it important to remember all! I like it and I use it, I would like to see it higher and that would be great for me!
