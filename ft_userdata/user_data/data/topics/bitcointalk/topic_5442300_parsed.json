And besides there's a format to reporting scam site or scam exchange in your own case. Check out this thread for the format Scam Report Format (Use it to make scam reports properly)",

Its most likely an arbitrage scam in which they want you to think that you can get more money for your crypto. Another big red flag is that they are not listed on Coingecko or CMC. Being listed there doesn't of course mean that exchange is legit, but not being listed there is a sure sign that something is wrong with the exchange.",
