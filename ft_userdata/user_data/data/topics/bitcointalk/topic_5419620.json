  "content": "I have solution for traders.The problem: as much we want but it's allmost impossibleto monitore markets 24/7 but the trading fundamentals of trading requires to watch Market literally 24/7 the trader need to wait opportunity and when there is something going on the trader can start trading and entry in position.Statics show's to us that even the most experinced traders can't get always the best entry points becouse when market starting to move suddenly it might be too late to act and good trading opportunity will be missed.What is my solution:I can do the market monitoring for you and watch market 24/7 for you off course with help of other people so i cant stay up 24/7 to watch i need off course the other people aswell to help me on this. What are the indicators i follow:Basic TA analysis, crypto news, Telegram channels chats the trading ideas volume watching and off course financial instutions activity and crypto whales such us whale alerts and any spefic request from the traders becouse some traders trade by some signals and some traders not use the same sources of info so we can arrange the watching list for everyone invidually according their needs.How the traders who join with this get notified when there is some opportunity:The thing is that traders should get notification even on their phone and even phone calls from our team.Off course each trader will give instructions how and when he or she can be contacted and alerted about good trading opportunity and it will be individual options becouse some people have some spefic trading ways so all alerts will be custom made.Why my idea can be better then all others?First we don't use bots to watch markets we Will have real people who's doing the market watching off course i will teach them what indicators to check.I do belive that human analysis about market are better then bot's doing this becouse the market works very basic ways we just have to wait when btc or alt coins are at buying zone or selling zone.And finally the traders can feel more confidence If they know there is people who watch 24/7 markets for them everyday and they will get notification when there is good trading opportunity it will save a lot their time.This project will look like hedge fund or some kind of wall street instution idea but we all have to start from somewhere",

      "body": "Not going to let others trade for me or watch the market manually; it's going to be complicated. Humans will have errors compared to bots that will do what you assign them to do, and I think it's going to be different from watching the market 24/7 like a bot human. It's better to get a bot, like Gunbot, instead of having people to rely upon that could make mistakes. Bots can easily be told what indicators you are going to use. Indicating the buying and selling zone is possible with a couple of indicators, which could be coded. I'm just stating my opinion on this. Letting humans watch 24/7 would be hard, for sure.",

Have your own website for that matter and have vouches for you. I only hear the word broker in real estate and other financial markets but I never heard that here in crypto. I think that's because cryptos are much easier to obtain or handle and there is no real need for a broker on here. If we are not confident with our ability then we can subscribe on trading signals and we can also do copy trading. They could require us to pay for some fees but most of our funds are still in our possession.Another advantage of using a crypto is that they are more anonymous. Those traders who like to conceal their privacy will prefer to trade crypto over the other but that is if they will also use decentralized exchanges.",
