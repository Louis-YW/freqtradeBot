I think the NFT price would be skyrocket since there's a lot Cristiano Ronaldo fans out there, however it's just a hype and then it's will become worthless.",

It is possible that we are seeing the cooling of NFT in the past few months, and this may be a way for Binance to prepare for a new monetization scheme from users and investors. However, this is great news because it shows the cooperation between the parties. This is one of my favorite rock stars.",

All NFT collections will be available exclusively on Binance's NFT store.It's interesting to note that Ronaldo is the most followed person on Instagram, having 459 million followers. He has more followers than the population of the entire United States. So I guess that's somewhat good for crypto adoption, at least people will have to learn something.It is ironic that Binance CEO Changpeng posted a week ago that the company had passed on expensive sponsorships allowing them to keep on hiring more employees during the crypto bear market. This is almost like him contradicting himself.",

But honestly, I'm still looking forward to other positive signals surrounding the NFT trend, not to popularize it but to show people what it will bring, after all the hype is over. Everyone sees a lot of junk products, but the market giants have yet to prove different with what they offer.",

I know that if binance must have paid him a lot but that's worth with how many followers on his instagram. he can be considered as a guy with so many followers after instagram itself. Multi year partnership will give so many impact to the binance. Im sure that this will be boosting binance. This time binance has multi millions users around the world and i think that will increase drastically. Remember that this partnership is also about NFT",

I know CR7 and I’m a fan of him but I will definitely don't  buy an NFT right now since the marketis very bad. No one will buy a useless NFT right now unless you are a collector only.

Let's see how effective this effort by binance but im sure that if this is related with the NFT. binance is trying to take NFT into the next level of adoptions. It seems like so many NFT related projects were facing a small surge caused by this news, I hope that another big news will come from the development and adoption for NFT as well. I hope that massive adoption for NFT will happen very soon.",

But, that doesn't change the fact that I would not be doing this just for the money, probably never for the money.After all of that first initial hype is gone, and the \"it's ronaldo nft!!\" people already bought it, then we are going to have a calm period where it will probably not worth as much as it did initially. Plus if they did this like a year ago for example, it would have collected at least twice as much as they could now, still a lot of money today, but not nearly as much as it could have been.Ronaldo is a guy that sold like 100+ million dollars in jersey sales last year alone, if you could get his jerseys sold that much, then I am sure that his NFT would probably get sold a lot as well. This is why it is going to be fine for now, but not a great idea in the long run.",

If Binance can afford that kind of money paying a renowned figure who doesn't have anything to do with crypto, shill NFTs which also didn't really popular among crypto community. Then they're really desperate and want the money from people who know nothing about NTF at all. This is a recipe for disasters in the future.",

Surely they know the NFT hype is running out of steam fast due to the bad press it keeps getting, plus, the recent crypto crash doesn't help either. But, still, even if the NFT thing doesn't go as planned, it's not a bad investment to have one of the most popular football players to shill for your product. If Binance can get at least 2% of Ronaldo's IG followers to open a binance acc, 9mill users, and at least retain 10% of those new users, that would be a massive success for Binance.",
