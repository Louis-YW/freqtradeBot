Their regulations and laws are not even been finalized yet, so it is difficult to bring that into the education system. The current education system are based on old school Fiat guidelines and they are not going to accept change, because those old farts are in control of those systems.

Each aspect is either too specialized or doesn't need a course in academia. For example the technical aspects (cryptography, network, database, etc.) are special topics and are already general meaning they can only be taught to programmers and some of them already are. The other aspects are general too like the economical aspect of bitcoin as a currency or altcoins are risky useless version of penny stocks.",

Also it's a very new technology and it is still going through that innovation phase where everything is very dynamic. The entire cryptocurrency market is not very structured yet. So trying to put in into a formal mode of education, may pass wrong information to the future generations. However, it can be added for the higher studies as an optional subject where the students have attained some financial maturity.",

'coz I would agree more if it will be discussed on invetment and economy related subjects as a sub-topic but nothing much. This technology is still undergoing growth procedures and developments, so I guess things would be 'wasted' a bit when its 'final phase' has been reached, right? And even if it has reached its peak, I still don't understant its relevance to academe or as a profession. Indeed, it is profitable and it has many advantages over FIAT but the mere fact inconsistency occurs and is present in this technology, we would be exposing people to risks.Yes it could be learned, that's why it is being pushed to the academic systems but if you're aware of 'Monte Carlo Fallacy', 'innate frustrations of an individual', 'drive for revenge' and such, for sure many people would get this point.",
