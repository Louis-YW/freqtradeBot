The team was let its smartcontract to print bunch of luna while this time they can halt it to mint the new token. that means if luna developers has become the party that must be blame as well. That's why investors are very angry caused by this. So many of them have been putting their life, house, car and many more. Just wanna see how this drama will be going on. Im sure that this another disaster in the crypto history",

They got Terra Luna's security loophole, but why didn't the Terra Luna team immediately deal with it, as if they were taking it easy. Some people even suspect that this is all manipulation by the Terra Luna team alone, but we can't think bad first, there is good news that Binance is continuing to trade LUNA and UST.",

That was clearly the initial trigger that was used as a nest by several groups in launching attacks. Moreover, the team's carelessness made them aware. Everything is stale and now there is nothing to expect from LUNA. Whoever Hype tries to re-enter to buy LUNA, they are gambling with their money.",

It might happen.  Currently Terra (LUNA) network and ecosystem is completely destroyed, one by one exchanges are starting to remove LUNA from their exchanges, if they relaunch their projects, I'm sure no one will believe them, even if they launch projects with other name.",
