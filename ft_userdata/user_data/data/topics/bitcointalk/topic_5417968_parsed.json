There some newbies that actually have more technical, economical or other knowledge than some higher ranking members. Mind you the forum warns on depending on the information gotten from this forum, you need to do more research by yourself.But when it's a matter of business I think you need to do that with members that have reputation in the forum. The easiest way to check that is to see there trust information and how they have handled such businesses in the past",

The fact that someone has a higher rank on this forum usually just means the fact that that user registered before other members on this forum and that's all.For advice, you should ask those members who have a certain reputation and knowledge on this forum, and that really does not depend on the forum rank.A good indicator of which members have a good reputation within the forum community is the number of merits a particular member has received.In fact, I have even met certain newbie members who are not very active on this forum but come from the crypto industry and have a lot of knowledge and experience in the field",

If you hang out here, explore, and read discussions often, you will eventually know who are the users that are apparently more knowledgeable than the rest.

You did not say which type of advice you thinking but you mixed up two things here, forum rank with knowledge.forum rank is gained by time and participation spent on the forum. many members reached a high rank (before the introduction of metrics) by spamming. if you need advice from someone who knows a certain subject well, forum rank has nothing to do with it.there is also a certain number of old-new users. Members with a high rank who have achieved a negative reputation, start from scratch, and present themselves as newbies but already have experience with the functioning of the forum.",

Ranks are not an indication that advice from a high rank will be better than from a low rank. Ranks are a measure of time spent on the forum. The longer a user is active on bitcointalk, the higher their rank (this was before the new merit era). But now about the nuances. Now, to increase the rank, you need merits, which are usually (not in all cases) awarded for useful posts. So it turns out that high ranks are given to people who have useful information and knowledge, sharing which they received these ranks. Again, this is not true in all cases. I would recommend paying attention to the amount of merits of users (especially those who have a lot of merits) and this can be assessed as a kind of filter to determine the real level of possession of useful knowledge that allows you to give really useful advice, in contrast to the formal rank. For me personally, a certain indicator of the usefulness of posts is the presence of merits that other users have marked this post with. Most often in them I find something new and useful for myself in terms of information.",

Nope, rank doesn't mean anything because not everyone are active on this forum. There are low ranking members which is more knowledgeable than them so maybe try to focus on what content of the people and you can easily find out if they are really good and not. Anyways maybe catch multiple information and don't focus on single advices since its more helpful if you have many basis towards what actions you want to do on your cryptocurrency hunting career.",
