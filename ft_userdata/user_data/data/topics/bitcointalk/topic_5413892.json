And Bitcoin is currently being used widely in online gambling. Some casinos and sports betting site that before was only accepting fiat currency also adapted and added Bitcoin and other crypto currencies to their payment method. One of such that I know is 500 Casino. P.S. I do not advertise any business entities mentioned above. What I've included are casinos that I believe will less likely to be running away with your money. This is based from experienced playing on their site and seeing them be accessed by other people online. Background check first for your own good.",

The number one reason why people/gamblers use this is because of the privacy and security, it might not ideal to link your bank account in any online gambling casino, so instead, use Bitcoin.",

One interesting thing I noticed is that gambling sites that use bitcoin as a payment method are mostly concentrated on this forum, so you can easily find them here. Follow the instructions of some of the members above and you will find a gambling site that you will love. It is important to remember that gambling is a very risky game and you should only bet with money you can afford to lose.",

Just on this thread you can see that some wear signatures from up to 5 different casinos, on some of which you can place sports bets. In general, gambling has played an important role in the history of bitcoin and looks set to continue to do so in the coming years.",

If you visit the Gambling page, you will see a lot of crypto casinos that use bitcoin and altcoins for betting and that bet is not only for games of luck but sports betting as well.You can also read each crypto casino ANN one by one, register at each crypto casino, and start depositing bitcoin or altcoins to play gambling. But you must know that gambling can tempt you to use more money but the result will not always win, so you must be careful.",

That means they are money and currencies which can be used for gambling. I even prefer bitcoin and other good crypto than to use fiat to gamble, they make gambling deposit and withdrawal very easy, unlike before, especially when it comes to foreign gambling sites.",
