  "content": "Hey guys, first of all I already read the posts here about which hardware wallet to buy but I have a few questions about, and I think a new topic is better than ask in old onesI'm going to travel to US next week, and I don't have a hard wallet until now, but I need one ASAPI was so sure about a Ledger Nano S, because I can find in Best Buy, but after reading here some threads, I'm disappointed with the reviews, specially this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5370521.0My conditions are:Under 100 USDAvailable to buy in USAPreference to buy in a store (not mandatory)I think Ledger is the only one Best Buy sells, and Trezor website shows that is located in Czech Republic, but I don't have US adress.I found this reseller in Trezor's website, but I'm scared to buy outside any official website: https://www.thecryptomerchant.com/products/trezor-hardware-walletThank you guys",

What are you staying at in the US and what do you have available to get one shipped to you.If you're not staying long could you wait until you get back and have a fixed address?If you're staying for a while and do really need one, could you get a po box or a self storage box you could get a device shipped to? (I'd count this as one of the most secure and reliable options I can think of - but I can't think of much).It's hard to verify the device is genuine if you buy from a reseller from what I know of both trezors and ledger.Can you instead by a cheap laptop when you're there (from a reputed retailer) and use an airgapped environment until you get a fixed address a hardware wallet can be delivered to?",

      "body": "If buying in a store is not mandatory, and you're in the US, I'd probably order a Foundation Passport.They manufacture and ship from the US, so shipping time should be good, no issues with customs opening it or whatnot, and no import taxes to be paid.Though they are still shipping preorders, so it can definitely take a while until it arrives.vvv Edit: scrap that... vvvQuote from: rdluffy on August 23, 2022, 04:50:36 PMThank you guys for the help  I'm so sorry if I didn't explain well, but there's no problem with safety or privacy here, the only problem is my trip will last 1 week only.^^^ Edit over ^^^But again, if ordering is an option, just go through [L IST]Open Source Hardware Wallets, pick something you like and order it.Finding a wallet locally is where it actually gets more tricky and that will be your main limitation. You may be forced to indeed go with a Ledger, for instance.Even though the device real bad, keep in mind as long as you have your seed backup, you can always restore that backup and move the coins to a new, better hardware wallet later on.Trezor One is a good option. Definitely my personal favourite under $100.Quote from: rdluffy on August 23, 2022, 04:50:36 PMMy main reason to get one is the last hacks / exploits / exchanges freezing withdraws etc, I'm worried and I want to get all my coins in a more safe environment.If you want to quickly get your coins off an exchange, you can also just go 'cold wallet' way.[1] Go to BestBuy.[2] Buy a decent USB flash drive and a laminator (optional). Should be easy under $100 for both.[3] Flash it with https://tails.boum.org/ .[4] Boot your laptop off of that USB drive. You won't have an internet connection by default.[5] Open Electrum (preinstalled) and create a new wallet. Write down the seed on a paper or two and maybe laminate that paper. [pro tip: fold it before laminating, then it can't be read unless cut open][6] Send the funds from the exchange (e.g. using your phone) to an address that Electrum shows you.[7] Shut down your laptop and remove the USB. If you want you can also format it. It will lose all memory after shutting down anyway. That's why those seed backups are so important.When you are back home and can order a hardware wallet you like, without hurry, take those laminated seed phrases, restore the wallet and move the coins to the hardware wallet.",

There are definitely fake Ledgers and Trezors made in China, not so sure about other wallets. In general, on Amazon and other untrusted resellers, there's risk of even a legit device being compromised and repackaged.Trezor has some information about this, though, as they have their own Amazon store. Do make sure to get it from there and not from another seller. When just searching for the device, Amazon may show you a listing from a different seller, if such a seller is cheaper than the official Trezor (Satoshilabs) Amazon account.https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ:Ordering_and_shipping#Is_it_safe_to_buy_a_Trezor_on_Amazon.3FMake sure that you see this below the order button before  you buy and click on the hyperlink for good measure; they should have exactly 2 products in stock (Trezor One and Trezor T).",
