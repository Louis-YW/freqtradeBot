Just because you see a certain price at trading view, it don’t mean that btc actually hit that price on your exchange.Have checked the charts in your platform? Did btc really hit 24450 there?

Can you provide more screenshots?Sometimes the prices on all exchanges are not 100% the same, there is still a slight price difference between the exchanges. cases like this I have heard quite a few times and mainly because the prices in each exchange may not be exactly the same, it also happens in the forex market.",

But price dropped to $24300, did you cancel the order before it crossed your trigger price?If the exchange you use is not liquid enough, the difference between buy and sell orders will be larger which causes your order to be put in the sell queue.

Better to double check your price based on the selling price because you might input the wrong number that's why you can't proceed with your selling. You're scalping for how many times already before this happen? This is rare not unless you are using an unfamiliar exchange and planning to scam you which I think, should be a big concern especially when you do trading. To get the real answer, better to contact their support now.",

I suggest you to read the whole instruction and requirement for put take profit orders [1] maybe you have missed something and it didn't perform.If you keep experience this issue on the next time, it's better to use other good centralized exchanges e.g. FTX.[1] https://support.bitget.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044804892-Take-Profit-and-Stop-Loss-available-now",

It's also possible that no one has ordered at that price you've set.The market is volatile and you have to take into account that even if you see the price move to that price order you're about to sell, it doesn't mean that all exchanges have reached that price if the market starts to go down a bit.

      "body": "This is not strange I think. You have to understand that different exchanges have different stand point for price. Is not that it is totally different from each other, it is just a little, very little difference either caused by the difference in buy and sell order which is where your exchange make some profit for your order or for trading and executing your order. Depending on different exchanges so the difference varies and that can be called like pips difference. What you notice varies too and can be to your favour when it comes to stop loss. Sometimes you feel you have lost your trade order to stop loss when you open your trade but you find out is just a pip above your stop loss order and you may end up winning that trade at the end. I'm not saying that exchanges don't scam traders, they do especially during the volatility time, they can increase the spread (difference between buy and sell pips) and if you are running out of capital then you can easily lose everything and this makes that while trading you reduce your risk because you can lose or gain but gradually accumulating profit is better because you build more confidence when you are in profit, losses gives you panic always.",

Try to check your orders and see if, on that exchange, it really hits your preferred price. Exchange rates vary per exchange and trading platform. You need to rely on the exchange where you actually placed your order.Next time, try to watch it as possible as you can to have a test. Come back here once everything is confirmed.",

Then it would be easy to understand where the problem is. And if I speak for myself, then first of all I will tell you to change your trading platform. Take a good  reliable exchanger for this you can take as these-Binance , FTX ,Ku-Coin . Binance is leading now and FTX is known as best lower withdrawal fees . You can choose from these. I think your trading platform scammer, your exchanger selection is wrong please do research when you are going to invest anywhere",

I think be aware with your exchange trading, but the way what kinds of exchange market do you use and until your selling order not filled complete? I saw you really got problem with exchange market because your order price have been reached but still not sold.",

Tradingview is working with API from Binance or other exchanges so for sure there are some lapses here especially when prices are volatile.You can also check from your exchange account about what type of order your take profit order is, is it a market order or a limit order? Because if it's market order for sure it will be triggered and sell/buy the order, but if limit order, there could be a spike on price and your order didn't trigger.",

Also different exchange are having different prices, maybe on the exchange which you set your take profit, maybe bitcoin did not get to the price on the exchange.If you think you didn't make mistake, you traded on a Reputable exchange and bitcoin price hit your take profit price, then contact the support just the way other members instructed.",

Every exchange aren't the same and not all of them based their rates on a third-party platform like trading view. Another is maybe there is only a delay that happened with them that time if this was the first time the op experienced this but I think they should come up with a statement in regards to the issue and maybe do some little compensation only to calm down their traders and to keep them on patronizing the exchange site.",

Usually when price hits a pivot it’s hitting stop losses and it varies between exchanges, that’s why on a normal day the price is similar with most exchanges but the daily low or high can vary greatly.It’s sometimes sucks because you were so close in selling but a couple dollars off from taking profit and trade reverses.
