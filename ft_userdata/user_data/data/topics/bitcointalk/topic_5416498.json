You are generalizing Altcoin as shitcoin while there are still a lot of them that has price history like Bitcoin. Maybe you should change it to Shitcoins because that's what really you are trying to express on your statement.Besides, Paper loss is still a loss since you are missing the opportunity to use your money in different investment to have profit since you are forced to hold just to recover your loss. But I agree with you that Bitcoin is the only best coun for holding because this coin is the safest investment on crypto space since its the first mover on crypto.",

If you bought BTC at 60k, you currently lost the opportunity to buy three times more for the same amount of money. Of course, bitcoin can go back to its old ways and reach new heights, but it is wrong to say that you have lost nothing. We don't know the future, and it's possible that bitcoin will be the singularity of currency and worth 100x what it is today. But we also have to consider the cold, hard truth: if you spent $ on bitcoin and didn't sell at a higher price, you lost money.",

We had seen plenty of hates already with Bitcoin and that might or might not affect other people's view on cryptocurrency depending on them.People should still know what they're about to be involved with when they're into crypto.

No one invests with believes that they could lose one day but, that's the sad reality as loses are a vital part of business. It's in loses that some other person might gain although, that's not always the case as there are sme typical win win situations.When you make investments, you get to realise tht there is the possibility of a lose but the good news in this as per price volatility is, you have have chance to mitigate that. By using time as a life line to stay on until you can actually gain. Selling becomes the way to loose and so you hold.",

That's all you need to do until you see the price goes up and then it's on the matter of how long you can achieve that time of selling at profit.Well, bitcoin is known to be on that scene at most times every after the bear market so, you only have to hold it as you've said. For some altcoins, the loss is greater if you're an altcoin lover and keeps on being hyped by it.
