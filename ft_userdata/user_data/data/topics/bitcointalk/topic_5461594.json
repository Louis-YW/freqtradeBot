  "content": "Yes as the title says, first Bitcoin ETF got approved for europeans now they could trade Bitcoin ETF from official platform. It have the ticker of \"BCOIN\". The ETF platforms is knows as JacoBTCi. Well, this is what i have not been expecting because i didn't heard about it before. Most of the news outlet was talking about only Black Rock.QuoteðŸŸ  NEW: First European Bitcoin ETF is now live ðŸ™ŒInstitutional investors from the following countries are able to participate in it:ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± The NetherlandsðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United KingdomðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º LuxembourgðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ SwitzerlandðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª GermanyðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° DenmarkðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª SwedenðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® FinlandðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ AustriaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª IrelandThe news outlets saying about this platform is it already got approval of ETF back in 2021 but was not live till then (source).But according to another latest news, they says this platform is going to launch its own Exchange for ETFs trading very soon. (Source).The thing is why this ETFs is so underrated then other. Because such news must have good impact on the market as well but it didn't. Well, i think due to the unavailability of the exchange maybe as according to news it was not live back then but now i think it's live. Made this topic to know more about it from you guyz.",

We are still waiting for ETF approval from the US to see if theirs will have an impact on bitcoin price with Black Rock. We needs big news that will have an impact on bitcoin price from which we experienced last time when SEC accepted to look into the approval of ETF.",

It is a first Bitcoin Spot ETF in history, to emphasize its meaning for Bitcoin community. It is not a first Bitcoin ETF in general because many Bitcoin Futures ETFs were approved in the past.Spot and Futures ETFs are very different types and the USA. already approved some Bitcoin Futures ETFs, they only have yet approved any Bitcoin Spot ETF.6 Best Bitcoin ETFs Of August 2023QuoteETF (ticker)Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â AUMProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  $889 millionProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI)Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  $100 millionVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF)Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  $39 millionValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  $27 millionSimplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Inc ETF (MAXI)Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  $21 millionGlobal X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS)Â Â Â $11 million",

Generally speaking ETF is in my opinion an over-hyped thing which doesn't have nearly as much an impact as some people have been saying it should have over the past 5-6 years. Specially since there have been a bunch of different ETFs in different countries around the globe without much impact.Besides I'd go as far as saying ETF by definition is the exact opposite of what Bitcoin is made for. When you want to buy bitcoin, you should buy bitcoin directly instead of buying the garbage some investment company sells to you in the name of bitcoin as a middle man. After all Bitcoin was created to eliminate the middle man not add more of them.",

The size of the US cryptocurrency market might be the reason why the news of BlackRock, Fidelity, and others applying for Bitcoin spot ETF approval is getting more attention than others. The US has the highest number of crypto users making it the most important crypto market in the world. The US economy is also seen as a role model of other economies which means that policies made in that country will soon be copied by others. Black Rock and Fidelity are all big firms with large financial bases. They will attract wider attention from the media because of their influence than small firms like JacoBTCi.Quote from: pooya87 on August 01, 2023, 05:43:07 AMBesides I'd go as far as saying ETF by definition is the exact opposite of what Bitcoin is made for. When you want to buy bitcoin, you should buy bitcoin directly instead of buying the garbage some investment company sells to you in the name of bitcoin as a middle man. After all Bitcoin was created to eliminate the middle man not add more of them.ETF is a clear departure from the original reason for the creation of bitcoin. But I like to see the positive impact of these moves by these middlemen. More people will know about bitcoin and gradually they will learn that they don't needs to rely on these exchanges to use bitcoin. Just as FTX made the use of decentralized wallets more popular, an event in the future will keep promoting the need for people to own and control their keys.",

It's a pretty old-school phenomenon.",

It's responsibility of investors who decide to not buy bitcoin directly but invest their money into Bitcoin ETFs. If anything bad happens with Spot ETFs they invest money in, it's their responsibility and they have to accept any bad results in future.People or entities are able to invest in Bitcoin Spot ETFs would be rich ones so I don't think I should feel regret for them because with very bigger capital, they would do more research than me about Bitcoin and they would have better risk management than me.",
