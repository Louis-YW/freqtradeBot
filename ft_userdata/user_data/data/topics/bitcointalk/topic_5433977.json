  "content": "Hi everyone my first post here and it isn't anything original. Sorry  I have a laptop and trying to download the blockchain to run a full node on bitcoin core. I'm at 14% and its downloading at about 0.02% per hour and estimating a sync time of 28 weeks.I've read a bunch and tried everything I could within my skill level.I'm new to linux and running mint on the machine.The specs are:i7-8550U quad-core CPU32GB DDR4 RAM1 TB SSDMy internet speed is about:25mbps dl15mbps ulI'm downloading through Tor and I've changed the size of dbcache to 4096Mib.I had not set up my laptop to not go to sleep and it disconnected from downloading during the first day.Can anyone help me troubleshoot this? Is abandoning the download and restarting a bad decision?Thanks in advance!",

I can definitely try. Is there anything really to be nervous about not using tor or a vpn for the intial blockchain download?I've been thinking about this quite a bit. Thank you!",

I'm at roughly 2% per hour with proton vpn. I definitely will look into Mullad for a vpn as they seem to be a pretty solid.

I thought about that and that's a great idea. Isn't it good practice to use TOR or a vpn while running a node?I may do that if I have some free time. I am little busy atm to hang out at starbucks or other places that offer free internet. I may do that if I get impatient.  THANK YOU!",

There's no \"limit\" to your data usage in free Proton, it will just be slower than the premium servers. Not that I would recommend you front a VPN behind your node. Now why would you do that? You're going to jeopardize your incoming connections. It's like running a node behind CGNAT without port forwarding.",
