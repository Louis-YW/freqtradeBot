  "content": "Hello!So I've come to a recent problem, that I'm getting slowly disabled from every UK bookmaker for basically, gambling too much. I'm under the age of 25, and therefore, in the UK, we have a limit of £500 per month to bet, in the past I used to fake bank statements, wage slips etc, and get huge limits like £5000 per month, but they've cracked down on it to only £500 regardless of earnings.Therefore, I'm looking for a Crypto based bookmaker that would allow a player from the UK, or that would allow me to use a VPN. Stake.com is not an option as the UK site is restricted + the worldwide site says they will ban you if you fail KYS checks. I am looking to bet around £2000-5000 per month, and I like my inplay/live sports, so a fast and big market would be ideal. My favourites have been B365/WilliamHill so if anyone has similar games, that would be great. I used to use CloudBet, but they became restrictive too. I bet on a lot of leagues around the world, Australia/US/France/China etc, even smaller 2nd leagues. Thanks for all the help and suggestions!",

They also prohibit players from your country.Maybe try Freebitco.in but the sports and betting options are limited.You can also look at this list of casinos which includes the license provider and also KYC requirements https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381143.0",

That's going to cause some problems in the future when the player abuses such privilege. I'm not saying you're an abuser but issues would potentially arise with those kinds of deals.",
