Â There is a bunch of ill-intended people who would like have his personal data...In my personal opinion, it would be a lack of respect to him opening such space in the very forum he created to let the world know about Bitcoin while not using his real name.",

That is just the way life works, and speculating on Satoshi Nakamoto isn't any different in that regard. It is true, there are a lot of threads like this. So why do you think such a sub-forum is needed? You see, there is no point in beating around the bush, Satoshi can prove who he is by signing an arbitrary message with his private key. But no one will be able to do it, and our conversation will be fruitless. Issues like this serve only to divide the community, and are not really relevant to development or issues of bitcoin at large. If you want to discuss Satoshi, just do so in general discussion. There are also some good threads you can check out if you want to read a bit more.",

Satoshi himself, themselves, herself, itself didn't wanna be known; this reasons are partly know to deep Bitcoin researchers. .....and I said 'PARTLY'. AFAIK, there are some personal reasons to which he choosed setting up the system like what we have now; for sure, it's primarily -- the most important aspect in ensuring utmost security and surveillance -- Pseudonymity.So I'll say a NO to that appraisal. I would really love that in place but, we'll have other peeps coming down here just to acquire a knowledge behind the whole, BIG MYSTERY -- pseudonymity. That ofcourse would need Satoshi himself to be present which, is somewhat impossible.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

By the approach, you can rename the topic of BlackHatCoiner to \"Satoshi Nakamoto-related Encylopedia\"",
