The clock updates regularly and displays the current debt, as well as the debt per citizen and the debt as a percentage of GDP.The national debt has been growing for decades and is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors, including government spending, economic conditions, and tax policies. The US government has been taking measures to raise the debt ceiling, which is the limit on the amount of debt that the government can legally accumulate. The government has reached the debt limit multiple times in recent years and has been taking measures to temporarily raise the debt limit in order to continue borrowing money to pay its bills.The debt ceiling and government default is a serious concern, as it could have a devastating impact on the global economy, and it's important to note that the US debt is not only a problem for the US citizens but also for the entire global economy.It's important to note that government debt can have both positive and negative effects on the economy, the level of debt that a country can sustain depends on its economic health, and the ability to service the debt, which is the capacity to pay interest and principal on the debt.It's worth keeping an eye on the debt clock and to be informed of the measures being taken by the government to address the debt, as well as the potential risks and impacts on the economy.",

But since it's been going on for a while, it's unclear how much it can keep going on, maybe another decade without issues.Now, AFAIK, to default on foreign debt, you need to fail paying your regular payments. Not just miss a deadline, but miss another one you get after missing the first one. So far, I don't think the US has allowed that to happen, so no default is happening. At some point, this debt thing can burst, I agree, but it may not be a short-term problem, which is why it's so regularly neglected in the US by the authorities.",

Did you see what happened when all of these crypto lending corps filed for bankruptcy? That's also a form of defaulting that screwed over all of their creditors and users. Except in this case it is going to be *everybody* doing business with the United States (including their own residents) that will be effected, with the ricocheting effect ensuring that every single entity feels the reverberation.",

It's coming and it's coming with massive amounts of drama. Democrats are pushing for a coup d'etat if needed, in order to print the infamous trillion dollar platinum coin. Republicans which got the House are going to push for negotiations. No matter what I think the market is sleeping on this and it's not priced in by any means. Moons are aligning too and this coincides with the dollar bottom, sp500 top as well as btc top. I believe markets will go into the usd, making the price go up, and then the FED raising rates again. BTC will just follow the sp500 which means down. Then later this year recesion and unemployment will hit, forming a bottom, that's were markets will capitulate and BTC will go to all time highs by 2024/2025 as well as the sp500.",

In fact, I remember 2 periods where government was at halt and no government worker got a pay check for weeks. Why? Because they couldn't agree on increasing the debt ceiling in both those situations. There was literally no USA government on that period because of this issue. No matter what happens, I guarantee you that it will end up with higher debt ceiling eventually, either they can do it right away, or they could postpone it for more votes and just hold it there and cause trouble, but eventually it will go up even more without a doubt.",

Well that has been so far, it looks like the US dollar might be starting to lose its reserve status, and I say might very cautiously because although there is some indication, I still don't see clear signs. If in x years it loses it, it will not be able to continue exporting inflation to the rest of the world.See this thread for example:    The world continues dumping US dollar (Gold, New World Order, World War III)Hey NotATether, you may want have a look at another tab too:https://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.htmlNo country seems to be saved, they are all in a headlong rush, and the only way to stop this seems like at least a gold partially backed currency, or even hypothetically although this is not on the table, a partially backed currency in Bitcoin.",

If that happens, then you can say goodbye to US hegemony for good. The US Dollar will lose its status as the reserve currency of the world, while the country itself will lose influence over other nations. American decline has been predicted for a long time, so don't be surprised if all of this happens in a \"blink of an eye\". With the world's major economies going downhill, Bitcoin could emerge as Fiat's replacement. No one can predict the future, so let's hope for the best. Just my thoughts",

I think the best thing to do would be keep holding your coins, and if you could invest into it a bit that would be great as well. I believe that should be the way we could get out of this.

That was when it was an issue for me, personally. Back then it was impossible to get anyone to take the US deficit seriously. It was still impossible to convince americans to take the deficit seriously when Trump ran for President in 2016.Recently, something strange happened. Americans have begun to take topics like the deficit much more seriously than in the past. It may have been the 2020 pandemic which triggered it. As someone who observed for 15 years, the shift in public perception is palpable. People appear to be learning, becoming more literate about topics relating to finance and economics more quickly than expected. It is a refreshing thing to see people begin to care about relevant topics which might have an impact upon their future.It could be worth noting that the united states isn't the only nation in the world with debt that is a decent chunk of GDP. Many nations of the world have similar liability issues and are identically attempting to print and spend their way out of it. While de dollarization is a real thing and many nations are taking steps to abandon the US dollar as an international reserve currency. These steps alone will not be enough for nations of the world to insulate themselves from their own national debt.",
