Will those RWA tokens be backed by real assets and will their company treasuries safely audited forever?I think if a token is backed by real asset, it is safer but it does not eliminate risk of scam. Their company treasuries can be faked and in history, we can see some shocked scams which can more easily happen with cryptocurrrencies.A big problem with DeFi tokens is, they can not maintain their capital in and out. If capital in drops, their token price will be affected. It will be worse when their tokenomics can not control inflation.",

And frankly i don't think it's legal. Large companies with tokenized RWA wouldn't like that their wallet addesses were doxxed and that's definitely going to happen. And when ever they would try to move something, bots with higher tx fees would react and buy or sell the same thing before them.There are also problem with the fact that regulators would want transactions to be reversable and assets frozen if needed. So at the moment i don't see any solution making the current system any better. I would like that they would solve this but i have been waiting for so long already.",

I reckon there are other platforms in the cryptospace like Chainlink. Chainlink has been working with Swift for blockchain interoperatibilty and according to their press release, Chainlink's CCIP protocol has connected Swift's infrastructure to private and public blockchains to transfer tokens. I assume the public blockchains being connected with are with Ethereum and Binance smartchain.Working with more than a dozen major financial institutions and market infrastructures and Chainlink, a leading Web3 services platform, Swift has successfully demonstrated that it can provide a single point of access to multiple networks using existing, secure infrastructure, thereby significantly reducing operational challenges and investment required for institutions to support the development of tokenised assets.Source https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-unlocks-potential-tokenisation-successful-blockchain-experimentsIf real world assets become a very big market for DeFi, I reckon automated marketmaking platforms with the highest liquidity might be good investments.

I remember now, the NFT that's been associated with some known companies like Nike. They got attention but after that, there's nothing interesting anymore.

CBDCs are right around the corner, so it might not be long enough before digitized RWAs become a big hit. Expect digitized RWAs to develop on decentralized public blockchain networks, before they migrate to centralized blockchain networks (controlled by central banks and governments). This so-called \"De-Fi\" is nothing but \"experimental grounds\" of what's coming next. Who knows what the future holds for our society? Just my thoughts",
