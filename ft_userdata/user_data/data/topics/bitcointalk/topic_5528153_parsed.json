  "content": "It's already been almost a month since The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) decision that Central Banks can hold up to 2% came into effect under their \"Prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures\".BIS initially was planning for a 1%, but when Central Banks asked for 5%, they proposed a 2% as a compromise.Quote from: https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d545.htmA bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and should generally be lower than 1%. Given that Central Banks are already looking into this, let's examine the impact this could have.Let's be conservative and assume we continue with the proposed 2%, and not the 5% that banks want.Banks have about $188T:Quote from: https://www.statista.com/statistics/421215/banks-assets-globally/The value of bank assets worldwide increased gradually between 2002 and 2023, despite some fluctuation. In 2023, global bank assets amounted to more than 188 trillion U.S. dollars, up from 183.2 trillion U.S. dollars a year earlier.At 2%, this represents $3.76T in Bitcoin. For comparison, the current market cap of Bitcoin is $2.05T.This, even at 2%, is a game changer for Bitcoin.",

People pay more attention to a certain president and his promises, while on the other hand, news like this can have a much greater impact on the price of BTC - although it should be noted here that banks can have part of their assets not exclusively in BTC, but in cryptoassets as is said in the article.Some will not agree at all with the fact that banks start buying and storing BTC, but it is still their decision and it remains to be seen whether everything will come down to individual cases or whether central banks will start investing en masse in cryptocurrencies.As things stand right now, this could be a very exciting year for Bitcoin.",

It unites central banks of 60 countries, including all major European states, North America, major South American states, China, and India. It seems they've been working on this policy since 2022, and I do agree that even 2% is quite a lot of money (even for cryptos in total) if central banks choose to hold some funds in Bitcoin.

Pretty freaking epic when you have every bank trying to get bitcoin on their balance sheet if its not already happening it will soon be. It will have a HUGE impact on our favorite coin  This move of the central banks to hold their reserve on Bitcoin is a promise to drainage other institutions to adopt the strategic the strategic reserve as well and once they do, it is sure of turning out to green lightening to the Bitcoin market in the main time.I said main time because because on the series of adoptors buying Bitcoins gradually and steady is also how steady and gradually Bitcoin price would keep growing.Therein is point we would even find the impact of those institutions which have not been able to buy Bitcoin yet because when the finally buys the Bitcoin in the future would contribute to further increase of Bitcoin.So indirectly these slacking institutions later to adopt Bitcoin will also act as reserve of Bitcoin values as it would perform series of market increases but if every of the expected institutions come to adopt this strategic reserve at same time, the green lights of Bitcoin would come to a time of reaching it maximum price as there is no value of further adoptors that is weighty enough to bring increase to the markets.Note: the regulatory compliance police states the central banks would not exceed to have it reserve on Bitcoin above 2%.Although the future promises of Bitcoin price is not pegged on just the banks but also as the private institutions but while we considers the leadership of the governments facilities adopting Bitcoins, it as well encourages the private institutions to follow the trends. Let us also be aware that most of the institution resources are in corporation with the government with Central regulations.Symbolically on this mode, the green lights will ever turnup even after the so yello or red lights. Then there should be that valuable reasons of adoptors to dive into the Bitcoin market.",

It is no secret that BlackRock bought large shares in the largest mining farms, and that it clearly wrote that it retains the right to decide which chain will follow in the case of a fork, with the emphasis that it may be the chain that will not have the greatest support.This will be a big challenge for BTC in terms of remaining as it is today, which means with a clearly defined max supply and being decentralized and based on PoW.",
