Avoid such mails they are all scam I have been receiving this mail lately and I don't always give a f*ck to it because I don't have account with any platform neither am I expecting any form of payment from any one to any platform, so I total discard the message and trash them at the end even as they keep on coming in. Yesterday a friend of mine told me how he fell victim of the scam, he also got same email with a tempting amount 0.5+ BTC his greed could not let him let go off the mail he decided to open the link and undergo all their process, and the BTC moved from 0.5 to 1btc + which was worth about $38k according to the screenshots sent over to me  when it was ready for withdrawal, he was as asked to make a payment of $64+ seeing the huge amount of money on the fake platform and his eagger to withdrawal 30k plus  dollars he, made a move purchase Bitcoin from Binance and make deposit to their generated address.

However, I'm not entirely sorry for your friend as this means they were trying to claim someone else's money...In any case, email addresses gets passed around a lot hence it's inevitable to not get a couple of scam emails in one of your mail boxes. I suggest keeping your email addresses private as much as possible and compartmentalize - create multiple email addresses to segregate important stuff to non important stuff. They will not solve the problem entirely but it does a good job at minimizing the damage.",

After 3 times of sending emails to me with different amounts of BTC, I already know it was a scam. A newbie with greed would fall for it, especially with the expectation of $38k thinking what is $64 when you receive such an amount. Felt sorry for him not receiving anything. Lesson learned that the internet is full of scammers. $64 could have been saved if he talked to OP first.",

Note that there are no free money here on the Internet, and if a service promise to give you money for free that's a sign that you should rum far away from it. I think you should educate your friend more on how to avoid phishing and also how to be conscious of his/her privacy and security online. I'm sure if your friend had known about phishing he could have been more skeptical and his $60+ would still be in his wallet. P.s. I think this thread should be moved to beginners and help board.",

This will help plenty people who received different emails from unknown sources. Your friend would not learn from this act because the buddy is greedy and he wants to be rich at all cost. If not that screenshot is clearly stated that he should deposit money to his account, as how? Repeated emails to your mail box is definitely a scam or Spammers so you just have ignore it and if possible unsubscribe from the channels then everything will be normal. Op the only thing you will do to safe this your friend from such again is to advise him with warning. I'd not he will still fall again from another method because those scammers are wiser has the serpent.",

If your friend was fully into crypto, there should have been about 40–80% chances that he could have sensed out that such an email can only be a scam. There are lots of scammers out there who have different kinds of targeted victims, and this kind of scam focuses on those who are newbies to the crypto industries; they might definitely not know how to get them in person, but I believe they have specific places where they buy all the mails from and send a bug mail to all their obtained mails. If your friend knew that there was nothing like free money in these crypto spaces, then he should have been conscious enough to avoid this kind of scam. Since he has already made his first payment, for which they charge him for withdrawal or whatever the title of the billing may be, if you happen to not hold him and educate him on how all this works, he will come up to you next time with another story of the next deposit made.",

I have long been dealing with this type of mail from different senders some claiming I won BTC some saying I won a BTC coupon and lots more. I do not waste my time anymore opening such mails. What I do is just a click mark as spam, block and delete that is what I do now.As for the emails, it is not reasonable you use same email you use for Crypto activities for other official create a different mail for Crypto so as to protect yourself and your information from hackers.",

Every emails which look too absurd to be true must be taken with suspicion by the receiver. Even emails claiming you had an account hacked on an exchange or bank must not be taken as true at first glance.One hint I give you is to right click the button of the link presented on the email, then copy address of the link and ctrl + v on notepad or any other place, so you can see to where you would be redirected.

All this tools are use to extract mails from popular sites like linkedln, minds, and any other websites they want. Those tools are specifically design for email marketing. Even with all the procedures you mentioned about scammers can still your mails providing that you use them to make registration on sites. Something they even go as far as buying those mails from places you use them for survey, spreadsheet registration and so on. In one way or the other we can still get all this mails their is no way which we can completely ignore them, even when you blacklist the first one they will still come up with another email and continue sending. The only things to do is to completely ignore the mail even when we receive them it's better off than way, but it's only few who know that those mails are truly scam will be able to resist such tempting offer. They say greed is one thing that push someone to be a victim of scam.Quote from: livingfree on April 02, 2023, 06:44:56 PMUsually that type of email goes to the spam folder and you're unlikely to click the link because they're unclickable. But it's sad to see that there are still some people that fall for it.Not all does, the ones I receive come directly into my inbox unread mails no kind of warning from gmail at all to identify it's a scam or something. Mails which goes into scam folders are those that's has been repeatedly reported as scam, which Gmail or any mail provider will now likely flag them as scam mail. And another thing there as well is that, the scammers are already aware that the mails might likely be sent to spam box so they use other means,  like using an old gmail or any mail account which have been created for several years and has been active for long, using such old mails to send scam mails most of the times mail providers over look it because they are old account that's to say they don't expect old account to be use for such new generational scam.",
