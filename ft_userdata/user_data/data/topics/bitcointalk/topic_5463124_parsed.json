      "body": "In the recent times, an account is not considered valid collateral, so even if your loan is for 24 hours only, chances are low that you will get one. Look at this, How is the lender going to recover his money using your collateralized account just in case you default the loan.Maybe try reading this  Lending Board Rules of Engagement - Attention Lenders and Borrowers can help, especially here;Quote from: DireWolfM14 on July 23, 2023, 05:35:43 AMWhat is not collateral:Identification documents are not collateral.  IDs can be faked or forged, and do not guarantee the identity of the borrower.  Nor do they guarantee recourse in the event of a defaulted loan.  Even if the documents are authentic, law enforcement agencies could take years to make any progress on a reported case.Fiat sent through PayPal or other reversable payment methods should never be offered or accepted as collateral.  The borrower could charge-back the collateral as soon as the lender sends the loan, leaving the lender empty handed and at a loss.Social media accounts and service provider accounts (such as exchange or casino accounts) are not collateral.  Any account that can be recovered by social engineering is a high risk for the lender to accept as collateral.Bitcoin Forum accounts should not be offered or accepted as collateral.  If a lender attempts to sell a Bitcoin Forum account in the event of a loan default, he risks being red-tagged as an account seller.  Selling and buying of Bitcoin Forum accounts is frowned upon by many members of the community.Items the borrower has listed for sale.  If the borrower is looking to sell the item he's offering as collateral, odds are he's not going to return the loan and is trying to trick the lender into unwittingly buying the item.Virtual credit cards, gift cards, access codes, game codes, VPS codes, or any similar type of item that holds digital value should be avoided.  These can easily be retrieved by the borrower through social engineering, or drained of their value immediately after the loan is issued.",
