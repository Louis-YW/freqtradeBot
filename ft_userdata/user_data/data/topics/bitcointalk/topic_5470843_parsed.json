      "body": "Use the GMP library which allows for arbitrary-precision integers. It's much easier than trying to modulo multiple uint64_t parts - although you kinda miss out on performance if your end goal is to run it on CUDA.You can even import these numbers in hexadecimal base - as well as any other base.I'm going to assume your numbers are in big-endian, because manually flipping the bytes is too tedious for me.Code:const char* a = \"59f2815b16f81798029bfcdb2dce28d955a06295ce870b0779be667ef9dcbbac\";const char* b = \"483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8\";char result[256];mpz_t ma, mb, mresult;mpz_init(ma);mpz_init(mb);mpz_init(mresult);mpz_set_str(ma, a, 16);mpz_set_str(mb, b, 16);mpz_fdiv_r(mresult, ma, mb); // <--- modulusmpz_get_str(result, 16, mresult); // returns a hex string without a prefix// ...mpz_clear(ma);mpz_clear(mb);mpz_clear(mresult);EDIT: forgot to add bases to mpz_set_str",
