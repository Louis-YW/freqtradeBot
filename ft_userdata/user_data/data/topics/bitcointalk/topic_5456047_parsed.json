No more manual guesswork ‚Äì our bot automates your trades, leveraging smart algorithms to maximize your profit potential.Very nice presentation of that useless bot, but sorry we are not interested in such bots and we keep huge distance from any stuff that does trading automatically for us. You should try to find another market to sell out your program because no one in this forum trust such bots and those applications aren't reliable at all. If your bot is truly that good then why aren't you using it yourself to earn huge profits from it yourself? The reason is simple because you are sure that it doesn't work the way you represented it.I recommend all the forum members to stay away from such bots because the OP might have added malicious code into it to steal your Bitcoin. I have seen many such cases where people sold malware by presenting it as a bot or a automatic earning solution, and all those people who installed such applications due to lack of technical knowledge were hacked by such malicious actors. It's always a good choice to ignore such applications and learn the concepts of trading and do it yourself rather than relying on those bots.",

It's not like your just out here talking about it but actually, advertising you or your company's bot with the repeated use of the word 'our' in your write up.Again from your construction, you don't seem to be just any newbie user. Perhaps the account is focused on the product your putting out but, you can't project more seriousness on an account that means less to you. Perhaps getting a copper membership would show your seriousness in this launch.Also, you need to show the forum some proof if you hope to get any followers. I mean like, some evidence to how your bot works like posting a deduction before its manifested in the market and after its manifested.Still, I don't think a bot equals human reasoning.",

When you enter or exit a market with a coin on the market, trading volume of that coin is important. If it is very big, it is fine but if it is not too big or small trading volume, your capital will have effect on its price. So if you share your signal to others, your chance to get profit will be affected and maybe profit will change to loss.QuoteAfter answering these questions, the potential buyer should probably already know what to do with this offer  if not, I'll give you a hint - stay away.I agree.",

Trading with bots is available on a few platforms, But I never dare to use them because I don't want to lose my money by relying on a bot I have never used. I am curious if Bot trading really works. Suppose it works; does it always make a profit? Is it a riskless method to trade? I don't think there is any way to trade without risk. When people talk about algorithms for trading, I feel like those are scams. If it is integrated into the platform, like Bot, it may have a good use case. But I don't trust any third-party programs.",

I highly doubt these bots can make any much difference with their stop and enter features which are just repetition based on the profits or losses that you make. Plus giving away your account control and the funds in the hands of bots is risky too. I know we can set the limits of exhaustion but that is also poorly managed and not charming feature. Dont know I am against the bot concept since the beginning I came to know about them. The Gunbot was there on the forum, however it also went down the market line over the time.
