But this particular case is not about that and that is why it seems to have persisted for a longer time. I think ordinals are the true cause of this problem. Quote For an early Bitcoin adopter, it is essentially important to start up with the right mentality and approach to avoid using all your Bitcoin savings for paying fees just because you want your transaction to go through at all costs, for for me, the advice is make no transactions and keep holding since the goals are for long term accumulation so that that to be achieved there is need for patient and resilience, by saving up with no transaction record.Just my two cents, I don't know who needs to read this.Right now I will also advise the use of bitcoin transaction only for large amounts not small amounts. You can also follow the advice of using small inputs and outputs. If you already have UTXOs which are smaller amounts I will advice you use coin control to freeze them for the moment. This particular case should be a reason why we need to pay more attention to consolidating smaller UTXOs",

That's all you can do when you are in need or just pay the fee and accept those fees as part of your losses. It's not always that these fees are going to be high, there will be some time that it's lower than the peak of these fees but still, considerably high. Don't make a transaction when you're going to send $10 and the fee is like $5-$8. Of course that doesn't make sense if you're going to do it, if it's about accumulation. If it's coming from the exchanges and they don't mind to pay the fee, that's fine but if you'll shoulder it. Save that money and buy in huge batches when fees drop.",

You can used it for free and wait for it to push through. I can vouch it myself as I have used their services in the last couple of months since the fees started to go up and become  very expensive to average joe. But I would agree on some of your points that you point here. If you are not in a hurry to make a transaction then don't. Just simply HODL and wait for the network congestion to subside at least to a levels that you are comfortable with regards to the transaction fees. Or you can follow this thread: [Dec 2023] Fees are high, wait for opportunity to Consolidate your small inputs.",

So, just keep the Bitcoin on the private wallets, we don't target to take profits in the near future. I'm sure most of Bitcoin holders will take profits after the Bitcoin halving, which means they probably send their Bitcoin to the exchange wallets after Q2 of 2024.However, if most Bitcoin holders will send their Bitcoin in the same time in 2024-2025, I assume there will be another increase in Bitcoin transfer fees in the next year. But if we send our Bitcoin to exchange wallets too early, it will be also very risky to keep the Bitcoin on exchange wallets. Honestly, I'm also a bit confused about when the right time to send our Bitcoin on the exchange.",
