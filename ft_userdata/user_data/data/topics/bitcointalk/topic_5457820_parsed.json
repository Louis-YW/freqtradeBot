Why not just use RAID?I don't think the BIOS of your Optiplex 7060 offers this, but there is a way to use an external card, which isn't very expensive. This would save you a lot of work, ok it takes longer to set up, but then you don't have to do anything else.",

      "body": "I see no point to clone data that is more or less readily available to re-download again within a reasonable amount of time. It might only make sense if you need to be ready with all data available within a short amount of time. As others already said, there're only rare cases where cloning the blockchain data makes sense or has a use for it (e.g. deploy a second node without the need to make a full IBD again for that node).To my knowledge a Bitcoin node doesn't benefit much of a RAID setup, but I assume that wasn't your intention anyway.A backup scheme and having data storage devices for that is never a mistake. For that there are some options available. I like to use Macrium Reflect for that. You can use an imaging mode or file based backups. A full image backup as a starting point and from there incremental backups will be fast and small. From time to time you consolidate the incremental backups chain to a new full image backup from which a new incremental backup chain can emerge.",

And if you use a cold wallet for signing, it won't need access to the full blockchain. It's easier that way, but much more work to keep your offline blockchain up to date. Only transfering a signed message from your hot wallet to your cold wallet (and back after signing) is much easier to maintain.",

Password protect the wallet before making a backup, and make backups before funding the wallet. Even better if you actually test restoring one of the backups and verify it produces the same addresses (being thorough gives me peace of mind).I prefer to use different brands and types of external storage media for my backups, just in case on of the drives/sticks doesn't last long.",
