  "content": "Hello there,As I was driving earlier, this thought came through my mind. I've been accumulating Bitcoin for quite some time now, and at some point eventually I'll have to withdraw it in fiat, at least some of it. I'm not sure when that time will come, and I'm definitely not selling for anything below $50,000, but that's another story. However, I've always kept my bitcoin away from exchanges, and I prefer that it stays that way for obvious reasons that have been discussed numerous times in the forum.Not only do I want to avoid exchanges but also banks, which is currently the most convenient way to withdraw money, but if I were to move funds to a bank account, they'd get taxed at 24%, which is a huge percentage. I've also thought about Bitcoin ATMs, but the majority of them here require some sort of KYC and feature expensive fees, although they may still be a better option than bank transfers. Is there an actual, reliable way to exchange bitcoin for cash in hand? My best guess would be a P2P transaction in person, but that's quite unlikely.",

      "body": "If you don't want to use a bank or ATM to exchange bitcoins for money, you don't have many options. A P2P trade would certainly be the easiest in such a case. But it is not easy to find a suitable trading partner. Either way, you have to be careful not to be scammed or robbed in the process. Therefore, one should always be careful. Above all, you have to be careful not to get counterfeit money.",

      "body": "There are a few options for exchanging bitcoin for cash, but each has its own risks and drawbacks that need to be considered.Peer-to-Peer Transactions: This can be a reliable way to exchange bitcoin for cash, but it requires finding a trustworthy buyer and conducting the transaction in person.Bitcoin ATMs: While some Bitcoin ATMs require KYC and have high fees, they can still be a better option than bank transfers. You can find Bitcoin ATMs near you through websites like Coin ATM Radar.Cryptocurrency Exchanges: While you prefer to avoid exchanges, some exchanges offer the option to withdraw funds in cash, either through a direct deposit to a bank account or by withdrawing cash at a partner ATM. However, this option may still involve paying taxes and dealing with banks.Over-the-counter (OTC) Trades: Some OTC trading desks allow you to trade large amounts of bitcoin without having to go through an exchange. You can find OTC traders through websites like ex-LocalBitcoins (offline now) or through referrals from trusted sources.Regardless of the method you choose, it's important to exercise caution and do your own research before making any decisions. It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor or tax professional for guidance on the tax implications of your specific situation.",

      "body": "Yes, one option for exchanging Bitcoin for cash in hand is through peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. However, as you mentioned, this may not be convenient or practical for everyone. Another option is to use a cryptocurrency exchange that supports cash deposits or withdrawals. Some exchanges allow users to deposit cash into the exchange, which can then be used to purchase Bitcoin. Similarly, the Bitcoin can then be sold for cash, which can be withdrawn as cash in hand through a physical exchange location. Not sure where you are from, but if trading Bitcoin is legal in your country, there should be physical exchanges where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The best thing to do is to ask your local community.",

Maybe you can avoid centralized exchanges with P2P transactions with people who accept crypto exchange services, but then the funds will be transferred to your bank account, obviously you can't avoid banks. Currently we still rely on centralized exchanges and banks to convert to fiat, but if bitcoin adoption takes place in your country, you can immediately use bitcoin as payment provided someone wants to accept bitcoin payments.and for Bitcoin ATMs, it does use KYC and transaction fees are quite expensive.",

There's a limit per trade size and you can read it here.  I tried this option without linking to my bank account but I used an app that supported remittances upon withdrawal of your money and don't need a bank account.  It's called GCASH in my country, from your crypto convert it to fiat via p2p trade locally and send it to the app and then withdraw your fiat to any remittance center.  I dont know where you come from but if there's an app have a feature like this in your country could be helpful.",
