Because you must have seen this picture on some meme page I also saw this pic on a Meme page and it was meant to be sarcastic instead of showing the fact the ledger is no longer trusted. We all know the ledger is under severe hate (which means people are avoiding buying it) due to its recovery update. But it did not mean someone came in public and showed his/her public to everyone. I hope you understand the purpose of that image.",

In terms of security, why would you trust other software/hardware than yourself to protect your wallet?If you want to secure a wallet don't ever use a hardware wallet unless it's open source and proven secured but for me, I stay using offline/cold wallet.The only advantage of using a hardware wallet like Ledger is the ease of use because it supports altcoins and tokens.I guess that the man who posted the seed phrase publicly is now switching to a Trezor wallet.

      "body": "Hello to you too.It would be naive to hope to take advantage of the negligence of people taking such careless photos with seed phrases, and also, absolutely unethically, to take advantage of this. In this case, of course, it looks like some kind of prank or joke, but I doubt it about fraud using a similar method. Whether it is possible somehow to use it - I don't represent.The loss of confidence in the manufacturer of hardware wallets doesn't mean that you need to publish seed phrases with 367BTC, as indicated in your post. Could just stop using this device, that's all.I have the following point of view:Ledger devices, from a technical point of view, can probably be trusted, because again, from a technical point of view, they remain reliable devices that have not yet been physically hacked. But Ledger itself, as a company, undoubtedly, thanks to their actions, there is no trust and can't be. But since this company and this devices are inextricably linked, it would be better not to use their products at all, if possible.",

I think the reason majority of hardware wallet users are still with Ledger is the same reason why some people still prefer fiat to crypto. If it is true that Ledger still (after all) has a large number of users, then we can conclude that the majority of their users are actually unaware of everything that happened in the past and what we learned a few months ago. Basically, it doesn't matter to them that their personal data is hacked and publicly available to anyone who abuses it, nor that the company seems to have the ability to access confidential information on the devices it sells and to share it with third parties (including the authorities).Whether the reason is that someone is unaware of the risks or doesn't understand the risks, the fact is that the amateurism and crazy moves of that company (from a risk perspective) sound an alarm that everyone should take seriously.",

It's not something you can easily recover from as a company, even though the drama has calmed down now. Knowingly or unknowingly, they have explained that secure element chips can be programmed to allow remote access, making such chips unsuitable for cold/semi-cold storage with hardware wallets. They are just digging their own grave going forward with the Recover feature.That aside, that Twitter feed has nothing to do with it and it's just someone who wants some attention, likes, or whatever. One look at that thread and its pictures and you realize that it's just a joke. Check the second picture. Besides the Nano X and seed, there is also a gun and a pocketknife in the picture. No one can and should take that seriously.",

Undoubtedly, this is some kind of trick.I dont have the numbers on how much money could have been stolen this way, though it is a scam method which has already been demonstrated to exist. I have seen myself at least one scammer trying to use it here in the forum, by posing as a newbie. Assuming someone does it in a relatively crowded place where hundreds or thousands of users can see his bait message with the seed phrase, a scammer could easily pocket at least 100$ per time he shares that picture and asks for help, and since each individual victim only losses a relatively small amount of ETH/TRON, then they are less likely to spread what happened to them and make others aware of the scheme. It is a method which is not so highlighted as the free give always scams or the typical ponzis, because at first glance there is no indication there is a scam behind it.",
