People need to be on the internet space for them to invest with cryptocurrency so for now we still have to keep creating that scam free atmosphere with cryptocurrency and that will allay the fear of the growing population of cryptocurrency.",

Instead of investing in crypto, they invest in new projects that don't know if they will thrive in the future or will disappear after the project is launched. It seems that they don't see the benefits that bitcoin can provide them, so they haven't used it as their investment. But after this, they will flock to invest and use bitcoin, especially after they see an increase in the price of bitcoin which will increase. Mass adoption is bound to happen and will happen in the future so we should just wait and help spread it in society.",

If an earthquake or hurricane shuts down businesses and the economy grinds to a halt. To a point where local internet ISPs go down and electricity is out. Backup generators and affordable satellite uplinks like starlink could still allow for business transactions to occur. I think that is the standard to aim for. As well as the robustness that digital technologies will need to better compete with paper money.While precious metals like gold and silver are often touted by doomsday preppers as being the currency of exchange in a post apocalyptic future. There has never been a scenario where society has reverted back to gold or silver standards in the event of war or natural disaster. The overwhelming majority of people would not have the slightest clue as to what a fair exchange rate for precious metals resembles, or how to identify legitimate gold bars from counterfeit ones. The infrastructure and knowledge base necessary for a reversion back to precious metals as tokens of financial exchange, no longer exists.It is possible that digital forms of exchange as well as paper money are our only options.",

It will impact the very place it is, but when you move to just another town next door you are going to end up getting all your money anyway. The trouble here is investing into bitcoin is still nowhere near investing into dollars for my nation, its getting there bit by bit but its still far away because one goes up constantly, even on bad days when dollar devalues, our Lira devalues even more hence dollar goes up, whereas Bitcoin could drop significantly. Thats the issue and rarely could be fixed or figured out.",

You also have lending, credits, and investments among other things. Bitcoin does all of this, but how can you control its supply in the market if there is an overflow of it when you cannot really change its specifications at all? Price and value alone of one thing isn't enough reason for people to use it as a currency. It has to be something more than that unfortunately. And even though bitcoin and crypto posted huge gains over the past decade, you can't really do much about them but use it for buying, selling, and speculation.",

We have to educate the surrounding people so that they can be on boarded for the better tomorrow of own banking system. If they are not into crypto then they are missing out whole new universe of banking system. The ownership has to be taught and in the current era only bitcoin is such asset which can fulfils this need really. So Yup, adopt it yourself and let others know what are they missing!",

In fact, for bitcoin to succeed in any nation there should be some level of economic development. Adopting bitcoin as a legal tender thinking that it would miraculously solve the economic problems of any nation is daydreaming.   Every government would always want to control the affairs of its people. They want to ensure that the financial or monetary sector of the nation is under their control. Bitcoin might not give them the privilege of making putting people in financial prison. Bitcoin would make people free from the financial manipulation of the central banks of most nations. So I don't think they would ever accept making become the national currency. They would keep sponsoring negative information about bitcoin because they want to discourage people from using it. It is clear that they might not be able to stop bitcoin adoption among their citizens, but they would do everything possible to regulate the industry. But the truth is that bitcoin might coexist with fiat for a very long time.",

The citizens of those countries that you refer to their currency as foreign currency are buying and exchanging their fiat to have more cryptocurrency, so we can actually say that cryptocurrency is growing to have more value over fiat be it local or foreign. The government and some of these people will not openly declare this, but in their hearts they know the truth that the fiat is failing.",

War so so good for bitcoin!Let's see if you have a new war over in Taiwan (god forbid it actually happens, just hypothetically) what's your bet on the price, 10k or 100k?There is no growth when there is an economic downturn, how many of those do we need to go through to finally acknowledge it?Look when gold started gaining value, it wasn't until late November that we finally had good news about inflation and the economy in general, during the crisis in March and October after an initial pump it went down from 2k to 1.6k, hitting 10% lower than before the war!

But, if there will be people or countries that will adopt BTC then I believe there will also be people or countries who will abandon it for some reasons. BTC to be the main currency is not likely and if it's possible then why El Salvador and the other one who made BTC a legal tender, still had their own local currency and they still use it? That's because BTC can't handle anything but it mainly works if there are electricity and internet.You can't stop the excitement of the people because the adoption of BTC is truly inevitable. Even if not a legal tender, simply adopting it is still a big thing.",

So most of its valuation will depend on the fact that it is scarce. On the other hand, fiat is made to be spent and circulated, which is why more will be printed over time, effectively diminishing its value. This rolls down to the next reason why it's not fair to compare the two. Fiat is inflationary. Meaning its value will diminish over time due to economic struggles, overprinting, the whole shebang, whilst cryptocurrencies, at least most of them, will remain deflationary. Wherein some of them like bitcoin. are halving their total circulating supplies over time to preserve and pump its value. Fiats do not have this type of feature and it doesn't need it either, because it is meant to be spent, not to be saved.",
