They are just different address types and you can send bitcoin to any of them you want. We have only one bitcoin chain and there is no bitcoin on BEP20, BEP2, ERC20 networks. Binance always try to deceive users into using their fake bitcoins instead of the real bitcoin.",

(you'll save fee if you're using SegWit input [sender], not the output [receiver])The only use of those two options \"BEP20\" & \"BEP2\" is if you're depositing from another exchange using those \"Networks\".In the background, they'll send \"non-Bitcoin Tokens\" on the selected network (Binance Smart Chain or BNB Beacon Chain) which has same value as Bitcoin when deposited.It only has value inside of those Exhange when credited to your Bitcoin balanceso do not keep them outside of the Exhange as much as possible if you somehow decided to select those when you withdraw (seriously, don't)The initial reason those are added is to save fees and time, but given that Bitcoin's optimal fee is small most of the time, those are quite obsolete.",

I have been able to do as said and it went well successfully. But never leave your coins on exchanges, the keys (the private key) are not yours, it belong to the exchange, there can be a time of inconveniences like wallet maintenance, freezing of accounts or coins, an exchange can be hacked etc. if you are not using the money for trading, or converting it to fiat for spending, better to send it back to a noncustodial wallet, like Electrum.Also as nc50lc commented, exchanges do charge fixed fee for withdrawal, which is far higher than the transaction fee while using noncustodial wallet, so using lower fee is about noncustodial wallet (I mean when sending on noncustodial wallet), not when sending on exchanges.Quote from: nc50lc on December 27, 2022, 05:01:50 AMThe initial reason those are added is to save fees and time, but given that Bitcoin's optimal fee is small most of the time, those are quite obsolete.I was thinking it is for the tokenized version of bitcoin (which are altcoins) that are existing, for people to have the withdrawal option too, even ERC20 is not that cheap. Just that Binance and other exchanges do not list them in a way people willl be able to differentiate between the real bitcoin addresses and the altcoins address.",

BitcoinB. Something made up by someone who wants to earn money from it.Ideally, for every B there is a A. And ideally, Binance would give that person A in exchange for B at their request. Until they decide not to. Who wants to be at the mercy of a rich guy who hides his company in the Cayman Islands?Like anyone else who created altcoins, Binance uses it to earn more Bitcoins. So whenever someone loses some B, it reduces their claim on A and Binance gets richer. In many cases it won't instantly be obvious who loses it, but they can at some point decide that all users have to exchange their B for C, and if they don't do that within x months, B becomes worthless and Binance owns more A!QuoteI thought this would not be possible, because if it is this would be very unethical as you said in your post.I linked to the topic of Binance literally scamming users. They confiscated all their funds for reasons the user had nothing to do with. They're not running their company based on ethics, it's based on greed.",

I thought this would not be possible, because if it is this would be very unethical as you said in your post.Wrapped, Safu, tokenized all useless words that try to hide reality. As Loycev said, all those wrapped tokens, coins whatever are just IOU promises, there is no difference between WBTC and Terra, they were both backed by consent that was not in your control, so when the ones really controlling those decide it's time to pull the plug you're left with a coin backed by literally nothing and worth just as much as some moron who has not read the news is willing to pay.Same for UST, the same for BUSD, same for every coin that promises stability or pegging to a value. If this can't work in the real world with currencies, do you think the likes of CZ or Kwon (ups) can solve it?As for unethical, should we ask SBF what is considered ethical in the industry?Back to the matter at hand, if Binance would really care about the fees and about Bitcoin, the order on that list would be a little different right? Not with a fake bitcoin being first and the real Bitcoin second? Or if they wound;t want to trick their customers, they could have simply made a different selection for BNB Bitcoin, whoever wants bitcoin click on Bitcoin and deals with that, the ones that want BNB scam coins click on BNB  and do the deposit from there.Reminds me of a Simpsons scene, it's like you press to vote with Democrats, and the first option is Bush.",
