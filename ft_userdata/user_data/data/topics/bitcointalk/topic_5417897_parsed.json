I don't actually think it's down to exchanges that means crypto adoption has happened that much. If everything was peer to peer it'd still function much the same way and probably a similar safety. There's likely been a lot of scam exchanges that have done worse for the space and the lack of adoption by larger and more traditional companies - as well as some banks banning companies like coinbase which have done well to hinder adoption.I'd say faucets in the time when I joined provided a much better onramp to cryptocurrency than exchanges did (especially for learning how things work).",

If everything was peer to peer it'd still function much the same way and probably a similar safety. I think it depends. Sometimes exchanges are not important , like here in this forum p2p is ok. But sometimes they are important. A few years ago, in 2017 when I joined the crypto space, it was very hard to buy bitcoin in Brazil, even in exchanges.Peer to peer was nearly impossible: price was much higher, not the same security, lots of scammers...I believe exchanges were important and they still are. Many implementations such as ATM exists due to partnerships with exchanges because they provide the necessary volume for those services to operate.",

The first time I hear and come across crypto was through Binance ads I registered from there and gain more knowledge from different places. When it comes to newbies like me in this crypto space, exchanges are very important and essential because they are the only means by which I find it safe and trustworthy to buy any crypto with my fiat. There are also a lot of people out there who their way into crypto from exchanges starting from when someone tells them about a particular coin that they believe will change their financial status overnight, which doesn't happen that way, from there they get access to any exchange have small knowledge and then introduce others into it. Â Crypto exchanges both cex and dex are playing a vital role in the promotion and mass adaption of crypto, which I know they are doing for the sake of profit-making but at the same time, they are bringing more people into the crypto world.",

The existence of Bitcoin depends mainly on its network, its hashrates, full nodes. They are core factors for the survival and existence of Bitcoin. Exchanges are only one of ways people use their Bitcoin, for trading, for profit taking, for gambling with leverage and future trading.Fortunately, you should know Bitcoin has so many use cases and we can use it at merchants, stores that accept Bitcoin. We don't must bind to use exchanges that are not unique places to use our bitcoins.Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash and we can trade it peer-to-peer, not have to rely on exchanges. You can use Bitcoin to buy pizza, cake, honey pot, etc. and you can use it to bet on casinos too. A lot more use cases for Bitcoin like donation, charity and more. It its network is running, you can use your Bitcoin.I agree that exchanges give trading volume and the higher trading volume is, the more comfortable people feel and be ready to join the party.",

Exchanges are for trading, not for long-term storage, which has been proven many times so far, especially in the case of Mt.Gox or Quadriga. The former are still waiting for partial compensation, and in the case of Mr. Cotten's story says that he literally spent a good part of the funds on bad investments, and part of it allegedly went to the grave with him.The whole idea around Bitcoin is decentralization, and the fact that the largest CEXs have millions of Bitcoins in their possession is not something we should look forward to.",

The majority of Bitcoin transactions currently are executed through centralized exchange platforms. They make Bitcoin transactions so organized and attractive that people prefer to use them. They sometimes make trade or exchange transactions very easy and they can easily be used for business transactions. Regardless of the disadvantages of these exchanges, there are some persons that would always prefer their services to decentralized platforms. These platforms spend millions of dollars on advertisement and promotion of cryptocurrencies. Most P2P providers don't have the kind of money these exchange firms have, hence they are not able to promote Bitcoin extensively. Some of these exchanges also lobby governments of nations to pave way for Bitcoin acceptance and operations. Therefore, it would not be wrong to state that these exchanges are really key players in facilitating the popularity of Bitcoin. Although exchanges might not be the ideal means of engaging in Bitcoin operations they are also spreading the good news about Bitcoin",

Some services are centralized, some aren't. Some are companies that actually store your coins, others just make the wallets or build a platform, but you are the real holder of the funds. I am not a decentralization maximalist. If a service is good, it has high reputation, and it is very useful, I don't mind that it's centralized. Even if there's a way to stay fully anonymous and use a decentralized service, but it's much easier to just use a centralized one and give some of the privacy away, I'd go for the centralized one. In the end, I think that a variety of services should exist, so that people can choose and decide for themselves.",

Yes, exchanges are a very important factor for adopters to have access to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Without them, most people couldn't invest in bitcoin, because they don't have other adopters around them to trade person to person. Exchanges also guarantee a protection for investors when dealing with crypto, as by operating at a legit platform you won't be scammed when selling or buying crypto. The history of your negotiations is stored there and you have access to real time market prices. On the other hand, when you trade person to person with strangers you are under risk of not receiving your money or being exploited by them, that is, when they don't pay the fair price for your coins or don't respect the real time quotation of bitcoin price.

One way or another everyone has an option of how securely they want to buy their Bitcoin. We have the people who want an easy user experience so they go for exchanges. That makes sense and is one of the cheapest alternatives (unless you plan on withdrawing to a different wallet in which case you will pay a small fee). But you still trusted a third party to hold your money for you.People who distrust those third parties (as they should) can buy Bitcoin without having to go to an exchange. P2P and cash are always options.But like 99% of people don't seem to care about that, even though they support a decentralized concept like Bitcoin.",
