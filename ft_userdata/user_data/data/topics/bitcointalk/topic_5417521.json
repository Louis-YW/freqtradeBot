But this wait might take some time, and Putin might have to do a bit more destruction in Ukraine before the Ukraine military and government fall.The point? Where are you going to build? Certainly not in Ukraine until after the war is over. Or are you nuts?",

      "body": "My dear friend Serhiy, you are welcome to the forum because I can see that this is your first post. It is quite unfortunate that you have to go through a lot of pain and hardship due to this war. My prayer is that very soon there would be a peaceful resolution to this crisis that has devastated many families.When you a new in an organization, it is important you spend some time learning the norms that exist there. This forum has rules and regulations that guide it so as to avoid lawlessness. And you just broke one of the rules. Begging is not allowed here. But it is also important to note that members in this forum support charity but it must be done through the right channels.How am I sure that you are Ukrainian? You might be a scammer that wants to use Ukraine as a means of getting money from members. Sorry if I am blunt but that's the truth. Scammers have used conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Palestine, etc to deceive people and collect donations. The only way people can donate funds is if they trust you and trust is not built in one day. The truth is nobody would believe your story here because they don't trust you.There is a part of the forum called beginners and help, I suggest you go to that section and learn more about the forum.",

The Embassy will assist in organizing the evacuation of people in need,” one Chinese diplomat wrote on Twitter over the weekend.Last week, Russia launched a two-day campaign of air and missile strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine after an attack heavily damaged a vital bridge — Europe’s longest — connecting the Russian mainland with Crimea, which President Vladimir Putin ‘annexed’ in 2014 without firing a shot.Experts believe that the Chinese may have knowledge of Russian plans and as such, Beijing is making an effort to get its citizens out of harm’s way quickly ahead of new attacks.The Chinese foreign ministry and embassy warned of the “grave security situation” and ordered an immediate departure, going on to cite the need “to enhance safety precautions and evacuate.” The statement indicated that “the embassy will assist in organizing the evacuation of people in need.” Russian state sources also on Sunday began publicizing the new alert notification.China state media Global Times writes: “Some Chinese nationals still in Ukraine have signed up for evacuation from the country, with most registering for organized evacuations, while others are preparing to leave Ukraine on their own, the Global Times learned on Sunday, after the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged Chinese citizens to leave Ukraine, citing the grave security situation.”...",

Everything will be restored to you if you only believe in God. And also it is not only you that has lost properties but others as well. By the way have you dropped such message or write up in Ukraine thread in the forum to discuss with your brothers before coming to the public. Though I dont know how things like this are done in the forum but the way I looked at it, it is not right like this. Nobody hate you here but we have to be careful of things in the forum because we don't know who is behind the name (user) whether a scammer preaching the gospel of Ukraine war to scam users in the forum. In these days they come with different approach to scam people. I will still recommend you to meet your brothers and sisters in the forum to discuss about it. I am sorry for my words. But just an advice. Remember and we all know that the war is not yet over so if you are giving the donation where will you build the house?",

You should first understand one thing; Absolutely no one would trust you using your words alone as you’re practically unknown on here. No one would hate you for writing this here, they mostly wouldn’t believe you. I know I don’t.",

Posting your first post in this forum demanding financial help is a big foul for me because you are yet to be identified or recognized in this forum as a trusted member. If the forum members decide to render help to you today, someone else may also claim to be a Ukrainian citizen tomorrow just to ask us for financial help. By then, this forum will turn out to be where Ukrainians solicit financial help",
