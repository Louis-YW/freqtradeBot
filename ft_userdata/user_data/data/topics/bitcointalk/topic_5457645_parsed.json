When crypto start wey na crypto be our problem. The major problem na unemployment and high fuel price with instable light. If steady light dey,this go follow lessen poverty because we no need fuel to on gen again and poor man go fit start up small business with light.Tinubu must always talk good things so that make people believe am say na him the the right president for the people and make you no also forget say when the president dey for public he go select him words talk so that make people no use h speech against am. Make we hope say Tinubu go carry everybody along and not only him cartel men just like the way other past leaders dey do am.",

I no think say you understand wetin I talk for my post maybe in a haste you rush glance through then reply, but if you observe closely you go see say once person don put (and) for em statement eh mean say na two things eh dey talk about, one for our presido to lift the crypto currency ban and two to and make our economy stable.However in as much as you no understand, the lift on Cryptocurrency ban get a big role to play in helping our Nigerian economy.1 eh go create employment 2 since our money no dey affect the price of bitcoin eh go fit help to reduce the rapid growth of inflation if we adopt am. 3 eh go serve as another means of saving and investment for citizens.4 eh go create jobs for some citizens whereas reducing theft.5 eh go serve as a faster means of transaction for the 막usiness sector6 eh dey safe and trustworthy so schools, banks, hospitals, church and other sectors go adopt I'm as another means payment.These na all the ways and many more wey the lift on cryptoban fit help our economy grow.먝Yes our presido fit get other agenda wey em wan look into but that na my own suggestion and I for like make eh look into that on the long run as well. All of us know say eh no fit tackle everything at once so we go keep our fingers crossed and hope say eh go do the right thing to make our country better.abi you no go happy if eh remove the cryptocurrency ban?",

Na so so bribery just full there. Wetin you been dey expect obviously, him go wan promote peace because na the only way wey him go fit enjoy him government. For me tinubu reign dey alright sha so far just dat subsidy wey still dey worry but I believe e go dey resolved soonest. Make tinubu forget all this waka waka make him no turn to Buhari. Wetin concern is with people wey dun japa, na we here know as the thing dey do us so if him wan address make him call a town hall (different, sorry I just gas talk am) but joke apart make him call use for town hall address us no be people wey dey France. Tinubu just dey sign sign bills (e no bad) but make him begin address Nigerians on wetin him go do to help this subsidy matter because na that one people dey see the impact not the other bills dem wey him dey sign.

I believe we aren't in an autocratic (autocracy) leadership.Prayers has gone a long way but the ability for us to activate our prayers lays in our hands also, let say \"God bless me, God bless me\" how do you want God to blessed you without you having a Job at hand to work. Note that God blesses man through the works of thy hands, so it's to us that has been praying for our country to change. God already answered our prayers by providing PVC for us but the ability for us to make a better use of our PVC is when our prayers would be activated.",

I believe say na only the generals and people from the North fit stop am, but unfortunately, dem dey fight among themselves pass before. Tinubu dey do anything e like, even when e dey against the law, nobody fit touch am, even if police dey.",

President Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu not get shaking as e tell nigerians say e remained the commando for Naija, and nobody fit do anything about am. We just de observed how e government de rule, e b like say things go better for the country. Afterall make we never jump into conclusions yet, e tenure never reach anywhere, make we continue to de observe. Wahala full for the country currently, like the massive increase for fuel as the presido remove fuel subsidy, nigerians de complain bitterly, especially the common man, to see food chop na problem no to talk of to buy fuel.",

Most of him own policies have been no dey welcomed by we country people yet e been still no dey favourable for us - the cost of living tripled, unemployment rate always dey high and minimum wage stable. For all these new policies and removed subsidies, Any idea where Tinubu government go funnel all the money meant for these things? My only prayer be say make this government improve the country rather than take it to a new low compared to Buhari. For now, those policies never yield any outcome but e still dey early.",
