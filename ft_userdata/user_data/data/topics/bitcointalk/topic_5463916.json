I have been wondering as a newbie with little knowledge on bitcoin that how is it possible for everyone in the world to own some fraction of bitcoin with the limited number just like the way everyone is using fiat.  Is it that these 21million bitcoin will be enought to serve the world with a total population of 8.1 billion because I know that we have whales who will buy a huge amount of bitcoin and just store it in their wallet without using it,just the way the rich men and politicians keep so much funds in their account or at home without spending it. I also notice that one country can't print the currency that the whole world is using but various countries printed their own currency. Another thing that I noticed so many investors prefer to holdli their bitcoin which might make it not sufficient for everyone.My question is that is it possible for everyone to have bitcoin with the number of limited supply of bitcoin ?",

      "body": "There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, it doesn't mean that everyone in the world cannot have bitcoin though. That's because bitcoin can be divided into smaller units. Each bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal places & the smallest unit is called a satoshi which is equivalent to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.With this divisibility even if there are only 21 million bitcoins the total number of sats is extremely high allowing for widespread adoption and use. In theory everyone in the world can own and use bitcoin as the supply can be divided to accommodate the needs of users.You can obviously buy fractions of a bitcoin so you don't necessarily need to own a whole bitcoin to participate in the bitcoin economy.",

Still there is time for others to get their hand on some amount of Satoshi but I don't think that it would be sufficient enough for everyone in this world to have Bitcoin. Another important factor is that a major portion of the earth population can't afford a days meal. How can the afford to buy a few Satoshi? If you do donate them they would sell it for fiat to buy food. Things are not that easy in the world we live in and therefore such topics look irrelevant for discussion.",

Another thing that I noticed so many investors prefer to holdli their bitcoin which might make it not sufficient for everyone.My question is that is it possible for everyone to have bitcoin with the number of limited supply of bitcoin ? I think it's possible since you could own a small portion of BTC which means you're already owned a BTC. I'm not sure if it's called mBTC where it's something like 0.001 BTC. And to clarify something even if we have a 8.1 billion number of the population, there's still a lot of people who doesn't know or aware on BTC existence so for sure there would always be open a slot to anyone's wanting to own BTC. You don't need to think of the supply with the number of people especially if they doesn't have any idea about it. Even some other people who've heard about Bitcoin but they don't give a sht since they think it's a scam which is pretty normal, and even studying Bitcoin once they realized it's too complicated for them they would just give up on understanding on it. In short, there's a lot of people aren't owning BTC but of course they free to enter the market whenever they want since it's decentralized.",

If in the future bitcoin is worth as high as 10 million dollars per bitcoin then owning it is impossible for many people, many people will not be able to get it.

The amount is very limited, there are 21 million bitcoins in circulation, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin doesn't go to certain people who want to own it. Even though rich people, popes and government officials store Bitcoin in large quantities, it will not stop the supply of Bitcoin in the market.

Everyone in the world don't have internet connection and knowledge about internet and digital technologies.Even some of country don't have electricity in all area and it's a must to use Bitcoin also internet connection. Everyone will not be interested to use or to like Bitcoin and no one can force them.Even some will not like to have Bitcoin because of its higher transection fees and some dislike it because of its volatile nature but it's a properties of Bitcoin.

Even though crypto itself has nothing to do with any belief, so anyone can use it and I think you are also starting to understand crypto because you don't think crypto is haram.I don't think that's a very logical reason because over time crypto and Bitcoin users continue to increase in different parts of the world so you might also discover more about crypto and Bitcoin over time. You can also find out about this yourself through some very concrete news so that there is more mature enlightenment about crypto because parents who are not familiar with crypto and Bitcoin will not find it easier to believe because they also don't know how to use it.",
