  "content": "I didn't know Alphabay, it was a bitcointalker from the local French forum who mentioned it. Given the fate of Ross Ulbricht (imprisoned then recently released against all odds) and Alexandre Cazes (dead at 26), whose businesses lasted around 2 and a half years each before the final downfall, I wondered why they didn't stop sooner, when they were already very rich. What motivates these people, who have become criminals, to continue their business when in the end they live in extreme danger? Initially, they were not particularly disadvantaged (which sometimes could explain the choice of a criminal path) and, unless I'm mistaken, they are quite intelligent and could have embarked on a successful career. Here are a few hypotheses : 1. Ideology and Libertarian Vision (for Silk Road)Ross Ulbricht (Silk Road) was not just a criminal looking for money (I just saw a documentary and some witnesses, including his girlfriend at the time, say that one of his objectives was clearly to make as much money as possible). He saw his site as a libertarian revolution, a way to bypass government control and enable free and anonymous trade.He believed in crypto-anarchism, where Bitcoin would eliminate banks and regulations.He kept going despite the risks, thinking of himself as a pioneer of a world without government surveillance.2. Addiction to Power and ControlAt a certain point, it was no longer just about money but power. Running a darknet empire provided an immense psychological thrill and a sense of being untouchable.Criminals like Ulbricht and Cazes must have tought they were too smart to get caught.3. The Illusion of InvincibilityAs their sites grew, they believed they had perfected their anonymity and security. Ross Ulbricht thought that his use of Tor and Bitcoin made him impossible to track.Alexandre Cazes was living a luxurious life in Thailand, convinced that law enforcement would never catch him.4. Greed and the Difficulty of StoppingEven though Ulbricht was motivated by ideology, he was earning millions of dollars in commissions. Cazes, on the other hand, was clearly money-driven, owning luxury cars, villas, and millions in crypto.When running an illegal platform generating millions per month, it’s hard to say, “I’ll just stop and walk away.”5. Business Pressure and User DependenceOnce their sites were running, shutting down meant losing all control and risking leaks of information. Darknet vendors and buyers depended on them and expected reliable service.A site like AlphaBay or Silk Road couldn’t be sold like a traditional business, so the only way out… was often getting arrested.It would seem that money isn't everything, and that even the richest criminals keep on doing what they're doing until they're caught or killed.They seem to love power and adrenalin; for some, fear is part of everyday life and not a problem.I think it's a risky life that's hard for parents to accept (when you're not a criminal yourself).",

      "body": "People who have experienced both wealth and power can never afford to lose them anymore. So even if they accumulated a lot of wealth already, living in such luxurious life, their greed towards bigger wealth in the future is still there. So why not stop when they have all the chances and opportunities to keep it going? With money, power can be bought, which means if they got more money, the more powerful they will be. I think that’s how greedy a man is, they won’t stop chasing for more wealth and power, until someone will put an end to it.",

IMO he never had a plan, never thought it would blow up the way it did. He thought it would be a small operation and when millions kept coming he never knew what to do with that money, like many bitcoin investors when they got big bucks for the first time in their lives. They either kept holding, or would buy stupid things like very expensive cars.

I am not sure why Ross was released by Trump and I am sure there's a big reason in the background which we are not aware of. Wanting to gain more is provably the reason why those operation didn't stop since as long they can get big money for those sites they are running then expect that operation would continue especially if government pay less attention on what they are doing.Also yeah they are detained for right reason, but guess they are looking at the sentence length which is provably to much that's why Trump release him when he think he already serve his sentence also think about he's not a big threat to the community.Quote from: avikz on February 11, 2025, 04:52:03 PMI am not sure why Ross was released by Trump and I am sure there's a big reason in the background which we are not aware of.
