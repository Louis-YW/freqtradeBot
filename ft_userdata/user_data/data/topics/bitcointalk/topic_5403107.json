  "content": "The bearish crypto market that is dominating again has brought Bitcoin price predictions to fall to US$13,000. However, this could still fail even if the odds were low.Veteran analyst and senior trader, Peter Brandt, has accurately predicted a drop in the price of Ether (ETH), to US$1,200, when the price was still around US$1,800.Of course, this led his Twitter followers to glance at his predictions on the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which he sees has the potential to fall even deeper, to $13,000.Bitcoin Price Could Touch US$13,000?The crypto market has increasingly languished since the US central bank, the Fed, took aggressive policies in raising interest rates, quantitative tightening, and releasing assets such as bonds. This has further exacerbated the bearish flows created since November 2021 in the crypto market, whose relationship has grown stronger with the stock market as risk appetite has waned.Investors are increasingly frightened by the prospect of inflation, even hyper-inflation, which sends a lot of money into the US dollar. The index of the US currency also shot to a 20-year high due to the Fed's aggressive steps.In the midst of the sluggish crypto market, Peter Brandt, who is one of the most popular analysts on Twitter, has a new view on the price of Bitcoin.According to his technical analysis, the price of this major cryptocurrency could fall to US$13,000, but there is still a chance it won't happen, even if the chances are slim.I don't mean anything, I just wanted to ask all of you.What do you think about this news?   Source : https://blockchainmedia.id/harga-bitcoin-bisa-gagal-menjadi-us13-ribu-ini-syaratnya/",

      "body": "I recognized a while back we might get a push into 2019 prices with enough negative sentiment but its tricky to say for how long and with what volume and significance those prices would appear.   Its due to a confluence of factors such as FED tightening and the natural reflux from the 2020 exceptional measures, my personal take is this alignment will not last and we do not see a return to great currency strength witnessed in prior decades as we have progressed far beyond that situation & debt remains liable on short terms with that weight greater then any other factor determining currency as a denominator vs market values.   This is just a guess but Dollar Index appears to retract is how I view this chart below, if it should develop downwards and fail to move up further that would help confirm this moment as peak bearish pressure or peak Dollar strength.   Speculation is supporting the FED idea of raising rates but ultimately this possibility is capped, I have no doubt the ability to finance debt at higher rates does not exist.  However the mirage appears real and people are fearful hence we sell off, combined with war and many supply disruptions we are seeing market prices negative and volatility rising on trend.  BTC itself is not especially altered but DXY has not been this high in the entirety of the blockchain transacting hence its a real test of perseverance.",

But now with support breaking and with the economic situation we are in, it is even more difficult.We are at a point where many of those who said: 'if bitcoin goes down to 20,000 USD I will buy a lot' have had second thoughts and are not buying because they doubt how far it can go down. One thing that has been seen in this market is that there was a lot of leverage that has been liquidated in cascade downwards. This in turn causes panic and more liquidations. For the sake of all of us who have some bitcoin, I hope the bottom is near but it doesn't look like it.",

Most often, these questions bother beginners, apparently because they have a slight (or not so) panic from what is happening, but the old users remain calm and don't lose their minds and composure, judging by their comments.Why not? I don't rule out reaching 13k $ price for bitcoin. Crypto community has repeatedly seen similar falls and old users are not emotional about this, because this has already become a pattern for this industry.What do I think of this news? I think 13k $ would be a great opportunity to accumulate cheap bitcoin. Focus on positive opportunities, not negative thoughts.",

I mean back in the day when bitcoin was not so much known, the drops where very hard and recovery was very difficult as well, we needed so many people to push together to make it go up. Nowadays, from millions of people to companies and hedge funds and famous people pushing billions of dollars into crypto, all of that happens together and that is why it is easier.I really hope that we could make it work eventually, and we recover but I will not be really shocked when that happens, it is going to be quite easy and wonderful to see. I am not saying that it will happen tomorrow, but with how many people and money involved, it will happen eventually.",

This is indeed a waiting game but sure that DXY will correct below 100 level which is the time for Bitcoin to print again another bullish cycle. I didn't expect this will happened this quarter of the year so I’m expecting to see DXY to pump more because it already broke the 103 resistance that established since 2017.
