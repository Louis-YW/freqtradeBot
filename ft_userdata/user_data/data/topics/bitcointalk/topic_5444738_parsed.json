Electrum will never use it instead they manually design their own website to avoid breaches.Code:Web Framework Laravel Programming Language PHP CDN Cloudflare Social MediaNetwork Profile UrlTwitter ElectrumWallet https://twitter.com/ElectrumWalletAnother you can notice on their site is that the email they don't use their own domains. So it's a 100% phishing scam site be careful there are many of them.And I suggest since it's fake/phishing site I suggest report them here below - https://www.hostinger.com/report-abusehttps://www.hostinger.com/report-abuse",

Please confirm that this is fake ? Not just the site, the lawyer is also a fake.Electrum and Bitcoin don't work like a bank, stolen funds can't be recovered by an authority nor the developers of Electrum or even Bitcoin Core.If you're scammed, chances that it's the same scammer who's trying to get more out of you.",
