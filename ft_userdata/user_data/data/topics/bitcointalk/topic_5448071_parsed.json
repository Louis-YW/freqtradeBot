      "body": "That is a pretty graph you got there.  I do not think it is useful as a gambling strategy for most of people who wish to try it, because the management of funds one's need to have in order to continue to increase the wager and compensate the previous losses. For the regular gambler who have a limited gambling budget, it could mean to get drained before seeing a change to profit or  break even at the end of the session. This is something we have discussed before around here, by the way. It is better for those who have much money to spare to try it.",

You are literally forced to play at higher amount each time...Plus, if you count a win that help to \"recover\" a loss, at the end you have achieved ... the same amount you have spent! So if you are really lucky you can win your unit (first step of martingale). If you're unlucky... you can loss a much much more of the first unit you were playing.Use some calculators and then you realize how big is the risk/ratio for this betting strategy.",

Because over the long term you will lose enough times in a row and lose all your capital.",

How do you feel about it?     My little experience sometimes comes with a good result) but more often the result is negative I remember a day I was using martingale strategy why playing roulette on an online casino. Normally I used to play like three times and anytime I win before the three times play, I just take my money. If I have enough money, I can make good calculations and go five times. Anytime I win, I do not bet again. But there was a day that I lost during the five rounds, I have no option than to just quite gambling that day. It was an unusual day for me. But normally martingale strategy is working for me. I am not an addict and I only gamble just like 2 days weekly which is also helping me because the more someone is gambling the likely the person can lose. I am gambling less often and the strategies I am using is helping, especially the martingale strategy.But while using it, you still have to be careful, because if you lose at the later round of the bet, the loss is very huge.",

But you have a beautiful graph which is it works for you, martingale strategy is also based on luck, if you don't have this luck you will not survive in a long term, besides, the martingale strategy needs more funds to recover your loss. One advantage of the martingale strategy is that it can help you recoup your losses quickly IF you experience a winning streak and still you have funds to beat the house edge. You can keep folding bet your losses to recoup your losses and of course, it need more capital to do that.",

It may not work also if you are using too much money to gamble.If you use the strategy, it should be in a way that you win and leave. If you first lose, you use the money that is enough to win the second after losing the first and win much more than the money lost at first and so on until the amount of money that you can use for that period of time has been exhausted, and you should not gamble again. But before the money is used up, you should have won at one time which is enough to cover the loss at once and quit for that time.But just that many people do use the strategy very well but using it wrongly, or they continue to gamble after falling to win.",

      "body": "Martingale strategy is often a failed strategy but there are some people who are successful in using it.  I think this kind of strategy is dependent on how a player can be able to determine when to reset his bet within the number of losing streak, or when a player decides to stop his gambling session in order to bag the winnings brought by the martingale strategy.I believe Martingale is good for a short session but devastating if a player is into a long session gameplay because the longer the player plays the longer the losing streak that may appear.  This long losing streak may drain the bankroll even before the winning roll pops up.  So in the end, martingale often makes the player's bankroll depleted faster.",

You can do it for fun and that's leave it there but do not expect that you'll be making thousands on this or even a hundred. The risk is high and if you're a rich person, you can do this strategy and see how high you may go until you run out of funds and kept on trying your luck using martingale. If you just happen to see the strategy OP recently and as you've tried it and still thinking that the result can be reversed based on the results that you've got, don't think about it. Do it for fun and you'll never be bothered, only if you have a lot of spare money doing this.",

Yes, many topics already created about Martingale and you can read most of the comments about being not good at all, its too risky and too greedy better to gamble small and make your time more worth it while playing. Luck will still be the basis of your gambling winnings because if this strategy works, then casinos will surely lose a lot of money,",
