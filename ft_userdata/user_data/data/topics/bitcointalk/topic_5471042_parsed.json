In the end, what the Winkelvoss have is greed, because with the amount of Bitcoins they have from the early years, they could have dedicated themselves to other projects that were not based on shitcoins to make money. The FTX exchange and its leaders have big problems, but it will be very difficult to prove this. This is a business and there are risks in it.QuoteThese kinds of crypto services were pitched as a “better form of savings account to replace your bank,” says Cory Klippsten, CEO of bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin. “Whether you use that language or not, that’s how people understood these platforms.” But the Earn program, the New York attorney general alleges, was far more risky than the marketing let on. The complaint states that Gemini was aware from the program’s inception that loans handed out by Genesis were high-risk and concentrated among a small number of third parties—specifically Alameda Research, FTX’s sibling company, which at one point constituted 60 percent of the Genesis loan book. If any of Genesis’ large creditors were to default on their debt, Gemini customers stood to lose the funds they had invested.I'm very low on the prospect of such trials, but it will be very interesting to watch because the evidence has not yet been published. Such a conspiracy is very difficult to prove in court.",

I am sure that the Gemini management understood what clowns were running the FTX exchange and Alameda, but nevertheless gave them money.The New York attorney general has the role of protecting the interest of these investors, filling this suit against Gemini and Genesis is lawful. Customers were informed that thier investment was safe and secure and nobody told them about the risk their funds were exposed to. I am sure many people wouldn't have invested if they knew how Gemini intends to use the funds to make a profit. It is annoying to see how people's hard-earned money is being mismanagement by greedy people who lack financial intelligence. An analysis of the operation of Genesis will expose you to careless and uncollateralized lending that led to its financial woes. The worst part of it was that they were concealing the losses from customers. Maybe they wanted to come up with a shitcoin that will be used to pay these greedy clients. I call them greedy people because 8% interest looks suspicious.",
