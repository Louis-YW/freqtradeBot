You want to do a job but you have no skill and you want to learn Job skill.It will be very hard to find an online job where you can earn almost 5 to 10$ without any skill. With skill and experience, you can for sure earn this amount through freelancing but no one will hire you without skill in an online job.How about finding some odds jobs in your local area and with the amount you earn, try to invest some in learning skills. Keep in mind that earning money requires hard work whether it is online earning or offline earning.",

One of the ways to make money here is by joining a signature campaign, which doesn't require specific skills; you just have to be active and participate. However, it does require merits, and your account needs to be active. I suggest trying to be more active and helpful to earn merits.While there are other ways to earn money outside the forum, as others have suggested, unfortunately, you don't have a skill yet, and learning might take some time before you can find a suitable job. Additionally, competition should be considered, as the online world is continually expanding.Therefore, be sure to evaluate things properly so you won't end up wasting time. Be resourceful and look for suggestions that you love and can practically do.",

If there is no money to learn a skill, then you can just get yourself any small job that doesn't really require a trained profession, work there, and save up some money, after which you can learn a skill. But if you have a laptop, like @hugeblack has said, there are some online courses you can take that will help you get some jobs online. Through some online courses, you can learn programming and how to develop some Android applications. There's this saying that \"we spend money, energy, and time to make money.\"You can earn as a content creator on YouTube or perhaps create a site and make some interesting content, but all that requires skill and patience before you can start monetizing your channel or site. Some people monetize their Facebook page, Twitter page, telegram channel, Instagram page and TikTok  but it all requires skill and patience to do that.If you also stay on the forum and establish yourself and gain a higher rank, then you might stand a chance to earn even more than $20 in some signature campaigns.",

I don't believe there is anyone who could be considered grown up that exist without a skill, because theire must definietly be something which the person will know how to do very well, and when they get their hands on those things their hand work will be complemented and appreciated. To me, all forms of farming are skills; providing that the person knows what they are doing on that field, they are skilled farmers; likewise, every other thing that could be done within one's reach is a skill, so saying you don't have a skill looks like condeming yourself in the eyes of others. Instead, you can possibly say that you don't have a skill that could fit in the digital world. Getting yourself a job that could pay you that amount might be a little hard for you considering the fact that you might not be digitally inclined to compete with your fellow job seekers, as most of them might require some level of knowledge and extra skill in some specified field. If you can read and understand English, you can fit in some online jobs like community moderator for upcoming projects, community manager, and all of that, as most new crypto projects out there are usually in search of people to help them control their social media community, and they are being paid weekly. The project will have to educate you about how the project operates so that you can be able to answer the questions that might come from new investors and community members. I can't get any links for that right now, but such a job fits in your description.",
