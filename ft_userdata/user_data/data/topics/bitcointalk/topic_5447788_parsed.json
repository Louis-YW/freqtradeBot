It is easier to attack crypto users through porn sites. But it seems that this new malware is more dangerous than previous ones. It can obtain your two-factor authentication by tricking you, so be careful, guys.It has been suggested for a long time not to store your crypto in an exchange. Instead, use a non-custodial wallet or a hardware wallet so that malware won't damage you when you are using a hardware wallet. Even a non-custodial software wallet isn't safe from malware if both are on the same device.",

If it is the secret code, that means the advice that you should use another device for 2FA is always valid, yes it is valid, but it is good to avoid malware generally.Quote from: The Cryptovator on April 06, 2023, 11:29:35 AMHowever, we know that malware is quite dangerous for crypto users, mainly because they tend to visit various sites such as gambling and porn. It is easier to attack crypto users through porn sites. But it seems that this new malware is more dangerous than previous ones. It can obtain your two-factor authentication by tricking you, so be careful, guys.I do not think is it visiting of gambling and porn sites that actually cause that, it is the visit of illicit gambling and porn sites that google and other search engines can popup, or that you saw through ads and link ads. Also in anything we visit, we should always avoid malware. Just commenting because in every aspect of life, there are legit sites, be it gambling, exchanges and the likes.Quote from: The Cryptovator on April 06, 2023, 11:29:35 AMIt has been suggested for a long time not to store your crypto in an exchange.

Even a non-custodial software wallet isn't safe from malware if both are on the same device.Noncustodial wallet can be online, they are also not safe against malware. Also people that uses hardware wallet should still be very careful of malware. Also people that are even using a means of having cold storage wallet like paper wallet and wallet on an airgapped device should be very careful.Another source of malware are downloading of torrent files.",

That is, there are other malwares with similar capabilities as the Rilide  virus and they are for sale as web browser extensions. From the article the malware is designed to attack Chromium-based web browsers like Google Chrome,Opera, Brave, Vivaldi,Yandex Browser therefore folks who use non-Chromium-based web browsers like - Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Tor Browser, SeaMonkey, Pale Moon, Midori, Konqueror are off the hook on this one but must remain vigilant against phishing attacks and stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and safety practices some of which have been mentioned by Upgrade00.",

      "body": "So to sum it up., in order to avoid such malware, you would have to completely avoid using Google or any Chromium-based browser and instead use Firefox as well as becoming a minimalist with regards to installing extensions, except for uBlock Origin, of course. Not only that, to achieve optimal security with such malwares, it would be beneficial for people to have a separate computer or laptop used solely for crypto purposes. I have my old laptop with Linux Mint installed, and it only contains the necessary applications for doing Bitcoin transactions - nothing else.Furthermore, upon researching, it appears that the malware disables the Content Security Policy (CSP), which makes the system vulnerable to attacks.Quote from: https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/rilide-a-new-malicious-browser-extension-for-stealing-cryptocurrencies/Rilide’s background script attaches a listener to the tabs.onActivated and webRequest.onHeadersReceived events and removes the Content Security Policy (CSP) directive for all requests. This allows the extension to perform an XSS attack and load external resources that would otherwise be blocked by the CSP. The app script adds another listener to the DOMContentLoaded event and retrieves a list of targeted domains from the C2. If the current domain matches any of the listed targets, designated scripts are injected into the webpage.Now If you're too paranoid about automatic withdrawals on crypto exchanges, we can add another security layer by \"whitelisting\" an address so that he exchange will only allow withdrawals to previously whitelisted addresses.These are the only measure I could think to prevent something bad from happening, or else you'd become a crybaby losing your hard-earned money.",

Also, not downloading random apps or files that may contain malware and using an ad blocker can also help protect our devices from online virus and malware threats.As a crypto user, it is very important to take strong security measures to protect our crypto holdings. Keeping our crypto deposits off exchanges and permanently offline is one of the best ways to protect our crypto from hacks and other cyber attacks. Additionally, using a secure wallet and taking additional security measures such as using 2FA can also help protect our crypto from security threats.",

For example, if you copy an address to send your entire Bitcoin to and the malware virus changes the address and you don't notice it, your entire Bitcoin is gone.It is always a good idea to double-check any address to which you are sending Bitcoin because malware can change it and replace it with another with nearly the same beginning and end of the address.",

And even they're familiar with what they're downloading, they need to look at it first and see if it's from the official service and company that they want to download. I guess the most common thing on this imitation will be from Metamask users.
