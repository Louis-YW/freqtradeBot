Can anyone assist to tell me the best reliable bitcoin exchange, that can grant loan with reasonable interest rate?First don't do this because it is superb risky.To have loan on centralized exchanges, you must deposit your cryptocurrency, send it to your either Isolated or Cross Margin account, then use your cryptocurrency as a collateral for your loan. When your position becomes bad especially in market crash, your position will be in temporary loss that is bad enough plus with decrease of your collateral value, then exchange will liquidate your collateral.When forced liquidations happen, you will lose very big part of your account.",

Who knows if and when they will get it back. The yield also wasn’t that high to begin with.You get more if you lend out stablecoins. However like I said before, the risk isn’t worth it if your USDT is sent to some market maker who takes risky bets with it and ends up losing it all. Everyone withdraws and the scam is up. Avoid lending your coins if you can.",

In fact, most services are scams and their goal is just to collect your money. As mentioned above, a ton of legit businesses went bankrupt so it is unlikely that any legitimate service would risk themselves doing that. If anything, you'll probably find better luck to get a loan from your bank although the risk is so high it is not worth doing at all. Just do DCA and be patient, you'll eventually collect enough Bitcoin if long-term investment is your goal.",

I know there are lending platforms or exchange but I don't know if bitcoin is included in the lending. However, why invest with a coin that is not yours and you will have to pay about 15% in Annual Percentage Yields. That means the interest you will pay is taking away your profit, so what about if there was no profit or you end up losing the whole investment, you lose your collateral. It is not a wise decision to borrow to invest because you will be under pressure and invest wrongly.",

So if you are seeing only the positives then let me remind the negatives of leveraged trading too which is you can loss money that you actually don't have which puts you into a situation of taking more loans to pay the debt.Binance the biggest exchange offers that feature which is Spot trading margin up to 20x and Derivatives trading margin up to 20x so like on other exchanges the values will be different.8 Best Crypto Margin Trading Exchanges Compared (2023)",

No one will give you a loan without any collateral.  But if you have a high rank and a reputable Bitcointalk account, you can take a non collateral loan from this forum, but the repayment period will be very short, up to 3 months.",

When you lose or lose that money, you still have a loan that you have not repaid (if We ignored the interest generated)If he meant leverage, then it is advanced trading, and I do not recommend it for beginners.
