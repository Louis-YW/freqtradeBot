There are so many other things that need more time to tell, Bitcoin is definitely a place of passion for me.Last sendable merits keep your post... Edited.",

Even though we can't be there to celebrate with him and have a taste of the ostensibly delicious cake, he has left us with a wonderful message. Not only us, but other platforms where he must have shared this pictures, such as social media platforms, must have seen the bitcointalk.org, which will make them curious as to why it's been decorated on the cake. These can lead them here, where they may become interested in learning about bitcoin. I hope you have a better memory on the forum this year than last.",

I don't gamble too much since I am a small time gambler but I am glad that I am lucky to be able to win about $200. So, I would say that hope that this 2023 year will be good for you guys too.

After attempting to become a hermit last year, Yahoo's suggestion to conduct routine health checks woke me up. Bless that man for his coming operation. We have all had challenges in life over the past few years, and we pray for a good 2023. This year, I feel more optimistic. I visited a zoo to start the year. Additionally, I will have a general health checkup sooner. This year, I intend to travel and enjoy life more. Wishing us all a rock solid 2023!",

So I pray you get well soon.",

It's my second new year here, and I have learned many things here in these two years. Every moment spend on this forum is worthy since you are increasing your knowledge. It's a new year and everyone hoping to see a good year from bitcoin perspective. There are many speculations about bitcoin price, hopes are high that it will be a good year.",

With OnZen, it's cut-and-dried cheating: they did it more than once, they tried to hide their first attempt, and I interacted with them in the thread, so I have some sense of their intentions. With MamunMKY, things are less clear; maybe they misunderstood the competition or were trying to make a joke, I don't know. I mean, it obviously looks like an attempt at cheating to me, but I can't be certain and I don't want to get into the habit of leaving speculative feedback.",
