Which he will never get. It's the end of the road for him. Also the politicians who were in cahoots with him now look stupid to the general public, so there's collateral damage to be paid for helping a mafia screw over people.",

      "body": "BTC has challenged the conventional monetary system by providing more efficient and secure alternate solutions, This has landed the governments and the banks across the world in a troubled position. They no longer have control over the printing of currency for their lavish expenses and lost the capacity of manipulation in money market. Therefore they are using all the tools available for curtailing the growth of BTC.",

      "body": "The statement \"Don't steal the government hates competition\" implies that the government does not support theft, but that the big mafia bankers have control and manipulate the markets for their benefit. The use of USDT was controversial because it gave these bankers control over the blockchain, allowing them to trade cryptocurrencies without revealing their trades to KYC exchanges. The claim is made that these bankers have an advantage over others because they can print money to support their schemes, making it difficult for others to compete. The stock market is also mentioned as being impacted by similar manipulation and changes in rules and laws.",

If governments become threatened of btc they can work together and do a global ban which would mean that most people would not use it. If this ban stayed in place then btc would never grow and only people who are die hard btc fans will ignore the law and continue using it.",

Since the bitcoin project started many people and governments didn't take it seriously and after that, they started trying to make some competitors in order to attract people's attention to other options. However, alternative coins and stablecoins could never be considered a real competitor for bitcoin after the governments started the CBDCs story to make another competitor to bitcoin. However, this has not been successful and will not be successful since it cannot compete with bitcoin at any point in time.",

Governments could try to clamp down on holders and exchanges, but can do nothing if Mr Bob wanted to transfer some BTC from his non custodian wallet to that of Mr Joe.If you focus on the market value, governments can slow that by making in more difficult t use and driving away the majority of investors, but they can not alter the immutability ov decentralization of the network.",

Manipulating the market and controlling the blockchain are two completely different things.2.You are trying to build a conspiracy theory about stablecoins being created by Bitcoin haters and fiat supporters. I don't like stablecoins, but I don't believe in your theory as well. The stablecoins actually had a role in the bull runs, which happened in the lest few years. Maybe they are a ticking time bomb, maybe they are a scam, or maybe they are created for the convenience of the cryptocurrency traders. 3.There's nothing wrong with competition. Actually, competition is the driving force of capitalism and market economy. I'm not a fan of altcoins, but Bitcoin needs competition in order to be maintained in a good shape.",
