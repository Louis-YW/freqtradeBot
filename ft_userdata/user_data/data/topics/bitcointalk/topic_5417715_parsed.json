      "body": "Hi andulolika hope you're doing well. I think for that kind of items (specific for a country) here in bitcointalk \"general\" collectibles section there is not much interest. Try on Local Spanish board maybe, you can hope there is a collector ....However best option is to sell directly in a exhibition to some collector or try with ebay/del campe. I have not idea about the value of such type of coins... if these are valued more of 500/1000 euro best option is an auction house (cons ---> higher fees and expenses) since they provide guarantee for the product. The \"pro\" is that you will have the opportunity to sell quickly probably at the best rate possible with minimum effort.Of course lets wait other ideas/suggestion",

      "body": "since these are not rare there is not too much interest and it requires some time (weeks/months) before you can sell. for that amount (30/45 euro) most of the times it can be harder find a buyer, because it's more or less the value of metal itself...try on subforum for sure it will be more probability you can sell / try also to \"exchange\" with other items  maybe you can get some crypto collectible!",
