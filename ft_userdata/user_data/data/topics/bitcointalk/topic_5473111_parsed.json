Sorry but you can't have 50% return and safe both.The safest investment of all times which is the s&p500 index only gives you 10% annual returns in the long run and most people fail to beat this. There is nothing wrong with wanting high returns. No but you also want it to be a safe investment and that's simply impossible.You have 2 choices here:1- You can increase your initial amount to $80k and invest in a safe asset. (S&P500 will bring you 10% annually in the long run and that will make $20 per day)2- You can yolo that $8000 on something risky and if you are lucky you can turn it into $80k or $800k or $8.The choice is yours senator.",

I can directly recommend the cloud mining pools but that won't be very rewarding, You can provide the loan service it will also require a lot of effort.In the end, the summary of the story is you cant be able to achieve both safety & passive income on your capital, risk one of them the result can be even better, in the end, you can follow someone like copy trading where you can some how to manage both risk and time. In trading copy trading is the term I hate most haha, but according to the OP's requirement I can say it will be most likely option",

You buy now and hold it until next year it will provide profits but not per day like you want.",

Also think that there is definitely an element of luck to earn which many people don't believe but I think for those who need luck as well.Master several subjects and train very well and then think about earning, then you will see that your income can increase.Finally I would like to say that if you can take help from a good advice and earner then your way will be much easier.",

Just convert to Bitcoin and forget about it until 2025when Bitcoin is likely but not 100% guaranteed to reach a new ATH after the halvingwhich is next year.There isnt going to be anything 100% dead certain anyway.Something we all steer clear of is giving your $8k in Bitcoin or Ethereum to anexchange and they will give you a percentage on it, Coinbase are offering 3.4%on ETH....Remember though - Not your keys, not you coins!",

Yeah, probably what he is trying to look for, pooling is the best way to get a passive earnings but be careful what pool you are getting into coz a lot of it is a ponzi. OP can also try staking using reputable exchanges like Binance which might be the best he could use his $8K and earn on a daily basis. You can also try to advent an external business, a physical one then invest your ever profit to crypto, I think that's a win-win for you.",

The market prices of crypto are volatile in nature which means there will always be times of up and downs. You may do swing trades but you could only win most of the time if you are that good with your analysis but will never be always.  If it is consistency you are seeking then try starting a business but it will not be happening in a single day for sure. There’s no easy way to earn profit in anything and seeking for one will just get you in trouble. If there is, many people should be rich by now to be honest.",

If you really want to earn passive income with your money then stake those at a crypto exchange but I must tell you that stacking is also risky as exchanges can't be trusted fully and they can take your money anytime. If I had such amount to invest then I would definitely go with an active method and would avoid any possible passive methods. I believe that trading is a good thing to begin with as you can earn $10 to $20 per day easily on platforms like Binance. If you aren't good at spot trading then go with p2p trading as people are earning more than $10 to $20 a day with p2p trading on exchanges.",
