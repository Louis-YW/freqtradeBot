  "content": "I sent received .009 from another wallet, then sent .005 of that to blue wallet. It sat there because I chose a low fee, but then I bumped the fee on that transaction. This .004 sitting in the wallet says its unconfirmed and I think that is supposed to be my change. When I bumped the fee, it replaced the transaction which I expected, but this is just sitting there. Under the UTXO screen in Sparrow, it says its spendable but It wont let me send it anywhere and is under the mempool field where the balance shows. It is making my balance wrong. I am 2 days smart when it comes to this wallet. Has anyone seen this or know what to do?I would love to add a few images for reference but it says I have to be at a jr level?",

      "body": "Ok, thats nuts. I got 100% sync yesterday morning and could not connect private electrum server so I connected bitcoin core with onion address. There was a note at the bottom to wait 24hrs after sync. I say that to say, that 5 min after sending the above post, I just checked to see if I could connect and changed my connection and my issue cleared up once it connected to electrum server. Nevermind the above post I guess.",
