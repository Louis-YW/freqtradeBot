  "content": "I just this cute picture illustration of bull markets and bear markets on Twitter.If you take a look, there really is a huge difference between bear markets and bull markets.Bear markets are for building, there are a lot of innovations and projects helping the Bitcoin community especially adoption so that we can spread good words with Bitcoin and everybody can try to use it.About the Crash, which for me is normal for every market, not only on Bitcoin or cryptocurrency market. When a crash, a lot of entities or companies are affected some of them are being rekt during the crash.https://twitter.com/LinaSeiche/status/1545671667237650433/photo/1",

      "body": "Bear markets allow big players to get bigger at lower cost. Why do they want that? To make money. So what do they have to do? Spend some of it on things to make the ecosystem better. BTC / fiat / whatever it really does not change. For the most part big money does not invest and hope they invest and do something to make themselves money. It's just the way it is. Now, is it good for BTC / crypto overall? So long as people keep it going when they leave. Otherwise, you get the crash and the cycle starts over again.-Dave",

I am sure Vitalik likely is not a first person who said about it.After each bear market, Bitcoin has more value - yeah value, not price. Price growth is a consequence of value growth. If we talk about altcoins, in bear market you can find truly potential altcoin projects. It is different than in bull market when people are over hyped with quick-rich stories and forget about fundamentals. Many potential in bull market will die in bear market but potential ones in bear market will more hardly to die. Many of them will become rising stars in next bull run.",

Investors often turn their backs on Bitcoin when it falls, media write articles on how Bitcoin will never recover or how much lower it will go from there, and most adoption news happen, I think, during the bull market. So the bear market is a time when some build up their hodlings, but when new players, IMO, rarely join the game because they're not sure the game isn't over. It feels like there's less FUD during this bear market than there was during the 2018 one, but maybe it's just my personal perception of things.",

To hold in a bear market is the real test of your nerves and not everyone is strong enough to hold the cryptocurrencies when they are on a continuous decline. Those who have seen the 2018-19 bear market, know how painful is the bear season.",

Surviving and building as long as you have spare money will be easy. but some people can't survive and can't even build because they don't have any spare money anymore. Crypto prices are crashing indeed a good opportunity to continue to accumulate crypto, financial management is needed to be able to follow the market.when you don't have spare money to accumulate crypto, the last option is just to hang on and keep going (don't cut losses halfway).",

Only those who can use this time properly can do well in the next bull market. I think Bear market is one of the key to success in crypto space. Here you must survive as well as keep in mind a good time to fill your wallet. Hopefully those who will be able to accept this bear market will be the real crypto investors.",

As far as I'm familiar with Bitcoin as such is an adventurous thing, so if a bear occurs it is likely that a bull will come. It was already like a tradition that was about to happen. This is because the user's trust is still the same and hopefully it will not be lost. This trust is what makes people buy to change the market.
