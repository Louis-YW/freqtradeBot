His main intention for creating this currency was to free everyone from the devaluation of the fiat, from the centralized banks, from the ones who control the money. He did this thing for us without any desire to own all of it for himself. Satoshi is the real king who created a currency that all the people in his kingdom are using for trading of goods and for paying the merchants.He's a true hero who knew that his invention one day would bring a lot of fame, and prosperity in his life, but still he disappeared from the forum and world just to prove that he has no desire for fame and prosperity and his creation isn't bound to the desires of a human. He's truly a stoic who has created this thing and left it away for the world to continue.",

You might not be very appreciative of things by disregarding the pioneers setup in not following the other of things in this forum.Yeah, Satoshi Nakamoto must have fixed alot of things and might have changed the way of finance for humanity but, that's only if we as humans are able to set aside greed like Satoshi did put aside selfish interest and not stay at the apex of bitcoin affairs but left it to the people in a fully decentralized system. It's left to us to keep it alive.",

The thing is that nobody can say about satoshi nakamoto or describe him as well but I believe that support you still in this forum monitoring whatever thing that is happening with another account because since it means or shows that satoshi is no longer into bitcointalk forum, i believe he used to see whatever thing that is happening here with another account",

This is the only person who really had the interests of everyone in mind when he created Bitcoin. Those who were fortunate enough to acquire Bitcoin at the very first stage made good fortune when the price boomed. Bitcoin made some people earn money they had never earned in their lives and gave them the opportunity to become billionaires and millionaires. I really wonder who will not be grateful for that. mostly those that have been benefiting from trading profits, like futures trading.",

As such, he decided to create something that the people could really use to fight back and stand out for themselves, which is really working today. Whoever chooses to be in total control over all his assets will definitely choose Bitcoin.",

What a stupid ass response.  First off, if you think being either a liberal or conservative is a good or bad thing, then you're just falling in line with everyone else who can't think for themselves and use their own brain to decide whats best.  I for the life of me can't understand why everyone doesn't take an independent view of things ..being both part \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" or more so choosing the best of both worlds.  You have NO IDEA if he was liberal or not, and bitcoin is NOT a liberal thing by any means.  It's indifferent.  If anything, conservative views call for less government, which is what bitcoin is geared towards.",

For now, nobody knows Satoshi so we can't tell if he is qualified to be a saint or not. But I will agree that the invention of Bitcoin was a selfless act. The sole intention of giving people freedom over their financial transactions is a worthy cause. Most saints refuse worldly wealth because of the pursuit of a divine agenda or a cause for the benefit of the people especially the downtrodden. Satoshi is unknown so we can't assume his financial strength but his invention has the unique goal of helping people to have unhindered access to financial transactions that are not controlled by the state. This feature of bitcoin has given the masses the uncommon privilege of bypassing the control systems of the government which is orchestrated to put the masses under control and surveillance.",
