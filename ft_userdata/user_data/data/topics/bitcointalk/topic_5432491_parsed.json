  "content": "December 31 Soccer predictionsSo, I would like to leave the last predictions of 2022!England - Premier LeagueBrighton - Arsenal Arsenal is the top dog for this game, however, Brighton plays with the massive support of their fans and has shown quality football. Thus, a well-disputed match is expected, where goal opportunities will appear. In front of such a scenario, I believe the most likely scenario for this match will be for both teams to score at least one goal. Both Teams ScoreWolverhampton - Man Utd I see Manchester United as a favourite for this match, however, the home team should also have its say. It should be noted that the market \"Both teams score\" was a winner in the last five Manchester United away games. In this way, a very busy game is expected with several goals opportunities for both teamsBoth Teams ScoreBournemouth - Crystal PalaceIt is true that Bournemouth can be more confident about playing at home, however, in this round they receive an opponent that provides amazing good football. In addition, both teams have several defensive issues. Having said that, risking in favour of the ''Above 2,5 Goals'' market in this game is a good option.Above 2,5 goalsMan City - EvertonIn addition to Manchester being motivated after the latest results obtained, it still receives a team that has shown serious flaws in the defensive process. Everton conceded a total of nine goals in the last three matches played, and, on the other hand, Manchester City has shown its offensive potential, scoring six goals in the last two games. In this way, I expect to see the occurrence of a few goals.Above 2.5 GoalsNewcastle - LeedsThe most likely scenario for this match will be for both teams to score at least one goal. It is true that a game more controlled by the home team is expected, however, Leeds also plays good football, with a lot of offensive quality. It should be noted that the market \"Both Teams Score\" was a winner in Leeds' last five games, counting for the championship and in three of the last four matches between the two teams.Both Team ScoreThe wheel is turning, so let's hope to see good results!Let me hear your predictions!",

In front of such a scenario, I believe the most likely scenario for this match will be for both teams to score at least one goal. Both Teams ScoreIt seems that your prediction has missed a lot this time. however, I will not go into that. because there is only one game left, namely Brighton vs Arsenal. in fact, I have already reviewed the teams that will be competing. however, let's review again. I believe this match will be Arsenal's match, even though the Gunners will be playing as an away team. however, currently the Gunners are in a positive trending phase. The loss of Gabriel Jesus, who was absent due to injury, did not stop the Gunners' young squad from performing at high levels. now, they already have a stronger mentality and even more solid chemistry.On the Brighton side, this match is their home game. at least they have the advantage of playing as the home team. moreover, from the history of H2H in its last two matches against Arsenal. they were able to keep up with the Gunners' game, winning one match and one draw, a pretty good mental capital for De Zerbi's troops. however, I don't think this match will be easy for them because Arsenal are currently in their best form.In my estimate, Arsenal won the score 1-3.",

Otherwise we would only have a dozen or so of mega-threads in this section and no other posts.I enjoy his prediction posts (which are not limited to the premier league) and am glad he does that in a separate topic, as I (as well as others) can't be asked to go through hundreds of replies in mega-threads (I'd only view the few most recent post if anything).@Blawpaw - but actually creating a separate topic and just updating it for fresh predictions (rather than starting a new one each time) could work great, as it'd be easier for the others to follow. Just a thought.",
