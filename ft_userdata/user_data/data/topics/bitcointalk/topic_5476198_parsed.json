A switch from Blake2b to Blake 3 demonstrates a performance boost through its speed and efficiency and prevents ASIC miners from dominating, promoting decentralized mining opportunities. Furthermore, PYRIN will implement a unique smart contract design and introduce PAIW, a groundbreaking POW combining AI algorithm.BLOCK EXPLORERhttps://explorer.pyrin.network/GITHUBhttps://github.com/Pyrinpyi/TWITTERhttps://twitter.com/pyrin_networkDISCORDhttp://discord.gg/gx5Ysu7Ub9",
