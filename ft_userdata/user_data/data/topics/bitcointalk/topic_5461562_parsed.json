Srilanka much needed this kind of league with overseas players to improve their performance and should ready for world cup and other international series.3rd Match: B-Love Kandy vs Colombo StrikersColombo Strikers win the toss and opted to bat. First wickets fall early in the first over. now both batsmens looking aggressive.. Babar azam didn't scores in the previous game and hopefully he will make score in this match.",

So far only some matches was interesting. Srilanka patches are not good for batsmens , the reason first team scoring average is less than 1509 Marches already played and here us the the point table , you can see the standing of each team so far",

It all looked like the Lankan Premier League had started and now it is close to the end of the league. Few more days left and amidst the prevailing situation of Sri Lanka the league is slowly getting progress as foreign players participation have been good compared to the past season. In the match between Dambulla Giants and Colombo Strikers it was Dambulla Giants to win by 50 runs. McDermott (69) and Alex Ross (51) had contributed good runs and in the bowling Hasan Ali took 3 wickets. With this win Dambulla Giants continue to be on the first position on points table.",

Dambulla team gives target of 163 which is not easy to chase for second team in Srilanka patches.B-love batting line up is very strong and have ability to score aggressive innining. Both dangerous openers Muhammad haris and Fakhar zaman out earlier without scoring double figure which created lot if pressure on the team. Dinesh chandimal scores fifty and Methews scores 26 but at the end they lost by 20 runs.",

Dambulla squad had only Srilanka players and only two foreign players and both was not experience players while B-love had three Pakistan top players(Asif ali, Haris, husnain). Dambulla batter first but failed to give high target. 170 is best score to defend in t20 but if you have less than 160 then bowlers have to play key role. DMA scores only 147 despite six  wicket in hands. Infact B-love bowling was so strong and didn't allow DMA team to score high. De silva picked one wicket and gives 24 scores in 4 overs. B-love won the match in last over. DMA defended well but top 3 players especially Mendis contributed well. At the end Asif Ali 19 of 10 plays a key role to increase the runt rate which make it easy for B-love to win this final . overall tournament was so good this time and and it will helpful for bringing top quality payers for Srilanka international team.",
