What electrical capacity do you have? What's your energy price? What taxes are applied to mining in Mongolia? Is it easy to import equipment to your country (I imagine it is)? Do you own enough money to start this kind of project ?These are all questions you should normally ask yourself before starting on such a project, but don't think we can give you any advice or insight if you initially don't share any information about your idea.",

But how large is your pocket in getting the necessary infrastructures and covering the installations. Just as iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 said, your two worded post is not enough, you really need to be specific in what areas you need guide or assistance, so that the forum members can be of help to you. Merely looking at your post many persons will not take you seriously. So you might want to update your post and give more information.",

As far as I know, there are already mining operations in Mongolia, but it's hard to get precise stats or numbers.Your proximity to China should give you an advantage when it comes to importing equipment. Perhaps miners don't brag and are discreet? Perhaps only few people there have the means to invest in such an operation?As for your question about the government, I think only fellow Mongolians could answer it objectively.Can I ask you what you're worrying of if it's legal? Customs when importing equipment or taxes? are you afraid of potential corruption ?",

Bitcoin mining already has the backing of the government which is like a go ahead for others join in. Asking why there are not many farms despite the advantages of it could be that bitcoin mining equipment cannot readily be sourced in the Mongolian market and maybe the cost of importation and entry for foreigners is very high so they just avoid it. Maybe there is high tax rate for bitcoin miners. There are just too many reasons. And asking if the government is trustworthy is a very valid question but I would need to know in worth sense do you mean if they are trustworthy? Taxes? Regulations?",
