Also, check the file size of the images. Might need smaller file size or a different image file type for them to load faster.Image optimization was done using the ewww plugin. but it's still slowTheres a few options for this. If you already use smaller images (webp format) are you also using something like lightspeedcache ?The website speed could also be slow beacuse of the wordpress theme, which are you using ?Do you have a lot of plugins that are installed ?Speed also depends on the hosting you use, quite a significant facotor",

      "body": "Do you run on a dedicated server, a VPS or shared hosting?In the first case, i'd start by looking at your system load, if you're on a VPS you can also look at the load of your system, but it might be possible the company you're renting your VPS from overallocated and (depending on the technology they used), your VPS might look ok, but it might still be a load problem.In the case of a VPS or shared hosting, i'd recommend following the next steps, and if they don't solve your problem, contact your hosting provider and ask them about the load on the system you're running on.If the load is ok, i'd start by using Cache (as described by bayu7adi) and by looking at your content (as described by others).If the load is ok, and the content is ok, and the cache is up and running, i'd start by disabling all your plugins. See if this solves your problem (if it does, enable them one by one untill you find the one that's problematic)If the load is ok, and the content is ok, and the cache is up and running, and the plugins aren't the problem, try switching themes to a default theme. See if that solves the problemIf the load is ok, and the content is ok, and the cache is up and running, and the plugins are ok, and the theme is ok, make sure you didn't modify any php files (or check if you haven't been hacked).If all of this is ok, the problem might be the configuration of your apache/nginx/lighthttpd/... or mysql/mariadb/... This is a topic on it's own, but there are a few tools like mysqltuner that pop to mind to debug this issue.In the past, i've also used some debug tools for wordpress... IIRC, there was even an option to write debug info to a logfile straight in the config file, but i cannot remember exactly.",
