  "content": "I view this forum as an International University (Bitcointalk).  Whereby Brand-newbies in  the forum just got admission into the university. They are observing the environment, asking questions on offline (their guiders), they read sign post (threads) at all corner (all board) to avoid un-necessary punishments and attacks in the campus (forum). Yet they still have problem in the forum.Newbies, they are in year 1 and have started taking lectures from their first post. That is they have started writing. They ask questions.  Jr. Members, they are in year 2 and continue taking lectures from the classroom (bitcointalk forum). Members Rank, they are in year 3. Learning becomes very serious at this level because they have gotten small experience. They are focus. Full Members, they are in 400 level. Learning continues with more seriousness.  Sr. Members, they are in 500 level (final year) in social sciences. And bitcointalk can be classified as a social science, because bitcointalk uses scientific tools to analyse the individual uses of bitcoin, therefore, as a Sr. Member, they write projects and making comments. This is where unserious students are WAF (Weak Academic Failure). WAF means in this forum ban, Although, WAF can be used at all level. If anyone misbehave.Hero Members, they are the graduating (convocation) students. They are very happy because they must be employed in the labour market. They make comments, correct, counsel, and guide usersLegendary Members, they are the Alumni/Lecturers/Profs. As the name implies. you already know who they are. In the structure of bitcointalk, they are the highest body in the forum as for now. They educate, and answer questions with ease. Because they passed through all the stages mentioned above. Their functions in the forum are numerous.Year 1 and 2 should read and learn from their senior colleagues",

I mean in the ranking arrangement.Did you know that learning on this forum can be different? That is why you will see senior member posting good than even some hero and legendary.Did you know that a legendary or users of higher rank can create alt account? Using it in a way people will even know that it is an alt.But I do not think this post is worth it at all as it adds no usefulness. Sorry for saying that.",

There's plenty of examples of newer users being more knowledgeable than their seniors. That's almost true in every walk of life. Length of time, doesn't equal knowledge. It does, have a correlation, but it definitely isn't something to follow completely. There's plenty of users here that are probably classed as senior by most users, yet routinely get things wrong. Throw me into a technical discussion about Bitcoin's intrinsics, and you'll find many younger users more knowledgable in areas than myself. We all have different strengths, and weaknesses, and knowledge about Bitcoin is no different. Some will excel, and some won't.",

It is just a regular forum like every other and dedicated purposely for Bitcoin discussion, Altcoins and also other discussions related to cryptocurrency.A newbie account doesn't mean the person behind is a novice, it could be a legendary member Alt account, J.Member doesn't have to read continuously to rank up, a single post can get merits and with a few activity can promote him to the next rank and also for the remaining ranks like Sr.Member and Hero Member. The legendary account can also get sold to a new person that is new to the forum and so on. There are many uncertain things that can happen anonymously and remain hidden from the public except when they observe some changes like password and Email and changes in writing.NB: 500Level is not a default level system for all university, Nigerian Federal University of technology mostly adopt 5 years course but this is not the same for other universities and colleges.",

You can access this welcome message from the \"help\" link in the top menu bar at any time.As a member of the forum, you are surrounded by legends; phenomenal successes and catastrophic failures. The forum was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and saw the first exchange, the first altcoin, and the first ICO, but also catastrophic software flaws, massive thefts, and incredible scams. You too have an opportunity to become part of the forum's history: whether and in what way you do so is up to you.Forum is mixture for brand new, newbies to Hero and Legendary members. There is no difference between brand new and newbie members. Only one post and one activity point are not enough to make difference between them.Junior member is not much different too but from Member (with 10 merit required), difference will become clearer. From Full member and Senior member, difference increases bigger. Sometimes not much difference between Senior Member and Hero member. I only think difference is clear between Senior Member and Legendary member.If this topic receives a lot of merit, we will see more members create same ones in future.",

If the OP presents the forum this way, it's normal, but unfortunately, not all newcomers come here to learn, as you put it, to study cryptocurrencies correctly.Some members of the forum see him as a \"money cow\" that can be milked.What about farmer accounts, cheaters, and people who come to the forum with not entirely pure intentions?Unfortunately, your vision of the forum is somewhat utopian, but it is not. Here, in addition to the picture you beautifully described, there is deceit and greed, for which in your real academy, people would simply be kicked out, which is not happening here.",

Sure as we know there are alt accounts as newbie, Jr member, member etc, are they still in the class of the analogy? No they are not because they have the requisite above that level you see them. I think before now ranks were basically and by implication showing duration in the forum but as time went , the merit system has changed the dynamics of ranks.

That is you have small knowledge at least for all the stages even. Let me give you an illustration for more understanding. If a student graduate from a university with a first class honored degree and a year one student asked him a question from his field, and the graduate said he doesn't know, what do you think the junior student will feel? Although they are some junior students that are doing second degree in the same University with different course. Therefore, they might have knowledge more than the graduate. Lastly: I believe you are a graduate of University. Not really sure, but probability formula is used.  When you were in school. Lecturers did not make you laugh in any day? And also be serious about his Teaching as well? Why the accusation of merit begging? A good teacher makes his students to laugh, tell them fictional stories at some times to make the class lively and also to remove boring from the students. Any how a teacher is knowledgeable, there are time his class are bore, so good teacher would detect very fast and give them story to mup up. The OP analogy might not be true because he or she was not around when the merit system has not been introduced, so he didn't know what was happening by then but the thread might also be correct from the structural analysis. The thread is even based on the structural analysis. Not on Personality. Personally I know that they are some legendary newbies in the forum.
