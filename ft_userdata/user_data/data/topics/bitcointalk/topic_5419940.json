The offer to get a free domain from Trust Wallet and Unstoppable Domains is puzzling to many users, but the news that this could cause theft of funds is only for you.Advise your friend to reset the settings to the factory defaults and not download pirated software to the phone, which was most likely already installed on his device.",

Maybe he was tricked into entering his secret details on a website that looked like a regular unstoppable domain website but, in fact, was an impersonator. It is no surprise that users of one of the most popular altcoin wallets are getting scammed much more often than other users, especially considering that interaction with altcoin stuff and smart contracts implies downloading many dubious things. Don't get used to trusting random third parties only seeking users' money, or you are risking ending up being robbed by these enterprising personalities. Anyway, you should avoid cryptocurrency wallets that make money selling user personal data to ad companies. They are all potential scam waiting to happen.",

Maybe a hacked trustwallet user entered his private key on a phishing site sent by a pop-up notification.and some pop-up notifications also appear because several stations are visited and provide these notifications masquerading as a trustwallet application. I often experience some strange notifications that appear from the chrome browser and from unclear websites. make sure to clear history and delete automatic notifications on visited websites.",
