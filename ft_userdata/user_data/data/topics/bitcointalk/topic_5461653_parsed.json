Seeing someone who has little to no merits explain in detail in an OP how to get merits or write quality posts is a big LOL. There are some who simply ask \"How can I get merit on Bitcointalk?\" and I don't predict a great future for them in this forum because they are the kind of people who expect to have everything handed to them on a platter.",

It's the same way we also see people who teach trading but can't earn profit from it to make them quit their day job and begin to elk a living from trading. It's a funny situation. I read a lot of posts like that and laugh at the hidden hypocrisy in them. This is why members here shouldn't take everything said here hook, line and sinker without verifying them.",

Yet they teach people how to play and score lots of goals. Maybe this set of newbies that teach even the legendary members should be likened to such football coaches. LOLHowever, I have strong feeling that majority of such newbies are not genuinely new comers. They could be the alt account of some established members. There are still chances that some genuine newbies could start off by teaching. Myself, I  started  by advising legendary members",

Most newbies are of the belief that the moment they give such headings, the merits would start rushing like a tap that was just opened.   . Patience is always rewarding but most of them lack it.",

Aside from the fact the it’s not logical it also makes it obvious that they are fishing for merit, which could irritate some users that were supposed to merit them in the future as they start to grow here in the forum into adding them to their ignore list.I also get the fact that most newbie come to the forum without proper education on what the forum is all about just as I did, after the forum was introduced to me I had to take my time to learn how to post and how things work here before I could join discussions here in the forum. But most newbies just don’t want to learn instead they are looking for shortcuts or buses that will take them to their destinations without them having to do anything.",

If a newbie who doesn't earn enough merits creates such threads then there is no doubt that they are basically after merits, and they mostly believe that with such posts they can make reputable members as well as the merit sources to give them some merits for creation of such posts.I think it's still okay to create such posts because those newbies may learn something by creating such posts and they will try their best to make the posts as much informative as they possibly could. I hope that such newbies may contribute betters posts to the forum because creation of such posts require efforts and when someone puts effort in something then such users often get better over time.",

Maybe.As for me personally, I am not ready to tell someone how to do something right on the forum, even now. But all people are different, and for someone to formulate a text in public is a way of learning. By the way, I also do this sometimes, and often the errors pointed out to me give a big breakthrough in my ideas about the subject of study.
