Like taking my example, my one post was deleted and I know the reason of deletion, i actually send POA two times by mistake and I can not delete the 2nd POA post within 24 Hours so i just edit it and write on it, \"it is posted by mistake and I will delete it after 24 hours\" but my post was already deleted by moderators. As for you, only 2 of you posts were deleted, according to bpip tool, moderators have deleted 2 of your posts, and why they deleted them? Can only be answered by you like which posts you feel missing in your post history and maybe by sharing some details of them we can conclude which rule you broke. But that's ok to delete 1 or 2 posts but I think if you get deleted more posts then it could cause a problem (unofficial rule, just my observation.)",

I think found one of the global moderator's answers about that when Ratimov created one of the threads about his report activity.I hid the dust under the rug - it means I cleaned the apartmentQuote from: hilariousandco on March 07, 2023, 04:14:06 PMReporting posts from 2018 in dead threads that have already been locked really isn't necessary. Sometimes it seems like people are going out of their way to find stuff to report. Posts that have been edited shouldn't be removed anyway as someone can just edit their post and then report it to try make sure it's fully deleted and people can try cover their tracks this way. There probably should be some sort of statue of limitations on certain stuff because posts in dead threads from years ago really isn't an issue. If you want to report stuff there's thousands of posts made a day by shitposters so it's not like you'll ever run out of stuff to do.Quote from: molecularman on April 05, 2023, 09:41:21 PMHas anyone else experienced old posts getting deleted?Some other users may share the same fate as you, but I don't found them ask for what, at least for now.",

If these posts are low-quality, then it's okay that now there is less of this crap in your post history. The main thing is that no one deletes valuable posts.We all know how much reports you submit to clear the spam posts on forum and yes whether it's old or new spam remains the same but the problem also arises when they simply bump up the thread after some time to gain more attention about those shitcoins they are promoting so it should be reported and if mods delete that ANN threads it's really appreciated on their part.They are not contributing anything but trying to gain some victims from these sort of spammy threads which should be deleted no matter how old they are.",

There were thousands, tens of thousands of posts of this spam, if not more. Until now, a lot of these low-quality posts, shilling, spam, referral spam, endless duplicates of the same topics, etc., all this is still hanging on the forum. In 2017-2018, bounty spammers pretty much littered this forum. And what is most remarkable, our forum is about bitcoin, and most of all the garbage from the discussion of altcoins. Fair enough  Re: Alt coin spamming.  That's where most of my posts have been, but I'd like to think I was always pretty aware of posting something related to the topic and not simply posting to post a shill/spam comment.   In a matter of minutes I had 22 posts deleted.  It appears this thread made someone go and report all my comments from years ago, lol.",
