You did not do a good introduction of your offer  coupled with the fact that you did not state your terms and conditions to apply in the course of application for your promotion here. You did not state the rank eligibility valid for application. I will advise you come down here to conclude everything about this deal for transparency and accountability so that there would be some level of trust and confidence when dealing.  Lastly, I would advise you opt for an escrow services here so that members would know you are serious about your job offer otherwise nobody would look your way.",

Hopefully, those who are interested in applying will consider reading the comments after the OP's post.The manner at which OP placed this offer should be a thing of concern to anyone thinking of going further to contact OP for discussions. On a normal, one should expect that the conversation for this deal should continue on this platform and this thread as created by OP for transparency and accountability  but taking it outside for further details is not really welcoming and nobody knows the nature of the deal for which OP wants to hire members here for. The account in question is an old one but not too active so how can such be trusted to to be genuine.",

If OP feels he or she is too busy to give this platform attention OP could have contacted a campaign manager here for further discussions as to know what is obtainable to promote their products here.

Then, if it's a scam post in here and let everyone know the deal if you're that worried about it. I'm not sure if it's a scam or not, but it might be a possible job opportunity on another forum. Only way to find out is send a message.",

We aren't sure of what OP is trying to achieve with what they claim they're offering. I don't know if it's lack of interest that people didn't apply or they're just bored not to comment on his thread to let the community know what transpired between them and OP. This seems the third thread OP has opened for the same masked offer they've. What perplexes me with this particular topic is that it's self-moderated.",

If anyone can be able to contact OP via his Skype ID to get information on the job offer then we could be able to know what OP is up to.  Be it scam or not, it would be best we hear from OP but doing so some how is a kind of breach of privacy because to the best of my knowledge, this platform is anonymous and as most members would want their identity to remain unknown do you not think contacting OP as requested would reveal ones identity and possibly their platform ID because I know for sure OP would want to know and ask for platform ID which I see as not safe.",
