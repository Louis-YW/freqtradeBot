It is actually time to buy. If the price will continue getting down then it will be driven by other big things.",

It’s the deleveraging of one of the biggest players in the space. Until FTX has sold off their assets, the market can only go down. Hopefully the pain happens fast and those that buy the dip are rewarded. I’m a bit concerned as we head into a recession with 2 more years of Biden and nothing but bad news in the horizon… That is hopefully a signal of the bottom and buying time.",

Anytime it could really happen and this is why it would really be just right that you should really be prepared on the time you had step your foot on this market.",

So the only thing they can do is withdraw their money causing panic. But I don't think it's plan, again, that is normal business practice, it's that it was really evident in this FTX saga.Quote from: XEN_Protocol on November 09, 2022, 05:24:37 PMNow I have no choice but to believe that 10,000$ BTC is possible. Yeah, anything is possible, the price can go as low as $10k, and it's up to you whether to take advantage and buy cheap bitcoin and accumulate and wait for the next bull run ride. There's nothing wrong if the place plummeted to $10k.",

It may be true that the bottom has not yet occurred, but right now there are so many possibilities in a panicked market.I'm not going to settle for this market situation, but it's nothing new every time bitcoin hits ATH. It's time to buy, it's always good but the concern about the bottom is bound to get stronger. $10K isn't impossible, but I think it's too deep for now. Bitcoin will find strong support in the $13K or $15K area, so I really have to turn a blind eye to the dump now.",

Yes, not the first time that this had happened to us. The news is that the deal has fallen between CZ and FTX, causing a huge ripple on the market today.I don't think though that those who still have funds in FTX can withdraw, I have the feeling that it's all gone that's why CZ doesn't want to messed it up.",

However the weekly candle closing is in 4 days. No point in panicking just yet. This could prove to be a short term crash which will be quickly picked up again just as fast as it fell. The reason for this train of thought is that the dump was caused by FUD about FTX, mainly. I think we already have seen the worst or will shortly see the worst of the fallout. But as soon as that clears, Bitcoin should be safe again. I see no reason why this would create another monthly bear market.",

I am also a victim here, at first when the issue started to pop public, I am really saying it was just a FUD, I tried to withdraw a small number of funds from the FTX exchange and went succeeded, but after a few hours when withdrawals halted, I deposited some amount which my plan is just to convert it to another chain and until now the withdrawal is still pending.",

No it's not but crypto dumps are already there even before but this recent issue that we are facing can cause crypto to return on their last lowest levels. I don't think this is a planned work. No exchange will wish that they will collapse but bear markets can be the one that is responsible for it because some people got bored of waiting and they are now selling/pulling out their funds inside the exchanges.In other bear markets, scenarios like this doesn't happen but this one is different. I think that is because the duration of this bear is much longer than the previous one. $10k is possible but it's not guaranteed that it will happen so don't give up yet if you didn't like to see this.",

And there is a possibility that this situation will continue but that does not eliminate our patience to keep waiting for the market to reverse direction. Maybe next year will be our best year again to see the market start to reverse direction or even 2 more years.

But since the master strategist behind GD is had a tattoo of Luna done one month before the collapse, it's probably zero money recovered, and three times the loss and the exposure.Also, no, the dump is not starting now because it has started with Do Con and his Terra garbage, which like in a domino effect started crushing investment funds and exchanges and reminding everyone why we call them shitcoisna and shittokens, because there is nothing behind them, there is no real utility, there is no usage, just a ton of wannabe investors moving money that there were never theirs in their place and playing the fraction game ten times the scale banks do and ten times worse.So, in nothing truly positive happens in the economy, like inflation going under control, the end of the war in Ukraine, or avoiding recession, we will have to keep on watching all this fiasco unfold till we finally weed out every single one of them. But it will come with a lot of pain for the ones that trusted their tokens, that invested money as well for the ones that thought this will be the year of x10 and x20 returns and put another mortgage on their house to catch it.Quote from: dunfida on November 09, 2022, 07:37:56 PMAnd this is where DCA would set in on which it would be just ideal if you do have considerations on accumulations on cheaper prices if you have done on buying on 19-21k price point.Oh yeah, all the guys that started DCA at the beginning of the year must be thrilled by now with their results.",
