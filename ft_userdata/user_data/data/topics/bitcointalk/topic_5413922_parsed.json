  "content": "Hey all, I'm new to paintball, and after a few times playing with rental gear, I want to get into it more. My first choice as of now is to buy a mask, so I ordered a JT Flex 8. However, my ears stuck out, and my chin a bit, so I returned it. I was thinking of getting a Virtue Vio Extend instead (Amazon Prime has a really good deal on it) because it would offer more coverage in the chin area. Does the Extend offer better ear coverage than the Flex 8, or should I buy another mask?",

      "body": "When I was younger on the weekends, I would go over to my cousin’s house and we would go out to play Paintball. My cousin would let me borrow his Dye Precision I4 Thermal mask, but for some reason, I always had some trouble fitting the mask on properly and finally decided to buy my own paintball mask which I strongly recommend. The Virtue VIO Paintball Mask is built from premium-quality plastic and different foam materials, but the best feature is the shock-absorbent and fog-free lens.  Its a good one to own if youre serious about playing Paintball.",
