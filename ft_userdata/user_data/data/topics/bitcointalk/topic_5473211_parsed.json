What do you mean by successful gambler is that a player who successfully earn a lot of money from gambling? Since before this happen to them they need to throw a lot of money since they will not experience that if those newbies will not gain a experience base on what they while trying to risk their money on a casino. The purpose is supposed to learn that type of game and know the risk on what you are doing since if people want a shortcut for success because they want fast profit then they might not like the result they can get for taking wrong decisions especially on gambling.Bankroll management is really important but you also need self discipline on any other thing related to gambling so that you would learn something thru your experience and use it the way how you handle your gambling habits for sure if you manage all of risk especially managing it to make the chances to lose into low then with this we can be bullish on gambling. But also in reality its hard to achieve all of this so maybe we should focus to have fun instead stress ourselves on technical situations on gambling.",

It is really simple really. You take gambling as entertainment, which it is. Never go in expecting to win anything, expect to loose all you deposited. This way if you win, it is a nice surprise",

Good sincere advice! I would advise all beginners the following: imagine one of your hobbies that helps you avoid stress. For example, this is buying delicious food. Let's say you spend $50 a month on it. And now think about it, if you play gambling for a similar amount - will you have enough fun? Note that I suggest in no case to consider gambling as earnings. I suggest understanding how much you can potentially spend, and how well you will have a good time. If you think that for $ 50 you will get a lot of fun, then so much can be postponed for gambling. The main thing is not to wait for a win, but to just want to have a good time for this amount. And you need to mentally say goodbye to this money.",

It is good to be patient while gambling and it is good to also follow the rules for you not to be addicted or lose too much money, but gambling is not where we should think about success. Seriously this issue of success in gambling needs to be clarified. Gambling is a game of chance and even the most experienced and disciplined gamblers can experience losing streaks. Majority of us believe that winning money is the ultimate goal of gambling and that's what we consider being successful in gambling forgetting that the odds are usually stacked against the player. Even the best gamblers lose more often than they win. I think it's just better to approach gambling with realistic expectations and to focus on having fun rather than just trying to win because staying positive and consistent can actually help you avoid making emotional decisions when you're losing but it's not a guarantee of success.",

That will provide more opportunities for them so they can make money.The most important thing about gambling is how you can control yourself while gambling.

Of course you should learn how to mitigate risk as well and not just bet all your money. That's why the advise is just play with the money that you can afford to lose and just enjoy and be entertained. If you are lucky then good for you. But gambling is not something that you can really depend or rely upon as far as making like money to bring food in the table for your family. You need self control and not be carried away, and on worst case scenario, be a gambling addict.",

If you are newbie who is interested in gambling and has been following the gambling community here or any where online or offline, your purpose should be to learn as much as possible from the shared experiences of others such that you can eventually branch out independently, allowing you to operate without dependence on others.What can we call success in gambling? ° Is it been a responsible gambler with falling to addiction all the years of your gambling?° Is it even capable of having winnings and making money out of gambling that can be referred to being successful? I wish to know as a result of how success in gambling could have variance to people.Well your question is very appropriate in this discussion, honestly I also never thought and did not really believe if there were people who were successful in gambling, this is personally and according to my own perspective. Let's think logically, the first point is that gambling is random in terms of winning and for the results it will always depend on how lucky you are at that time, the second point is that there is absolutely no guarantee for anyone to be able to win there, and the point when there is no certainty for anyone to achieve the results they expect. Honestly, I don't really care if they are responsible gamblers or not but even if you are responsible, this activity is really not recommended, no one will be able to achieve success in gambling because there is no element of success at all such as the process to achieve their goals and also on the other hand how could they seek success in a place that only relies on luck for the expected results? And there is also no consistency in it, the fact is that defeats will occur more often than the occasional victory and with this it can be concluded that there is no consistency in achieving something in the final session, everything will go randomly about how lucky you are at that time. Does this make sense? Think about it.Quote from: Lida93 on November 07, 2023, 03:26:05 PM I endeavor to use 5% of my  income monthly for gambling I don't have to exceed my bankroll be it in loss or winnings knowing that there are still other days to continue with my gambling. Gamblers that worry letting it to get a better part of their feelings are those that take gambling as a means to make money and when the money is not forth coming it becomes a problem for them.Of course my friend, that is the best way to be a responsible gambler, and for anyone who only allocates a small amount like 5% of their money to gambling then I think they will avoid addiction, provided they always gamble with the amount they can afford to lose. Because with that I am sure from the beginning you have agreed with yourself that for whatever the result is, especially the loss, you will not mind accepting that fact. As in general, usually people who put large amounts they want a big win and not come for fun, we can see that usually people like that actually experience a lot of losses with large amounts, none other than that happens because basically it's like you said they came with ridiculous intentions, how could they think that they could make money from gambling? yes I understand that for occasional wins it is possible but if you want to be consistent then it seems like your mind is disturbed. So better reconsider, there is nothing better unless you stop or just reduce it.",
