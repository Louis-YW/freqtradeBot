  "content": "Blockchain technologies are developing at a tremendous speed, and many startups using this technology comes out daily; however, this industry is still quite challenging to understand. It is worth noting that the standard marketing techniques widely used to promote joint projects may not work here, which brings many problems.For your startup to be as successful as possible, you must tell the whole world about it because today, every country has its crypto enthusiasts. In the era of the global Internet, various products have become more accessible to users, but it has become much more challenging to stand out among the sea of ​​other projects.The more information about your projects you place on various platforms, the better. The problem is that the publication of materials is quite expensive, and the budget of startups is often minimal. However, this is not a reason to give up. Today we will talk about how you can make free publications. It is often a little more challenging to agree on such cooperation, but the effect will be no worse and sometimes even better than paid placements.Personal agreements with influencersThere is an opinion that publications from influencers are costly. On the one hand, this is true; the entire cost of advertising integrations on the promoted pages on Instagram of world stars can reach several million dollars.But, today, many celebrities are passionate about the crypto industry, buy various cryptocurrencies and NFTs, and invest a lot of money in popular startups. If your project is exciting and promising, then most likely, you will be able to agree on free placements.The first thing to do is to choose influencers carefully. Their interests must be in contact with the subject of your project. In the first stage, you can contact the celebrity, chat, and express your admiration for his or her work. If you immediately start talking about your project, and even more so about free advertising on a page on social networks, you will most likely receive an instant refusal.It is crucial to very carefully and diplomatically bring the dialogue to the fact that you are also interested in the crypto industry and have even started your project. You may mention that the topic of your startup is in contact with the interests of a celebrity and offer to get to know it better.You can safely count on free placement if an influencer likes your product.Many are afraid to think about starting to work on this method. It is due not only to uncertainty in your project. The fact is that many do not understand who exactly can become an influencer. Today you will find many bloggers who work in the crypto industry. They don't have to have an audience of millions. Various experts often have tens of thousands of live subscribers, and it will not be difficult to agree on such cooperation.If you can surprise an influencer with your unusual startup idea or execution, you can intrigue him or her. It is crucial in this regard to show maximum enthusiasm and confidence that everything will work out. People are charged with your faith in victory and also want to participate in this.Promise a reward from the sale of a product or give away an NFTIf you have an extensive and exciting NFT collection and want to get the support of influencers, then you can offer them your product in exchange for advertising. For example, if you understand that the bloggers liked the project during the negotiations but did not want free placement, you can give him a few non-fungible tokens or offer a small percentage of sales.In this case, the influencer will be interested in promoting your product and can create a perfect advertising integration. Motivating all your partners to work better is essential, and then the project will receive maximum support from a large audience.When making such an offer, you must ensure that the influencer likes your idea. Brainstorm your presentation to be as effective as possible. It is essential to understand that each influencer is unique, so here you need to rely not only on the merits of your project but also on what will be necessary and exciting for an individual blogger.Here you cannot write one engaging text and send it to all the influencers you have chosen, and it is essential to make a personal approach to each person.Social networksPromoting current blockchain projects is impossible without a robust community in social networks. A good solution is to create pages on a variety of platforms at the planning stage of the project. Working with social networks is a science because you need to produce publications about your startup and make the most interesting to the audience. Here, the selection of images and videos, the frequency of publications, and how much you can attract the audience to discuss the project play a role.Today, various programs help to increase the number of subscribers. We advise you not to resort to this method because, firstly, you will not get a live audience, which means it does not make sense. And secondly, if the platform notices abnormal activity, it can block your page, and you will have to start again.The choice of social networks themselves also matters. Instagram and Facebook are the world leaders in terms of the number of users. Still, here the public is not interested in blockchain technologies, so we advise you to pay attention to Reddit, Twitter, and Discord. These social networks have many crypto enthusiasts, so it will be much easier for you to find followers here.It is also worth mentioning separately about Bitcointalk. If Reddit, Twitter, and Discord are more entertaining, this platform was created to publish various analytical publications. Here it will be much easier for you to find investors or crypto enthusiasts who are more likely to buy your product.When creating publications for social networks, it is necessary to consider their features. So, large analytical materials are more suitable for Bitcointalk. You can also place your White Paper here. As for Reddit, you can post various information about your startup here, but try to do it more lightly and unobtrusively. Twitter generally does not allow you to give complete details on the project since the size of publications here is only a few characters. However, you can post photos and videos, links to the product, and launch various promotions, special offers, and giveaways here.Projects such as OPEN Platform and SuchApp are notable for successful ICO marketing campaigns because they position themselves as savvy \"problem solvers.\" They focus on the needs of society and do not specifically target the blockchain community.Work with social networks should not be episodic. It is desirable that you go to different materials every day or several times a week to maintain the interest of a live audience.Create a press releaseFor a long time, it was believed that a press release was a very effective tool to attract a new audience. On the one hand, this can attract visitors to your site, but on the other hand, the price for this is disproportionately large.If you are developing blockchain startups, you need to choose media outlets specializing in this industry, such as Cointelegraph. The main problem with press releases on such platforms is that they are on the homepage for a brief period, and then they can only be found in the most boring sections for users. No one reads advertising intentionally, well, except for narrow specialists.As a result, the cost of such press releases is relatively high but ineffective. Even if you write an engaging text, it does not mean many people will read it.However, if your project is interesting, you can try hosting it free. Of course, it becomes much more difficult to agree on such advertising in specialized media than, for example, in social networks of influencers. But, if the editor-in-chief likes your project, then you have a real chance to get a press release for free.In addition, you can also post press releases on various social networks and other information platforms. Usually, they do not have a massive audience like the popular media. But you can get good positions even by posting for free, which means more people will view them.Mutual postsMany people underestimate joint posts, so they do not use this method, although practice shows that this is a big mistake.First, it is straightforward to agree on mutual placements. You can find many crypto bloggers with the same number of subscribers or more and decide on cooperation. In this case, you get free publications on various pages where the public will be interested in your products. If you practice this regularly, you will be able to notice that the number of followers on social networks will skyrocket.If you decide to make mutual posts, agree on what and when you will publish. A good solution would be to create different ads for different pages. It will draw more attention significantly if your audiences overlap.You can also partner with influencers who have much more followers than you. In this case, you need to pay more attention to advertising design.Practice shows that these points can be marked as the main ways to get free promotion with influencers you have discovered or found in ready-made lists purchased from third-party sources.What other options would you add here based on your own experience?",
