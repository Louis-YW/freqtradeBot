Hence, bidders might want to take into account those fees in their total, when placing bids.Hence, it will be helpful if you could please indicate the continent (at least) from where you will dispatch those items (if you do not want specifically to indicate a country). In case you dispatch them from Europe, an indication of EU (or not) will help too.Thanks",
