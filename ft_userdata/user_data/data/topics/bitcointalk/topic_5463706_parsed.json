After winning the primary with more than 30% of votes, Milei is now the front-runner in Argentina’s general election in October.As previously reported, Milei wants to abolish the central bank and adopt the United States dollar as Argentina’s currency. The presidential candidate also believes that Bitcoin is a reaction against “central bank scammers,” while fiat currency allows politicians to scam Argentines with inflation.So, this is going to be a really mindfuck moment for a lot of users- he likes Bitcoin- wants to get rid of the central bank- want to fully adopt the usd dollar, so ditching completely the pesosOf course, there are some other bits about abortion and climate change and the fact that has already sent a big f word to China and her Brics but the whole thing is about on one side getting rid of the central bank and on the other of fully adopting the USD is really interesting as It would be the largest economy that has done this after Ecuador and it will just rise the number of countries that are either using the dollar directly or a currency pegged to it. So, that much for the so-called de-dollarization some nutcases still think it's happening.The first impact will be clear, double and triple-digit inflation will go away, of course there will be some bad things happening as there will be no more money printing so the government will not be able to hand over the traditional socialist gifts that come to bite you in the ass 2 years later to get elected, but more importantly, how would this affect the perception of Bitcoin.It's obviously seen as a way to escape spiraling inflation but with a real hard currency would it stop losing its currency flavor and be seen as more of an investment?",

The high inflation in the country is making people turn to Bitcoin as a hedge. Adopting the dollar is a sound economic strategy to gain monetary stability but it comes with a price. Dollarization helped reduced corruption and stabilized the economy of Ecuador and Zimbabwe. One problem is that the Argentina monetary system will now depend on the monetary policy of the US central bank for monetary policy. And the US central bank might not consider Argentina when making its policies. The US will make policies that suit its economy. If Javier Milei wins the presidential election on 22 October this year, Bitcoin might get the needed boast in Argentina. I don't think Bitcoin will easily regain its traditional status as currency. If the price keeps accelerating more people will keep it as an investment because it will become more precious.",

Above all the industrial sector will suffer, there will be higher unemployment (now it's modest with ~7%).Here a graph showing Argentina and Ecuador's economic growth 1984-today:(Source: World Bank)You can see that in both cases, Argentina and Ecuador, there was an initial boom after dollarization/currency board introduction. In Argentina, 1991, and in Ecuador, 2000. But then the growth went increasingly bumpy. Dollarization creates a higher dependency on external commerce and international financial events and gives in generall less flexibility. It's a gamble, you could have favourable outcome or not, depending on your economical structure. Argentina's post-currency-board history coincides with Ecuador's dollarization (~2000-2002) and after these years there is no clear \"winner\" between both if you look at economic growth.With cryptos emerging as an alternative, a dollarized country could try to introduce altcoins as a way to stimulate growth if it thinks it needs to increase money supply. I'm less thinking about an independent currency (like ETH or LTC) but more of a kind of utility token. This could give the country flexibility again, so I'm currently a bit less against dollarization than I'd have been in 1992 or 2000.Quote from: stompix on August 18, 2023, 02:40:51 PMhow would this affect the perception of Bitcoin.It's obviously seen as a way to escape spiraling inflation but with a real hard currency would it stop losing its currency flavor and be seen as more of an investment?I guess in Argentina BTC adoption is clearly benefitting from the current high-inflation scenario. It is already used more as an investment than as a currency, but has also the function to act as an intermediate step between the Peso and external currencies like the US dollar, as US dollar acquisition is restricted.If the country was already dollarized, I think BTC adoption will grow slower. The country could go the way of El Salvador though, trying to force Bitcoin adoption to become at least a little bit less dependant on the USD cycles (at the cost obviously to have to support the high BTC volatility).",

In the last years, believe it or not, employment improved a lot, even compared with pre-COVID times (and it's not only due to the State growing, it's primarily private employment). Private consumption is also quite high currently (see this New York Times article about restaurants being always packed). Also, sanitary conditions have improved continuously in the last decades, like we can see with child mortality.So yeah, it could be much worse. The situation is a bit paradoxical, but only at the first glance: The high consumption may have been one of the main reasons (apart from delayed effects of COVID subsidies and its M1 explosion) which propelled the inflation from a mere 25-40% to 120%+.In the 1990s currency board Argentina, unemployment initially got better, but from 1995 on (impact Tequila crisis) rates above 10-15% were common. In 2001 the \"convertibilidad\" regime collapsed with 18% unemployment.I still think such a regime can work (as in Bulgaria and the Eurozone in general) but taking its time and giving the industry time and measures to adapt. However, I think the US dollar isn't perhaps the best currency for Argentina to peg its currency to, as its main trade partner is Brazil, the US is third (if taking EU countries as separate entities).My personal \"advice\" (if I had any power or legitimacy to do that ) to Argentina's government would instead to be to advance with a Mercosur monetary union (with Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia). There were some very timid steps towards a creation of an Argentina/Brazil \"unit of account\" (like the ECU was in Europe) but almost nothing. A dollarization could close that door, which would benefit potentially all of South America, for a long time.About the GDP per capital: that graph if any shows how overvalued Argentina's currency was in the 1990s due to the still relatively high inflation rate. If any currency board/external currency adoption steps are taken then this effect would have to be avoided.",

It's private consumption driven out of fear, not out of how good things are and how much money they have.Spend now, worry later: no point saving in inflation-stricken ArgentinaExactly what you were saying:QuotePacked restaurants, long lines outside the theatre, concerts that sell out in hours – Argentines with purchasing power are responding with a frenzy of consumption in the face of soaring inflation. ~For many, the situation means rushing to the shops as soon as possible after pay day to buy groceries before prices increase.Quote from: d5000 on August 19, 2023, 07:49:03 PMMy personal \"advice\" (if I had any power or legitimacy to do that ) to Argentina's government would instead to be to advance with a Mercosur monetary union (with Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia).

Why do they still carry plans on making the trade in peso and reals and other currency somewhere in the middle then?   Because just as Russia realized when it got paid in rupees that when you get paid in shitcoins there is nobody else wanting you shitcoins!These agreements are just like a bounty campaign here!They can't afford to pay their users in BTC so they pay them in their shitty tokens they can print endlessly, and once the payments are made they drop like a fly as everyone receiving those shitcoins runs to the exchange to convert them into either BTC or USDT. Just how people in Argentina are doing now with their peso or Indians with their rupees or Rusian with their ruble!",

The US dollar has it's flaws, but it's way more stable in comparison to the Argentinian peso(even though the peso was pegged to the US dollar).Having no national central bank might be better than having an irresponsible central bank. Being pro-USD and pro-Bitcoin at the same time isn't so absurd as you think.

No. They're doing quite well. So is Argentina - in terms of employment. In terms of inflation it's completely another story. Here Argentina is a disaster.Basically what I want to say is that in Argentina there is a financial crisis, not so much an economic crisis. Companies are in general doing well.There's a retroalimentation between inflation and consumption. Consumption is driving inflation, and inflation is driving consumption (and capital flight).Quote from: stompix on August 20, 2023, 04:15:29 AMSo, trying to peg your useless currency to other currencies that might be just as bad and that have continuously lost ground against the USD could be better...I almost expected that answer But both states would need to increase fiscal discipline if they bound their currencies together. That's the main benefit of the idea. There probably would have to be criteria like the Copenhagen requirements for the Eurozone to join this area. By the way, Argentina's peso is the only currency in the region that suffered such a big devaluation in the last decade. The real is doing well (has lost 30% of its value against the dollar since 2003, most of it in two crisis including COVID, but that's not bad at all), as is the boliviano (its value has even increased in the last 20 years, it could hold well a floating peg to USD), the peso uruguayo (lost approx. 30% since 2003), and the Guaraní (lost 20% since 2003).But the advantage compared to simply adopting the dollar is if there is a regional crisis, e.g. caused by a drought or oil prices, then the currency can temporarily become weaker, to later strengthen again if relative conditions with respect to the US are more favorable. In contrast, if the US enters a crisis, it allows the countries to strengthen their currency, like it occurred to the Brazilian real in the late 2000s/early 2010s, when the BRL became itself overvalued reaching 0.6 USD (coming from 0.3) and then falling down again to 0.3 and after COVID to 0.2.Quote from: stompix on August 20, 2023, 04:15:29 AMWhy do they still carry plans on making the trade in peso and reals and other currency somewhere in the middle then?The problem is that there is not enough coordination. The plans to \"skip\" the dollar were renewed in May 2023 but Brazil is obviously currently the one trying to slow down. The problem is also that when there are ideological differences between both governments these initiatives can come to a complete halt. That's definitely something which has to be improved.Quote from: Poker Player on August 20, 2023, 08:01:39 AMIn any case, if Milei wins, he intends to turn the country upside down, a country that had the highest GDP per capita in the world more than a century ago, a country where people emigrated in search of opportunities and a better life. By handing out subsidies and creating large layers of the population dependent on them has ended up in the disaster it is today. It is the result of Peronism. That's a very simplified point of view (although Milei is trying to install it in the discussion).First, Argentina had almost no population in 1900 (few millions). There was also practically no industry. The \"business model\" of the country in this era was to be an almost pure pure agrarian state (heavy industry appeared only in the 1920s/30s). This would be unsustainable today, as the agrarian sector needs not much labour force.Second, the big problem of Argentina is that it never sustained policies over more than 10 years. This led to a weak industrial sector. Peronist governments had its share of this problem as they often created and sustained uncompetitive economic areas, but also the military dictatorships trying to establish the pre-1930s model again in the 70s, and they failed completely.The debt crisis in the early 80s in the last years of the military government was the reason for the general Argentine debt problem which started to become massive in the 90s and then led to the collapse in 2001. But this debt problem is still the background of the current crisis: Argentina had always problems in the last decades to get external financing, so it had to very high interest rates. This led to the current situation where the central bank prints money to finance the country's fiscal deficit, and this boosts inflation. I could write entire books about this (as you suspect, I have \"first hand\" knowledge of the situation in AR) but let's end here",

I think just the next step is too complicated thinking what will happen after this with two \"if\" it's out of my league.Quote from: m2017 on August 20, 2023, 10:13:35 AMJavier Milei himself is the same politician as those whom he accuses.So you're saying no politicians should accuse the former leaders of corruption just because he is also a politician?If you start from the idea that they're all corrupt and they should shut up then basically you're admitting no change will ever happen and everyone that goes voting is just empowering corruption.Quote from: d5000 on August 20, 2023, 08:03:55 PMQuote from: stompix on August 20, 2023, 04:15:29 AMSo, trying to peg your useless currency to other currencies that might be just as bad and that have continuously lost ground against the USD could be better...I almost expected that answer But both states would need to increase fiscal discipline if they bound their currencies together.Remind me why is Argentina in this mess in the first place. And you expect them to magically do the right thing after half of century of proving they are unwilling to do so? Wishful thinking!Quote from: d5000 on August 20, 2023, 08:03:55 PMQuote from: stompix on August 20, 2023, 04:15:29 AMWhy do they still carry plans on making the trade in peso and reals and other currency somewhere in the middle then?The problem is that there is not enough coordination. The plans to \"skip\" the dollar were renewed in May 2023 but Brazil is obviously currently the one trying to slow down. The problem is also that when there are ideological differences between both governments these initiatives can come to a complete halt. That's definitely something which has to be improved.[/quote]No, it's no ideology it's basic financial stuff.Brazil doesn't want to get paid in a currency that devaluates by the week and that no one else wants, they have a positive trade so they end with one billion worth of pesos, oh wait it's 900m, by the time you read the topic is 700million     and Argentina can't afford to buy reals as it would be the same as buying in USD, so it makes no sense. It's a copy-paste thing of what Russia and India got through and they solved it by using the UEA dirham, which, is pegged to the dollar! The irony, right?",

It seems Javier Milei is another puppet of America. Otherwise, no good country will ever want to replace their own currency and adopt currency from another country. That's definitely a negative but if he has won the presidential primary, that means a lot of stupid people support this fellow. Replacing currency with USD may work for smaller countries but when it comes to a country which ranks 23rd in global list, might bring disaster.",

El Salvador changed its national currency to $ 20+ years ago, and as a country that is much smaller than Argentina, I don't see that this change has transformed the country economically (for the better), although we can rightly wonder what would have happened if that they didn't do it. Maybe the size of the country really makes a difference, although it seems to me that regardless of the fact that Argentina is one of the largest countries in the world, their problems are far more complex than which currency they would choose. In other words, if you don't have smart politicians who work for the good of the country, everything else is in vain.",

I am from Venezuela, so I know what I am talking about, all of it comes to a point where people is willing to give up part of their culture in order not to be always checking the price of the pesos against the USD.Venezuelan economy is already dollarized in many levels, expect salaries. We ask for prices in malls and stores and we get the price in USD, not local currency. It must be the same in Argentina",

The countries, mainly Argentina of course, would have to be well prepared and coordinate their policy a lot for such a move. But in 2018-22, there was also the hurdle of an ideologically-related \"cooling down\" of relation between these two countries, so that eliminated all possibilities of a coordination. There was Covid, too. As of 2023, Brazil of course wouldn't take further steps in the short term if they don't know who wins this year's election. If Bullrich or Massa win (together their parties have ~60% of the vote, even if they're ideologically strongly opposed, at least when they're campaigning  ), however, I'd expect further steps in this direction, as both want to strengthen Mercosur.Quote from: Hispo on August 21, 2023, 04:16:19 PMWe ask for prices in malls and stores and we get the price in USD, not local currency. It must be the same in ArgentinaIn supermarkets, prices are displayed in pesos in Argentina. 100-150% inflation doesn't mean that prices change every day, but every couple of weeks you can expect a 10-20% increase. In some sectors, mainly real estate and upper-class tourist accomodation (hotels, cabins ...) you may find prices in dollars.However, dollarized prices were much more common in the early 2000s. For example, when MercadoLibre started, they had the option to use prices in dollars, and electronics were almost all priced in USD. I don't know if this was forbidden but now it's much less common, even if inflation was much lower then.Quote from: avikz on August 21, 2023, 05:49:05 AMIt seems Javier Milei is another puppet of America.At the contrary, several US politicians and also IMF functionaries have already expressed they oppose that move, see this La Nación article.",

Dollarization, with the replacement of domestic currency with the U.S. dollar - well, we can allow it as a solution, for some stabilization period. But it does not solve the essence - the problems in the economy. Probably it is necessary to reform the economy, fight corruption, develop high margin sectors of the economy, and similar actions aimed at solving the problem. But do not emphasize solutions that \"hide\" the problems.... Moreover, everyone understands perfectly well that they will only temporarily hide the problems. It is like trying to treat a disease by hiding the manifestations of the disease, instead of treating the cause of the disease itself.",
