  "content": "Hello everyone Im not sure if you already heard about Venom foundation testnet. Surely some of you already did. Ive stumble upon the Zealy Quest campaign and I think this might be a potential requirement for airdrop or at least become eligible for possible whitelist if ever they got a public sale.Ive already done the testnet and been waiting also for additional tasks since I think there would be more to come. Let me know if you knew something or news about.Not sure if invite  link to the discord is allowed posting here but will share if its fine. Though it has some referral link thing.",

I googled and didn't find much information, they are again multi-blockchain but their solution to always make the fee less than $0.0002 means that the network will be centralized and thus a new service with the same old concepts.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on May 13, 2023, 07:59:00 AMNot sure if invite  link to the discord is allowed posting here but will share if its fine. Though it has some referral link thing. You can post referral links if the topic is very useful and the referral links are an addition, but to avoid being reported, you can help with an explanation, and someone may ask you to send them in private if the project is good.",

Something just needs to change IMO",

Here it is mate. https://venom.network/ the task are very organized and easy to understand. I think with the smoothness of the campaign task everyone would join with this. Plus the project already raised $1b so I think they have plenty of funds to improve more before mainnet launch.Quote from: Husires on May 13, 2023, 08:45:42 AMCan you share why you are excited about this project or why they will get whitelisted once they go public? This is an assumption based on the qualifier of sui project for the allowlist and some pojects like cetus and others in which considered participants on the one Ive talking about.

I just dont want to be reported if links with refferal isnt allowed. But the campaign have points if you refer someone cause there is a leaderboard. Thats how zealy want for their every project. Quote from: jacafbiz on May 13, 2023, 09:08:58 AMI just hope this is one of the protocols that people will just test or get involved with just to farm the airdropsYou can check for yourself if the platform seems nice. Just sharing and its up on your judgement to find it interesting or not. Airdrop is an assumption, but most likely they will do to increase community popularity. NOTE: I was informed that the zealy campaign on discord might not be legit since the tean is denying the connection but the Venom testnet on their offcial website is correct. will update once there is a confirm task of zealy from venom but dont engage on task or deal with zealy if this is really fake then someone using venom's name for the 50k venom tokens reward.",
