Today he is lecturing people in the Reputation Section:Quote from: naim027 on November 02, 2022, 06:51:57 AMBeing on a DT Network is more demanding than becoming a Moderator/staff. I know it's not easy for someone to be a Moderator. I also believe moderators maintain many things, including how they will react to posts. I rarely see them tagging anyone. Moderators do their job with a lot of responsibility. But, When it comes to a DT member who is mentally sick, It's like a nuclear bomb. These DT members rule the forum. There are many reasons to ban him, but mostly that he ban evaded repeatedly. Anyway, I am sure he will create new alts and farm them up, but at least it will cost him time and effort. And I hope he's dumb enough to get caught again.",

I didn't notice any positive forum contribution from him, only thing he got was personal financial benefits. I never understood why member who was unbanned was so hard to ban again by moderators, but this happened several times before.Let's not bring cases I reported before, but I remember showing all the proof of members doing multiple ban evasion, and admins never banned him/them. In case of naim027, he should be banned with all of his altaccounts, and I am not saying this with any hate towards him, it's just time for him to move on with his design work in some other places.",

It is quite clear he has more accounts but will they be given the time to build up and do what he primarily wants, which is to join signature campaigns.Quote from: NotATether on November 02, 2022, 03:38:07 PMThis is almost like cryptohunter 2.0, the only difference is that he didn't red-paint everyone (yet), so the only thing we can do is wait him out until he gets bored and leaves (possibly multiple times under different accounts).The desire on his part to join a signature campaign using multiple accounts seems to be the driving factor for him even if he has to try to lie, lie and lie again to try to get out of his own web of deceit.He seems very determined to hang around for as long as possible and he has been logging in using more than just his naim027 account but if he ever did leave I have no doubt he would be posting inconsequential nonsense on an industrial scale before running off.",

This gon' be Incessantly driven. Needless to permaban those accounts .Sandra ðŸ’‡Please do not be too surprised because many things have happened in this forum over the years, it is all part of the drama. Yes he did pretend to catch alt-accounts belonging to other users but that was part of the facade to fool people in to thinking he was a regular member with no ulterior motive.It is clear that skulduggery, threats, cliques, trolls, scams, scammers, alt-accounts and sock-puppets along with attention-seeking hate-driven lowlifes have infested the forum but there are also members here that are countering them because they are genuine, helpful, informative and generous.Put this is way, if one day the signature campaigns are removed from the forum, there will probably be just a tiny minority that will frequent here.No matter how much the naim027 denied it, the reality was he was only in this forum (just like the vast majority) to join signature campaigns. Along with naim027, it was confirmed he used AnotherAlt, Crypt0S0ul, and the aptly named Dic3L0v3r too. There are probably others which will come to light soon.I agree with you, the known accounts should be banned. The OP has already started this thread asking for naim027 to be banned but I would go further and ask for all of his known alt-accounts to be banned. If this thread gains enough momentum and gets spotted by a moderator, there is a possibility all 4 known accounts could be banned.Quote from: decodx on November 02, 2022, 11:23:02 PMQuote from: uchegod-21 on November 02, 2022, 10:16:27 PMIf he should be banned not because of what Poker player said.

I think it says enough about the kind of person he is.That is an excellent collection of the threads you listed, thank you.He created those threads to gain support and respectability, it goes to show exactly what lengths naim027 would go to in order to try to fool people when he was trying to catch alt-accounts of other members. What cannot be denied is that naim027 is a compulsive liar and a drama queen and by using alt-accounts to ban evade it really should mean all his known alt-accounts should be banned permanently.",

Being such a hardened liar is a calling, and the forum will have to endure it until Naim027 himself gets tired of it.You made a very appropriately worded post. I think you were the first to tag him red and that was a long time back very around in early 2022 and that was for merit abuse. Am I right?The problem with some of the so-called influential people you refer to is that half of the time they are like sheep, they listen to one narrative and because it is repeated again and again they tend to believe it. The other times, they tend to push an agenda because it gives them some of control regardless of how much they believe in it. And yes, I agree with you when you say he is already using clean accounts because with him being a compulsive liar and a greedy individual he will not be able to keep away as he aims to join more signature campaigns.

You can see that he has a special ability to manipulate people.I mostly took his comments with caution but it was clear there were many vouching for him in his ban appeal thread that was created by his aptly named Dic3L0v3r alt-account. I never understood why there was that level the sympathy and sentiment as well as goodwill shown by some members towards naim027 and his alt-accounts. Some of those members were (as lovesmayfamilis called them) very influential people and they were also duped by him.Quote from: Poker Player on November 03, 2022, 05:33:44 AMBut as I said, we all make mistakes, the important thing is to realize it and correct it.You took appropriate steps as you saw fit to correct what you saw as a mistake and nobody should hold that against you. Now that you have started this thread I hope it gains enough traction which would lead on to a permanent ban for all his known accounts:naim027 AnotherAlt Crypt0S0ul  and the aptly named Dic3L0v3r",

Yes, I own all four accounts. I was Evading a ban. I tried to pretend like a new user. But I am a chilling guy who doesn't take Everything seriously. I had one account, which is this one. I created this account back in 2017. There was a time I forgot my username and created one more account, which is CryptoS0ul. It has IP ban/Evil Points, and I never logged in on that account. After I returned to the forum in 2021. I saw people have multiple accounts, and it's allowed. So, why not create another account since it's allowed? I created a Dic3l0v3r account and exchanged some merits without knowing that it's not allowed to merit your alts. Which I stopped immediately after I saw it was not allowed. After a couple of months, I accidentally exposed my alt and got two Negative feedback from DT Members to both my account. After a healthy discussion, DT members removed the tag from my naim027 account, and Dic3l0v3r still had the tag. So, its reputation is ruined.After a few days, I thought to create AnotherAlt since Dic3l0v3r has a Negative tag. I created it and paid evil fees as well. I started posting with that account. After a few weeks, a member reported my plagiarized post, and I got perm banned. Those posts were made in my newbie days, and I was unaware of the rules. I created a ban appeal thread and got some community support, while others opposed it. I have sent too many emails to theymos and others. I knocked them on Discord and everywhere I know. I got no reply from Administration. At that time, I lost hope and thought I wouldn't get unbanned anymore. While I was trying to explain to the community what had happened. Some forum members were attacking me personally on the ban appeal thread. I was frustrated and thought I could keep posting with AnotherAlt and see what happened. I had many things to learn from the community, and I used anotheralt to learn some technical things about bitcoin and Bitcoin Full node/core and other things. I knew that I was evading the ban. I never thought I would get unbanned since no Mods responded to me anywhere. I was hopeless. That was the reason for the Ban Evading.Sorry for lying. I was trying to deny everything not to get banned again. But I am not smart enough like others. I can't pretend like someone else. I am mine. Being me gives me inner peace. I feel guilty for what I did. In the meantime, I am not looking for sympathy from the community. I want to face the truth and reality. I can sleep much better now.I never thought I would get unbanned. When I saw Cyrus knew about my ban Appeal, I was already evading the ban. Special thanks to Cyrus.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416864.msg61116237#msg61116237",
