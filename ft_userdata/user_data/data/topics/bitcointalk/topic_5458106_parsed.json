I would always recommended no one to click on show all if your are using the TOR browser. It is better go page by page that may be frustrating for some but is comfortable if you are a privacy focused individual. That's totally true.I've always been confronted by this bugging cloudflare verification process and sometimes, it's useless and even becomes more boring - especially when the images don't show up to be matched... But maybe some browsers are limiting the possibility of privacy invasion, so for that reason, the don't bother showing up images to be matched?.. I uhhhh... partly condemned that action because we've got alot of bots now that could possibly bypass those limits.Apparently, clicking on the \"All pages\" option works effectively without bringing up the bug in other browsers; I've seen users suggesting the VPNs too...that would help if its made to automatically connect while in session.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
