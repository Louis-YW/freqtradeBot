No need to throw around with bad reviews!When responding to users, it's always important you know what you are talking about. Rebroadcasting a transaction to the network does not help at all, so any services claiming that they are accelerating a bitcoin transaction by just rebroadcasting it to the network are liars.What the OP in that thread needed was a service that could include add his transaction into the next block they mine, like ViaBTC and not just rebroadcasting it.Reporting to admins about the negative feedback won't help, as they don't moderate trust ratings. Own up to your mistake and have a sober discussion with the person who left it to you, and they might remove it. It's not too late.",

Well done, buddy, for sharing this topic and for wanting to protect the community from losing their money in vain in these accelerator sites. Frankly, I have not tried any of them before, but what seems to me is that they take the personâ€™s fees without making any impact on the transaction to be accelerated, yes ViaBTC is famous among these sites that trying to imitate the same services, but it also requires large fees in the paid plan, which may exceed the transaction funds, so I do not prefer to waste my money on these acceleration sites, and I prefer to wait instead.Quote from: Charles-Tim on June 22, 2023, 07:56:09 AMWhat if you definitely know the site is a scam?

Scammers have different ways of scamming.I agree with you on that, but since @anubizz was his first mistake and he did not repeat it before, and he justified his position that he recommended these sites through Google, we can now overlook his recommendation, it is good that you deleted the red tag, but I hope that this will be a lesson for him in order not to recommend sites or platforms from search engines without having sufficient research about them or having previously tried them, and so that beginners and others do not lose their money, because this matter may make us throw suspicions about him.",
