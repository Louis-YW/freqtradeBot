      "body": "Your questions are a bit confusing but I will take it this way First as an IT person there some certain skills you might have that could help you render services either on the forum or outside it, just explore the service board and see those on the forums. Secondly concerning bounties or airdrops, they are hardly beneficial anymore most except some few that come through and that would explain why you haven’t earn anything since you have been here. Also the trading part you mentioned is different from bounties. Trading do pay off but it requires you to have capital and essential knowledge of it. Also it has his risk that it is advisable to go into it with money you can afford to lose. The easiest way to earn on the forum currently is through signature campaigns. That too requires you to grow in ranks within the forum before you’re deemed eligible. You can only grow in the forum rank by contributing meaningful either through creating helpful contents or threads you have knowledge about or by sharing your knowledge when one needs help in the forum",

You can at the point when you have attained Full Member Rank apply for any signature campaign that is opened. If you are accepted by the campaign manager, only then will be start earning.

Teaching IT and diving into the world of Bitcoin, that's quite the dynamic duo!But now I wonder, if you are really a teacher teaching students about IT, how come you haven't heard of Bitcoin before? I mean, it's not like Bitcoin is a secret or anything. It's been around since 2009 and has had quite the impact on the world we live in today. So how come you've never heard of it before?Regarding your question about how to manage your time and earn money from trading, there are no simple answers. Everyone's situation is different, which means that there really isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I can tell you, however, that if you're serious about trading and want to make money doing it, then you need to be willing to put in the work. There's no such thing as getting rich quick with cryptocurrency, even if some people may try to convince you otherwise!",

And you have to change that mindset. Follow up on a few trading tips through the link shared by Tabas; it will really help you gain a little knowledge about trading, and when you have learned a few things, you can give it a try and learn how to reduce losses. Please note that crypto currency trading doesn't always guarantee profit. You can also actually earn online. If I get you correctly, you said you teach children IT courses. Those skills you can perfect online. Advertise yourself either in this forum or outside of this place. There are a lot of freelancing sites where you can offer your skills, upload your portfolio, and clients will look at it and pay for your time. You can actually start making real money, which you could use to foot all your bills, adding to your little teaching earnings.",

Always try to manage a few time and watch the market situation and you can set take profit and stop loss and in this way you can manage your order by not giving too much time in trading.",

My advice1-  Focus on learning and not making money. The bounty section will not expose you to the rudiments of Bitcoin.2-Contribute to the forum that is why you need to learn about Bitcoin and the forum.3- To trade you have to be knowledgeable about the trading section. 4-Many people on the forum also have full-time jobs. You don't need to spend all your time in the forum. Your spare time will be enough. Just avoid other time-wasting activities like using social media just for fun.",

I read the rules before posting. Can someone guide me on how I manage my time and earn money from trading what is an effective way to start?This condition reminds me of when I was still teaching and finally ventured into the crypto world to increase my income.Honestly, this will not be easy, or not as easy as other people might get when we initially see them seem successful and get a lot of earnings.But one thing is certain when we are willing to try and be willing to sacrifice a little time to learn more, it is possible that we will get better income or additional income from both forums and trading activities. 1. Regarding bounty participation, to be honest, this is true. The first time I was in this forum was just focusing on joining the bounty program without thinking about what contribution we should make, just making a few posts to meet the requirements. Listen, avoid this method, I've done it for a while at that time and it really didn't work, especially when our rank is still below Full member.It would be better if you would spend a few months of your time learning how to contribute to this forum, improve the quality of your posts, and work on increasing your ranks by earning merit. of course, you have to study more often and in more ways, observe if there is a help board on your local board. Indeed, this is like spending time, however, this really works, if you are serious and want to learn, then you will get various benefits when you can rise to higher ranks and take part in signature campaigns that pay BTC.It won't be easy, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.2. Related to trading activities for earning more money.Are you sure you want to do this? Trading is quite a risky activity, especially for beginners. There is no guarantee that you will get a bigger profit than the possible losses. However, if you are really ready for the risks, learn about crypto trading first, both the exchange to be used, how to analyze and strategy, and various complex things related to trading in the application, including how to choose a coin. Don't easily trust the trading signals on the telegam group, they might help but don't take it right away, study the market in that situation too. Maybe you will also find several online trading courses, if needed, you can follow them to increase your knowledge of trading methods and adjust them to your own abilities and analysis. It will be better if you try to start from Spot trading first, don't try to Future market at the beginning of your trading, this is very risky.",
