Especially with the fact that, it would help the betting platforms gor which this best are been won on. Like the case of drake and stake.com. it surely created waves in the betting or gambling industry and you can agree with me that, some gamblers and even intending gamblers must have been won over in that singular display of won bet and also ability to pay.Again, it would create a trend for the curious mind to follow in studying how these winners place there bets and arrived at a win. That's to say, the wall of fame goes. The question now is,How would these bets be collated and ranged to determine who makes it in.",

We can see smart people in making predictions too so that their speech can be trusted to be followed, there are many interesting things on the board games and rounds, some people often win in a competition. You can check, if I'm not mistaken, also betja always makes a soccer prediction competition every week and the names of the participants are open for everyone to know. I agree with your idea.",

      "body": "Well first of all thanks for reply.Regarding what advantages it would bring to the consumer, I would say that not many directly to be honest.But it is interesting (at least for me) to know who really was champion in some internal tournament.No, I am not referring to those games and rounds contests that are \"simple\", I am referring to the big poker tournaments, like the one I mentioned in my example and to the pool of predictions like the one that is sponsored by Sportsbet of the Premier League that has 50 participants.Returning to the subject of advantages, for example the sponsors will always have their name written in the historical table as I put in the example. (Betnomi poker series, etc.)This could also generate that more pages decide to make their big tournaments (of which there are few today) thus benefiting the entire community.The main thing is to know and get to know each other better and that the newbie who arrives also knows who he is talking to. Because as we all know in the posts there is a lot that he comments on but perhaps few that he really knows.My idea its to do good with a good graphic desing or something like that also can be sponsored. (im not saying im going to do it). But can be do for one of the amazing campaing managers we have here.Sorry if im not well expresed, english its not my mother tongue.",

Players on this forum still value anonymity and are very not happy to share information about their winnings.

In certain cases it is possible only if the gambling site reveals it.

But that would then require casinos to have a sort of communication going on with whoever is pretty much holding the data together, not to mention that they have to ask permission whether the winners would like their names to be publicized. IF it was a local tourney hosted by someone here, then that might be easier though. As for custom tags, that would require talking with the owner and specifying when the title should appear only on a specific thread, I don't think it's worth the effort imo.",
