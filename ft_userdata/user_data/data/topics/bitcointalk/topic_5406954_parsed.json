  "content": "Hello everyone.I would like to introduce here the Duckereum project, a meme currency with no other goal than to make crypto fun again. Duckereum was born from a sad observation: today, meme currencies are not really meme currencies. Every day, new tokens are created, and all of them have almost always the same ambitions: to increase their marketcap at all costs, to find tokenomics that would increase the price of the token, to look for \"utilities\" that would justify buying the token, etc. In the end, there is almost nothing \"funny\" about them, except for a dog in the logo, in general. Where is the fun, light, meme spirit that Doge had brought at its beginning?As for Dogecoin, its mass adoption now means that almost all the talk about it revolves around its dollar value. We see very few memes on Twitter, for example. This is not the spirit that Billy Markus brought, and by his own confession, Doge is never more annoying than when the focus is on its dollar value. Duckereum revives the spirit of Doge. On the website, the team does not hesitate to announce the color: no race to marketcap, no active marketing, no burn, no revolutionary project, no dubious practices to make the price of the token grow. Only one goal: to make crypto fun again, thanks to meme contests organized every Monday.A fun and light currency does not mean that everything must be sloppy. The team is transparent, the wallets of the 3 founders are clearly posted on Medium and trackable, every expense of the community wallet is justified on a Google Sheets, the liquidity has been burned, the contract is extremely simple and has been renounced. No scam possible, except of course if the team disappears and abandons the project. But, that doesn't seem to be their intention: the developer keeps a diary on Medium where he tells the Duckereum adventure, week after week. The team doesn't post screenshots of charts on Twitter, doesn't promise 100000x and stuff like that. If you want to know more, visit Duckereum.com.Thank you for reading.",
