Most of the projects that have been exposed here that they have a plagiarized whitepaper in the Scam Accusations board have the same answers that they have hired a person and blamed this person, how can a project that wants to gain the trust of its investors and achieve future successes start its project with a plagiarized whitepaper without being mention the sources of information they took, and if they did not have one of the work team members who could create a legit whitepaper on his own that carries all the information, then excuse me, you are not professionals at all, anyway, where is the team of this project? I did not find any details about them on the site or in the whitepaper, and where are their Linkedin links?",

I can point you to more than 50 projects that have their team with avatars and/or with NO TEAM they rock for a long time (ie. PIVX). Three weeks? By then, your token sale is already over, you expect people to invest on you first before you show any sign of what a legit project possess, e.g.: original WP and/or clear team details? And why would it need that long? I thought you didn't write your own WP and had to --I'll pretend you did hire someone instead of caught red handed-- \"resort to a freelancer\" simply because English is not your native language, wouldn't that means you could just whip your already prepared draft and have someone to translate them for you in matter of hours?And for NO TEAM that rock for a long time, can you please give us an example of one which also \"outsourced\" their WP and caught plagiarizes many materials?A project who hired a content writer to write their document because \"they-didn't-speak-English-although-their-replies-here-are-damn-near-perfect\" are questionable, a project that's also not bothering to spend several minutes to proofread their materials are double questionable and deserve a flag right away, but that's my owm view, and I tried to give you a benefit of doubt. But certainly we have to protect the benefits of many, i.e.: your future investors, especially as you planned to prove your legitimacy only after the token sale is long over.

We wish you good luck finding a better writer who will serve you with what you want, rather than copy-pasting someone else's work. And good luck for the success of your project as well, we hope you come out as not guilty in this case. 👍",
