You are not likely to get a loan without collateral(valid collateral only) unless someone is going to trust you for no reason.Darkstar_ provides no collateral loan and so does shasan and others but as I said only for trusted users of the fprum. You can check Darkstar_ thread to see who gets a loan without collateral- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3243635.0",

If you ask for a loan without a collateral when you are a newbie, you may even get a negative trust rating which will ruin any future you will potentially have in this forum.The newbie people you see asking for a loan without a collateral are mostly scammers and will receive a negative trust rating sooner or later.",

There are lenders who give loans without collateral, but only to trusted members of the forum, so in a sense, your forum account (that is, your reputation) serves as collateral.",
