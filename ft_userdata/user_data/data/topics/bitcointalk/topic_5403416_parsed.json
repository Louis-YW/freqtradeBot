At this point you will be risking one vital thing that cannot be returned, the time.I have been reading discussion of a certain group for startups.And timing is part of it, ideas are there but one thing for sure that they put as the matter of importance and that is execution. Let us say that many of these startups built at the right time and became unicorns. But it doesn't mean that all of them are going to be successful in the future. I have seen startups that were funded well with huge amounts of money but now, they are nowhere to be found.",
