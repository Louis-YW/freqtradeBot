You can lower the voltage or reduce the frequency to try if it's hashing then gradually increase it later until you found the best settings for voltage/frequency.If didn't work then there is official thread of this Newpac you can find it here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5053833.0The above links are not for Newpac official thread.",

I then removed --gekko-newpac-boost and I got the same problem.Have you replace the my_btc_address with your Bitcoin address?It seems that there issue on the driver you need windows have driver signature verification by default if you disable it the miner might work properly. If nothing works better bring your issue to the official thread here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5053833.2260You can post it there and link this thread there.",
