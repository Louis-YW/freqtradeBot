      "body": "If you can manage to raise €291 on each Friday you are paid or €3500 in 3 months. This means you have a job somewhere that is paying. Why not opt for an Employee Loan or Salary loan in your locality. I think it's far more realistic than expecting a stranger to get you a €2500 non-collateral loan",

But, in actual no one is going to lend him a cent. First of all he's a newbie members and secondly he has no collateral for the loan. Such users always come up with similar stories in order to take advantage of the generosity of the lenders, but now we know their tactics and they won't get loans from this forum.",

You might want to consider building up your reputation first, but brace yourself, it is a marathon, not a sprint. In the meantime, investing in a good old bike could be a solid plan!This very good advice. I hope the OP will take notice and at least try to build up his account here unless it was created specifically for this loan request. As for the bike, that is something he should seriously consider.Quote from: zazarb on September 16, 2023, 08:06:44 PMDid you register on the crypto forum just to get a loan? It's a very strange decision..It certainly seems that way. How on earth he concluded he would get a loan (by creating a new account) is beyond me. There is a chance he is an alt-account being used to fish but I prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt.Quote from: Timelord2067 on September 20, 2023, 12:20:17 AMAre you in regular employment?  If so, you will be able to go to the bank and get a loan on a new car (or a new second hand one at any rate) using the car itself as collateral.  You'll even be able to spread the loans out to be more manageable.Look to ride share companies to get you around (or, gasp - shock !!  Horror !! Public Transport) - buy a scooter or push bike and save the money.Better still, fix your car!Well, he is stating he needs to buy a car and he is already in possession of a car therefore the collateral (for non-forum) is there. You are correct, he should go to the bank or elsewhere using the car as collateral either to fix the existing car or to buy another. Until then, public transport will have to suffice.",
