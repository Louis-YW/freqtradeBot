      "body": "I don't think changing the 'change address' setting will cause transaction timeout nor that message.Also, the message isn't about the issue but the reason why Armory can't display the cause of the timeout.For now, try to add server=1 to your bitcoin.conf file in Bitcoin Core's data directory.For the transaction, you can also try to broadcast the raw transaction though other methods like directly with Bitcoin Core's console (sendrawtransaction) or some blockexporers (blockstream).If any of those rejected it, it will come with an error which will tell what went wrong.To get the 'raw transaction (hex)' of the transaction that you want to send:Create a transaction \"normally\", but instead of clicking the \"Send!\" button below, tick \"create unsigned\" instead.Click \"Continue\" and you'll be presented with an unsigned transaction data that looks like this:=====TXSIGCOLLECT-3gg5Z8fX======================================AQAAAPq/tdoAAAAAAf1aAQEA.....Click \"Copy to Clipboard\", then click \"Continue\"; Paste the previously copied data there and it will show that it's 'unsigned'.Click \"Sign\", \"Continue\" then type your passphrase to sign the transaction.Lastly, it will display \"All Signatures Valid!\"; with that, you can now click \"Copy Raw Tx (Hex)\" to get the raw transaction.The data that you've copied should only contain the characters 0~9 and A-F, try to paste it on a blank text document.You can use that to broadcast the transaction through the options I've given above.Note: for the features to appear, Armory should be in Advanced user mode or higher (User->Advanced).",

      "body": "Quote from: cryptocurious84567 on August 30, 2022, 05:30:48 AM-snip- and it was the time out message that was an error.If Armory had to fallback to RPC to broadcast the transaction and it was rejected by your node, it will know the reason for the timeout based from the RPC call's response.And as the message said, it didn't know the reason for the timeout.But I'm glad it worked out at the end. (prob. just a minor connection issue to Bitcoin Core)",
