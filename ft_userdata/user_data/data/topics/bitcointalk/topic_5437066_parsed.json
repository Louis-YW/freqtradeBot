To the best of my knowledge both Christianity and Islamic religion preaches about peace, for it's only religious fanatics that go their way to causing harm to others under the guise of their religion. Anyway, In my opinion, I think this topic ought to be in serious discussion or off topic.",

The bottom line is that the people who follow these religions are responsible for the good or evil they do. There are good and bad apples in every bunch but the idea that an entire religion’s followers could be classified as missing love is to me a very old way of thinking.",

You need to recognize what has happened in the whole world throughout all the time after the Creation.Since mankind sinned about 7,500 years ago, everything is slowly deteriorating. You can see this from the fact that all the ancient nations understood that there was a God, but at least gods. How do we know this? Look at their architecture. Gods all over the place. We aren't advancing. Rather, we are declining, because we barely feel God around us any longer.God brought Moses into being about 1,500 BC. And through Moses God started the Bible. Thru the Bible people have a written record that backs up their hazy feelings about God and His laws.The Old Testament is simply the way things worked before Jesus came and sacrificed Himself for the sins of the world. The OT is simply examples of what people do when they are in favor of God, and when they are against God... but living in a time when sin had not yet been forgiven by God.We aren't living in a time where sin has not been forgiven. But the universe still exists even after forgiveness, so we are affected by the same laws as the time before the forgiveness. That's why we are supposed to obey the laws, yet do no violence because of the sacrifice Jesus made when He died on the cross. The whole setting has changed in the eyes of God, because of Jesus.",

It's biased or intentionally incorrect interpretation of scientific evidence. This means that it is a religion for those who believe it.When you use scientific methods to check out ancient Israel and the Bible, you will find that the Bible is records, not fantasy. Written records by those who were there are stronger than scientific interpretations of present make-believe-evidence type of evidence.The records that Moses wrote about 3500 years ago are believed by millions, maybe well over a billion. There is power in that. Many people have heard of Aristotle and Plato. But their writings can't compare in strength to those of Moses... who wrote under God's direction, and did miracles under God's direction.",

But as many misconceptions and wrong doctrines arose christianity began to see so many bad omens. Islamic too is shifting from what it was from the beginning and their love is waxing cold.",

This stuff doesn't necessarily state that scientific theories are wrong. Rather, it presents info that is commonly understood, and that shows that much of science is being ignored in the science theories.https://tasc-creationscience.org/other/plaisted/www.cs.unc.edu/_plaisted/ce/index-2.html",

In religion you need to deny the new evidence to preserve faith. Unlike science, religion never adjust views based on evidence. That's the difference. In scientific method we would gladly change our views on any \"gods\" if there would be any evidence pointing at them.And funny how you pick one magic book from history to follow. Why not greek religion? Why not Hindu? Why not Gilgamesh, Quran or Kalevala? Why not apocryphal texts from the bible? Why not ramblings of Charles Manson? Just random pages chosen by few ancient religious leaders. Funny how you don't see those as \"evil elite\". Even with their violent history and what they done with children.

This means that most of science theory will remain in 'theory' status, because there are too many variables that could make these theories incomplete or completely wrong. See the science in https://tasc-creationscience.org/other/plaisted/www.cs.unc.edu/_plaisted/ce/index-2.html. Denying the science is like formulating your own religion.Scientific studies about the OT show that it has barely changed since 250 BC (Dead Sea Scrolls), and that the whole Bible was completed within 100 years AD and has not changed since then. There is nothing unscientific about that. It's science showing how dedicated the people of Ancient Israel were to keeping their records accurate.In addition, there are in the range of 25,000 copies or partial copies of the NT dated to before 350 AD. You can barely find 5 copies of Plato, and less than a thousand of Aristotle. When you get a man like Jesus-God doing miracles, and when you have the Holy spirit backing His believers, science fails without Him.",
