Is it better to wait for a further drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum, or would DCA be better?DCA is usually the best way for Bitcoin. For ETH I cannot tell; ETH may go south badly if it (ever) goes PoS, but you better ask in altcoin area...Quote from: Mark301 on June 14, 2022, 06:54:21 AMWhat will happen next?Sorry, my crystal ball was malfunctioning and I've sent it out for technical inspection, I can't help with this.Quote from: Mark301 on June 14, 2022, 06:54:21 AMHow long do you think the market will take to recover?As I said a few days ago:Quote from: NeuroticFish on June 09, 2022, 06:42:26 PMA rough calculation tells that at around 1.5 years after halving there's the ATH and the downtrend starts, after one more year (more or less) it's basically in the crypto winter and from that point we're getting slowly back to bullish trend, and in 1.5 years there's halving again.So if you do the math in Q4 we should be back on (slow) up trend. Of course, this may or may not happen. Or may happen earlier. Or later. (Sorry, I know it's not helpful, but I don't want to lie to you.)",

After that the cycle will start over again with a new scam type of hype.If you have bought one of those shitcoins, my advice is buckle up, the bumpy ride is just getting started.",

We need to nuke 'em all.I hope so too, I think I'll be fine even though this session will last for a few more months. A bear market is good for clearing the market of useless duplication altcoins. The growth of altcoins so far has been too high and difficult to stop. I'm honestly sick of hearing the lamentations of victims of hype schemes and seasonal projects.",

There must be a phase of accumulation when the big players will slowly gain a position so that there is no pump. But in any case, we should not stand aside and in the event of a continuing fall, gradually buy the coins are interested in in parts.",

There's no time frame when the market price will recover and raise again, but this isn't new in the crypto market or in Bitcoin price, if you remember after the bull run in the year 2017 and in the following last quarter of the year, from $20k it dropped to $3k.  It seems it repeats itself and it looks like it will drop from the previous ATH in 2017 and then maybe will create a massive hype after this, we should always prepare instead of worrying. Bitcoin has matured and it's already mainstream and also gained already a mass adoption, I think that's enough evidence for you to have faith in Bitcoin to invest and hold it for a long period of time. Quote from: Mark301 on June 14, 2022, 06:54:21 AMIs it better to wait for a further drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum, or would DCA be better?In Bitcoin for sure DCA way of buying Bitcoin is a wise idea but in Ethereum, I don't know if that is also good.",

From my observation currently it's something that will happen next year not expecting this year. Because for the market to come up it's through the demands and supply of crypto investors. And the nature of market is very scary that nobody wants to enter's the market to purchase or traders. What we are suggesting now for recovery of market is procrastination and assumptions because nobody regulate crypto market. But due to the red flag of market everyone is afraid of cryptocurrency.",

      "body": "The kind of question that had been asked here many times whenever the Bitcoin price drops. Why is it the number of threads created from a dump is higher than the number of threads created when a pump happens and an ATH? Kind of amazing and sad.   But that's a question for a different section. Anyway, I am just using history as means to identify when Bitcoin could recover. From December 2017 pump to 19.5k it recovered July of 2019 but that's only 11k. So don't expect a pump in a hurry, may not be a sharp one too, the recovery may happen a bit longer, time to just chill around and try to accumulate more Bitcoin.",

Not an investment advice though. from your perception What and when do you think the market will be in equilibrium state. Because i believe that cryptocurrency can get itself accelerated as i portrayed from the first comment after this yea. Because looking from the previous analysis of people early this year, it tells that market can can get elevated like 2024 and 2025, nothing like experiencing of bullish market because of the volatility of cryptocurrency this season. But for the scenario of it value been dropped to 20k. I consciously believe that the falling will not exceed below 20k.",

The recent market conditions has been reported since december 2021; with the trade charts suggesting so, but lots of individuals refused to believe or study the charts on their own.  When it comes to ETH and BTC, Everytime is a good time to own them because they are bullish on the long term",
