  "content": "QuoteExploiters seemed to use a flash loan attack to trick the protocol and steal more than 53 bitcoin, worth $1.1 million, and 10,000 tether (USDT), a stablecoin backed on a 1-1 basis with U.S. dollars. The exploit comes just over two months after attackers stole $15 million worth of cryptocurrencies from Inverse Finance in a similar attack, as previously reported.Blockchain data apparently shows the exploiters flash-borrowed some 27,000 wrapped bitcoin from lending protocol Aave to conduct the attack. The funds were routed through swap service Curve for various stablecoins before being used to remove DOLA, a stablecoin, from Inverse Finance pools.An address tagged as “Inverse Finance Exploiter” on blockchain analysis tool Etherscan apparently sent 900 ether, worth $1 million, to privacy mixer Tornado Cash following the exploit, data shows.Tornado Cash allows users to mask addresses and is sometimes employed by attackers to hide their stolen funds.➥ https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/16/defi-protocol-inverse-finance-exploited-for-12m/another bad day for inverse finance, they got exploited for $1.2 million. due to this news INV token trading volume dropped drastically (72%). whether vulnerabilities to exploits in DeFi make investor funds insecure?  if you have invested in DeFi token please give your opinion!",

I feel this is still a problem that needs to be carefully considered every time developers release a product to go into operation. As users are afflicted with such incidents, it gives a negative view to outsiders as well as insiders when hearing about the market. Perhaps crypto theft has taken place in various forms since early 2022. With hackers using mining and phishing methods to steal millions of dollars from platforms and online from users, It is difficult to determine the effect of this large-scale theft on industry growth. However, it is definitely not a positive thing.",

But even having security audits can still be at risk for some defi product. Well lets say that black hat hacker are way smarter than them and able to manuever their defense.Its not that easy to find an exploit with those smart contract its just that these guys are way trying hard to make this possible to a point they need every loopholes just to secure a perfect exploit.",

Look at how garbage celcius, 4AC and some defi that were starting to collapse. DEFI was still an experiment and this is not even decentralized.

People are not using their talent to enhance the functionalities of the Defi ecosystem but their are just stealing money from the protocols, As it's totally decentralized so it become a little bit hard to find the hacker or intruders than the centralized hacker or intruder. No doubt some-times platform itself leaves some loop holes to get into the system and announce that someone got into our system and uses these protocols to steal money. Now what we can do. in the last 2 years, billions of dollars were stolen due to these poor protocols and i don't think that these developer are that unqualified, To make such an authentic platform they need some good developers, to save the expenses many platform hire low profile developers to do the task but that's a gambling with our money, so over all we can't trust defi unless some good developers came into field to put their hardwork into defi ecosystem with less profits",
