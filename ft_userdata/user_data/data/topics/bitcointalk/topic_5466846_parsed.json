This AI tool is only gives you chart from old rate but btc price depends upon many factors like CPI meeting and other news in the market. Lot of works need for AI in term of trading suggestions and so far manuals analysis is great option.",

He did the opposite, as if the price reached 27777, it would most likely break the resistance, which means the possibility of testing 30,000 and vice versa.

We hope that it will break the next barrier, although I think that the slowdown in the rise indicates that correction is coming.",

Maybe we must be careful for today and tomorrow because we are now at the weekend where there is usually a correction.Right now, the price looks somewhat stable so there is a possibility that it will decline again but let's hope that doesn't happen. But it could be a downturn if negative news is released that forces Bitcoin prices to decline again.If you look at the movement of the line, it looks like there will be a decline but the extent of the decline is still difficult to know. Breaking through the price of $30k still seems difficult to achieve because, at least, Bitcoin must stay above $27k for a while. And the important thing is that we are ready for what happens next.",

      "body": "If an AI merely analyze the market in this manner, the winning rate is relatively low. Why? It only use a daily time frame. If you are going to trade, I believe you should look at the higher time frames, such as monthly and weekly, to discover the exact trend. We can't establish the appropriate trend if we go to the lower time frame without first looking at the htf. We thought the trend was bearish, but when we look at the htf, it's merely a retracement. It is something we should be aware of. If we do not trade against the trend, we have a good chance of winning. Always trade with the trend.",

And the important thing is that we are ready for what happens next.Exceeding the price of $30k is not the problem because we had approached prices of $31k several weeks ago, but the movement towards $30k has become more difficult. Note that we have become difficult to move between 26k and 27k This slow decline will not lead to breaking the $28.5k barrier, let alone $32k. One thousand dollars, so the price will soon lose momentum and decline to $25k.The continuation of the price above $25K is an indication that even people who have been holding Bitcoin for a long time are still making a profit.Image source",
