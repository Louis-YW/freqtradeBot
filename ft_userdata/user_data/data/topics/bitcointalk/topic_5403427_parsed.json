  "content": "Aye, i hope whoever sees this is doing well. Would a bitcoin ecosystem for gamers who play for more than 4hrs a day be a feature of bitcoin? I started executing on an application called Playgon Arena: an idea to help bridge the gap between doing what one loves and earning a living. The limitation of this idea is, it would only bridge that gap for gammers since they'll be rewarded for the wasted time if they play well or consecutively end up at the top 60-70% of the participants. I also believe in bitcoin and was hoping it could add its utility. However, I do not wish to develop a feature as a product. Would one consider this application a feature of bitcoin when it succeeds? What's the worst that could happen? Could utility layers be added to bitcoin to increase it's utility? I've read about the lightning network layer and web 5, would Playgon Arena be considered a utility layer for bitcoin such as those bitcoin features?",
