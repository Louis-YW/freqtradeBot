That way we feel the future of Bitcoin will still continue to contribute to us in general. Don't get me wrong when a country like China controls something means control is no longer yours. Whether there is adoption by countries, Bitcoin remains an asset that will be adopted globally. If you look at Africa now, you might miss a lot because African countries are much more Bitcoin-friendly now. For example, the Central African Republic is the second country after El Salvador to establish a bitcoin legal tender.",

Countries of people don't generally have power over bitcoin or to control it's price movements, what moves the price of bitcoin is the forces of buying or selling. Buying force drives the price to grow while heavy selling results in a significant drop. That is the only way an entity or a central authority can make an impact if they are putting heavy pressure either on buying or selling of the coin.But despite that, I don't see any of that stopping Bitcoin from entering the future with a newer and better position from the previous one, and by position I mean a price that is higher than it's previous ATH.",

We can have a reset and a new start without them as that's where bitcoin have came from. Quote from: Blisszi on February 19, 2023, 02:09:12 PMDo nations or people have power over bitcoin price regulations?The nations can do influence the price of bitcoin and the same goes for the people that have a huge influence in certain markets. Anything they say can truly heavily influence the price whether it's good or bad but, usually, it's all about the bad news or statements.Quote from: Blisszi on February 19, 2023, 02:09:12 PMWhat is your speculation if bitcoin keeps revaluing in price?It's a normal thing for bitcoin. We'll have to wait until the next halving and when it's done, you'll see how great the value would be.Quote from: Blisszi on February 19, 2023, 02:09:12 PMDo you see a good outlook soon?Why not?

What do you think can happen after this? Well, there will be no more adoptions so the price will either be stagnant or it will decline since a Bitcoin being banned in some nations is a kind of bad news and we all know that there are people who panic sells after they hear such news.I just want to say that talks like this matters a lot because it can make or break Bitcoin. We don't know if what future awaits with Bitcoin but at this point, Bitcoin is now doing great and we expect that it will perform better these upcoming months and years.",

In specific I've experienced the participation of China in the recent years and later it went for a complete ban which is unexpected. The goodness depends on the users, amidst all the negative incidents that had happened out of the powerful nations we were able to see good progress in the cryptomarket. So, it is not about the powerful nations, but the people who decides the market. Powerful nations could help with the mass adoption which can make a wider market for bitcoin.",

First of all China tries to ban it as much as they can, that's true, but USA doesn't, they allow crypto investments and even crypto companies, hell coinbase is a stock market listed company at this moment, you don't get more allowed than that. On the other hand, Africa is a continent, not a nation and each nation in Africa has a different approach to it so we can't just say it like it's one thing, some like it, some don't.So as you can see, the world is not approaching it all at once with the same view, there will be some nations who support it, and there will be some nations who are against it.",

This might happen again but on different powerful nation, It would be temporary but there's a chance that they will take the opportunity to buy then lift the ban again. I agree that bitcoin exist without the help of big countries  but I think that sooner or later we  will come to a situation where big nations will be the one who will accumulate bitcoin as there additional or alternative reserves.",
