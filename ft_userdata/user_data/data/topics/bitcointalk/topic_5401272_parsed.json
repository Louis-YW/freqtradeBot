  "content": "Since im relatively new to the space(2.5 years) i wanted to share some insights to newbies, i gained over the years.Dont just check charts all day and focus on price, hoping you will get rich, when youre still learning about Bitcoin. Desperation for money is the thing that keeps us slaves in the first place. Price should be the last thing were worried about cuz theres a lot of catching up to do. Just don’t feed whales or shitcoins.And Bitcoin is not the get rich quick scheme some new investors are hoping for. But it can enable you to do things no other asset can do. And for this fact alone it’s priceless already.Try to imagine that Btc had no price and try to understand everything that is not related to price first.Like holding ur own keys safely, buying without kyc, running ur own node, understanding the architecture behind it and why satoshi invented it. But that’s just the beginning.Our current system thrives on misinformation and desperation, just look outside or open the news and you’ll understand what i mean. We’re all stuck in this cage together.Knowledge is power in this world and those who refuse to educate themselves or stay gullible will get exploited. Bitcoin thrives on education and self-sovereignty, the more educated and self-sorveign we become, the more bitcoin will thrive, we can all do our part.We’re closer to a free monetary system than any human has ever been before us. Let’s spend our energy on making this work, instead of focusing on other 1000x pumps.Everything in this world is made up by people that are no smarter than us, like steve jobs said. We can do this if we all stick together.Satoshi did his part, and now it’s our part to finish the job.There’s nothing that can stop us anymore, if we all do our individual proof of work. We entered this world with nothing and will leave it with nothing again. The only thing that will be remembered about us is how we used our time, and if we only chased wealth, we do the same thing that billions are doing rn and no one will give af. So let’s finish the job satoshi and the other bitcoiners started and actually do something for the world.",

You inspired me) In my opinion we could not be able to reach the free monetary system neither without Bitcoin or with it because it doesn't depends on how many educated human beings believe in this thing or invest their money, it's just about how the things work. It will be impossible to change the way of economic by ourselves in the world without some huge country level changes. It seems for me like the governments aren't going to accept Bitcoin and include it as a part of an global economic system (at least in the possible future).",

There will be a point where the average person will be fed up with the current system and thats where bitcoin shines. The more people stand behing bitcoin, the harder it will be for them to ban it. And even if it was banned it will be resilient, the more people already hold their own keys and run their own nodes the harder it will be for a ban to have any effects, it could even be positive, because it forces us to use more decentralized services. I completely agree. Technologies like bitcoin are much more than charts and candles, it is a system of money that anyone can utilize as everyone else. All other means of exchanges take a bureaucratic approach and not everyone can use it like everyone else, more like it is designed to work for a select few. This is truer in poor and middle class nations.Quote from: tadamichi on June 04, 2022, 10:56:34 AMThats where the knowledge part comes into play, because the more educated bitcoiners we have, the easier it will be to withstand future attacks(And there will be many social attacks on the protocol and so on). Bitcoins game theory is just on point and i think it will play out the more good actors we have in it. And if countries refuse to take in bitcoin and keep this current broken system alive, then bitcoin will keep increasing in value and it will attract more and more people. So i think if we play our cards right, we can do it, theyre in the loosing position, not us, we just gotta withstand attacks now and keep it alive as best we can.Having any sort of general consensus would be difficult as the scene is filled with so many different actors right now, the most plausible approach is not normalizing processes that undermine the decentralization of bitcoin, no matter how popular they become, like, storing on exchanges, freely submitting KYC documents, etc.",

It spreads slowly and has non-stop “variants” growing that began with altcoins, then NFTs, etc. The blockchain cannot be controlled by the government and banks as it is decentralized. No matter how many times they are trying to take it down, they can’t do it. So yeah Bitcoin is thriving despite the circumstances that we are in these days.

With the rise of the Internet borders became obsolete, the whole world is connected now. Which makes it so important to educate ourselves. Knowledge became a resource that can be accessed online through online courses or Wikipedia. It's up to us to keep educating ourselves and move forward in the world.   Self-sovereignty is a powerful tool that can make people more interested in politics and reduce corruption in the government. The more people are directly involved with politics and the government, the more transparent things will be. There should be a layer of ordinary people checking what the politicians are doing and verifying everything is okay.",

With the current trend in the market, bitcoin has become the instrument of trading and earning profits rather than transacting for the commodities, day to-day stuff buying and selling etc. Bitcoin can have it's own value once they start accepting the payments in btc to etc format and consider USD as only measure of unit. I mean holding gold bar is alway prestigious thing, no matter the value because we always know back of the mind that it's fiat value is always going to upgrade with the time. That sort of feeling one should start getting while holding bitcoins in their wallets. Definitely we should have it as profiting asset but first it should be adopted as it is in terms of its functionality and technicality.",

A lot of the people in Africa and other 3rd world countries does not get good education...and their government has dumbed down the education system on purpose. (A corrupt government can only thrive in a situation where citizens fear them and where they do not question their rules and decisions) Bitcoin can look very complicated to a lot of people, but not all people want to know the intricacies of this technology.

Its also important to note that government's influence is still heavily on the system and it rather acts as a double edged sword. In one instance, the critics brings about a gradual growth and acceptance while, should it be proclaimed acceptable, it would flourish at a fast pace.

If more countries will adopt it, we can’t forget to train normies too on using it. Learning the technicalities behind bitcoin and helping core development out.
