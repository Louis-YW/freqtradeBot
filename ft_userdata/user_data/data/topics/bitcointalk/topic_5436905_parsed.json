  "content": "I just received email from Trezor that their official Password Manager will no longer be maintained after June 30, 2023.This was probably done because Chrome is making big changes in their browser and Trezor developers don't have enough resources to keep up with this.If you used Trezor for this purpose than it's time to think about migration to other applications, and Trezor provided instructions for that on their website.Click on your user name and select Export storage, and you will find them in file trezor-export.csv.https://trezor.io/learn/a/trezor-password-managerTrezor first suggesting for replacement is Bitwarden, but I would strongly suggest you first try KeePass or some of it's forks like KeePassXC for desktop and KeePassDX for mobileThey are all open source and they work perfectly without use of any centralized server.Don't use LastPass that was hacked several times, and I see Trezor still have them listed on their website!Trezor Password Manager is open source app and there is always a chance someone could fork it and continue maintaining it:https://github.com/trezor/trezor-password-manager",

I would have not expected them to stop giving it support this way, anyways, I makes some sense if their main marketing is to those who want to keep Bitcoin safely.Also, I thought it would not matter much what service of password managing one chose?Because as far as I understood during my brief investigation, the data is encrypted and decrypted using the trezor itself?",

That's right. Many people probably don't even know about it because it's not available with the default settings. It's one of their experimental features that can be activated through the developer mode in the settings of Ledger Live. https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017501380-Passwords?docs=true I have never tried it, and I assume it's a painful process entering complex passwords and finding the characters you want with the left/right buttons on the Ledger HWs.",

I can definitely see someone or some company deciding to provide a password manager on their hardware wallet software, but there are alternatives such as KeePass if they want to fork from existing software. At the end of the day, it is just a personal choice though, so I'll see if there are any new forks of it.Quote from: dkbit98 on January 26, 2023, 09:14:04 PMBitwarden is not bad but I don't want to use any cloud service aka other people computer, so I would only used it as self hosted.I remember trying to self-host Bitwarden but failed because I need to register a domain that points to my device. Is this still the case or can I point to my local IP address now? I think the problem is also related to SSL encryption certificate. In the end, I choose KeePass. Syncing manually can be a pain sometimes but it is not so bad since I just use 2 devices regularly. Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 28, 2023, 09:53:44 AM1Password (which mentioned on Trezor website as alternative) also had few security incident and IMO should be avoided.I won't be surprised if other centralized platforms have similar hiccups but are not yet exposed. I'd never use any centralized password manager even if it is convenient to use. They should recommend more open-source password managers as an alternative on that page.",
