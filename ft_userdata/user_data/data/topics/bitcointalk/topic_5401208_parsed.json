  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm a novice programmer and as my pet-project I've created an online tool https://equivolu.me that allows you to better visualize important support and resistance levels. In general, this is the same candlestick chart, but each candle has the same volume (10 or 100 BTC) and the volume indicator shows the percentage of the volume of buy transactions. I hope someone finds this useful for themselves.https://equivolu.me/images/equivolume.pngOn Binance, you canâ€™t see at what price this large volume passedhttps://equivolu.me/images/equivolume.pngMy service allows you to see not only the price at which large transactions are made, but also the direction of transactions.I will be glad to answer your questions",

      "body": "Thank you for your review.There is no periods on my charts, only volume and price. Algoritm close candle not at some moment in time but when volume go up to 10 or 100 BTC. I tried to make volume trigger at 1000 BTC but in this case chart is almost the same like on Binance.I have very cheap VPS, therefore I can't store large amount of data. It's not a commertial product, just a pet-project. If I will see that people start using it, I will buy better server and will make more deep history. But now I just want to know what traders think about my idea of new method drawing charts.",

Since the JS code is from Tradingview you can maybe get more features that you can add to your chart.Also, try to add news aggregator it is easy to add in your site you can use this widget below- https://cryptopanic.com/developers/widgets/",

I will definitely add this news aggregator to my site.Yes, my tool is based on tradingview lightweight chart library, but I don't want to add indicators. My main point was to trow avay everything superfluous from chart, even time. Maybe I will add MA in near future.Purpose of my tool is not trading per se, because i'm newbie in programming and there could be mistakes in my code, I just wanted to share a new way to build a chart. Maybe it will lead someone to new trading ideas.",

      "body": "Any practical application of it? Like how will it be used?I'm interested because when you know the current volume on a certain transaction that you have, would it correlate to how much change could it have with the following BTC price? Or would it just be purely informational when it comes to knowing the volume?",
