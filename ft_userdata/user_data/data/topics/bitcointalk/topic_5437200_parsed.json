  "content": "Tonight marked the defeat of Iranian military enterprises. The goal is to reduce the danger from rabid terrorists who dream of destroying Israel, the secondary effect is to stop or minimize the supply of UAVs and possibly ballistic missiles from Iran, the technologically backward Russian army.Where it leads ? There are not many options, but very few real ones. The regime of fanatics will probably try to raise a tantrum against Israel, but ... The Iranian regime of the ayatollah will not dare to start real military operations against Israel. They know perfectly well that although relations between Israel and the United States are tense, the United States guarantees the preservation of Israel. And the blow to Iran will be global. There is nothing like the Russian army - destroying peaceful cities and killing unarmed citizens of Ukraine. The blow will be inflicted on the top of Iran, the generals, the \"tame dogs of the regime\" such as the guards, warehouses, barracks. Those. totalitarian power will be destroyed in the literal sense, from the head to the servants, and power will be transferred to the free people of Iran!Also waiting for Russia. After its start of economic terror against the EU, about 15 years ago, before unleashing a terrorist war in Europe, against Ukraine, Russia made itself a pariah all over the world, revealing all the fakeness of its politics, economy, military power. But if Iran is a \"local terrorist\", then Russia is an international terrorist, without any morality. Therefore, Russia is waiting not only for demilitarization, but also for total denazification, and ideally, the division of Russia into several independent states.Interested in your opinion about the 3-5-10 year prospects for the process of \"pacifying\" the international terrorists mentioned above and others falling under their description.By the way came very interesting news from Iran.I won’t write about the destruction statistics yet, not all the data is available yet, but a significant number of production sites, warehouses and much more have been destroyed. But what is the interesting nuance?Iran's air defense includes Russian \"unparalleled\", according to the Kremlin, \"super air defense systems\". Namely:S-300 ZRK 4 divisionsS-200 ZRK 10Tor-M1 ZRK 29Pantsir-S1 SAM about 20the last two positions are used to protect the most important nuclear industry facilities and strategically important industries. And it was they who ... missed 90% of the strikes on objects ON THEIR territory. A good call to those who are still thinking about buying Russian iron junk, which is passed off as \"unparalleled weapons\" Oh yes. According to Iran's official data, almost all drones / missiles were shot down ... And the fire and explosions are all special effects planned in advance )))",

This is not peace, simply because people all die anyway. True peace will only be accomplished when Jesus returns, Satan is thrown into the Lake of Fire (Hell) that this universe will become, and the people who believe in Jesus are taken to Heaven. Then there will be peace for those who remain... in Heaven.However, as the saying goes, \"There is no rest for the wicked.\" So, the people in Hell won't have any real peace throughout eternity, simply because they wouldn't accept Jesus in this life. If you think that Hell is all God's fault, Jesus is placing the absolute best construction on the life of every unbeliever. He doesn't want anyone to go to Hell. He is giving all people the best chance that they could possibly get.",

World peace can only be achieved by stopping all military uses of nuclear energy, dismantling dangerous weapons for all countries, and issuing an international law that prohibits all nuclear military activities or any types of weapons of mass destruction.I agree with this. The US START/START2 initiatives were the beginnings of such a process. But there are nuances here. It is difficult to explain from the point of view of politics / geolithics and other things. I will explain with a simpler example. On the example of our body, which is closer and more understandable to us  But in a greatly simplified description:So, in order for us not to get sick, we have an immune system, the basis of which is T-lymphocytes. This is a weapon. T-lymphocytes KILL hostile cells. the organism is our Earth, our world. Cells are countries and people. Hostile cells - cells that tend to disrupt the work of our body and lead to its death. Do you understand what I mean?In order for us to live as nature intended, we must not have or have a limited number of harmful cells. In order for the body to protect itself and prevent some cells from killing us. Everything is clear and everything is fine. If we are talking about disarming EVERYONE, we are also talking about \"destroy the immune (read - protective) system.\" OK. As practice shows, sometimes, very rarely, the immune system fails, and leads, for example, to autoimmune diseases. This is when the immune system \"overdid it\" and negatively affected the correct, healthy cells. Unfortunately, nothing is perfectOn the one hand, you can put a person in ideal conditions, remove all harmful cells, \"turn off\" the immune system. Question - does this guarantee us 100% quality life? The answer is simple - NO!Why ? Because there is a concept of mutations that occur constantly, and sooner or later, as a result of the RIGHT process, the wrong cells will appear. And they won't meet any resistance... The body will be destroyed very quickly, due to the fact that \"everyone is disarmed\" / the immune system is disabled.Therefore, there must be a controlling and restraining function in the world .. And therefore, to disarm everyone is to harm yourself",

Radical Islam is not to be trusted.Here, too, there are nuances... We must also understand \"where the legs\" of international terrorism come from, who finances, arms and supports them. I can recall - but the concept of bloody terror originated in the USSR in the 1920s, Ulyanov / Lenin was the ideologist, and already at the end of the 50s of the last century, absolutely officially the USSR began to develop \"classic terrorism\" and develop \"fundamental principles\", with such decisions like hijacking, hostage taking, bombings in residential areas, sabotage, assassination of foreign leaders, training terrorists for other countries. Just read the history of what terrorism was like until the 60s of the last century, and read what it was actively doing  USSR in the specified period of time ...I will give you one sentence. Alexander Sakharovsky, who headed Soviet foreign intelligence at the time, declared: \"In today's world, when the nuclear bomb has made the use of military force obsolete, terrorism must become our main weapon\"...Iran, as for me, is just a tool in the hands of other people, like many other terrorist or anti-human regimes and groups. And one thing connects them - they have one \"womb of terrorism.\" I will not say that all world terrorists are a brood of one nest, but the main ones that appeared in the 1960-1970s, yes. And it was they who then \"inspired\" others to do this ...PS By the way, I'm almost sure that Iran's support for terrorist Russia is not just like that, not money is of interest to Iran. Most likely, Russia promised to realize Iran's old dream - and help them develop nuclear weapons, supply technology, etc. And this is \"management and development of world terrorism\"",

That's right, otherwise crime will swallow the world.And regarding those put \"in prison and destroyed families\"1. Pay taxes, follow the laws of the country you have chosen and everything will be fine! Although I agree - there are no ideal laws. In the same Russia - no better, maybe even worse - executive services easily throw out into the street (and this is in the literal sense of the word), for example, old people who have a meager pension and a huge cost of utilities (although propaganda says that pensions are high and services very cheap).2. Over the past 20 years, how many families have been destroyed in the United States due to non-payment of taxes? And I'll tell you the order of the DESTROYED people directly by the hands of Russia. And many millions more - really lost everything, were forced to leave their places of residence, lose relatives, work, savings, home ... I'm not talking about Ukraine, or rather not only about Ukraine. This is Georgia, and Moldova, and Syria, .... And this is the tip of the iceberg, where Russia did it directly with its own hands!Or \"planted for non-payment of taxes\" - all cause more compassion?",

Considering that the Russian world is synonymous with the words destruction, grief, misfortune, pain, suffering, degradation, ...It would be more correct to say this - the Earth is a rather wise organism. But sometimes in the body of the body there are such cancerous tumors. And if they are not destroyed, including metastases such as the DNR, LNR, PMR, Abkhazia, etc. - the world will be stricken with cancer and perish. Understand, most likely you don’t quite understand what modern Russia, the previous USSR, and a little older Muscovy are! These are formations that never gave anything to the world and people, but only took, destroyed, or drove into slavery .. Even if they gave the appearance of something, they took hundreds of times more. I lived in the USSR, I saw it all with my own eyes ... fate bless you so as not to be a citizen of such a country! And I saw with my own eyes what the citizens of Russia did in the suburbs of Kyiv - Bucha, Irpen and many other cities and villages.

Yet, life goes on as usual, with Russia more solidified internally. There don't seem to be many shortages. Even the sanctions have had their benefits for Russia.Ukraine war: life on Russia’s home front after ten months of conflicthttps://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-life-on-russias-home-front-after-ten-months-of-conflict-197315It’s been a year since I last visited Russia. Back then, most people I met thought the prospects of a war with Ukraine were very remote, despite the massive troops build-up on the border. So I was curious to see how attitudes had changed since then. Equally important was to see for myself how the war has changed life in Russia.The first surprise was how normal life was. Despite all the media reports of doom and gloom as a result of western sanctions, everything works just as before. Domestic banking is working, salaries and pensions are paid on time, ubiquitous e-commerce is bustling with activity, the shops are stuffed with food and consumer goods. In St Petersburg, at least, I’ve struggled to notice any change in daily life compared to January 2021.Yet, digging deeper and the impact of sanctions is there.
