      "body": "A lot of people in the market are always looking forward to Friday, but my view is it's not the number of bitcoins that affects the bitcoin price. It's about demand. If the majority of people believe that the price will go up, they buy bitcoin which then causes the increase. If they believe it will decrease, they sell which causes the decline.They do however issue new bitcoins at a predictable rate, so you can rest assured that you will never run out and never earn again.Generally, the price of bitcoin is completely dependent on the market, which is made up of individual traders. These market participants decide whether they want to buy or sell bitcoin based on what they think will happen in the future. There are many factors that determine how much someone is willing to pay for a bitcoin, and even what they actually want to use it for.",

From the historical analysis of bitcoin market, even this bear market will still go up. In any business wholesalers buy when the particular goods is in very low price and resell it when the price goes up. I can remember in my village when fuel price was very low, black marketers would buy it and store it in a large quantities and when the price goes up, they will come out and sell it. That is how I am also seeing in bitcoin. This is the best time to buy if there is money because after now bitcoin will go up and once bitcoin goes up it will be hard for low salary earners to buy at that time.",

Futures markets are a powerful tool in the financial world, and they are especially useful for commodities like oil and gas. If there's a big swing in prices on the futures market it could suggest that there are big changes coming to the actual market. If the price of a commodity on the futures market is higher than its current price in real time, it could mean that people are betting on a future rise in price. So if you have a sense of what the future will be like and you think it will be good or bad, then you can use that information to make trading decisions.",
