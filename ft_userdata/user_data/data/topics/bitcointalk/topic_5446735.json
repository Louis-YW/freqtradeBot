If you can be good with security and have good Internet surfing behavior, a single signature wallet can be enough for you.However, of course a multi signature wallet is better (if you don't buy hardware wallet) but if it is your first try with it, you should use a Bitcoin testnet to practice or if you use bitcoin mainnet to test, only set up a wallet with very small bitcoin amount that is enough to test transaction in and out with multi-sign.If you practice incorrectly, loss is minimal.If your practice is good, you can deposit more bitcoin to that multi-sign wallet.",

In short, in the case of Khaled, you need any two signatures to perform the transaction. Imagine it as a door, and that door opens with any two of the four keys, meaning that you only need two keys. To open the door, but you cannot do that with one, and if two keys are lost, you can still open that door.For more please read: - Set Up Multi Signature Wallet  - Help me to create a multisignature wallet with Electrum - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multi-signature",

And I think it's already quite difficult to manage the 3 different locations with the 2-of-3 multisig.Since your goal is to make a cold wallet (you don't make transfers regularly, maybe just once a year or so), I think you have to bear with this backup activity. At the end of the day, security is your goal. I'd encourage you to think hard to find where and how you should store those backups. There are many good threads around this topic, for example, this one[1]. If you want to read more, just search \"seed backup\" on this forum. Quote from: bitcoin_user on March 30, 2023, 06:24:45 AMThe desktop of the 2-of-3 is not airgapped, it's a \"normal\" computer, used for all other things. Each element of the 2-of-3 vault has its own weak point (the hardware wallet is the stronger element, though), sure:The desktop can get a virus and be stolen, as well as the mobile phone. Consider using an air-gapped device as part of your setup. While the chance that both your phone and PC got compromised at the same time is low, I'd consider them as one of the risks that need to be solved. You can buy a cheap phone and use a live OS to set up your multi-sig, for example. There are obviously some risks regardless of what method you choose, but I think using a daily PC is not that great if you want to set up a cold wallet.

      "body": "Taking a step back from worrying about your seed phrases and back ups and looking at the bigger picture here, your multi-sig idea is not a great one.There is not much point including a hardware wallet as part of a 2-of-3 multi-sig when the other two cosigners are highly insecure hot wallets (one on a phone, and one on a computer). It is exponentially more likely that someone is able to compromise your two hot wallets than your single hardware wallet, so the hardware wallet adds zero additional security. In fact, I would argue that a standard single signature wallet set up properly on a good hardware wallet is probably safer than a multi-sig involving two insecure hot wallets. In your situation I would probably set up the Trezor and then add an additional passphrase and use that passphrased wallet as my cold storage, backing up the seed phrase and the passphrase separately.If you are desperate to use a multi-sig, then you should do so with either multiple hardware wallets or airgapped devices. Adding hot wallets as you have done weakens the security rather than improves it.",

So, you multiply by 3 the cumbersomeness of this configuration.Can I spare myself all of those? What do you think?Thanks!Hello! Are the desktop and the mobile phone connected to the internet?EDIT:I just read the previous post by o_e_l_e_o. That's exactly my point. Your multisig configuration is not great.Instead what I have done may give you an idea. I have a signing device, which I have used to create 3 wallets. I backed-up the seed phrases and I used my signing device in order to create 3 corresponding QR codes that would help me retrieve the private keys. Essentially, the QR code and the seed phrase do the exact same thing, as they help me \"recover\" my wallet.Finally I have a backup of my 3 extended public keys. This is a crucial step!During this process I have not been exposed to the internet at any time.Then I have loaded my public keys in my BlueWallet app in order to be able to monitor my multisig vault and to produce addresses and send them to anyone who want to pay me.So, for each wallet I have:1 QR code1 seed phrase3 extended public keys -> here you can do some tricks and not save all the public keys together for privacy reasons. In case someone gets one of my packets, they wouldn't be able to steal my money, but they would be able to monitor my transactions. I know that's not the best approach, but I can live with it! I know the alternatives but for some reason I didn't feel comfortable to follow them and since we talk about money, I preferred to live with this drawback.Therefore, I have created 3 packets (one for each wallet). I have distributed them to 3 different places. Of course, I have tested that I was able to sign transactions with any 2 of my 3 wallets! An important thing here is that you should delete the vault from BlueWallet every time you repeat the experiment, in order for you to get familiar with importing the extended public keys as well.",

For any m-of-n multi-sig, then you only need to back up n minus m number of xpubs alongside each seed phrase (provided you pick the correct ones) and still have full redundancy and yet also protect your privacy.For example, using your 2-of-3 system, then you back up 3-2 = 1 xpub alongside each seed phrase, and your 3 back ups would look like this:Back up 1: Seed A, xpub BBack up 2: Seed B, xpub CBack up 3: Seed C, xpub AAs you can see, the compromise of any one back up is insufficient for an attacker to spy on your wallet, while you still only need to recover any 2 back ups to have all the information needed to restore your wallet.",

So I owe you many thanks!In general, let's conclude that there is no point having a n-of-m system, where many of your keys are stored online. Ideally, you want none of them to be online.Finally, let me give you an alternative, which I think is still better than your current system. I keep suggesting people to create a fully offline wallet and add a passphrase. This is more than enough, unless of course you want to learn better practices, which is of course advisable, but not necessary.You could back-up a simple singlesig wallet with a passphrase and maintain 3 vaults and split the backup as follows:vault1: words 1-6 + passphrasevault2: words 7-12 + passphrasevault3: words 1-12In this case, losing one of the vaults wouldn't lead to losing your money. Only 2 of the backups are required to sign a transaction. What you gain with this system is that you wouldn't have to trust your memory at all. You have everything backed-up, even the passphrase.",

I do agree. There is no doubt that setting up and using a multi-sig wallet is harder than setting up a standard wallet, with or without an additional passphrase.I like passphrases. I think more people should use them. They provide additional security should your seed phrase back up be discovered, and they also provide plausible deniability in the event of a $5 wrench attack. However, in most cases, people will still use them on a hot wallet. At some point you need to progress to a safer set up. This could take three basic forms - multi-sig, airgapped, or hardware. Even better if you use some combination of the three, and still use passphrases on top of that too.So yes, multi-sigs are more complicated to set up and use, but at some point it becomes worth it to just sit down and learn how to use something more complicated than a standard hot wallet for your own safety.",
