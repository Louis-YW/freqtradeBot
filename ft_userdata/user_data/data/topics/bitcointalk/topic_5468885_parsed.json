Sorry to say this but that wasn’t a wise decision.The reason why we always calculate how much we are going to put in our gambling account is to make sure we don’t over spend and trust me if you have up to a million dollars in your gambling account you won’t be aware of when you’ll finish everything and that’s why you see people come to the forum and give stories of how they spent over ten thousand dollars in a week on their gambling account and for you to have been receiving your payment in your account seems like a dumb mistake IMO. I’d suggest you change your wallet address to your non-custodial wallet address and after receiving each payment you can then be depositing bit by bit into your account rather than just putting everything at once. But if your main purpose of participating in a signature campaign is to fund your gambling account then no issue with that.",

And you have to start learning to limit yourself so you don't lose control of your emotions.You can withdraw all the money from the payment to another wallet so you won't be able to use the money to gamble. But it all depends on you because many are tempted to use it for gambling. They want to increase their balance by gambling but in reality, they lose all their money several times.@OP, you have to learn to control yourself and for the next payment, you have to withdraw your payment money.

      "body": "I was thinking this was some sort of signature payment from a casino project that you are promoting, which made their payment directly into your gambling account. Not until I read the comment from the first commenter did I understand where all this is coming from. I think that's not a wise idea to use a betting platform wallet as your receiving address for signature payment. Let's take the uncontrolled means of gambling aside first; it's too risky. This payment is like your salary, and you receiving it into a casino means you are putting it at risk. And what if you use a casino that you can't just make a deposit and withdraw immediately without meeting the wagering requirements that are set in order to reduce the use of the casino for money laundering activities? What do you think will be the faith of the money? You have to wager your payment and might end up losing all of it just by trying to clean up those funds. And another thing is that you are using a means that doesn't give you total control over funds, as you might not be able to use your bitcoin when you want to use it sometimes. Maybe the casino has some technical issue that can delay withdrawal, or any of such, and what if the casino gets hacked or there is any other activity? Well, I am glad you have realised your own mistake and made a redirection towards such a choice again in the future.",

I may be the only one to say this but I doubt things would have changed. I'm only making this assumption based on your gambling impulse as you shared in the OP. It wouldn't take that long to fund your casino wallet if you felt the urge to play so you'll bet them regardless. Nothing wrong with using gambling accounts except maybe the added fees you'll pay when withdrawing.",

Of them 5 don't bet anything, about 10 bet part of what they eran in the signature campaign but withdraw part, and another 5 are degenerate gamblers who actually fund the signature campaign with their losses.",

Even with my current signature that pays me into a stake account directly,  I still have a percentage set on the amount of balance I leave on the casino at each time and that is all aimed at controlling my gambling activities",

It is a deliberate act that you submitted your gambling account address to be paid on your signature campaign, so how is there a mistake? You have submitted your gambling address to be paid on it so that it would be easier for you to have a bankroll to wager from  Seriously, you don't tempt a dog by leaving a bone for it, when you don't want to eat a meat then you don't need to use your teeth as a knife to cut it.
