And like this i don’t see a point of using Quickex if i easily can use Other swap with lower minimums.This is actually a good giveaway, your exchanger has already a great amount of positive reviews on Bestchange, i would love to give it a try and participate if only your minimum allowed amount to trade is not that high.",

Regarding fees on QuickEx, the platform primarily charges a flat 0.5% fee on transactions as you mentioned. Additional fees, if any, could be related to the network fees for deposits and withdrawals. These fees are generally determined by the blockchain network of the specific cryptocurrency you are dealing with and are not controlled by QuickEx. It's essential to check the platform's latest fee structure for any updates or additional fees that might apply.",
