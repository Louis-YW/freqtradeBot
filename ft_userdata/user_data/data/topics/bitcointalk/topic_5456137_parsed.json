Clarify first if you preferred KYC because this will make your buying experience easier. Binance offer debit card purchase in both P2P and or their buy with Fiat. Binance accepts multiple country so you will have no problem if your country is not that strict.You can try also agoradesk.com if you have an online account for your debit card to transfer funds.",

You can use a lot of exchange site that accepts International debit/credit card to buy crypto from their site. You may have a look at Binance as well as Coinbase. But for both case, you must have your own card.",
