(Lost in the sense that the owners lost the access key to them.)What we can know is that more than 19,348,612 bitcoins have already been issued. And what we also know is that a percentage of that value will most likely never circulate (for the reasons given above).",

All you can see if you track down the circulating supply are addresses holding huge and small amounts of bitcoin, which have been moving from one place to another. But to know the people in possession of those assets in circulation, it's not entirely possible.",

Your questions shows you don't quite understand how Bitcoin works, so mind you that this scenario isn't peculiar to only James Howells, the only way to spend Bitcoins is if you have the key, anybody who loses their key, has lost their Bitcoin.Quote from: Chilwell on April 17, 2023, 08:52:44 AMCan it be possible to know the people the are in position of all the bitcoin in circulationNo you cannot know that, blockchain analysis companies help the government to link addresses to identities, but it is not possible to know who owns all the Bitcoins in circulation, some coins have never moved from the address they are in, some addresses have no connection with centralized exchanges, etc.",

You can't actually tell the number of people that own/have Bitcoin because it's possible for a single person to have up to 30 wallet addresses so if you're to count based on a wallet with balance you'll only end up with the wrong data. And that the beauty of Bitcoin is to keep the government guessing.",

Now my question is that does it mean all this 7,500 bitcoin are gone completely?Your question is a technical one and I can see that the above answers are making confusion already but I will chip in my own answer to the best knowledge of how I understood your question. When you lost access to your seed phrase or private key, consider that you have lost all the bitcoin in that wallet, even if the owner of that hard disk later finds it, it is impossible to access the bitcoin inside it, I'm very sure that if the owner of that hard disk has the back up like the private keys or wallet.dat, there wouldn't be the need to search for the hard disk, so to answer your question, the bitcoin in that wallet is gone for life.QuoteCan it be possible to know the people the are in position of all the bitcoin in circulation or know the number of units in total circulation?Bitcoin is Pseudonymous, which means that you can access wallets that have bitcoin but the identity of the person behind the wallet will remain hidden except for Bitcoin that is coming from an exchange that has been kyc, you will never know the real owner of bitcoin in a wallet.You can know the units of bitcoin in circulation from https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin, the total supply, and the maximum supply.",

So it is 19,348,918 BTC according to coinmarketcap which is around 92.14% of the total supply.If you are looking for the count of people holding/using BTC, it's impossible to say the exact amount.If you are looking for the count of the people who lost BTC or how much BTC is lost is also impossible to say. But we can say those are not moved for a long period to other wallets are lost BTC. I have found an article here about around 2.6 millions bitcoin are not moved in 10 years.",
