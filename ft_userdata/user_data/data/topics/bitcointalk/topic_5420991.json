  "content": "Good Afternoon Folks, I hope all is well. With all that has been going on w/ the FTX SBF business it gives me peace of mind knowing that my coins aren't on any exchange. Its a shame for all the people that lost all of their money, they learned a very valuable lesson. Having the peace of mind of running your own full node would certainly be the best case scenario for any Bitcoiner I would think. With that said, I know this is probably a question that has been answered many times but what is required to effectively run a full node of your own? What kind of equipment & knowledge does one need to have and how much would this investment cost? Are there other benefits you get from doing this other than holding the keys to your coins? I know that these questions are probably all very newbish questions but I do not currently run a full node. I am genuinely interested on what it would take to do so & would love some expert advice in this space. I'm looking forward to seeing your responses, thank you in advance!Cheers, -TREAD",

What kind of equipment & knowledgeAs hardware you need a decent device that you can leave running for long time, preferably 24/7, but not necessarily, since after the initial (long) blocks' download, afterwards it would be rather quick (of course, it depends on how many hours or days you don't sync). What is important is to have a big disk (preferably more than 1TB) also if you don't have too much patience then SSD would be better.There is however, this topic you may want to read (Cheap Node Self Hosting: Just because you CAN does not mean you SHOULD) telling about the hardware choices. The worse the hardware, the more time you'll waste. So you better use decent hardware.Knowledge: it depends on what you want. Starting Bitcoin core alone is not difficult. Configuring it is not difficult either. If you want more (eg. I have Bitcoin Core, and Electrum Server so I can use my hardware wallet with Electrum and also I have a block explorer), you need at least patience and some basic skills in following instructions on installing this or that (usually under Linux), but if you're not too picky there are tutorials too.I'll get back to te system. While most of the things are made for Linux, nowadays you can put a Linux subsystem under your Windows 10 or 11 (maybe less, but lower Windows is no longer safe to use). So you don't have to worry much.----All in all, I think that running your own node is not that difficult. And if one just wants to avoid the FTX like problems, he doesn't necessarily need a node; just get a hardware wallet and use it with Electrum and you're already way better than most.",

Depending on your HDD space and time you intend to keep the node online, you might want to run it in a pruned mode to save on disk space. The initial download of the blockchain is needed as well and will be the thing that takes the most amount of time (anywhere from 24hr to a week).",

Really not that much. It’s pretty easy and cheap to run a node nowadays. You either build one yourself (easy with the right tutorials) or you get one ready to go(more expensive and less learning, but fast). But i would advise option a, as it’s actually fun and feels rewarding to do it yourself.Quote from: tread93 on November 14, 2022, 07:03:30 PMWhat kind of equipment & knowledge does one need to have and how much would this investment cost?A raspberry pi or old laptop, an sd card and 1tb ssd should suffice. Raspberry pis are hard to get at the moment, but sometimes it’s possible to reserve one by just contacting an official retailer found on the official website. This should come around 150-200€, but it’s also possible to do for cheaper. It might seem complicated to setup at first but with the right instructions like raspibolt and a community for when you need help it’s definitely doable. So not much knowledge is needed beforehand, you’ll acquire it while building and when asking questions to understand how it works.Quote from: tread93 on November 14, 2022, 07:03:30 PMAre there other benefits you get from doing this other than holding the keys to your coins? Better privacy, you enforce the consensus rules and decide which rules run on your node and no need to trust third parties anymore. You get a whole copy of the chain, you can resist changes you don’t agree with and verify everything yourself. Helping the integrity of the network and allowing yourself to become sovereign.",
