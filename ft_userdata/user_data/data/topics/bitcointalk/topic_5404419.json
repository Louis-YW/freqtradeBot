  "content": "I've liked Mycelium for a long time, and have a Keepkey hardware wallet that I haven't really used. I've connected it to Mycelium on Android, and it gives a Bitcoin address I can deposit to. But: it doesn't have the option to verify the address on the hardware wallet, which means I have to trust Mycelium. The whole point of using a hardware wallet is so that I don't have to trust any software.Did Mycelium forget to implement this feature?",

At least that's how I've been using it the very few times I've used Android wallet to spend.I've been also thinking on how would Mycelium do with signing a message with that address (you know, to force/trick Mycelium into validating that address somehow) , but I couldn't do that either since the HW wallet is not the first HD account in my Mycelium (is it possible to sign only with the addresses generated by a pure Mycelium HD wallet??)",

At least that's how I've been using it the very few times I've used Android wallet to spend.That would probably work, but it defeats the purpose of using a hardware wallet. If I can't verify the address, malware could make me deposit funds to an address I don't own.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 30, 2022, 01:04:32 PMyou can only try with Shapeshift app that is available for smartphones.I try to stay away from that company.",

Using the hardware wallet with Electrum means the nodes know nothing more than when I normally use Electrum.It looks like I'll have to give up on a mobile wallet to link to the Keepkey for now.",
