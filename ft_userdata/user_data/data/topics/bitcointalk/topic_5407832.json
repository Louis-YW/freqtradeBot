  "content": "In any phase, era and period, individuals control the production system. Historically, in the feudal system, landlords took lands and gave to the slave to cultivate and got returned of the production. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feudalismGovernment is only meant to manage the affairs of the state. It is a machinery by the state to carry out the instructions of the state. So, who is in the State controlling the state? https://passnownow.com/definition-subject-matter-government/With that, the individuals who control the countries Economy might not allowed the government to adopt bitcoin to be used generally by the citizens because they will not have the power through the government to control bitcoin because bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency which nobody control it.Now bitcoin was produced by an individual (s) who is from a particular country so other countries wealthy men instructed their government not to accept or adopt it because it might affect their fiat currencies in their custody. And bitcoin will create equal opportunity because p2p payment method will be introduced. There will be no central bank and other financial institutions. Therefore, most countries deny the uses of bitcoin in their Countries.Bitcoin is the Best Option to remove inflation. Companies are using inflation to suffer the poor masses/Citizens.",

Companies are using inflation to suffer the poor masses/Citizens.Inflation is indeed needed to get people to work and consume more at the same time. The problem with bitcoin will be deflation not inflation, since if you own enough bitcoin the value will decrease faster than you can spend it what will in return make it useless for you to work. So there is with every system a flaw",

But some may/will/should choose to work with bitcoin (too).Quote from: Mate2237 on July 27, 2022, 03:51:42 PMBitcoin is the Best Option to remove inflation.Bitcoin prices fluctuations make it difficult for many to keep all their funds in bitcoin. Even more, if they earn fiat they already lose by inflation (if the cost of working hour is done in fiat, it's subject to inflation).Quote from: Mate2237 on July 27, 2022, 03:51:42 PMCompanies are using inflation to suffer the poor masses/Citizens.It's the state who plays the inflation game. Companies may rise prices more than they should and blame inflation, but that happens only where there's no proper competition (usually weak state, weak law enforcement agencies).",

It's been 13 years already and at this point most countries have accepted bitcoin in one way or another.Quote from: Mate2237 on July 27, 2022, 03:51:42 PMBitcoin is the Best Option to remove inflation.Bitcoin is not going to remove anything because it is not going to replace anything.Fiat system will continue to exist to be used by everyone and the governments will continue printing more fiat causing inflation.Bitcoin is just an alternative option that people are free to chose if they want to have an additional payment method that is not affected by all that corruption and inflation.",
