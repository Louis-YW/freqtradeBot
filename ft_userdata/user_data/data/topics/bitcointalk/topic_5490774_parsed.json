Understandably, that gave rise to serious concerns on COPA’s part that Dr Wright wasimplementing measures to seek to evade the costs consequences of his loss at trial.if he says zero to avoid paying anything it destroys his rep of being rich and able to pay his promises to his sponsors and the courtsif he says he has millions.. bye bye millions (he will have to hand it over as compensation)..speculation: (my thoughts on future maybe's)seems they want to know how much he says he has, so maybe they can also sue him/charge him criminally for past issues(EG when CSW funds are locked due to this case, they can quickly sue him and use the lock to ensure he pays future case)but my dream scenario is they use the information to then take him to criminal court and set a bail amount for millions so that he cant just walk away from a criminal case",

I don't think that CSW will ever consider telling that he's not really Satoshi Nakamoto, he'll probably going to commit to that joke until he's on his grave, the delusion that he's got is just too strong to admit defeat in the face of an unrelenting adversity which is jail time, dude probably regretting it inside but has to commit all the way.",

He didn't succeed with his lies so now its better to buried up his name and he's not deserving to gain any further discussion since it will just hype his name again in other aspect. Better for people to stop mentioning his name so that he would be totally forgotten and if someone will remember him they will just think about he is the guy who lose in court for faking his claim that he is the great Satoshi Nakamoto. For sure he will be ashamed for that and maybe he don't want to remember this since he's been exposed for faking everything just for clout.",

Not only he could not produce the private keys to Satoshi's 1.1m Bitcoin but the claim that he authored the Bitcoin Whitepaper has been disputed since the copy he presented to the court was written with a software called LaTeX while the original white paper was written OpenOffice software. I think he would not be sent to prison but would pay a fine and will be mandated by the court to stop claiming that he is the inventor of Bitcoin.",

Whether the money is illegal or not, accepting donations from supporters who think he is Satoshi Nakamoto could raise ethical and legal questions.From all the evidence, it is clear that Craig Wright is in trouble of a more complex nature.
