If anything affects China's exports, inflation may go worsted due to lesser supply. Inflation may have direct impact on bitcoin price.",

But, if it is true, get ready to buy cheaper bitcoins with long term plans.Probably it is a rumors though there is some political power struggle happening inside his own party. There has been 6000 flight canceled from china which spread the rumors more. Some even saying that they are planning to attack taiwan now. All these is rumors till now so we have to wait for the president to come public and prove the rumors.For being one of the largest economical hub and largest exporter of the world anything bad happens to china could disturbed the world economy badly.",

I actually did a quick search on the internet and did not find any known news agency confirming the news. It's all about some news that is being promoted on Twitter and some private pages. It is not easy at all, it is almost impossible, for this to happen without the whole world hearing and prices and markets affected.",

There have been a number of instances where dictators undergo house arrests, a few of them are here and here and hereThough I believe the Chinese dictator isn't yet under any form of arrest. If he was, we would be seeing it all over the news. it probably just some websites and tweets looking for clicks and likes.",

China often imposes a \"house arrest\" on political dissidents. This is a way to make it appear the person is not being imprisoned, while still restricting their freedoms, and being able to monitor their communications with others (so these people can be \"kept in line\"). I don't think there is any kind of Coup going on in China right now, as this is not being reported by any reputable news sources. However, if this were happening, I think Xi being under \"house arrest\" would likely be a first step. I also know that Xi has a very tight grip on the CCP and the Chinese government. His loyalists are in positions of authority.",
