But our service is not trading, but informational and analytical. We only request read keys for registering accounts. It is simply impossible to make any trading operations, transfers of funds using these keys ... even if we are hacked",

To create a read-only API key, you need to set the ☑️ Enable Reading checkbox at the stage of creating a key on the Binance exchangeAnswering the second question, of course, everyone chooses what is more convenient for him. In the Binance mobile app, for example, you can also track transactions and account status. But in our application, everything is on one screen, you don’t need to scroll anything, you can customize reports. It is more convenient in our opinion.Plus, as I said above, soon we will save trading data and make reports that are not available on binance ... for example, on income for a week, month, year. Let's make convenient charts and presentations",

Would be a good idea to add guides for other exchanges as well, since some of them don't have a concise guide on how to set up a read-only API key. That being said though, nobody should rely on one guide published by a third party and try to check out their exchange themselves.Is your UI design final btw? I don't know how or why but I feel like it is not modern enough these days. The color scheme also doesn't really suit my taste. Not sure if it is a personal preference or not, but it is probably a good idea to do a review campaign or something similar if you're planning to improve your app further.",

So far, the site only has a guide to creating API keys for Binance. Of course, we also support other exchanges.Regarding color solutions - so far there is only a day and night theme. In the future, it is also planned to provide customers with a choice. The first part of the media section of our service is also coming out soon. There will already be alternative color schemes.We are just at the beginning of a long and interesting journey. Thanks for your suggestions and wishes. We really need them to better understand where to go.",

Regarding the second question. Both CoinMarketCap and CoinGechko are great spot account services. But not for futures.Our online service is mainly designed for futures traders. Although we will also connect the spot to monitoring soon ... rather, even as a free part of the service.",
