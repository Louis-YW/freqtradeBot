  "content": "I hear a lot of voices saying that BTC's price will go through the roof when the monetary system goes down.I've heard predictions of BTC going 4x in 2024. Others say 33x in years to come.Is there any estimated guess on how high Ethereum can go? While the growth of BTC depends on the loss of confidence in regular currencies (dollar, euro..) it seems that the growth of ETH is not dependent on this.I often hear people talk about BTC value explosion, while it seems that growth of ETH price is more gradual and linear. So basically a lower expected return on investment.Also, after BTC surviving for more than 10 years and not even the Chinese government being able to stop it, I am quite confident it can not be stopped.But can ETH somehow be stopped? Confiscated or devalued when exchanges are attackedThe investment I can afford right now is 1 BTC and 1 ETH. I barely have fixed costs for the next 2 years so I can slowly stack up.But I don't know if the same amount is better invested in let's say 0.5 BTC and 5 ETH. That will depend on growth potential and safetyAlso if the government somehow finds a way to attack BTC, owning 5 ETH can compensate for the other investment that didn't work out.I would like to diversify, but don't find many suited options to diversify in.",

Others say 33x in years to come.Is there any estimated guess on how high Ethereum can go? I am not really a crypto expert but if you ask me then i would say that in terms of future growth potential, then i think that ETH has still more room to grow than Bitcoin. The reason for my opinion is quite simple. Bitcoin already did a x30000 or even more since it's very early days. Ethereum on the other also already did around a x7000 based on it's ico price. So there is still a factor of 4 between them at the moment.That fact alone though does not necessarily mean though that ETH will really grow more in the future than BTC because Bitcoin still is and probably always will be the big lead indicator for the whole crypto space. So it is also possible in my opinion that BTC will outperform most of the altcoins in the future. It is really hard to tell.",

So we see Ethereum maintaining its status on crypto universe on the top 2.The only way ETH could be overcome would be through the popularization of another chain.

There will be a corresponding reflection of that raise in the ethereum and some of the altcoins the price reflection is a natural phenomenon in the entire market and as the expected bitcoin halving is booked for 2024 it becomes important that we should expect a raise in the market but this all depends on other factors that affect the market such as regulation and other market attacks that may force the price to remain down. But if all things are equal the price will rise significantly after the halving and that will also reflect on the ethereum price. But we are not certain of the amount of ethereum be but I am sure we may see far above $3k-$4k ETH price in 2024-2025 as ethereuem has made every network correction that will allow its network to remain stable during such bull run time, as we all know the challenges ethereuem users face whenever there is a significantly high price the network is always slow and high gas fees but with the Ethereum 2.0 That challenges were part of what was fixed but I don't know how effective the Ethereum networks migration have been since I have not transacted in Ethereum for a long time now.",

Running a Bitcoin node does not require monstrous hardware, miners are diversified, and plenty of developers. The pillar of decentralization is intact. Regarding Ethereum, it recently switch to PoS. Additionally, the majority of ETH users are connecting to the blockchain using a third party. This kind of trait surely increases the centralization exposure and risks.",

It can not even be tamed by the federal reserve raising intrest rates.Fiat is dying. So people look for alternatives.BTC speaks to my mind because it is somewhat out of government control. I do have a lot to learn for that matter.I expect Binance and Coinbase to be taken down via lawsuits in the near future.But I do not have the technical knowledge to understand if this somehow makes it impossible to buy BTC. Other exchanges in crypto friendly countries may still operate. Or people may find other ways to get their hands on BTC. What do you expect to happen to BTC when governments manage to close the top 5 exchanges in the world? It will bring down adoption. But will it kill it? And if so, is that forever or will people find a new way to get their hands on BTC?",

Confiscated or devalued when exchanges are attacked-cut-Eth has even less changes of being stopped imho. They can technically always start to weed out mining facilities and ban those, like they did in China, but it will be harder to prevent people from staking. Cryptos being confiscated is a whole another issue and it doesn't need any kind of attack. Basically they can already do that and people running CEXes are complying with authorities. So anyone in a black list technically should get their accounts frozen.What it comes to growth potential, it's anyone's guess, both of them have potential and great arguments for and against, but if i had to choose, i would say eth has more potential to grow.",
