  "content": "I am in search of a FaceBook account that has been aged.  I do not care about verification or nothing like that, I just need one that is not going to get locked every 10 minutes. I do not have time to deal with this BS of opening a new account to get it blocked because I open it and update it to quickly for their likings.  I am having my daughter be the social media manager for my companies and she does not want to use her personal facebook account to do this, so I am setting up another one.  I do not want anything anything that has been scammed or nothing like that, just a regular facebook account that has been aged and used.",
