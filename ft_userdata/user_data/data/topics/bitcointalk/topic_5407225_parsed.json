  "content": "https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/three-charged-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-tipping-schemeA former employee of Coinbase, ISHAN WAHI has been accused of insider trading. Wahi used to work as product manager assigned to a Coinbase asset listing team, so has inside knowledge as which coins are going to be listed soon. He then used his product with confidential information and share this to his brother NIKHIL WAHI, and an associate, SAMEER RAMANI. And they collectively gained $1.5 million approximately.What do you think of this case? I'm not sure if this is the first time we have heard \"insider trader\" in cryptocurrency. Will this set a precedence?",

Fair enough then, if Coinbase acted upon this themselves, i.e started the investigation themselves, it at least shows a bit of integrity, especially since they've released it to the press also. Could've easily brush it under the rug to save face (which is what I thought might have happened with the mass firings).

NFT are not usually 'traded' like daytrading assets/coins. NFT is more of a retail purchase/auction model, which doesnt really fit the income creation method coinbase likes(day trading is their wheelhouse)Quote from: Kakmakr on July 22, 2022, 11:20:12 AMI think Coinbase are the target for negative news, because their enemies know that if they can take down one of the biggest exchanges in the Crypto scene, then they will put a serious dent in Crypto currency adoption. It is a lot like hackers going for the juiciest target, because they know that these centralized companies get the highest trading volume. coinbase is sister company to alot of crypto business. so i dont see them dying quickly if they were to die. binance however is more of a solo company with more at risk to die with one fatal shot. but coinbase would need multiple hits from multiple directions to inflict lasting damagethey are well supported by the other sister companies. but with that said. if there was a supposed organised attack on the DCG. EG yes coinbase is sisters with greyscale that is suing the SEC. then putting a dent into coinbase can snowball effect cause dents in the sister companies too.
