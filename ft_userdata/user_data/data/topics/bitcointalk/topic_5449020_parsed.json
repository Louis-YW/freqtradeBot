After a few hours of coding and several 3D prototypes thrown in the trash, I was so satisfied with the results that I started to sell the device on EtsyAfter a few hundred of sales I created an upgraded version with the following features:WiFi powered. No PC neededThis ticker is a stand-alone device and it directly connects to an existing WiFi network. This means that you don’t need a PC to get it running.3D printed in eco-friendly bioplasticEach item is 3d-printed with a fully biodegradable vegetable-based plastic material. contrary to other thermoplastics which are petroleum-based, some of the raw materials used include corn starch, tapioca roots, or sugarcane.Super easy setupConnect the device to your WiFi network and program it through your phone/pc thanks to an easy to use web interface!Support for more than 600 pairsChoose your three favorites from more than 600 cryptocurrency trading pairs (Binance used as source).True real-time priceUnless similar devices CryptoGadgets display updates real-time, several time per second!Adjustable display brightnessAdjust your device's brightness so it will not bother you at night if you want to keep it on your bedside table.Upgradable firmwareKeep your device updated with periodic bug-fixes and performance improvements.USB-C poweredJust connect the device to your USB wall charger or to any USB port through a USB-C cable to get it running (cable not included)Power efficient LCD displayOnboard 1.14-inch 240*135 power efficient dot matrix COLOR display.I really hope you like it---https://www.cryptogadgets.net/",

If you continue using the plastic look, personally I think it must be considerably cheaper. Or you try and really improve to something more fancy and you can even up the price to 99 USD and maybe beyond. That could work if the crypto logos are metal or have any other high value components. Just my 2 sats.  GL!",
