It's just that we see too many cheap presentations and in such a competitive environment it's hard to stand out if you don't do things right. I see on the one hand that you have KYC which I don't like in cryptocurrency casinos, but more and more casinos are implementing it, and also responsible gaming features, such as auto-exclusion which I believe should be mandatory for any casino.I guess if you know the forum you know that the best way to popularize the casino is to run a signature campaign. You have a lot of reliable managers that can run it for you.",

You have a lot of reliable managers that can run it for you.Little Mouse has provided us with guidance to initiate this topic. We are planning to launch a signature campaign and additional promotional activities in the near future. As for the KYC, we will relay the message to the team for alternative solutions. It's not mandatory. Only applied when there's something suspicious.",

But in general it is better to have frequent entrance pf new casinos because that is the only way we can have the possibility of a competitive market since their are competing with the already existing casino for customers this will make them to place the customer's satisfaction first before any other thing unless if they have shady plans.",

The level up bonuses seems to be the lowest one compared to other casinos with similar level up bonus. No offense, just saying the truth at least based on my experience in several other casinos. If I look at this point only, I cant say that you are one of the most rewarding casinos but I have not checked the other rewards that might be claimed in your casinos by being active players. KYC verification level 1 seems to be mandatory here, once user tried to sign up (set email and password) and click register, there is pop up column to be filled with personal information. It cant be skipped and I cant do anything in this stage.",

Well the reason will be well known for you.It’s more of a jurisdictional thing for most casinos. It’s not like they don’t understand the need to be versatile across more nations and getting more patronage but, there is always a niche to it and the level of operational rights the company can get within a place as well as license to operate. Surely, they’ve got some reasons to there restrictions and it’s normal.Either way, having the betting site as not just a casino but also a sportsbook is some means to create an all in one place for gamblers on the platform and that’s okay.Still, I noticed there are over 32 coins that one could function with on the platform, that’s a plus as well.
