      "body": "What makes a cold wallet while using a computer for it is the removal of bluetooth, WiFi card and other modules that can be used to connect online, you have to make the computer to be completely airgapped and not connecting online. If your computer still connects online, the wallet you setup on it is still an online wallet.If you know you still need you computer for other use. After you reinstall the OS, setup the cold wallet, back up your seed phrase, make sure the seed phrase is correct, have like two or three of the seed phrase backup in different locations that is safe from attacks and damages. You can then delete the wallet and use your computer for what you want to use it for.",

      "body": "Not totally safe if your main purpose is to have a cold wallet. It will be more complicated when you create a transaction, the making of unsigned tx online, signing offline, then broadcasting the transaction online. What if the computer have malware when you do these steps? It will compromised your wallet. That's why cold wallets are designed in a totally offline environment.",

      "body": "That's not cold storage or wallet if your PC after you're done generating a wallet offline once you connect it to the internet it will never call it a cold wallet. Unless you remove the HDD/SSDÂ  and only use the PC with a different HDD/SSD.Or wipe and reformat the hard drive after you generated a wallet and make a paper backup that you can use to recover your wallet soon when you needed.This way you generated an offline cold wallet that you can use later by installing the Armory again once you needed.",
