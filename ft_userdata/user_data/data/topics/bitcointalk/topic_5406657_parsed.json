  "content": "Greetings Everyone! I hope you're all doing well! You may have noticed, as have I, that PREEV was down for a while this week and that's not too cool.I liked using preev to get real time conversions because it's a weighted / averaged price.But since it went down and stayed down for a bit, I put together my own conversion app.It's called PREECS and it's pronounced just like it looks, but you have to add a HEAVY LISP at the end, almost to the point of making spit fly out of both corners of your mouth.If you have that almost happening, you know you've pronounced it correctly! ¬†CoolStorage.org Presents...PREECS!!It only supports BTCTC and is updated automatically every minute with a weighted price from coinbase, bitstamp, and kraken, for all your BTCTC/USD conversion needs!https://preecs.coolstorage.orgI also have a simple key-less API setup to spit out the current weighted BTCTC price. If you want to integrate it into anything, please limit your requests to one per minute as it only updates every minute anyways, thanks!https://preecs.coolstorage.org?btcusdTo enhance the key-less API I have setup a feature to spit out the weights used for the weighted BTCTC price. These values are separated by a colon. The values are ordered: Coinbase:Bitstamp:Kraken.If you want to integrate it into anything, please limit your requests to one per minute as it only updates every minute anyways, thanks!https://preecs.coolstorage.org?weightsI have added a new PRICETAG feature to the preecs app! ¬†Set the dollar amount you wish to display in BTC ($100 shown)and use the url below to embed the btc price you set into your posts.https://preecs.coolstorage.org/pricetag/100Then put the url into an IMG tag like so:To generate a PRICETAG containing cents, use the ?cents= variable ($10.50 shown)https://preecs.coolstorage.org/pricetag/10?cents=50Remember the name - PREECS!! (wipes face)I hope everyone here in the collectibles community finds this app useful. Any questions let me know.",
