We shouldn't be so excited when politicians talk about Bitcoin because after they might have succeeded with their interests it is possible nothing will be done.  It is better to show working just like El Salvador president and not to make promises which we can't tell if they will be fulfilled in the future. Well, it is all good that bitcoin is the talk of the day for some politicians.",

The promise of this candidate sounds appealing, but some ideas are just unrealistic - especially this one. I think it's fine to consider Bitcoin as a legal currency in a country, but there's no need to eliminate the central bank. Besides, Bitcoin can't really replace what fiat does for everyday transactions. It makes more sense to treat it as an alternative currency and a store of value at the same time. Plus, a country with more options will be more attractive to investors.",

Just because he has not yet closed the Central Bank does not mean he is not going to do it but for the moment he has done all these things:Milei shuts down Argentina's tax agencyMilei is taking a chainsaw to the stateQuoteDuring his first 10 months in office, he fulfilled his promise of cuts: spending has been reduced by 30% year-over-year in real terms Milei Achieves First Budget Surplus in Argentina in 12 YearsQuotePresident Javier Milei's Argentina just achieved its first budget surplus in 12 years, boasting a 256.9% increase in tax revenue and a 50.3% drop in public spending in January 2024Rent prices drop 40% as President Milei boosts Argentina’s property supplies by 170% in one yearThat's what happens when you put a guy who understands economics to govern a country that had been ruled for almost 100 years by that pseudo-communism called Peronism.And you can rest assured that if you dollarize the economy you are already taking away a great deal of power from the Central Bank:Milei outlines his dollarization plan which will add other currenciesSo, when you criticize this candidate saying that what he says is unrealistic, it is you who are unrealistic with what Milei has achieved. He never said that closing the Central Bank was one of the first measures, on the contrary, he knows the complexity involved, and he has not even been in office for a year.",

Bringing Bitcoin standard in a country, doesn't mean improvement. Suriname is small country so it might work for them like it did for El-Salvador but the result is never guaranteed. Moving away from mainstream economy will have its consequences. Supporting and adopting Bitcoin is great but replacing everything with Bitcoin, is stupidity!",

She has established some crypto businesses that flourished in Suriname. I guess that since Maya might not have the financial resources like other presidential candidates, fronting Bitcoin might make her get some attention from crypto donors. I also wish her all the best in her quest to change the economic situation in her country.

She runs a crypto firm called Daedalusa which has a subsidiary called building RESIN. RESIN is a real estate firm which allows investors to use Bitcoin as a deposit to purchase houses. The firm still allows investors to retain ownership of their Bitcoin deposits as they pay for these houses. https://www.daedaluslabs.io/resin",

I don’t think it makes a difference not until bitcoin enthusiast win before we see the outcome as promised. For now let’s play along with what’s given but, I hope she gets the chance to win because mere looking at the news now it shows presidential candidates no longer talk bad against bitcoin, I wished all this happened earlier I believe this will stand as an influence many will start holding bitcoin sooner or later.",

No, it's not a trend and the ones who run to be president and is a Bitcoin lover might not be suitable for a country. It certainly depends on many factors and just because someone says he/she loves Bitcoin and make it way to their success of achieving political status isn't the best approach to promote Bitcoin in anyway. Surely, if that Bitcoiner also knows enough about economics and economy in general and can take best steps to reduce impact of inflation or rising of prices in a country then that's going to be helpful for the country and might be somehow helpful for Bitcoin as well.",

But like you said, this isn’t common yet..Every politician I know that has mentioned bitcoin once or twice did not seem genuine about crypto or bitcoin and just mentioned it for the sake of gaining attention and followers. As per bitcoiners running for president, I know this will be good for bitcoiners but not any bitcoiner can run for president. It’s not just crypto that you will dealing with. You have a whole country to run. If you really want to make a difference as a bitcoiner, start with something smaller like a partylist or an organization focused on highlighting the potential benefits of crypto to the country as well as points on how the government can help crypto evolve more.",

It is easy to make Bitcoin Legal Tender in a country, easy here means easier than making Bitcoin Standard practice successfully in that nation. We can see El Salvador, a first nation ever makes Bitcoin Legal Tender. It's law from El Salvador government but citizens in the nation are not comfortable with it.It won't be easy to make Bitcoin Standard successfully even at a national scale. At global scale, in trades with other countries, it's much harder and it will be challenged by IMF too.Citizens can easily accept and use Bitcoin blockchain but for business, there are big and small businesses and they have different monetary cycles. Small businesses have very quick monetary cycles and they are not comfortable of receiving payments from customers in Bitcoin. Price is volatile and small businesses have less ability to hold bitcoins for a long time to enjoy it as their business treasury or investment.",

But honestly, I don’t think everything on her list is actually doable, and it’s pretty unlikely some of it will happen even if she wins.https://geyser.fund/project/maya2025Maya's VisionQuoteEliminate the Central BankThere’s no way she can completely get rid of it, but easing the regulations --that's probably the best move. At least it would give Bitcoin some positive attention over the central bank.QuoteAdopt Bitcoin as the national currencyIt's doable, especially since two countries have already made it happen.QuoteIntroduce free currency competitionIt’s a solid idea, and she can definitely pull it off. By talking about \"free currency competition,\" it’s still about crypto, just including altcoins too.QuoteReduce taxes significantly and privatize public services to improve efficiency.‍Privatize telecommunications, utilities, and transport sectors to improve efficiency and profitability.Privatize healthcare, education, and infrastructure to enhance service delivery through competition.[I don’t think this is a good idea. Honestly, there’s nothing wrong with raising taxes as long as citizens actually benefit from it. Privatizing public services, especially if they use public resources, just pushes capitalism-- and sometimes, that’s not great for the country. The money people spend won’t come back to the country, especially if the investors are foreign capitalists. Sure, she could do it, but I’m not a fan of the idea. Usually, when things get privatized, fees go up, which just ties back to my point previously mentioned.QuoteEstablish timechain-based capital markets and introduce Bitcoin bonds to boost economic growth.Gradually phase out social programs and focus on job creation and self-reliance.Promote Bitcoin mining through renewable energy resources to diversify the economy.Establish a sovereign wealth fund to manage oil and gold royalties transparently and efficiently.Deregulate sectors to allow businesses to thrive and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy.I’m all in on these four ideas.",
