It's cleanest, gui is very user friendly, and it's versatile as you can track not only cryptos, but indices, NFTs, Stocks, Funds, commodities etc.It's definitely worth upgrading to pro too to get more insights.

Yeah if your PnL is up 15% the value of your holdings should be greater than your total cost. Anyway, are you sure that 15% is your PnL and not simply the coin's 24h price change? It would be helpful if you could provide a screenshot of your portfolio dashboard to clarify this.",

Oh I get what you mean. So this is not exactly a problem, just a way of how Coingecko record your trades. The amount of sell transaction will not reduce your cost, instead it will be recorded in \"Proceeds\". The overall PnL then will be evaluated by:Code:PnL = Holdings + Proceeds - CostIn my example:I bought 100 $DYDX at $1.84. Total cost = $184.I sell 50 $DYDX at $2. Proceeds = $100I'm still holding 50 DYDX, with current price at ~$1.83. Total holdings = $91.42My PnL would be = $91.42 + $100 - $184 = $7.42",

But it is preferable to use the app that is updated frequently, allows to make backups or import/export data, would be great if has a desktop version and synchronization, and if it has a free version, than it should be ads free. I have an experience of using Delta and Blockfolio apps. I have used Delta, because after an update Blockfolio crashed and I could not get info from it (all I could do is to install it on different device). I dont like Delta, because it sometimes shows me \"oooops, smth went wrong\" and did not update prices, so you have to restart app several times. When \"time is money\", that aint good. I liked that Blockfolio supported more altcoins and you can trade directly from that app. I would use Blockfolio if I am more a trader guy, and I would use Delta if I just want to monitor my assets.",
