  "content": "When you buy Bitcoin hen the price is 100k$ then how much will you sell it back to make profit because at that time the price of Bitcoin might not exceed 100k$ and if the price didn't not exceed that amount you will become a loser in the business so how does the vendors do at that time? Or you buy at that time and thinking that it will go up to 200k$ but ironically, the price come below 100k$. What will be you faith/fate. Many companies stopped function last year because they accumulated a lot of Bitcoin when the price was high and they were thinking that the price would go up for them to sell them off and make their profit from there but instead the price of Bitcoin drastically come down very well. So the companies  enter bankruptcy and folded. So exchange are trying to avoid such mistakes, so that they can run a long journey. Will the price pass 100k$ next year 2024 for buys to make their gain?",

Even if Bitcoin is 1 bitcoin to 1 million dollars, people will still buy and hold. You know why; this is as a result of the belief that whatever makes it hit the $100k price will definitely make it climb higher than that. So far as Bitcoin doesn't have a maximum limit to which it can't exceed, we will always have people that will buy and hold at any point in time.",

They understand Bitcoin's economic and value proposition, yet, they ignored Bitcoin until they've found themselves with little choice but to enter at 100k or potentially be left behind even further- People who have no choice. Money in their country is losing purchasing power rapidly, so they must use Bitcoin in order to preserve value.- People who are losing freedom. Some systems where CBDCs become exclusive and where cash is phased out, will inevitably face tyranny on the rules in which they can use their digital money. Maybe, even have become financially ezcluded. Therefore Bitcoin is their only choice.Then of course, speculators and investors who believe $100k is just the beginning",

This is not correct, there's no company that went bankrupt last year because they bought BTC. All the centralized exchanges, lending and earning platforms and crypto companies that went bankrupt in recent events, all collapsed because they operate through a fractional reserve system, that is they use the funds they have for gambling, trading, investments or anything that can make them more money, and if the investment fails, they become insolvent and collapse, and it creates a domino effect because many related companies are also exposed to them.",

Even if Bitcoin is 1 bitcoin to 1 million dollars, people will still buy and hold. this is not true.. there is always a window of value>premiumin 2021 the window was $10k-$75this is because  for instant the top number is the amount it costs even the most laziest hobby miner in the most expensive region to mine bitcoin. meaning if everyone on the planet can mine for less than $75k no one will want to pay too muchso the market price topped out at about $70k because less and les people were willing to buy until all buyers stopped. so it didnt go higherin 2022.. the window was $15k-$90kbut most people in the expensive mining cost countries were more interested in sorting out their fiat lives so hardly any people with what would be natural mining costs of over $50k wanted to just buy bitcoin which is why there were no people paying above $50kits now 2023 and the window is about $23k-$140kbut right now everyone is happily buying cheap and there is not much demand to pressure the price to go up. because there is a excess supply pushing the price down to try to keep it below $32k so far this year. (mostly from whale doing shorts on other markets thus pressuring the spot market to ensure their shorts futures market bets fulfil..)everyone is happily buying cheap coins that are being held down by whale traders. but once their contracts ends. then natural trade speculation could push the price up. where $100k is possible this years but anything above $150k would require higher mining costs to warrant people to want to buy at such ratesright now so far this year there is no logical/economical/infrastructural reason anyone would want to pay over $200l becasue anyone/everyone on the planet can mine for sats at the rate of under $140k so no one would want to buy for $1m right nownot unless the underlying mining costs went up by many multiples to equate to a reason a region on the planet find it financially beneficial to buy coin at such a rate rather then mining it",

You might be surprised bitcoin will hit to a million dollars have you also considered who then will buy as well but today you are buying bitcoin if you were asked then to buy you might feels that bitcoin won't appreciate in price or makes any changes.it was from cent, to a dollar, then moves from hundred, then from thousands i believe we may also witness million dollars is just a matter of time and people will keep buying bitcoin.

Given that its market value depends on demand and there's limited supply of it, then it is okay to believe that skies the limit for its market value as long as demand is increasing as well. People would buy no matter what price there is as long as it moves. Volatility is the biggest risk for assets of the likes but it is also the biggest advantage over other type of investments. And as a currency, what's more likely to happen if people would be buying Bitcoin at $100k, is for investment purposes and not for payment means.Quote from: dothebeats on June 26, 2023, 10:44:29 PMIt will be hard to know.

Cycle is  price goes up, be corrected then go up again. Even I, before, never believed its price could be as huge as its ATH, but what happens simply proves how huge the potential is, for this industry.",

Bitcoin is bought by people who believe that its value will go up or at least won't go down. A few years ago it was unimaginable that Bitcoin will be stable above $20k, because $20k was the peak of 2017 market. Maybe the history will repeat and there will be new highs conquered and secured. Or maybe indeed Bitcoin will reach a maximum and struggle to find more buyers. No one can predict how it will play out.",

In contrast, sellers are people who believe that price will be corrected, crashed, fall down. Buyers can be truly investors with strong belief in Bitcoin future and diamond hands but they can also be people who don't understand anything about Bitcoin, don't have good belief in Bitcoin and just are greedy, want to get quick profit.Because Bitcoin is designed to have its block reward halves in every 210,000 blocks or 4 years till 2140, I believe there will be good number of halvings for FOMO. It is not real reason for Bitcoin price growth that depends more on Bitcoin adoption. With Bitcoin adoption has been increasing latest years, I believe that price will go up more and many people will have similar belief like mine.",

There are may die-hard bitcoin believers that a convinced that the price will keep increasing with time. If bitcoin piece gets to $100k I am not sure that it will fall below $50k during the next bearish market. And in the next bull run, it is also possible that it will exceed the former $100k benchmark.

At any price level there will be buyers and sellers.Also, Bitcoin's price rise is directly related to how much buying money there is, compared to how much Bitcoin is being sold. So just as there are more buyers of Bitcoin at $30k than there were at $1000, there will be more buyers at $100k than there are today, and there will be more buyers at $1,000,000 than there will be at $100k. Because to get to that higher price that means many more people need to be in the market, therefore there are more buyers.There is no point worrying about what will happen at some specific price, like $100k. The market will continue and the price will keep going up as long as the population of the world learns about Bitcoin and likes what they learn about it - which I think for any of us that are already into Bitcoin, we know that the answer will be yes, the price will keep going up because Bitcoin is incredibly valuable to the world so there will always be new buyers coming in when they learn about Bitcoin.",
