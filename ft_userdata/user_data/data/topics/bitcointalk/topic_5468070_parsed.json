And from the look of thing,  many potential client's may have a bad feelings towards dealing with you deu to your red trust flags,  so you may need to work more on your reputations before you be fully ready to take up any offers in other to guarantee your customers satisfaction.",

I believe it’s still allowed to maintain this thread on gambling board since it’s an offer specifically for casino service.",

DICK HEAD MEMBERSHey, their intention is not to ruin the site for new users; they are just expressing concerns about your credibility due to negative feedback on your account. This might make potential clients hesitant to work with you. There are accusations of potential scams and warnings to stay away from your offers.I would also advise online betting sites to be cautious about working with you. It's a matter of legitimacy. You appear to be aggressive and unprofessional, which creates a hostile environment.",

You should have to accept criticism because you asked for non-collateral loan in lending board without proper knowledge and that's the reason that you got those negative tags on your profile. No one is against you or other newbies and if you think that newbies are unaccepted in this forum then you're wrong my friend. Those newbies who contribute good information to the forum are highly appreciated by reputed members of the forum in the form of merits, and after a certain level of activity and merits they will grow into ranked members. The forum is open for everyone and it's a person own actions that could make things good or bad for him/her.",

If I will advise the op, he should refrain from all these things be sincere to himself and create good threads in the forum to grow instead of trying to go away with people money. Such things will not make him to move well and go further in the forum and he himself has seen it yet he does not want to give up.",
