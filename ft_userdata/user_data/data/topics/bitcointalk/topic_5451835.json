My friend bought a piece of land in 2019 and it's now worth 3 times more and I don't see it losing value due to the banking crisis. I strongly believe bitcoin will go up if we get a total currency collapse, especially if USD crashes hard. The FED is in deep shit. They don't want to print because the inflation is high, but they also don't want banks to die because it's going to start bank runs and protests. Let's see what they come up with. I have less than 1% of my money in the bank and the rest is in real estate, bitcoin and cash. I can sit and watch.",

According to some forecasts, this will happen in the summer.What do you think will happen to bitcoin in this case?Your claim about some predictions about the collapse of the world economy would have been more meaningful if you have dropped a link about the information. I have read the news that predicts that global economic growth will be slow this year because of:1. Global instability: The effect of the war in Ukraine will keep hurting the global economy. Some other conflicts in some areas will negatively affect the global economy.2. Inflation: The increase in interest rate have not slowed down inflation in most countries and this will keep affecting the economy. 3. Aging Labour force: Most countries are facing labor shortages due to an aging population and they don't have viable immigration policies to attract the right workers. One of the key indicators of a global financial crash will be the loss of value of major currencies and the collapse of major financial institutions. And from observation, bitcoin always rises when major currencies drop in value because people seem to shift to bitcoin. After all, it is the next reliable alternative. We also observed that the fall of major banks affected the price of Bitcoin positively.",

According to some forecasts, this will happen in the summer.What do you think will happen to bitcoin in this case?Referring to this global economic collapse, I think it will not be any close to looking like the financial crises of 2008; such history don't need to repeat again; if not, it's going to be a disaster. But assuming the economy collapses, nothing will happen to Bitcoin if not a total decline in price that may last until the economy begins to heat up again. I seem not to bother much about Bitcoin each time I hear things like that because when I looked back at the bear market of Bitcoin in 2011, when the price fell by -99%, to many, it looked like Bitcoin was even about to crash, but here we still are with many who are now becoming interested in Bitcoin day after day. What we should even be concerned about is ourselves and what will happen to human society if the global economy collapses. There will be a lot of suffering, especially in some countries where the economic system is still developing.The financial crisis of 2008 was a lesson to learn because: 8.8 million jobs was lost4.Unemployment spiked to 10% by October 20095.Eight million home foreclosures6.$19.2 trillion in household wealth evaporated4.Home price declines of 40% on average—even steeper in some cities7.S&P 500 declined 38.5% in 20088. If that happens now, that's going to be a disaster in our society.You can read, if you want.",

You should at least have a reference given here, not what you just said or heard. That way, what you are saying will come out as gossip. Although there are many people who say the same thing, but almost everything they said did not happen, instead it was proved to be just FUD in the end.         Except for what the FED did the other day which actually has an effect on the market somehow but not on the Bitcoin industry or cryptocurrency.

      "body": "It is impossible to predict the outcome of a hypothetical situation like a global economic collapse in 2023. However, I can provide you with some general insights on how the value of Bitcoin might be affected in such a scenario.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, which means that its value is not directly tied to any particular economy or government. However, the value of Bitcoin can be influenced by global economic events, such as recessions or financial crises. During periods of economic instability, some investors might turn to Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, similar to how people traditionally invest in gold or other commodities during times of uncertainty. This could potentially drive up the value of Bitcoin.On the other hand, it's also possible that a global economic collapse could lead to a general lack of confidence in financial markets and digital currencies, causing investors to sell off their Bitcoin holdings. This could potentially cause the value of Bitcoin to drop.In summary, it's difficult to predict exactly how the value of Bitcoin would be affected in the event of a global economic collapse in 2023. The outcome would depend on a complex range of factors, including investor sentiment, economic policies, and global market conditions.",

According to some, bitcoin rates could fall along with other forms of investments, such as stocks or bonds. On the other hand, bitcoin proved to be a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and turmoil. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/21 is a good example of this, where the price of Bitcoin initially dropped but then quickly recovered and even surpassed its previous all-time high.",

But this situation is special and can hardly be compared with the possible upcoming fall of the world economy. It is generally accepted that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should rise sharply in price if the global economy collapses. But we still don’t have much practical experience of observing cryptocurrencies at such a critical time. In addition, the price of a cryptocurrency is always influenced by many more factors that add up directly at the time of such financial cataclysms. We just have to wait and watch.",

If there’s a crisis, Bitcoin will be affected as well just like the recent pandemic where most of the economies suffers a lot, and Bitcoin followed that trend. If you’re thinking about holding more Bitcoin in preparation of the crisis, then better to have more cash for now and wait for the dump, you can make profit if you are able to timing it.",

Likewise in several other markets such as the stock market, but what will probably be very clear to happen to Bitcoin if the economic collapse continues to occur this year is that it will be difficult to increase the price of Bitcoin and has the potential for another decline. But if investors and also Bitcoin holders still want to buy and store Bitcoin in large quantities, I think Bitcoin's price resilience support will also be stronger than before. So, actually I myself will never worry about this as long as Bitcoin is still the target of investors and holders in large numbers.",
