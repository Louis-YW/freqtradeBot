Tell us about your experience.I played Gate of Heaven which is the enhanced RTP version of the very well known game Gate of Olympus from Pragmatic Play and I felt some sort of difference.I say some sort because I lost in both games all balance by keep buying the bonus feature but in the enhanced version of the game I lasted a lot longer so for me it is not a marketing gimmick,maybe I should try a couple more games and see if the same happens and if so then definitely is not a marketing gimmick.I assume we will have longer play sessions with enhanced RTP and most likely is not just a gambler fallacy.",

Tell us about your experience.Not really sure if it is a legit because there is no way for us to check the actual RTP of the game as we can just trust the provider. I played many enhanced version from pragmatic such as Gates of Heaven, Sugar Twist, Slushie Party, Madame Mistique megaways, Jewel Bonanza, etc. What I can say is that I got better result in the normal RTP than the enhanced RTP, both using normal spins and buy bonus. Perhaps I'm not that lucky with the enhanced version, I would like to know other's experiences about this enhanced version game.",

I mean whenever I use my weekly budget to try Gates Of Heaven with 98% RTP its not always good the results sometimes look good but more often the results are bad.and in other games like Sweet Fiesta its the same.this week i spent my budget to try Gates Of Heaven because i want to feel maxwin sensation in this game but lose faster and not my day.",

Meanwhile, we are just players who often play gambling at the casino. We cannot expect that in slot games Enhanced RTP games can provide greater luck. Everything depends on your luck. If you are lucky, you can even win a lot of money on the regular one.If you only think about winning and the win rate is higher in Enhanced RTP games, you should prepare yourself if you lose.",

I believe it's just a marketing gimmick to invite more players.Some people look at the RTP first before playing and if the percentage given is good then they will enter the game and some do not care about it. I think it depends on each person's belief in the benefits of RTP. Gamblers will get their luck anywhere, and for myself I am a gambler who every time I want to play likes to see the RTP first, okay some of them don't care about this and consider it a scam. But for myself, I think this has an influence on all the spins in the game, I often get a win by referring to the RTP percentage, and in my experience there are also some slot casinos that commit fraud by using RTP, as you say this is just a trick to get more players interested. Losing can happen to me because I'm too sure of the RTP but I will only believe in one casino that really has an accurate RTP percentage, and I've got it.",

      "body": "Of all the types of slot games available, I tend to play games from Pragmatic Play. for some reason, maybe it could be because the first online slot game I played was Pragmatic Play. to be honest, I don't have a precise answer to this discussion. because, I'm more inclined to bet on football. but at least, I'm very familiar with games that come from Pragmatic Play and their RTP.I'm not sure, though, that RTP will work for every gambler playing the same game. even though the game we are playing has an RTP of 96%, or even more than that.Referring to my experience, the fact is that I can lose in a short time. I also did on a few other trials, I played a very red RTP which means it is unlikely to give us an interesting game or even a win. it's just that, I got a big win from the game. So, I tried to do some other experiments. the point is, every experiment I do the results are not always the same. then I concluded, that basically luck plays an important role when we play slot games. although I can't deny that RTP also has an effect on us choosing the type of game. not infrequently a high RTP really gives us a good game, or it could be the other way around.For me personally, in the end it all comes back to our luck.",

Tell us about your experience.98 percent, and 96.5 percent, what is the difference here? just 1.5 percent, Can this 1.5 percent really make any difference that can be significant or noticeable? if you ask me, i would say NO, there is no difference, so i would honestly consider the whole enhanced RTP stuff as nothing but another form of marketing for some slot games, Many gambler after playing online slot games for a while always shifts to sports betting, as it like its never possible to make any profit from playing slot games, both in the short and long term, and for the game providers to try to find a solution to the low patronage on slot games, they probably came up with this enhanced RTP idea, but in reality, its nothing different from the normal RTP slots.",

The fact of the matter is that it doesn't guarantee you would win, it only ever guarantees that out of all your slot sessions you should be able to get something back so you don't feel bad for yourself lols. Say we take Blood Suckers for example with a 98% RTP percentage, if you wager a $100 on this game, you're bound to get $98 back, sure along the way you may experience losses and lower payouts since every RTP if I'm not mistaken is calculated at every session, so for people out here who resets their browsers in hopes of better payouts I'm sorry but you're only making it worse for yourself. I've played on slots with RTP and my payouts are just the same as I expected, not as much as I win with regular slots but surely enough to whatever percentage they are plotting.",

Let me provide what I know here so you can copy and paste it in the main post (if you wish): Done, thanks for your input Quote from: Casdinyard on August 02, 2023, 11:11:19 PMSay we take Blood Suckers for example with a 98% RTP percentage, if you wager a $100 on this game, you're bound to get $98 back, sure along the way you may experience losses and lower payouts since every RTP if I'm not mistaken is calculated at every session, so for people out here who resets their browsers in hopes of better payouts I'm sorry but you're only making it worse for yourself.This is a gambler fallacy. If you only play a couple hundred or thousands of spins, the live RTP can vary greatly and won't necessarily be 98%. The 98% RTP is with the assumption of unlimited spins (~)So if you play $100, you can even win thousands of dollars (if you're lucky lol).Therefore the question is about whether people here \"feel\" the high RTP slots or not. Up to this point, more people answered no, they don't get better results. But it might change in the future when they do more spins.",
