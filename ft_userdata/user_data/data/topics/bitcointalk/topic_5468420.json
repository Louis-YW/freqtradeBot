      "body": "Here's the raw code of the invalid block: https://farside.co.uk/blocks/809478invalid.txtThe issue is that they included lots of transactions in the wrong order.When a parent and child transaction are both confirmed in the same block at the same time, then the parent transaction must come earlier in the block than the child. Now look up the following string in the link I shared above, which is the first example of them messing up:Code:7d18f0eefce0497b5d0c9b61fdf816b7744587c7e5e57acc53de71d1dae59725You'll see one of the first transactions in the block (the sixth transaction) uses an input from that transaction, but that transaction itself doesn't actually appear until about a third of the way through the block (as the 1,454th transaction). They included the child before the parent, meaning the child transaction tried to spend a UTXO which did not yet exist. And so the block was invalid.Another few examples:Code:16f573a372f9950f1c57df642ecac64860be22482d424d35c084746b1066b02cc0d322bd830bbbc429121f7766a6cdf0438c7e316187c4f1d45663893c7d51cda04e35d002d97e2be8fd8b99564bbab3746dc090029b4c0284ae4705de942647So for some reason their sorting algorithm totally messed up and didn't include transactions in the order necessary for the block to be valid.Quote from: Dave1 on September 28, 2023, 12:26:06 PMWhat are your thoughts on this one? Do you agree that they can simple run a experiment, what if they succeed here? what will be the repercussions?There will be no repercussions. The nodes they tried to broadcast this block to all rejected it since it was invalid, and bitcoin continue to run as if nothing had happened. This is exactly what is supposed to happen. The real story here is why MARA are testing things on mainnet and not on testnet, but I wouldn't expect any level of competence from the same mining pool which is in cahoots with the US government and OFAC.",

If  B needs A you have to add the fee of B+A  and then the size of B + A to figure out what you get in terms of size vs fee. C + D might work better or even E all by itself. All the while new transactions with their own fees are streaming in.The Devil is in the details, and as I said I can see them trying to optimize it to the point where it sent out a block as they did with the transactions in the wrong order.Programming whoops though the years:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC_ioJQpv4E-Dave",

LOLGiven they coded a bug on their testnet software, it threw off multiple invalid blocks, and then they ported it across to mainnet without addressing the invalid blocks - yes, probably. This is also the same mining pool who wanted to censor the entire network by only mining OFAC compliant blocks, before abandoning the whole idea a few weeks later when they finally realized it would never work.

That's the only reason I can think of for bothering with transactions and their order in the block you are trying to mine.It makes no sense. Their sorting algorithm is simply lowest to highest absolute fee. If they were picking transaction from the mempool based on absolute fee, then many of the transaction in their invalid block wouldn't have been included at all. These low fee transactions were included precisely because they had a higher fee paying child, and some of their transactions with low absolute fees paid high fee rates. So they've followed the usual Bitcoin Core method of grouping parent and child transactions together in to packages, ordering all transactions/packages by fee rate, and selecting the highest rate paying transactions. And then after using the normal method to construct their candidate block, they've then resorted all the transactions for no reason.",

MARA pool threw away their lucky chance of finding a \"valid\" blockheader hash by using flawed and not well enough tested candidate block assembly solftware. I know that finding a valid blockheader hash is a random process. The amount of hashpower you utilize compared to the sum of all hashpower of the network just gives you some statistical chance of finding a valid hash until someone else competing with you finds one. There's no garantee to find a valid blockheader hash with your set of (ever changing) parameters.Still they lost their opportunity to get 6.25+fees BTC for a block with the statistical chance they had with their percentage of hashpower. I'm pretty shure affected miners don't share your opinion of it not being expensive at all. Whatever, YMMV.",
