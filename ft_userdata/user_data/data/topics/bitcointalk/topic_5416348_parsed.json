Since I have some previous experience with bitcoin-themed pumpkin carving and had much fun doing it, I might join the contest (here is the entry that I made a couple of years ago for that 10th anniversary art contest).Anyway, kudos for the initiative.",

You can send a DM to theymos or Cyrus regarding this. If they are not interested, I would say the games and Rounds section is compatible with this contest. I am also confused. LOL.

Thatâ€™s what I was kind of hoping, that maybe Theymos/Cyrus/Hilarious might be willing to stick it in the news section, at least for a day or two.Â  Itâ€™s certainly not as big as the pizza contest but I still think itâ€™s fun and a cool way to bring the community together during Halloween time. Itâ€™s free and Iâ€™m giving away a few hundred dollars worth of collectible items. I think a good amount of people who donâ€™t visit Mets or Collectibles would be interested, I just donâ€™t know how to spread the message to the forum as a whole. I donâ€™t want to bug theymos/Cyrus/hilarious and any other mods w/a PM, so Iâ€™ll leave it up to them to see this thread and let them decide.",

Just a suggestion.I would rather it remain in collectibles because thatâ€™s where I mostly participate, prizes are collectibles, etc.Â  If I could post it in both sections I would.I actually have one casino whoâ€™s already reached out to me about contributing to the prizes (currently vetting them before agreeing to it).Â  But that is a great idea.Quote from: AnotherAlt on October 09, 2022, 07:55:42 AMQuote from: ChiBitCTy on October 08, 2022, 05:42:11 PMI donâ€™t want to bug theymos/Cyrus/hilarious and any other mods w/a PM, so Iâ€™ll leave it up to them to see this thread and let them decide.Â  I saw you posted it on the Bitcointalk Discord server.

So we will see what they come up with! I also posted this on r/bitcoin, hoping some Reddit users jump in. Plus I thought this might be a good way to get new members to sign up for a forum account. If anyone wants to share this on Reddit /twitter/instagram/Facebook etc, Iâ€™d appreciate it!",
