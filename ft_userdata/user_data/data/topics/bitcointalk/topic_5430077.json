Trezor has not had Ledger's problems, they delete data after a certain time and they are open source, so they are a better option. In general, to set up a paper wallet you have to know what you are doing.See this thread: Andreas Antonopoulos says to stop using paper wallets, do you agree?",

The guide is incomplete though as it doesn't say how to generate the address from the mnemonic. Could someone fill in the rest?https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/diy-bitcoin-private-key-project<…>This guide is not about creating paper wallets. It merely describes one of the several ways how you can generate your own randomness and convert it to meaningful words from BIP39 without relying on any hardware or software tools that do the same job but better and faster. If you're not experienced enough and don't understand precisely how the generation algorithm works and why it works this way, it is not recommended to do things manually because there is a high probability of you losing all your money due to stupid mistakes. Even worse, if you decide to generate addresses manually from your manually generated seed phrase, the chances of you messing things up are almost hundred percent because doing sha-256 or ripemd160 calculations requires hundreds of hours of intense and incredibly complex math manipulations, which is infeasible for a normal person. I'd say just buy a reputable hardware wallet like Trezor, and don't complicate your life by reinventing the wheels.",

You can find an official reseller in your country and buy from a physical store using cash. You can have it posted to a PO Box or using general delivery, so you do not have to give away your address. You can also buy it using a pseudonym with delivery to a different address (if you have one you can use). And of course if buying online pay using well anonymized bitcoin and not a fiat method which is traceable to your real name.Quote from: NickofTime on December 19, 2022, 01:32:34 AMShould I go for a paper wallet instead?If you are planning to hold for a long period of time and transact very rarely, then a paper wallet can be a good choice. However, setting one up securely is significantly more difficult and has significantly more risks than using a hardware wallet, as does when you come to actually spend from the paper wallet. I would not recommend that your first attempt at making a paper wallet is then used to store the majority of your funds.Quote from: PX-Z on December 19, 2022, 03:20:07 AMI would prefer to use an existing way[2] how to create paper walletsThe site linked to in the thread you have linked (bitcoinpaperwallet) is a known scam.

A properly set up Electrum cold storage wallet is just as safe, if not safer, than a hardware wallet. You download Electrum on a separate device, verify it, and then transfer it to your airgapped device using a USB drive. Your airgapped device remains permanently airgapped and the wallet on it never connects to anything, but simply signs transactions created elsewhere and imported using a QR code or USB drive.",

Buying from an official reseller is the absolute limit of what I consider acceptable, and even then I still have reservations when compared to buying direct from the manufacturer. Buying from a random third party is just asking for trouble. You have absolutely no idea how many people have had their hands on that device or what they might have managed to do to it. Yes, good hardware wallets have built in verification process and cryptographic checks, but for every vulnerability or way to bypass these checks that is found someone has to be the first person to do so.Quote from: NickofTime on December 20, 2022, 01:46:18 AMBecause Trezor has no secure element. Which leads to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9y-KQbqi4Probably worth point out that this was only possible because the Trezor device in question was running old firmware which contained a specific vulnerability.
