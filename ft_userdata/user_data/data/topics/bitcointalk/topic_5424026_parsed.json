But it has low risk compared to Bitcoin, that's why Bitcoin can make huge return especially for early investors that buy Bitcoin when the price is less than $1,000. Now it's the time to accumulate Bitcoin before it's too late!.",

The ability to invade some exuberant bank charges is one of the benefits I have enjoyed. Fast, safe and private transactions is another important benefit. Those that invested in bitcoin long time ago when the price was really low accumulated some good profit considering how the price appreciated. But currently it is only the brave that would invest because of the fall in price. Also some investors have lost so much because of the price recently. But the point am trying to make is that bitcoin investment is a smart one but it takes patience and bravery to Hodl because it is not a get rich quick avenue.",

Also, the knowledge that it had given about the economy, how it works as an investment, and the technology that it has introduced globally. Can we imagine how vast the information and help bitcoin has given to each and every one of us? We're all grateful that Satoshi Nakamoto has made this project and now, it's on the mainstream while the big financial institutions are on it too. Originally, it should be an alternative transfer although it's there being used as is but there's another use that has came out from it and that's being a store of value.",

The bitcoin adoption population still remains very low and many are yet to get on the network so, we can't really make such assumption.Although, we can say it's important for people, investors to own some of there portfolio in bitcoin, accept bitcoin  for media of payment but, it doesn't seem right to look at it for the bedrock of an investment.",

Hence , such huge earning intensest is the bedrock of investors. But , those who invested in late 2021 when Bitcoin was on its peak, for them Bitcoin is a terrible investment because they badly got hurt by 85% fall in Bitcoin price from its ATH , though they will also make good gains if they have the capacity of holding it till next bull run.Whatever direction Bitcoin takes in coming months, but it will remain hot topic of discussion on social media.",

Though this is circumstantial in a way that it differs per investment, investing into cryptocurrencies somehow \"accelerates\" such process.Compared to any investment mechanism that is currently available, the volatility of BTC makes it as a perfect short or long-term investment depending on its price. Unlike stocks where you trade only on a specific time-frame within the day, trading in cryptocurrencies happens in a daily basis.",

Many people indeed earned huge amount of money not only from Bitcoin but to other cryptocurrencies as well. But that is enough with gaslighting its flaws. Investors cannot do their 'investing' habits without Bitcoin? There are other assets which are less risky but are profitable such as with stocks. Investing to cryptos would be more profitable but that would also mean bigger risk because of too volatile market price. We just tend to highlight positive sides of a crypto investor story. But try asking big time investors on how much did they lose before reaching that certain point. Makes it no surprising why ither investors moved out. Simply because we have investment preferences.",
