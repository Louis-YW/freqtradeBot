  "content": "My Words to you Dear Crypto Trader/InvestorsIf you missed the dotcom bubble of 2000, this crypto bubble is your chance now.At early stage 2020, every defi projects went thousands of percentages pump; I was amongst the first to encourage users to engage on Uniswap and we made so much money then. It is because of hypes/FOMO. Most of Crypto traders have no idea what was going on. Bear market has now taken them down 90-99% now. From now, they will grow by fundamentals. Real investors need to understand how those projects/companies work ( Business model/revenue/ earning/ active users ...). In the end, you will see the next amazon.Amazon busted -95% at Dotcom bubble 2000 Amazon went up 60000% following 20 years.If you are really serious for this, now is good time to start your crypto investment firm.I believe everything will be quite different in the next 5-10 years.Imagine you stand here like someone was at Dotcom bubble 2000.Simply put:Crypto is Dotcom Bubble 2.0 repeating after 20 years.Biggest reset in macro cycle for Crypto is set in 2022-2023Hype period is over. Growth speculators is over!!Now many need to learn how Value Investing in new cycle.When we talk about Value investing ??We talking about ( Business models/revenue/ earning/ active users ...) .Never been more long term bullish on crypto/NFT tech.The future is ALMOST upon us !!..Cheers and stay plugged in so much money to be made this Nov/Dec even 2023 and beyond !!",

They talk about how much the prices dropped during that time and how bubble made a lot of people lose money, but they do not talk about how many companies survived that period and then became huge.If you invested into Amazon 20 years ago when the dotcom bubble happened, that would mean you would be pretty rich person today, even as a kid if you found 100 bucks and invested into it, you would buy a luxury house and car with that, so it’s such an easy thing to buy something when it's low. Crypto is low now, bitcoin is under 17k, if you buy now, in 20 years you will be able to buy anything you want with this too.",

Might he is right about it and we have to anticipate that if we wanted to earn more from investing in crypto then make it start buying them while the price is cheap for this will change sooner. Yes, halving will come by 2024 as predicted and expect a price rally after that. Therefore, there is still a lot of time to prepare before that moment and we don't have to miss this chance as this won't stay like this even next year. But of course, you should choose the right coins for investment as this also matter and affect the results.",

There may be slight ups and downs. But these will be deceptive ascents. The real bear season hasn't really shown itself. Seriously bad news has started to appear in the market and this news will only get worse.",

The future is still good though, you just need to play safe for now and wait for the right timing. As others have said that their analysis that Bitcoin's bottom price value can be around 13k$ each, for me they may be right but for me, the possible bottom of bitcoin can be between 13k$- 10k$ for sure I will not lower that 10k$. But this is only following the analysis based on what I read in the graph chart of bitcoin 1 month ago.If you look at the chart in the past month, you will notice and see that many descending triangles indicate that there will be a big fall in the price of bitcoin, we don't just expect FTX to be one of the fallers and there are other reasons why it will fall even more.",

Lower-than-expected October CPI is a good thing, but let's not forget inflation remains high above 7.7%. That means that the fight against inflation is still very long, it is difficult to expect the Fed to lower interest rates soon because that is showing that their policy of raising interest rates is effective.",

In case of breaking this mentioned support price line on chart, market can even crash down below $10k,IMHO. I don't \"trust\" any TA, that would be weird as it's just matter of probability, I just review their earlier data. And this guy/girl was spot on predicting the crash. I followed him before the crash as he had predicted something else. Right now i can't recall what but you can review his history as everything is transparent.",
