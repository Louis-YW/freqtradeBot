  "content": "I have lived most of my life working all day, the only free day I have is on Sundays, whenever I promised my cousins a visit on holidays I always fail, I have no time to go on holidays and I always end up making less money, with all the hard work.Many people are into crypto for materialistic things, like cars, houses, etc but the best Gift I have attained from Bitcoin investment is free time, to live my life, finally.Bitcoin investment makes me feel alive once again, after so many years of a nonstop workaholic life, now I have enough time to think, travel, rest, go on holidays, spend time with families and still make more money than I used to when I was a workaholic.Now I can do everything I have always wanted, time is not on anyone's side and if you spend all your days on some hard jobs working and working you won't notice how fast time is running and you will age so fast in the process.I remember I got so sick after going from one job to another, I ended up spending a lot of money on my health, I got so thing and my immune system got drained too, you might end up making millions and spending half of that to get back in shape, always remember, health is wealth.Whatever you do, make sure you live your life like someone who is truly alive and breathing, if you are in any hard jobs that's draining your life away right in front of your eye, you need to put a stop to it. I want all the good flashy things in life but the best gift I have now is free time, and Bitcoin makes this possible, I don't know about others and I can't talk for others but, to me, Bitcoin is Freedom.",

But with the help of small freelance jobs I am running online and crypto trading and investment at large, I do what I like at the exact time I want it, I work from home, and even my other side hustles don't stress me at all. Sometimes working very hard with all the stress isn't really worth the earnings, but working smart eventually pays more with lots of comfort as well.",

If money or bitcoin can be accumulated, then over time this can't be done and it only ends.Bitcoin saves time like any form of rising asset value, but I don't see that as the main benefit of btc. Whether you have a lot of money, cash or a credit card, you'd say the dollar gives you freedom. Just like you are talking about BTC.I consider freedom in btcoin the opportunity not to depend on banking or other systems, governments or states, not to depend on one's location and country of residence.",

And at that time I was a car wash and at the same time selling cassava chips and other things that I can't mention, I did all that after I got home from work and also on holidays. And it's all just to get extra income that doesn't know time because my salary is less.and after i was introduced to bitcoin from my friend, everything changed drastically and i just do my job and the rest i can hang out with my friends to have fun. And I can also get married with capital from bitcoin profits, and so on until now my life is very safe and comfortable, especially in financial matters, even the cost of giving birth is also because of bitcoin.so we are all the luckiest people because we have known bitcoin for a long time and are still experiencing financial difficulties, and I pray that everyone is aware that bitcoin has many good benefits for everyone. And that is if we do it right and also be patient.",

People who invest time endlessly to the growth of a company will still not be retained when they are due for retirement. Time is important and you have to understand that just as you dedicate time to work, you should also dedicate time to learning and seeking valuable information that can help you work less and gain more. You are lucky to have been informed about bitcoin else you would have worked yourself to retirement and at the end have little to show for it in most cases.",

And by investing in bitcoins, we can slowly have or achieve what we want and soon, we can reach our goals. And those of us who are familiar with bitcoin want to continue investing in it because it has helped us achieve our goals, even if not all of them.
