So I will like to advise you to have a 100% developed and launched casino before you come here to seek feedback or suggestions so that members can have a real test of your games and thereafter offer their feedback or make suggestions.",

After the launch you can still start a review campaign here in the forum and get people to test the site and give you legit feedbacks on how to develop the casino more.For now you can launch a review or a signature campaign all you can do at this point is to hope that forum do actually take their time to visit your site and tryout the beta version of the site.",

Still wondering what’s the purpose of data tracking since it can’t still change your chances of winning on playing crash game. Anyway, just give some updates with regards to the development of this project and we might see this as interesting once its live already, if this is a free tracking app then it could be better.",

      "body": "OP, to be frank your introduction looks poor and I do not see anything captivating about it. Joining other counterparts, I think it would be impossible to start a review on a beta version of your project when it is not guaranteed if it truly would see the light of the day. I can not review a site or project and at the entire end nothing is implemented or effected. Nobody would want to waste their time doing a review on project which is not yet launched.  It is more of you telling us you want our ideas to build your project but it would be better you make a launch first so that the inputs of members here would count if the case maybe because as it stands now it is assumed you are not serious to do anything and you acknowledging the reviews would be under probability. So no need to do that when the project in question is not yet launched.",

And as much as possible, each player will continue to set the right strategy where we cash in the right bets so that we make a profit. And what we think is the main goal of avoiding cheating, or manipulation so that we don't experience losses, players will automatically manage their time, strategy and place bets at a certain time.",
