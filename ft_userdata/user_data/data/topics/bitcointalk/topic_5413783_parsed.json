So yes again, it will not be a lucrative business in your current environment.One legality I am certain of is that of being licensed by a regulatory body, and in a case where it is illegal to host an offshore casino, it is better to avoid the heat that comes from being found wanting by law, but rather relocate to a country where it can be done.  There's no dodging the huge amount you will spend in organizing a PR marketing campaign and for other bodies of which more taxes and levies would be paid to, so as to fully function.",

Are there things that most don't know when stepping into the business?Thank you, all.Most of the crypto casino get a proxy location on country that has an open law for online gambling such as South America specifically Costa Rica. They do partner on local in there to become a proxy owner of the casino so that they can easily get a license for global operation like Curacao license. I was involved on this kind of startup casino before and our main boss live on UK, we just have a guy living on Costa Rica to do all the paperworks for the casino. The casino just didn’t continue after the boss experienced huge loss on initial run of the casino. There’s no way a resident of restricted country can own a casino that can operate global without using a proxy owner.",

There are a lot of risks and avoiding issues will be very hard, as you would be operating illegally. You would have to offer your services in a shady, secretive way, like through the darkweb or something. And in the end, the probability of you getting caught is extremely high. So there really is no point. You should just look into finding a grey area. For example, what is and is not considered \"gambling\" and how can you offer gambling-type services while remaining in the legal area?In my country, for example, skill-based gambling is not really considered gambling and you would have no problem offering such services. Maybe you can find a loophole for your own country? I recommend asking the people of your own country. We have local boards, perhaps you can ask there?",

Most businesses are given licence to operate to show that it has the approval of the government, now with the restriction you have regarding your business in your country, you may not be able to get the license to operate. The customers to patronize you is also important and if you don't get customers surely you will fail. If your customers decide to use VPN to bypass rules, not all customers will want to keep playing like that and that means you have limited customers.",

Or alternatively you could partner with other well recognized gambling site which may not required you stressing yourself about other than investment and you have your shares from the gambling site.Lastly you can choose to invest in bitcoin and hold for about 3 to 10 years I believe you would never regret it if bitcoin is not restricted in your country as well.",

Are there things that most don't know when stepping into the business?Thank you, all.I don't know how's the approach on online terms but in physical business, at least referring to some cases here in our country, owners and operators from countries where gambling is restricted are travelling to other countries where there will be no problem with legality. From there, they will now established their business on that particular country. Another option, they are doing partnership and business to some people on those gambling-friendly countries to operate and manage the business for them and what will they just do is to cover the funding.But to tell you honestly, it's good to operate a business without thinking of any problems related to legality. Maybe just think of another business.",

Of course those who own or are founders of online casino sites use partnerships with other trusted people in every country that legalizes casinos. even though the owner is in a country that prohibits everything including gambling and crypto, the online casino site owner can still run his business well. he only needs to make funding to each partner that is incorporated. regarding regulation in each country there may be some close ties so there is some leniency towards online casino regulations. Money can arrange anything without any obstacles.",

But it is good to start from the gambling site license, but that does not mean, once a casino has a good review by people and being popular, that is enough to know that such casino is good enough for someone to register. But as for me, I check all. I check the licence, customers review and also the ToS before I join any casino.",

Yes, as practice shows, getting a license from Curacao is one of the easiest and fastest options for obtaining a license for online casinos.You are very right that the Curacao license does not give any guarantee to users, most likely if such a casino turns out to be fraudulent, you can not expect that someone will protect your interests.",
