The total count of Ordinal inscriptions has impressively hit the 48 million mark. Despite initial skepticism about their longevity, these inscriptions have not only persisted but now make up half of all BTC transactions confirmed daily. It is a milestone for Bitcoin miners because they are receiving more bitcoins each block with more earning from transaction fee.Another happy entity is BRC20 developers because they are creating useless inscriptions and get money from this hype wave.Longevity of Ordinals, BRC20 tokens, I believe with their uselessness, they will die soon. Those inscriptions and BRC20 tokens will not have different endings like altcoins NFTs, memecoins.Three months ago, Glassnode Insights released a public report on Ordinals.Inscriptions, Mempools and MinersDune has two interesting stats pages about Ordinals.https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysishttps://dune.com/dataalways/ordinals",

I do hope that the developers finally implement the solution that they've got with regards to this stuff, a lot of people that could've made use of that 50 USD tx fee but instead they're paying it because crazy techies are inscribing stupid and redundant messages in the network.",

It's the same as altcoin market. We know they get dumped and people lose money but because they have a chance of making a profit, they continue paying the exchange fees and endure losses in trading them.In other words the attackers may not even care if they end up paying 1000 satoshi/vbyte if they think they can make a profit on the garbage they are buying.",

These inscriptions have led to high fees which have discouraged many people from using the Bitcoin network, so I don't know how this is a good omen to the community. I think most Bitcoiners will be pleased to see these spam attacks end so that the mempool will become normal. But sadly some groups of people are benefiting from this mess which means it might last for more time unless a drastic step is taken.",

Unfortunately, they are still a thing, apparently, and as of the end of August 2023, they make up the majority of Bitcoin transactions. There are lots of useless altcoins, so I don't understand why people would crowd the precious Bitcoin transactions with a version of NFTs. I read that, apparently, they're more decentralized than traditional NFTs on other blockchains, but do they really need to be decentralized? Why Bitcoin? They are making transaction fees rise, so I'm not a fan. That's not what Bitcoin was made for, and there are plenty of clones of Bitcoin on which such a project could thrive without hurting Bitcoin users.",

Of know the first ordinal was uploaded back in 2022 December. I thought this shit started around in March or the first quarter of 2023. The high traction is not because people are loving this fault but they are using in the hope of making money by becoming eligible for future airdrops. There is great hype for airdrops in the market right now and I have seen many inscription-type airdrops also, which adds a great number to the inscription volume. The 48 million milestone is a great one by the way, it is being adopted by a huge amount of people only in the timespan of one year. But I hope it would have added some value to the BTC blockchain other than using it to dust the network to increase the transaction fee. Only the miners are getting the benefit out of this while we as consumers are facing issues. By the way, should we celebrate this event or not, I think those who must have made some money out of it will prefer to celebrate and those who didn't make any profit will prefer to avoid celebrating.",

While it is good , the other uses of BTC is what has drawn its larger user base to it and it concerns investment with a DCA strategy or HoDling strategy or trading at the best profitable price. No doubt the ordinals made many of the users stick with Bitcoin since Ethereum prides itself with the launch of the NFTs and minting process. BTC ordinals makes up to keep BTC relevant and more valuable but the fees nowadays for transactions is more hefty than would be and something should be done about it, not launching newer innovations that cost more, makes the network jam-packed and invites the wrong users to the right platform.",

To me there isn't a lot to celebrate here, to even DCA into Bitcoin now is getting harder, only miners are the ones that should be celebrating, not investors like us.
