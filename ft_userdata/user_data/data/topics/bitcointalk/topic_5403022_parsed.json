Kind of, because things will take around 10 times longer, and then, after 2016 blocks (so after around 20 weeks, if that would be permanent), the difficulty will adjust to be 4 times easier, then again 2.5 times easier, and since then, the network will function normally.QuoteSo more energy use = more security?Of course. Just download Bitcoin Core and run regtest, even offline. You will have minimal difficulty, minimal energy usage, and all Bitcoin functionality. You will mine all coins in seconds on a CPU. But it will be very insecure, and possible to overwrite instantly, if you will deploy that in such state to the real nodes.",

Probably not. Big dent? Tough to say. There are probably 10s of thousands of hobby miners out there with 1 or 2 pieces of older equipment sitting in storage someplace since they are not worth selling and also not worth running. So, if something really did take out 90% of the hashrate how many people would spin then up just because? As an *extreme* case I have a little over 100TH/s sitting in a storage locker. Just not worth running it. And until the person who is renting the locker needs me to move my crap out it's not worth striping to sell the aluminum for scrap.At the moment I have spare space and power at one of the data centers where we have servers and routers. I could probably get 5 possibly 6 of the A841 running with the power we have after swapping some boards around to get them all to all working. 65TH/s is a tiny tiny tiny fraction of a percent in the speed today. Dropping it 90% it's still a tiny fraction. Add 1000s more people putting their units back online and yes I think there would be a difference.This is all assuming that it's the big farms that went offline and not a world disaster that took out large chunks of the internet.-Dave",

Because as long as SHA-256 is not broken, there is no need to change it.Nope, we have seen it before. We have had a fairly huge drop >40% of the hashrate during the migration from China. That resulted in a huge sell-off as well. However, people were well aware the root cause of it and it was reasonable to expect them to be turned online again. The impact of it should be magnitudes bigger, given the larger percentage.Economic-wise, it is fairly easy to imagine what will happen. 90% drop either means the hashrate is so centralized that some disaster took them out, which is bad by itself or that miners decided collectively to stop mining. Either of them will almost definitely result in a sharp drop in the price. The remaining miners which were still profiting at the current difficulty will shut down. This results in a >90% difficulty drop in all. Even if you were to take into account, by considering the total difficulty drop, you will still see a very significant crash in price. Miners are the backbone of the network and having 90% of them leave (ie. industry being worth tens of billions) is not a good look for Bitcoin.Furthermore, because every Crypto is in essence tied to Bitcoin, the little (and potentially diminished) profits in merged mining doesn't warrant enough for anyone to really turn their miners on. So, I would believe that the protocol will survive and function but not the economy.",

Since you are only focusing on mining security not just security alone, the mining security depends on hashrate not energy consumption and how easy it is for one entity to acquire majority of it and how distributed this hashrate is.For example if we have 50 individual miners that consume minuscule amount of energy and they do not cooperate with each other and no new miner could come online (assume the equipment is unique and scarce) that provides a lot of security.But if we have 100k miners that are consuming all the energy in the world but 99k of them connect to a single server (a mining pool) that provides no security whatsoever because one entity has control over the majority of hashrate.",
