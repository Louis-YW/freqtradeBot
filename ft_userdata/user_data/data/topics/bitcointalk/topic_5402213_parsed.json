This means the management must have studied all the pros and cons of market and it’s effect on their revenue generation. They understand the risk of volatility and continues to accept bitcoin anyways. Dubai is obviously land of richest always thrives into modernity and accept everything with open arms. This decision will attract big crowds, lavish tourists to their front yard for sure. Great to read this news.",

Dubai has always been very open for tourists who want to explore their country and offer their best resorts and hotels. So adopting crypto payments is certainly a good advantage as the people around the world have seen that crypto will always be in progress and become the trend now. Hopefully, not only their resorts and hotels will be open for crypto payments, but also their huge tourist spots and big department stores will widely accept crypto.",

I think next to their big leap is accepting crypto payment in their international airports as it would attract more tourists from other far and neighboring countries. I believe they are seeing this already that crypto will be a big thing in the market and that they make sure to stay ahead from other hotels and resorts as that would create more income on their part as they now both accept both fiat and crypto.",

While crypto offers anonymity, the available payment methods like plastic cards offers convenience. But I think it will be very handy for international travelers because they won't have to pay currency conversion charges while using bitcoin or ETH while making such payments. I just hope that they accept LN to add more convenience to the travelers.",

This new entertainment hotel will be accepting cryptocurrencies as payment from guests from day one, as legislation in the country permits it....Nisthar, group director of revenue at FIVE Hotels and Resorts, told The Fintech Times. “Switzerland has always been at the forefront of fintech and cryptocurrency. FIVE Teams have worked with partners to ensure the best payment features are on offer for guests, allowing them to pay in Bitcoin and Ethereum.”Let's just hope they partner with a gateway that has friendlier terms e.g. not those who has a history of KYCing their merchant's customer as that could deter people for opting for crypto payments.",
