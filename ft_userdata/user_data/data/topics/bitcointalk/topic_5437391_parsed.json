And doing it, how do you see this ?I don't think you should ask for reviews or feedback on the experiences of your trading transactions with forum members. Some of them will do it after the transaction is completed, but in some cases you may need to ask for that feedback especially for transactions involving large amounts of money.To be honest, you probably shouldn't be asking for feedback on $1-$10 transactions, but for relatively high amounts like $100 - $1000, I think you deserve it as long as you're not begging. But until now, I haven't had any experience with this, so whatever I say is just an assumption.",

I ask my client or anyone to whom I provided the service to drop their feedback about the deal or the service I provided them politely. Is this why you have 0 positive trust lol? In all seriousness IMO you should never ask for a positive feedback to be left. If someone wants to leave 1 they will, but then you have cases where users may have no clue how or why to leave trust, positive or negative. So, I think if you make a deal with a newer account you might ask them to leave a feedback and explain how it's done so that there's a record of the trade, but if making a deal with a seemingly seasoned member don't ask. If you want to leave them a feedback, go ahead. As far as seeing it, the little +0/=0/-0 on the left hand side of each of your posts is where that is reflected. Be aware that only trust from DT members is seen by others unless they are looking at your profile and all feedbacks left.",

Trading small amount money is worth to leave positive feedback too, especially when you think the account will scam since he doesn't have any reputation or get negative feedback.Quote from: Pokapoka124 on January 30, 2023, 11:45:59 PMI don’t believe someone should been give a positive feedback just because of a single successful transaction.

However there are a lot inappropriate positive feedback used in this forum, I still think it's way more better to leave positive feedback for small amount trade rather than the user is scam buster, high rank, good guy, respected user etc.",
