And at this time, the lowest that we've seen for the past years was $3k+ on 2018.And after hitting the ATH of $69k, we saw the new high low at $17k which has happened just last month. That's actually positive if you're looking at that perspective.",

Thanks for the observation correction made. Lately the price has been of great concern especially to those who possibly joined the peer-2-peer network from November last year. From the chart I was able to deduce how far Bitcoin price skyrocketed from 2010 when it was close to been valueless to it's ATHs in 2021 as well as how the price kept fluctuating since then pointing towards the bear. My sole aim is to ensure as many Bitcoin holders have that believe that prices will spike again",

As you said this is not the first time bitcoin slump so hopefully the data will be the huge basis for other to trust bitcoin since red days normally happen on it every year.",

And it would be great if Bitcoin could be at a price of $100k next year because it would break the ATH $68,991k record that Bitcoin has ever achieved. But I would also be happier if Bitcoin could be at $70k, even though $100k is a higher price than I said. And I think to be at that price, Bitcoin needs a little longer pump time than last year, because it was a very big price target and Bitcoin started at $20k which is certainly a long way from the bottom up.",

Price action is a technique to understand how the price going to react based on the knowledge we get from the history of the price. Regarding bitcoin, there are many things to say but in short words, the trend is still an uptrend if you check the chart in long term from tears ago, and corrections happened are totally normal because since we see sharp and huge movements to higher price levels, we should also be ready to see the corrections to lower levels and sometimes these corrections are just falling lowers than anyone could be expected ever but still, that's pretty much healthy",

      "body": "In fact, many people will be very worried about the decline and will not even be able to control it during the correction. Panic selling so far has sent the bitcoin price tumbling to a 7-month low of $17.7K. What are the best ways, I just think that this is too wide an entrance to start making purchases and accumulations. This 70% discount is very rare, but I believe there are still bigger discounts from now on because the bearish trend is not over yet. Consider DCA to invest in, we don't have much chance in the future if the rally starts.Why not worry? The reason: Bitcoin still has a lot of potential and the ATH cycle may still repeat itself after its halving in 2024. You are investing with private money with an amount you can afford to lose, but if you are using borrowed money then your worries are understandable.",

It doesn't show shit. Take a look at 2022. It shows February and March as green months with some serious gains in Feb, but this doesn't mean a thing if those gains are after a big crash. If the price were to fall 50% and then gain 10% the next month you'd see that month as a green month, but that green month would still mean a 40% loss for your portfolio. Whole 2022 is a read year if you read it right. January -17, February +12 and March +5 so that's a 17% loss followed by a 17% gain over the next 2 months. Looks good, but in January you were already 26% down from the top so we weren't gaining anything just sitting at a loss that turned into a bigger loss in April and May, to finally capitulate with a huge 38% loss. What if this month shows as green? 5% up, hurray! One thing I can read from this chart is that last time it was this bad was in 2011.",
