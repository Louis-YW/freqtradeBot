  "content": "I have a shop and experimented with receiving bitcoin/crypto last year. Coinbase Commerce looked good and was working fine.Now I wanted to implement this in a new shop again and it looks like they have only offer USDC in an \"auto-convert\" system to new accounts? My old account is working fine accepting all kinds of cryptos.Is it really like that now? I don't see any option to turn auto-convert off. Would it be possible to connect 2 shops under 1 account?Glad about any answer here.",

Is KYC proof or something similar missing? Coinbase itself explicitly advertises Coinbase Commerce by stating that a large number of coins are supported: SourceIf I were you, I would simply contact support. They will certainly be able to help you with your second question.",

Thanks![quote Glad that you're able to sort out this issue, now you can conveniently use two different coinbase wallets for your two different shops. I don't use coinbase, I'm just in this thread to learn with you, and I'm glad that you went to their reliable source, the support service.Crypto understanding is very vast, it's not easy to acquire every knowledge, this is why this forum is a store of crypto knowledge value.",
