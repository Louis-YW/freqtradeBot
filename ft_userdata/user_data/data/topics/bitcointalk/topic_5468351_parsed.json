      "body": "These two are popular in British and they have supporters, they may not be the top Featherweight fighters in the World, but they deserve to be on top of the featherweight, I understand the winner will fight Cordina who is an upcoming sensational fighter in Britain, Wood is likely to win the match based on their last fights, Warrington's sorry loss against Luis Alberto Lopez is ugly to watch he was exposed as someone who has a weak chin.I expect a slugfest in this fight because the fight will be in front of their fans, it will be for pride and who is the better British featherweight.",

      "body": "It was a very thrilling and very controversial match Wood scored a knockdown exactly after the bell sounded to end the 7th round Just as expected both fighters come out very aggressive at the start of the bell with Warrington starting the assault until Leigh Wood catches him with a right hook that stuns him Wood follows it up with a barrage of punches he is able to get up but he had a very shaky leg and the referee stops the fight QuoteAt the time of the stoppage, Warrington was ahead by the scores: 58-56 59-55 59-55 It was interesting that Alexander didnâ€™t give Warrington the chance to make it out of the round, as he likely would have done so. Who knows whether Warrington would have recovered in between rounds. If so, he would have cruised to victory because Wood was bleeding from his right, and getting dominated by Warrington.Source: Josh Warrington Wants Rematch With Leigh Wood At City Ground - Boxing News 24 (https://www.boxingnews24.com/2023/10/josh-warrington-wants-rematch-with-leigh-wood-at-city-ground/)See the full fight here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbrbzTFduU",
