Is there anything where the profit/spend ratio will be reasonable (at least 50%).Any other ideas how to spend it? Thanks",

Will you be able to run mining on these cloud servers?If you received a gift, then I think that such use has restrictions for mining, and you will be blocked.Try Radiant (RXD) if you can.",

ThanksAs far as I know AWS has locked the option of mining but since you have a lot of money to spend as 75.000 dollars is truly a lot of money any coin you try to mine you will be in profit as you are using gift money.I would mine any coin I see fit and that is compatible with the servers you have for use in AWS.For other ideas,you can open up a cracking password service,wallet recovery service for cryptos but this needs a lot of expertise compared to mining so if you have that expertise go ahead and do this second option but keep in mind that you need clients for this,so mining rests the primary use case for that huge amount of money.",

      "body": "Its been years since I last used AWS for anything mining related however you need to find out how you got those credits. If you got them as a promo and got them for free, most likely they will not allow mining. If however you are actually paying out of pocket for the mining then it should be ok. At first you might be limited to a few servers but after they get your payment and everything you can rent more.However right now, even with free credits there isnt anything to mine. The best was Zcoin back in 2017 or so. I remember each rented rig made like $1/day. So the more rigs you rented the more money you made. And it was like that for a couple of months. Many people made a good killing.",
