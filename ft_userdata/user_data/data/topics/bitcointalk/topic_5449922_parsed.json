Although this could be right some other times but it is not entirely good to trust on them. Currently the bitcoin market is still young considering what the future holds. All this prices below 30k is still a good starting point and it will be advisable to start buying now. Using the method of DCA could save you the stress of waiting for the right time. The only right time is to buy bitcoin is to buy when you have the money right at hand. Imagine waiting for a dump of less than 20k and bitcoin starts to rise in price right to another height? It would be an opportunity missed by you. Invest now using the DCA method, either weekly or monthly since your income is on salary",

Just don't use all your money that you're about to invest on bitcoin to buy in just 1 time.If you really want to buy some Bitcoin don't wait too long, no one knows how expensive Bitcoin will be in a few months, and it may become harder for some people, including you to buy it.Quote from: Grasper on April 23, 2023, 09:35:00 PMAnd to be honest I don't trust those votes much, I'll just use my mind and stick on my own decision after reading from different sources.",

      "body": "OP, most of the time, all this price analysis of Bitcoin is not so accurate. If you have, say, $1k to invest in Bitcoin, instead of waiting for the right signal to buy, you can decide to buy $10 -$15 of Bitcoin every week just as the price fluctuates. Don't just invest the whole amount at once. There are chances that if you are only waiting for the right time to buy, the market can get into a big uptrend and maintain the price for a long time. So instead of just waiting for the perfect opportunity to buy, you can DCA.That's ðŸ‘† not investment advice, but just a suggestion.",

You shouldn't wait till you have milions of dollars or till the price of bitcoin gets to $5 before you invest in it.",

Heck, I'll even go as far as saying that you will most probably buy bitcoins blindly if the goal is for the long-term. I think a lot of people here would agree about that. For now, before buying anythin, maybe learn as much as you can first. Learn about wallets prior to learning about market movements. A lot of scams and attacks have become sophisticated over the year that it's scary to be ignorant of them and how to avoid them.",

Itâ€™s better you donâ€™t listen to people are saying if you really want to stay long in crypto space, always do your analysis and know the best time to invest. If you are planning to invest in bitcoin for long period of time, then I believe if you invest now itâ€™s not really a bad idea, the only people that should be disturbed by bitcoin price movements are the bitcoin day traders or mid term investors, but if you are planning to hold for long, then you donâ€™t have to panic.",

If you feel that it is going to go down then follow your instinct. Or you can do a cost averaging investment and i think this would be good way to invest. You are right money investment need to be carefully planned but until when? No one knows if the market will go down drastically or will go higher. If you are aiming for a long term anytime would be the best time to invest.",

If you want to trade, you have to make an on-chain transaction from Electrum to your exchange account, and wait for 1 to 3 confirmations (depends on each exchange requirement) to start trading.If you store your bitcoins directly on an exchange, you can trade it any time like when you feel panic or being greed.Trading can not help you rich but holding can help you. In addition, by storing your bitcoins on exchanges, you have more risk.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Money investment need to be carefully planned. This is just my plan, you can advice or give it kudos.You should definitely NOT be waiting to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is much more likely to be much higher than it is today in a few weeks and in a few months than it is to be lower or even anywhere near the current price. Now is an amazing time to buy Bitcoin. It even just corrected a bit this week so the price is extra low. If you are trying to get the lowest possible price you will almost certainly be buying higher than the current price. You should be DCA'ing into Bitcoin, not hoping to get lucky and pick out the lowest price. The price is very low right now and you should definitely start buying today. Maybe you get lucky and you are able to buy lower, but if you wait you will almost certainly be buying higher.Furthermore you should definitely not be relying on some vote on some website as having any validity for what the market will do.Start buying today (you may never get a better price) and buy regularly. Buy a little bit once a week or whatever you want to do. But start now, the price is low and it won't be long until people were wishing they were buying in now.",

I mean you can just stick to study the chart, price movements, and things like that, but this kind of signal only shows that you're also depending on other people's decision. What if the Bitcoin drops a certain percentage and the vote says \"hold, don't buy yet\" and then Bitcoin just bounced 100% back and left that figure and never returned. That's a big missed opportunity right? IMO, following this votes is not like what you've said \"Money invested need to be carefully planned.\" because basically, it was never YOU who planned when to put your money and when to sell. Carefully planned investments always starts and ends with you making all the decisions after going through a thorough research and due diligence.",
