For the experts in the house, how true is it that Ethereum is more decentralized than Bitcoin? Bitcoin was solely made to replace the usual currency - FIAT. I'm gonna say, it hasn't fulfilled its purpose entirely but this whole decentralization was put in place through that path; a path that ethereum only improvised on some protocols ... maybe like introducing smart contracts, DEFIs and NFTs... That doesn't make the coin more decentralized than Bitcoin, does it?Quote from: franky1 on February 22, 2024, 10:06:59 PMif ethereum is so decentralised.. then why is its market rate not independentjust look at the prices of the markets. ethereum follows bitcoin like a shadow 9#% of the time. exactly! Why hasn't it grown beyond it's 4k limit since 2021? Secondly, what's this DApps liverage that made ethereum to create a version of BTC on Thier network?

Do not think too much about this, whenever you read statements like that you need to think about the intention behind them, and it is obvious this is an attempt to try to make altcoins more appealing than bitcoin and hype them for the upcoming bull run, while trying to keep bitcoin in check at the same time, will it work?

In the crypto world, talks about decentralization can be a sneaky way to hype up altcoins and make them look better than Bitcoin. This comparison like giving Ethereum a higher decentralization score seems like a move to grab attention and build excitement especially for the upcoming bull run. If you've been in the game for a while, you can see through the marketing tactics. It's a reminder to stay sharp and not get swayed by the buzz because there's often more to these comparisons than meets the eye",
