Was the purchase on the exchange successful and was the Bitcoin moved from the exchange to somewhere else. You need to make the discussion clear and this will help to determine who can actually help in the recovery if it will be possible.",

      "body": "If for example, someone hacks through your account (PayPal or exchange) and steal your coins, I don't think there's any way the exchange can help you, because the coins that was stolen from you by the thief must have already been converted to fiat before you act. But if it was the exchange that got hacked and they have a policy that they will refund their customers, then you can be sure that they will give back your money but you don't know how long that will take for customers to get back their money. I will advise that you should never save your money on exchange or centralized accounts like PayPal and if you have small funds on those account, make sure to secure your account with 2 factor authenticator.",

With what I read there they had to shut down because of the lope hole the scammers discovered and used again by now the Bitcoin would have been forwarded to other places which makes it a lot harder to track and follow up.",

The middleman won't process send the payment if the seller haven't  given the product and the buyer won't get the product if the payment haven't sent to the middleman yet. In short, middleman will hold the product if it's digital goods and also the payment and give the payment to the seller once the buyer receive what he bought.",

Since you are using Paypal if ever you buy BTC from any exchanges or you buy BTC from a phishing or hackers website anytime you can dispute and reverse the transaction. That is why nowadays there are no crypto platform or exchanges that accept PayPal as payment method because anyone can chargeback like on the screenshot you provided, scammers and hackers do this trick to scam exchanges or to anyone else. So if you are the one who bought BTC using PayPal, you can reverse the transaction, unlike BTC once they sent it to your wallet and confirmed the exchange, or where you buy BTC, they can't reverse the transaction.",

Your funds is only as safe as the device you use it in, if you use your wallet in an online device, then you are vulnerable to hackers. To safely store your funds, you need to store it in cold storage and practice good opsec, to increase your safety you should also set up extra layers of security like extending your seed phrase with a passphrase or setting up a multisig wallet.",
