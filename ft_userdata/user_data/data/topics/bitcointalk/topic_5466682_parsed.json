The way in which you present the whole matter will have the greatest influence on the success itself.I still believe that this forum can be a good starting point, for presenting an idea and expanding the community and people interested in your project. Certainly, first of all, you have to thoroughly research the existing market, maybe your innovative idea is not so unique.",
