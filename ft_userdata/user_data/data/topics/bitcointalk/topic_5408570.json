  "content": "picture3  picture2 picture1Today about  770  million people live without access to electricity, mostly in Africa and Asia. Considering the high cost of buying and maintaining other sources of power, generating set has become the generally accepted source of power. The cheapest generator might cost about $200. While other sources of power would be much more expensive. The average cost of running a small portable generator costs about $30 to $70 per day, while a 15- to 20-kilowatt generator that powers the entire home will cost about $50 to $150 per day. In a  region  where 85% live on less than $5.50 per day, access to electricity is a major challenge. Most people that are interested in Bitcoin are discouraged because they don’t have access to electricity to power their phone or other appliances that can grant them access to the Bitcoin space. And they cannot afford the cost of buying and running a generator.There are predictions that Bitcoin  can still hit $100,000-$150,000 price mark in few years but the rate at which new consumers are buying and exploring it would determine the price. Bitcoin adoption increased  880%  in one year and developing nations had the highest increase. If Bitcoin would achieve the mark of 1 billion users by 2024 and 4 billion users by 2030 then developing nation must have access to major infrastructures like electricity to drive this growth. Interestingly, growth rate in access to  internet  is currently high in developing countries like in the Sub-Saharan Africa region with a growth rate of over 90%. This shows that developing countries have a rapidly growing interest in the internet and the related innovations. The economies of developing nations might be very insignificant when compared with developed nations but it can have a positive impact on the Bitcoin space. And this can be achieved if developing nations have access to electricity. Seeking cheap alternative and innovative means of power such as solar powered phones and computers can be a good starting point. Instead of buying an entire solar system which includes batteries, inverter, panel, etc, an affordable phone or laptop with inbuilt solar system would be ideal. These developing nations might no have the financial power, but they have the population.",

Africa is often mentioned as a continent with great potential in terms of a very large and relatively young population, but without enough resources that enable them to be included in everything that offers access to the Internet and electricity. Of course, this is changing, but it will take a long time until the electric network is built, while the Internet is something that is in a better position because it can become available through mobile networks or via satellite.A few years ago I watched a documentary about how people in Africa manage to charge their phones at stations that offer such a service, and some are even mobile and use solar panels.

Do you really believe that the growth will come from people who earn less than 5$ a day? Do you think their first choice once they get electricity would be to invest...what?

Then making the Internet widely available is the next step, and ensuing that people can afford devices to frequently access the Internet (a laptop or a smartphone, at least) is next. Prior to all that, we can't expect people who live in poverty and without access to all these basic requirements for using Bitcoin to become interested. But even when all of that is widely available, it doesn't mean people will turn to Bitcoin, as there's a huge difference between the number of active Internet users and Bitcoin users. Creating a fruitful ground is good (and regardless of whether people choose to adopt Bitcoin, they should enjoy access to electricity and the Internet), but it doesn't mean that when these conditions are met, it will automatically lead to higher Bitcoin adoption. And yeah, I don't think that 1 billion by 2024 is realistic.",

I read some article before on how to have a wise estimate on how many real bitcoin holders are there. Since a user can have a multiple address containing dust amount, Some expert suggest that counting the number of people registered on exchange is probably the best thing to do due to KYC since the majority of crypto holder is using exchange and probably undergo KYC due to regulatory compliance.I just saw some flaw on this method which user can create multiple account different exchange unless all exchange share there data to each other to have a single database to count unique users.Article: https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoin-users/",

Namely: Volatility, Ease of use and general reluctance to change the status quo. If El Salvador is of any indication, Bitcoin is not a sustainable currency where volatility is of any concern. It can be worse than the major currency in those countries because of its volatility. You can still argue that their currency may be subjected to hyperinflation but USD or major market currencies are far more stable. In countries with low literacy rates, you have very few of the people who are willing and able to use technology to their advantage. They are far more likely to be willing to maintain the status quo due to the lack of understanding of alternative currencies.The problem is not with the ease of access but it is an entire myriad of problem that plagues the lack of adoption.",

Africa has a lot to offer, and it's teaming youths desperate for ways to alleviate themselves from the economic hardship instilled as a result of bad leadership will always consider and embrace cryptocurrency if they are exposed to it as a way out.Corrections appreciated sir; it should be improved or better access to electricity. Like you rightly stated there are still areas in rural areas that lack access to electricity and even in some urban areas have not enjoyed power supply for years due to infrastructural problems. Youths in developing nations are very creative, innovative and very diligent. Hence, they would gladly grab any opportunity that can grant them access to financial freedom. Quote from: dbc23 on August 03, 2022, 06:22:45 PMThe cost of running alternate source of power supply are quite expensive in developing nations but this doesn't mean there are no power supply at all. Thank you sir, developing nations have access to electricity but the point is that a large number of the population either have no access or epileptic supply. Hence, my take is that improvement in power supply can affect Bitcoin adoption positively.  Quote from: darkangel11 on August 03, 2022, 08:28:08 PMIf electricity was the only problem in bitcoin adoption, we'd still have much more users than we have.

Yes challenges of Bitcoin usage are multidimensional, but I just had the privilege of identifying electricity.
