      "body": "Nice to see another raffle for a quality HW wallet.c - KryptowerkThere are a few important qualities to a good mixer. The obvious ones include anonymity of user-data.However I'd say one of the maybe overlooked ones is ease-of-use and adoption.Ideally you can easily access the mixer within a wallet with just a few clicks. This increases the number of mixed BTC - if everyone would use a mixer, all coins would be equal again. Ofc this would also need low fees - which would be possible of volume is high enough.Just my 2 sats. Thanks.",

As long as you have that you're good to goTo build off this a good mixer also needs to have a high amount of users using the mixing service to allow for a solid coinjoin. Having a threshold for a minimum amount of users, let's say 50 per conjoin helps with anonymity.Also it must have TOR capabilities as well as the option to mix multiple values of BTC at a time. For example mixing 1 BTC, 0.5 BTC, or 0.1 BTC at a time is a must.",

The people running the mixer should do their best for eearning users' trust.Then a flawless functionality is also needed. All options offered by the website should work as designed.
