  "content": "I have a few transactions I need to search for in block explorers but they are all in image format. I could just try to extract the text from the image but that is going to be highly inconvenient. Is there not a block explorer that lets you search for transactions/addresses/blocks by the first few characters? So far, I know that Blockstream and blockchain.com don't let you do that.",

      "body": "nc50lc beat me to it - walletexplorer works for this. Usually down to 6 characters, but you will get a lot of duplicates with only 6 characters so better to use a few more, and obviously double check that it has indeed found the right address/transaction and not another one with starts with the same string.Note that they are often not fulled synced with the blockchain. If you scroll to the bottom it will tell you they are currently synced to block 777,528, which is around 250 blocks from the current tip. So any transactions more recent than this won't be indexed by them yet.",

It worked even with the first 7 characters. I also tested walletexplorer with the first 6 characters. It brought me a different transaction, not the one I was looking for.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on February 22, 2023, 10:20:33 AMUsually down to 6 characters, but you will get a lot of duplicates with only 6 characters so better to use a few more, and obviously double check that it has indeed found the right address/transaction and not another one with starts with the same string.I think if you enter a few first characters of a transaction (at least 6, it doesn't work with 5 characters at all) and there are more than 1 transaction starting with those characters, it shows the one that is alphabetically ahead.",

Does it just harvest the blocks folder of some full nodes and then converts it into its own format?",
