  "content": "Just recently , the Nigerian ex deputy senator (Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice) were arrested in UK on allegation of organ harvesting. It appears the couple wanted to secure a kidney transplant for the daughter in UK who had been diagnosed of kidney failure.The wife got released while the senator will still be in UK custody till ending of October. The lesson about to be drawn out is that in Nigeria, it is unheard that a local counsellor would be in police custody if you at least belong to the ruling party not to mention a \"whole\" senator in Nigeria but the UK system works, they have held down different prime ministers to step down for violating their laws. The difference is that the UK system is judiciously following the law and their law respects no human while the Nigerian system is highly selective, in justice it is very partial. The organ harvesting case of senator Ike Ekweremadu would have been a normal in Nigeria because he is a law maker but the law he makes, caught up with him in UK. I still remember the Nigerian government was not able to jail James Onanefe Ibori (Formal Governor of Delta State) for money laundering but the UK system did that perfectly well and he got his term served out. So do you think Senator Ike Ekweremadu would go the way of ex governor James Ibori, being convicted and confined to serve a jail term in UK?",

I still remember the Nigerian government was not able to jail James Onanefe Ibori (Formal Governor of Delta State) for money laundering but the UK system did that perfectly well and he got his term served out. The truth of the matter is that most of the politicians in Nigeria go unpunished for most of the crimes they have been accused of committing mostly because there was no substantial evidence against them but this doesn't mean that if the politicians are tried and found guilty of the crimes they won't face the law. Some of the politicians have been arrested, tried, and persecuted here in Nigeria mostly for money laundering and diversion of funds(EFCC). The case of the senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Ike Ekweremadu's involvement in organ harvesting and his arrest came as a surprise because a man of such caliber and a practiceng law maker should not be involved in such evil. Well, I believe if he was arrested in Nigeria by now he would have regained his freedom because of his position but that doesn't mean that he won't face the law if he was found guilty.",

The Nigerian system is only corrupt, it is not that they can't do a good job in terms of pinning down culprit but they compromise the system base on who you have in the highest level of government. There are abundance of evidence to prosecute many of the allegations but because the system is always corrupt then you won't hear more of such case and for those that were managed to be prosecuted and sent to a prison term, there have been presidential pardon. One time Plateau state governor, Joshua Dariye and the counterpart Jolly Nyame past governor of Taraba State were pardoned from serving 10 years and 12 years jail term after being convicted of stealing 1.126bn naira and 1.64bn Naira respectively. This IMO amounts to waste of tax payers money as it was surpose to be examplary.There are proper information gathering and information but the spirit of carrying it out is the challenge. It is always in the news that the secret service or the DSS will warn about an eminent attack and yet such attack will happen and people will die and perpetrators will go freely, that is a system that is compromised.",

So do you think Senator Ike Ekweremadu would go the way of ex governor James Ibori, being convicted and confined to serve a jail term in UK?well Nigeria was brought up by the same British government but Nigeria decides to follow American model of government which is Presidential system, and this was adopted in the year 1979 in the second republic of Nigeria. At first Nigeria practiced the British parliamentary system of government but that could not the withstand with the  test of time in Nigeria because for then the leaders said, the parliamentary system did not carry everybody along so they looked for a system which can carry everybody in the country. so Presidential system was used to replaced the British Monarchical system. American system became a danger weapon to Nigerian, It brought democracy (true democracy and fiscal democracy) which Nigerian government can practice in any day. British government put their youths first in the yearly budget or allocation for jobs and other benefits before any other thing while Nigerian government is selfcentred government, it does not care about your in any way.",

      "body": "I don't understand why you made the comparison with Nigeria in particular. In most third world countries, laws are just words on paper or are only applied to poor citizens.There are laws in Nigeria that are able to protect the entire system, but they are waiting for someone who is able to activate them.It cannot be denied that even in developed countries, there is a category of people against whom the law is not applied. Those with influence can override the law through the law itself. All it takes is a good group of lawyers.",

      "body": "Although the UK colonized Nigeria, the systems in Nigeria and the UK are somewhat similar but also very different in many other ways. However, their systems of government are different; the UK uses the monarchy and the PARLIAMENT system, whereas Nigeria uses the presidential system. A representational system of government in which the people elect their leaders or representatives through elections is what both democracies have in common. The majority of our laws are identical to UK laws because the Nigerian constitution was adapted from the UK constitution. The differences between the two systems are as follows: Nigerian law forbids same-sex marriage. While in Nigeria, the system is elite-oriented, it is citizen-oriented in the UK. The Nigerian legal system postpones decisionsmany years, while the UK system rendered a decision quickly.",

No, whatever we sow we will reap, it is common with the elites who think they have the money and the power to enjoy life to the fullest forgetting that others are suffering because of their negligence, irresponsibilities and bad corruption they have ventured into, then comes the mighty hands of nature strucking them with all manners of plagues, there is  adherence to law and order in UK than Nigeria and things they see and do ordinarily in the heir country maybe against the law in others.",

The UK system believes that any defaulter of the law should be penalized and brought to book. But the Nigerian system as you carefully noted, blatantly disregards human rights and carefully shields those in power and puts it under the guise of immunity. It's good to note that a senator has been duly brought to book for his crimes but what I don't understand is why his wife, Beatrice gets to be released and he stays back. Is it cause he was a co conspirator in the act even after knowing the law? Well one can only chalk their actions down to selfishness and a plain disregard for the law.",
