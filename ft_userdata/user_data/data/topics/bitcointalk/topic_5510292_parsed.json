It does not do anything with scalability of Bitcoin blockchain.QuoteHave you had any experiences with node deployment or staking?This board is for Bitcoin discussions and Bitcoin is a Proof of Work coin. If you want to get bitcoin through works, you have to mine Bitcoin blocks and confirm Bitcoin transactions, you are a Bitcoin miner and your work is mining.There is nothing like Staking on Bitcoin blockchain. It's not a Proof of Stake coin.There are scam tokens, and you usually see them with names like Wrapped Bitcoin tokens, but they are shitcoins deployed on altcoin blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana. You can lose money to these scam tokens if they lose pegs to Bitcoin price.",

Have you had any experiences with node deployment or staking? Share your thoughts and insights!  Yes simplified node deployment would help in increasing number of nodes in the Blockchain and textbook wise help improve decentralization But that's a No, It could lead to centralization since many who lack the know how could flock to third parties server This would increase over reliance on a third party and not truly Decentralized. Since there would be few independent server. P. S simplified nodes deploymentÂ  is not same as Light nodes. Now to staking? Well if Bitcoin wants to loss out on been decentralized then staking would be used. Yes it would increase participants due to incentives but like the Ethereum Blockchain, it becomes reliant on a central unit. Staking and simplified node deployment would bring a flaw into the Bitcoin Blockchain security rather than improving it. No matter how secured, or well protected a system isIf it's in the hands of another or a selected fewThen it's never secured.",

There are 3 options of node deployment: on your own, via infrastructure and via cloud provider or to rent a server. Have anybody tried running a node with Waterfall Network? Can you share your experience please?It's derivative product from centralized exchanges or staking platforms or altcoin projects with scam Wrapped tokens.Wrapped tokens are risky because of their pegs to Bitcoin price can be lost.With centralized platforms, exchanges to staking platforms, after you deposit your bitcoin to their platforms for staking, you no longer control your bitcoin. Will you receive your initial bitcoin back, depends on these platforms. Risk to lose your deposit is high and it's biggest concern you must think, before thinking of earning through staking.",
