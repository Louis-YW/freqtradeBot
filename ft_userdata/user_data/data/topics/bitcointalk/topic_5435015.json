      "body": "Count me in icopress. Is there no application form before making review, and should we post reviews in this topic?Reserved. My review:I am using Betnomi website for longer period of time with some pauses when they changed design, and when I didn't have coins in my account.Registration was fast but we all had to registered again when they updated website, good thing is that there is not mandatory kyc verification.Current design is much better than it was before, dark theme is perfect for my eyes and every page is opened very fast for me.I am mostly using sports betting and I love that Betnomi is one of the best crypto gambling websites that support most MMA sports from all competition (UFC, Bellator, PFL, Invicta, One Championship, Ares...).Odds are not always the highest, but there is enough market options and they once had nice competitions for free bets, called Predictor (I want to see this returned).Deposits fork fine and many coins are supported including Bitcoin, but there was some issues with withdrawal being processed manually and slow.Betnomi support said this was fixed but we still see members complaining about this, in my case this never happened.One problem I face when placing bets on Betnomi is that I can't bet with all money I have in my account, when I press MAX it shows me maximum amount I can bet, so I always need to enter coin amount or USD value manually.For some events maximum I can bet is much lower than on other gambling websites, and this can be improved.This is all I can say now about Betnmi, but I will add more if I remember in next days. bc1qdsrr2sxt8kfjw0rd9yzlw7twk7n8ehq5lh5h6s",

      "body": "My Review about Betnomi - Leading Bitcoin Casino and Crypto Sportsbook.I've seen a lot of crypto gambling/casino before that I can say \"Betnomi is better\".The \"Welcome Bonus, Get up to 325%\" on the first page made my signing up and logging in faster. It is good that the team made different ways to log in like google and telegram that will make users to log in easier. DESIGN The darkmode is pretty good but I didn't find a way to go in light mode? Some of the people will prefer light mode specially to those who go out and gamble at the same time. Betnomi website are black and green themed. I suggest to add light mode. The interface is 9/10 since I was searching for a light mode and I think devs should start working on it.DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWALThe minimum withdrawal is 0.00095686 BTC currently 20$+ for me it is a bit high specially to those who are just starting gambling. I did not see any minimum deposits in the website but I asked one of the customer support and responds quickly and said that 5 USD or around 0.00022 BTC is the minimum depositing amount which is good for starters. Having different types of options on depositing is great. Hoping to add more crypto alternatives on deposits option.GAME Betnomi has a lot of games to offer Casino, Live Casino, Games, Live sport, Sport, E-Sport, Poker, Blast and Mines. I did not experience any errors while loading the game unlike others. ¬†The sportsbook odds are always higher and has more markets compare to competitors. The E-Sport for me was the best since I do like Dota and CSGO, will be betting soon. 300 traders run live games in Betnomi, using complicated automated tools for market management and odds setting. 300 is enough for the team. Wagers are more than 50 multiple games and events. This encompasses not just the most popular sports, but also poker, politics, television, and other forms of entertainment, as well as electronic tournaments.CommunityThe community of betnomi inside the live chat is good. Meet a lot of nice guy. As a gamer that has been around for a while, what I've always liked about betnomi was the community.Customer SupportBetnomi provides a round-the-clock customer service to answer your inquiries and provide support. I asked some questions and it was answered quickly. 10/10 for the cs.Betnomi don't require KYC which is good since gamblers don't need much time just to verify themselves.Hoping that my review will help the team.BTC Address: bc1qmr06rgx5hackq8caxznes2fhgtgnya7ckmqf08",

      "body": "My Review/Betnomi.This Casino is to my liking to play only poker, so I don't want to make it my main focus in the review, hence, I will do a inspection for traditional games and sports betting quite curiously, but before I will mention basic things like ToC, the log-in‚Ä¶ among others. For specific matters, I will evaluate on mode traffic light : Green-Yellow-Red. And I must emphasize that no red came out.Roadmap of the review:TOC and/or PoliceLoginMain Page (Structure)Casino: Slots / Traditional Games.Sports-Live Sport-E-sportPoker:App- Browser-DesktopDeposits-Withdrawals.Customer service. (Support)BetnomiMy Recommendation:httpcs://betnomi.com/termsYou must read these T&Cs carefully in their entirety before clicking on the ‚ÄúSign Up‚Äù button. If You do not agree with any provision of these T&Cs, You must not use or continue to use the Website.Green! ¬†The ToC are easy to read, although the \"blah, Blah\" is the same in the objective, it seems to me that they leave a good summary in the General Information. That reading took me a minute, but obviously all the information would take 5 to 10 minutes.But things like \"update of Personal Information, Know Your Client (KYC), KYC Policies and Personal Data\" should always be read, in any casino, everything is very well explained.One thing I like about their terms is that they don't have the enumerated infinite clauses that try to go backwards, fordward etc. That is why I mention that it is a simple reading and that you will understand.Yellow! ¬†It makes it clear that you can request in the first instance:\"Full name, e-mail address, a chosen password, username, age, and valid mobile phone number.\"Green! ¬†So far in my case with several deposits in BTC, Doge and BNB over almost 3 years and several withdrawals with a maximum limit of less than $300 I have not had to provide, Full name, Age, and mobile phone number.But since the possibility exists, I think it's important to mention it. In fact, this initial request that seems complex is \"viable\" within the requests that some other casinos ask for in the first phase.But that other level does exist in Betnomi, but it is understood as a higher layer of investigation, which is protected by the \"Betnomi may, at its sole discretion... \" and there they do ask for documents, you can read details in KYC Policies and Personal Data.Ready! now, let's play/gamble.If you use VPN and the country is restricted you get this big notice:Green! ¬†I have not had any problems when that happens, I just log in again and I have been able to enter without problems, there are casinos that just that fact puts you on a checklist, so far it has not happened with me.According to support, you can use a VPN that does not violate country restrictions or try to bypass the geo-restriction of providers.Betnomi offers the possibility of log-in in the traditional way and includes Google-Telegram.Yellow! ¬†It's not that it's something that tortures your life, but sometimes, perhaps in this case due to the fact that I use Brave for this review, I get this pop-up window. I think there should be an option where I can enable/disable.Green! ¬†It's a matter of clicks and it takes a few seconds.*Home!Level 1: The classic Deposit, Coin and Profile button.Highlight the cogwheel that takes you to the General settings:https://betnomi.com/profile/settings/generalI like that panel to view Fiat/Crypto and select from there which coins are frequent or preferred, right there you can access the account panel change email, password, also a security panel for Login/Password change/Withdrawal/Rain&Tips.Level2: Active promotions, shows Welcome Bonus, Betnomi Vip and Wager Contest.Level3: Shows the Slots.Level4: Live Casino.Level5: Latest Bets.Level6: Game ProvidersLevel7: Coins (11).Level 8: In which we can include, Link of \"About, Help, Regulations. They add social networks and highlight that Betnomi is a licensed casino in Cura√ßao.Level 9: A fixed menu with Link to Sports-Casino-LiveCasino-Games-Chat and extends to an alternate window where E-sport, Poker, Blast, Mines complete.Green! ¬†I like the UI everything is there everything within reach even though there is redundancy in the menus it doesn't bother me and in general the UX is more than acceptable.Yellow! ¬† Perhaps as in my case, that I go to poker I would like to add that link to the fixed menu, not to be confused with the level 4 button where there is one but it is for games against the dealer.So to get to Poker I have to click on Menu and in the next window click on Poker, let's go! It's a nonsense of clicks, but some unsuspecting player could miss it, I don't know!Green! ¬†On the positive side, at least they have included that other path in these updates, because before you entered through level 8 where only the word Poker appeared that took you directly to https://betnomi.com/live-casino/28 now it takes you to a F&Q https://betnomi.com/poker and in it you can get Poker:Play now.Casino/Slots!*They have 5403 Slots, you can select by popular, BonusBuy and New, likewise the classic search engine and the added search by provider.I like the preview that shows the game just by typing part of the name, this helps when you don't remember the name of a slot, it's not something new, but there are casinos that still don't have it.You can see how retro I am with Slots, the first thing I remember is Book Of Dead!On the side of the information always necessary for the user, the RTP does not appear on the main page of the game, it does not say if it is a slot with high, low, medium volatility, Hit Radio. Usually they are read in the game, but you have to wait for the load... anyway, I would like it to be available before Play Now.Casino/Games!They have 12+1 Games.Blast-Dice-Striker-Farkle-Big Hi Lo-Plinko-Mines-Talisman-Crash-Zeppelin-X50 Wheel-Monti-Fishing.The only one that had played before was Blast... it's a crash. The funny thing is that it still has the Christmas theme. ¬†Yellow! ¬†There is no game history for slot or games, nor can any game be favorited.Sports-Live Sport-E-sport!It has the full range of sports betting i.e. scheduled betting, live betting and includes E-sports.I reviewed and supports bets of $0.1 which allows access to any type of bankroll, I made a live bet, this was the panel that was shown.It is quite intuitive and has everything within reach of a click. But even though the game had already finished, it took a while to load the information both about the new balance and to update the betslip 0.On the other hand, the betting history was not displayed in that window, you have to go to:https://betnomi.com/profile/sportbetsThey are available to period time to 72 hours. information by support.Poker!Available versions: Browser, obviously yes. Desktop: Yes. Web App: Yes. Mobile App: NoThe Browser version performs very well, nothing to add or remove for now.The Desktop version stands out for having some additional functions, we can mention the ease of Multitable.Sometimes it has disconnections, it is something that is not frequent, but it happens. In this sense, there is no reconnection time beyond the standard established seconds, so protection for disconnection of a few minutes does not exist.In any case, it is a software ¬†that they are always trying to improve.There is no mobile App, but the webmobile version performs very well, is not the best and if you have played with other providers, You will notice the difference, but it is not overwhelming.Important, the traditional games and/or slots great performance in the webmobile version, important to highlight and differentiate the comments in this regard.Deposits-Withdrawals.!As I mentioned at the beginning of my review without problems for me. The minimum deposits and withdrawals are well denoted for each coin, in the case of bitcoin there are no additional fees, only the corresponding Network fee.Customer service. (Support)!I asked three questions and they were all answered with the greatest assertiveness, response times varied but did not go beyond a few minutes.I liked is that the history is saved separately for each of your conversations.Thank you!Address:bc1qrt9u8ek2gf4500fnutf32sm48lmn6gnn9hrzrh",

      "body": "Hi all,This is my review about the Betnomi casino. I was a lot more active on them when they had the free predictor game (about 2 years ago). But because of the launch of this review campaign, I tried them out again and I quite like it.Positive points: -¬†¬†¬†Nice design and easy to navigate through it. I have the impression though that some things are missing on the dropdown menu in the up right corner. I could only find back information on the VIP level on the home page and not in the dropdown menu-¬†¬†¬†Game selection: almost all popular third party slot providers are available (Pragmatic, No limit City, Hacksaw, ‚Ä¶). I would love to see if they could also add Betsoft as they do have some really cool games. They also have a nice selection of in-house games and some really unique ones (like the Fishing game and Talisman)-¬†¬†¬†Good selection of coins to deposit (BTC, ETH, TRX, USDT, ‚Ä¶). Amount to withdraw is also quite low (around 18$ for BTC and 5$ for TRX)- ¬†¬†The sportsbook is nice, good selection of sports (soccer, tennis, snooker, MMA, ‚Ä¶) to bet on and a good amount of bets to play on but the odds are mediocre and could be betterThings to improve:-¬†¬†¬†Site is slow loading at my side. It can be just me, but it seems that the site is loading slower than other casinos-¬†¬†¬†Live support is pretty slow in responding: took sometimes over 1h to get a basic reply back, this is probably the biggest action point as costumer support is very importantBTC adress: 336zPPXqj4TZYCLweHE3seDpZo9uZ7SLye",

      "body": "I was not registered on betnomi so this was a good chance to join the site  RegistrationThey have a quick registration with an email address is required which is very useful in case you lose your password/username.BonusI have noticed their interesting structure for the deposit bonus but this is \"not for me\" ... since you cannot take advantage of this bonus for sports betting but only gambling on casino games  Deposit I made the deposit without taking advantage of their bonus‚Ä¶ It doesn't update right away (it could show that a transaction has been made‚Ä¶) Withdrawal objectively the limit is high and this is an obstacle. I think it could also be reduced because since it is crypto and it can be managed in a different way with a much lower limit. It is interesting to note that it was processed practically instantaneously with low fees respect other crypto gambling sites.Sport betting section \"sport betting and live sport betting\" could be updated in the same tab! Well I would say to update this section showing the live events firsts! Now that I've tried sport betting it shows \"who will win the 2026 world cup\". It's interesting, a good way to promote this initiative but I would use this home page to show \"current\" and \"non-current\" events that will take place in 3 years  It's interesting to see that there is still a wide choice of markets/tenders.Let's bet!I have selected an event to bet on, but notice that there is no player stats/info! Previous score, charts, and so on‚Ä¶ or just an external link with this information that can be provided.Some sites like Betfair provide \"historical\" odds as they have evolved during the game. This is also interesting information to provide.OddsThe odds seem standard to me for the market (it's not a big difference compared to similar sites always in crypto) but It is interesting to see how many betting opportunities are provided such as handicap bets and so on. and another positive aspect... there is no \"slowdown\" when the odds are played even if live!CashoutI have notice the cashout feature shouldn't make a lesser cashout than shown! Odds may vary and the player who decides to cashout chooses a specific odds! This should be corrected or at least explained.btc address: bc1qm9wnwsgy52jdefvm5g4w72lxqep5d9ks4gq62p",

      "body": "I'll go for the takedown for the different modules of the betnomi,First is the login page. It has a good feature included with the promotional banner, which encourages the users with a large percentage of bonuses. Additionally is ideal to use other logins like the metamask or wallets etc for the sooner feature of it, and its new to me theres a telegram feature with the login of a gambling casino most of them have a recommendation with the google, steam and metamask, also ideal if to be included with the number of characters for the password and recommended password like the uppercase, symbols and number. ¬†¬†In the chat community, it's a good feature that the people can reply with others using the right click like the telegram features or discord, but its good if you give a head start to the users that you have an existing feature like this, ¬†¬†In the profile panel, Sports bets are like the history of bets or current bets. I deal if I use the bets only for general because it seems to focus only on the sports bet.¬†¬†The side panel is redundant with the top navigation bar; I guess you can remove the blast and mine because the panel of games already exists inside once the user clicks it on; next is the sports. I can suggest that you can make a sub-branch of it like the e-sports so the users can easily find it or still as is with that because it is more convenient to find itI don't have a problem with the deposit and withdrawal; its smooth all in all, and I like the current match update; its so good that even though I'm just watching in the web app its more easier to know the current updates of the game, and the best thing is there's a community moderator in the chat community that helps the players concern.For future advertisements with your sports book good to add a boosting feature for the odds so the people would like to use it every day because they know they can possibly get a good profit.

      "body": "I've played some games on betnomi before, as I've had an account there since some time.TBH, there's not much to criticize as everything was good as we usually experience on almost all casinos. However, the platform worked just smooth on both desktop and mobile, giving me an all-round experience of both live casino and sports-betting.Lookwise, the site is really good with cool combination of easy-to-eyes colors that caught my attention at the very first glance when I visited them.However, there's something I didn't like much and would like to share and even suggest the team to look into, and try to change.Be it the desktop version or the mobile version, the sports or live sports area, I see it clubbed badly. I mean, I try to tap somewhere and something else gets selected (may sound stupid but true). Especially in the mobile version, it should adjust itself according to screen size, but it boasts itself outside and I need to scroll right to choose other options. I'm a fan of sportsbet.io in that genre, and would like to suggest you guys to add some spaces between different events' boxes upside down so that the overall site experience becomes catchy and keeps attracting users to visit your site and gamble there frequently.
