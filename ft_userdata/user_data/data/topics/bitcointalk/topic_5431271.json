  "content": "I am having so many problems simply trying to connect to a python script connect to a local bitcoin node running regtest. I posted another thread here using a different Python library https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5431250.0Im now trying the library python-bitcoinrpc. I run:    Code:pip3 install python-bitcoinrpcAnd the script is:Code:import bitcoinrpc.authfrom bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy# Connect to the local Bitcoin nodeconnection = AuthServiceProxy(    \"http://username:password@localhost:8332\",    network='regtest'  # specify the network parameters as 'regtest')# List the transactions in the walletprint(connection.listtransactions())I run it with Code:python3 scripts.py And I get the response:Code:    import bitcoinrpc.authModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bitcoinrpc.auth'When I do Code:which pythonI get: Code:/Users/me/opt/anaconda3/bin/pythonThe python version is  3.9.7I am truly reaching the end of my tether with this. If anyone has any ideas whats going on, or even has a suggestion of better libraries in different languages - I've spent 3 days on various Python libraries and cannot get any of them working, some I cant even seem to import. Im more experienced with Java and Javascript than Python.",
