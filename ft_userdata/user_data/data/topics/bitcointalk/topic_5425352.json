      "body": "These sites run on the referral spam that gets generated by users who promote their referral links through many PTC and GPTC sites. Most faucets have a hoard of banners promoting them too, such that we cannot differentiate if it is a faucet site or a noticeboard.Anyway I hope this saves some newbies from getting scammed on this site, the basis of how they run is that they take money from new investors to pay their old investors, while all of a sudden they will vanish and you will be left hanging with no trace of your money.Now there are people who make money with these sites, they are the affiliate marketers and the owners of the scam.",
