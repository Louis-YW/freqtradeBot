Let's dive into the details and learn from this incident to protect ourselves and our crypto assets!The hackers pulled off this daring heist by creating a fake address that resembled the intended receiver's wallet. They spoofed a transaction that looked like a legitimate transfer of USDT from the victim's wallet, but no funds were actually moved. In the confusion, the victim unwittingly sent $20 million to the scammer's address.An on-chain data report from Peckshield revealed the manipulation behind the attack. The intended receiver's address had previous transactions with the victim's wallet, making it easier for the scammers to exploit the similarity.Fortunately, Tether, the company behind USDT, swiftly took action upon discovering the unauthorized transactions.

Let's work together to maintain a safe and secure crypto community.It will not work for decentralized coin e.g. Bitcoin, as long as the coin isn't linked with the centralized site and you never submit any KYC, there's no chance they will know who you are and freeze your coins.The drawback with this centralization is the team or the site can randomly freeze someone coin and you would lose all of your coins, so it's not secure due to this centralization.",

      "body": "This is not an old news anymore that Tether can freeze funds. That's the power of centralized systems and those scammers will try to avoid usage of USDT because they know that if they'll get caught, the funds will be frozen and they'll have no control on it anymore.On these matters, this is good but for decentralization then it's a different matter. I guess that's the consolation that one can get with that when he's phished and scammed.",
