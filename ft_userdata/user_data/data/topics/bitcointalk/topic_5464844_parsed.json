  "content": "Good news for bitcoin enthusiasts and crypto investors in Hong Kong after the government launches its first bitcoin and crypto trading platform.QuoteHashKey Exchange and OSL Digital Securities Ltd. have won Hong Kong's first crypto exchange licenses under a new regime that allows exchanges to serve retail customers.The two entities already had licenses from Hong Kong's previous opt-in licensing regime for crypto asset service providers, which may have helped expedite the new approvals.Earlier, the HashKey Group announced plans to introduce a regulated exchange in the second quarter to serve retail customers and said it planned to raise funds at a $1 billion valuation to capitalize on Hong Kong's re-emergence as a potential crypto hub.\"Effective immediately, OSL Digital Securities offers retail investors the ability to register on its platform and access digital asset products, starting with the popular cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH),\" a press statement from the exchange said.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/03/hashkey-wins-hong-kongs-first-crypto-exchange-license-to-serve-retail-customers/?outputType=ampIn light of this, what potential value will this add to the people of Hong Kong. This platform is a centralized exchange and will be regulated by the government in the country. Do you think this move is a good one for the crypto adoption there and won’t the government be so strict with the use owing that it will be regulated by them fully? This is a good move to crypto adoption in that region since it’ll gain more use and popularity there. Privacy of ownership while trading with those platforms will be very limited. Overall, I think it is still a good development looking to the mass adoption of bitcoin we are anticipating for.",

If the government finds that individuals are ready to deal with cryptocurrencies and that the ban will not produce a positive result, then they will consider dealing with these currencies as a matter of fact, imposing taxes on them, and establishing central platforms to ensure monitoring of depositors’ money and easy tracking of currencies, thus maintaining financial stability and expansion. in taxes.Hong Kong will not be the last if this experiment succeeds. The rest of the countries will find an opportunity for more tax money and will follow the example of Hong Kong if the idea finds a successful application.",

      "body": "The official launch of bitcoin and crypto trading platform in Hong Kong will have both positive and negative aspects for bitcoin adoption.Regulation will attract more new users, and regulation by the government inspires confidence for the majority of the country's citizens. People unfamiliar with the ideas of financial freedom afforded by bitcoin will see this as a good indicator, and therefore I assume that this event should act as a good catalyst. But on the other hand, this platform will be tightly controlled and there can be no talk of confidentiality and privacy. Government authorities will know absolutely everything about the users of this platform and will be able to collect any taxes, and possibly, if necessary, block users' accounts on this platform.In the short term, this news will have a positive effect, but in the long term - negative for digital freedom. No matter how we react to this event, we can no longer change the consequences.",

Do you think this move is a good one for the crypto adoption there and won’t the government be so strict with the use owing that it will be regulated by them fully? Most of these centralized platforms put in much money into advertisement which means more people will know more about Bitcoin. But the problem is that many shitcoin will also be promoted. Regulation leads to centralization and the latter defeats the main purpose of bitcoin. This move by HashKey Exchange and OSL Digital Securities Ltd is not to promote bitcoin but to make profit. These firms can do anything possible to make profit, they don't care about the success of bitcoin.

There will also be high liquidity in the market and traders will have more options. It will also be great if the exchange or customer deposit is insured by the national deposit insurance (Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board).",

However, Hong Kong follows different customs and their governance system is also different from China. But even though the Chinese government speaks against it, Hong Kong will be able to implement it, but they may have to go through some trouble. But it's admirable that Hong Kong is legalizing crypto despite China banning it.",

Do you think this move is a good one for the crypto adoption there and won’t the government be so strict with the use owing that it will be regulated by them fully?If you look at it broadly, the existence of a crypto exchange platform will actually have a good impact. Because then, the development of crypto and bitcoin in Hong Kong will further develop. But with the regulation of the exchange platform by the government as a whole, in my opinion, this is what will become uncomfortable for crypto investors in Hong Kong. Because then, like the opinion that OP wrote, there will definitely be rules and conditions imposed by the Hong Kong government, which might be very strict or could be like implementing a fairly large tax system. Whereas investors in crypto, as I know, really don't like things that smell centralized, and are regulated by the government.But even so, with the creation of a new crypto exchange platform in Hong Kong, I think it will definitely have a pretty good impact on the progress of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Quote from: Jegileman on August 28, 2023, 02:09:59 PMThis is a good move to crypto adoption in that region since it’ll gain more use and popularity there.It is true, with the creation of a crypto exchange platform, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are likely to become more popular in Hong Kong society. But can crypto currency become popular quickly?, I also can't predict it for now. Because the exchange platform is also very newly created. So I personally also don't get a picture of how crypto investors in Hong Kong and other Hong Kong people (not crypto investors) will react.",
