Out of curiosity are you trying to ride the wave based on a red or green market of these coins??",

That's how we should approach it at all times. CEX is not terrible, just the idea that they are getting a share of everyone's trades makes it so that they are the sole entity that will own all of bitcoin one day if we keep going this route forever.",

Greed and panic will be very difficult to control with top gainers and top losers.I understand that, but a 24-hour time frame is considered too long for anyone who wants such trading. For example, I do it from time to time, with an investment that does not exceed $50, and sell within an hour or two and earn 10% to 20% at best. If I continue to hold these currencies for a time frame longer than 24 hours, I will most likely lose my money.I do not recommend anyone to do such trading because sometimes things do not go in the right direction, so this is a high-risk investment and it is not supposed to exceed $100.Quote from: justdimin on July 20, 2023, 09:38:23 AMThis is why I think DEX should be considered a lot more, that allows people to trade with each other while other people make money from it, we all make money and we all trade it and that's why no single person will have all of it.

In general, daily trading is more profitable in CEXs.",

I don't remember the name.Go for tradingview for monitoring only, its very reliable or you can just choose the best exchanges since its also available when you do trading. In fact, you can just have one app to monitor everything, if you’re a day trade since you are looking for a shorter time frame better to do this directly with the exchanges where you will execute your position, Binance is a good example here.",

I'm also looking at Coinmarketcap because it has a lot of useful information. However, in terms of trading, using a tradingview is the best option because it allows you to examine the market much more thoroughly than doing so on the exchange. You won't have to worry about having the same price action as the exchange because the search bar will represent the exchange you're using. You must also ensure that if you trade futures, you include \"perp\" at the end of the trading pair because it's slightly different from the one without.",

I don't remember the name.As far as I know I have not heard of such a website, but many exchanges give you a time option where you can check a chart from the last minute to a week to see how much a coin has gone up and down. For daily trading people use time frame of 5 minutes and 15 minutes. In which one candle is considered to be 5 minutes or if the time frame is 15 minutes, then one candle is considered 15 minutes. I often use Trading View to trade where I can easily check for entries in any coin across all timeframes. .if you trade on Trading View, you can easily get this option there as well. Where you can check the previous record of any coin in different time frame. After that you can plan ahead where entry in this coin would be appropriate.",

There are other similar sites that are on top of the results page but they are not free and require a registration first before you can be able to see the statistics, so I just choose this one.You can't make a technical analysis without these tools so yeah they are very important for the traders. Other sites aren't limited on providing historical and current prices but they also have other features which are also helpful for the experience and newbie traders.",
