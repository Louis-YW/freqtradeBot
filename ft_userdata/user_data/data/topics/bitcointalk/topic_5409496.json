Are you going to trust someone the way you're going to give them 1.4 BTC to sell for you and then expect them to somehow send almost $35 000 to your bank account in China? You have BTC, find some local way to sell it, because even though it is officially banned, people still trade with Bitcoin in China.For example -> https://localbitcoins.com/country/CNOf course, all trading is subject to risk, so everything should be approached with caution.",

I mean, as you said, who in their right mind would give someone 1.4 BTC and expect them to give fiat in exchange?OP. If you're serious about this, you should try your luck in the black market. You will find people who are willing to work with bitcoins.EDITsike  (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409484.msg60733031#msg60733031)",

In your other thread that you created.Base on the picture, you want the other person to register in a shady exchange.Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on August 11, 2022, 01:47:24 PMQuote from: bitmover on August 11, 2022, 01:11:35 PMQuote from: GOMER MACFURI on August 11, 2022, 11:16:14 AMI moved to China from Ukraine, no local card, all before leaving I transferred to bitcoin. Now I am sitting without money. I will pay someone who will help me. There 1.4 BTC I can give you a commission of +-5%.  https://t.me/lil_netysilFor your security and to other people involved, I suggest that you have open and public discussions here instead of chatting with strangers in your private telegram.There are a lot of scammers in this forum and bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Ok after some minutes of conversation on Telegram with OP, i confirm that OP is a scammer trying to motivate you to create an account of a shady fake exchange. He doesn't use BTC official network ''for security reason'' and wants only to do a internal transfer on his fake exchange.I cannot say that I am surprised...https://imgur.com/a/fNSi5Q0",

How it works ?It's like OP will say I send you the money just send me 90%So to send you the money he will ask you to join some fake exchange and for real he send it there to your username in that exchange . When you try to withdraw the money from the fake exchange they will ask you to pay some tax or fee.  Like a message looks like this You trying to withdraw 1BTC you need to pay tax of 0.05BTC please send it to this address.. that's the kind of scam it's so stupid yes not sure if ever someone fail for it. But always there stupid people .",
