Use at your own risk.Dubious and abandoned defeats the purpose of using an escrow, no? what's the use of a \"middle man\" if they're just more or less as unknown as the person you're transacting with. Reputation of solely from long time ago would send me doubts as well specially since I encountered a case where a scammer took over a closed escrow service's expired domain.That being said, you could look into our forum escrow's as wellList of Services by Escrow Providers Few Trusted Escrow Providers",

I used them in the testing phase, then they looked ok with a fairly friendly and understandable interface.
