A person uses 2 accounts and seems to have mistakenly posted a POA with the wrong account while quickly applying for Signature Campaign , and upon realizing he immediately edited and deleted the previous post.

Need to do it again, create another user and so on.It can be unfortunate when the \"truth bomb\" is actually full of hyperbole and little truth.  Look at the two red-tags on topman21's trust wall; both accusing the account of being \"hacked\" or sold.  True, there seems to be significant circumstantial evidence suggesting the account changed hands, and certainly there's evidence of operating multiple accounts, but neither of those things are banned activities by the forum rules.  If there was legitimate evidence the accounts were \"hacked\" the mods would lock the accounts, and the other \"offenses\" may warrant neutral tag at the most.  The referenced post for those red tags even suggests the account may have had three different owners.  Was it \"hacked\" twice?  Lol, come on man.  Unless the accounts have been used to cheat or scam, I don't see what the big fuss is about.So actually, this sock puppet isn't meant to avoid drama, but rather it seems he's attempting stir it up.  Merry Christmas all, carry on.",

Some of the merits that went around were on posts that seem to be in the OPs opinion not merit worthy [I don't think they are either]You then get back to the issue of is someone sending merit back to someone else since they got merit from them and felt obligated.In theory it should not matter but in reality humans are kind of hard wired to do this.BUT, when 1 or 2 of the accounts seem to not be legit it taints the view of people looking at them and what they did and they only at that point see the worst view of their actions. So, it's not just the merit it's the entire way everything looks for these accounts.-Dave",

There is absolutely nothing wrong with someone creating a new account to expose something like this. Hell, not even theymos has anything against itQuote from: theymos on August 28, 2012, 09:17:31 PMI don't have a problem with alt accounts as long as they're not used for evading bans. If you're hesitant to say something controversial because you don't want it to be associated with your name, please create an alt account and say it.Quote from: Popkon6 on December 26, 2022, 12:44:49 AMYou should be judged first then anything else.Judged based on what? Exactly what rule he broke? All that it matters here is whether OP provided evidence strong enough for his claims, and not who is behind this alt account.",

But after @Popkon6 making some noise, the @OP trying to link his account with @topman21 and @Rigon, he also link with @Shaha98, @Holiday5 and @tomos81 because they have a connection of getting a lot merit of this circle.However @theymos already state this.Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIf a DT member tags you for something stupid involving merit (ie. probably anything less than selling merit), then they're not going to be a DT member for much longer....BUT, when 1 or 2 of the accounts seem to not be legit it taints the view of people looking at them and what they did and they only at that point see the worst view of their actions. So, it's not just the merit it's the entire way everything looks for these accounts.-DaveCorrect.Besides, we have already have some past cases about merit abuse, the one which comes to mind was the case of naim027; who was caught giving merit to his alt account. He did not know that was frown upon, regardless, he got red trust (it was later removed / changed to neutral).In my personal opinion if someone is proven to be farming 2 accounts or abusing alt-accounts then they are likely to have more than two, still It should be ideal to have further evidence just to be sure.",
