The bitcoin market is fundamentally driven and any good or bad news has a serious impact on the market. With this news, i think we are back on track to a full-fledged bull season    You're right, the market is responding very well to the outcome of Trump's bogus witch hunt case. Trump is a victim here of political persecution and shouldn't be labeled a felon. The judge even wished him luck in his second term. Great way to start his term with another W. I think its pretty wild that while all this stuff is happening the Democratic state of California is literally on fire & dems are selling all the silk road bitcoin & sending unfathomable amounts of cash to Ukraine before the well runs dry. Crazy stuff happening in the world rn, man.",

We are not just talking about any top politician from any small country; we are talking about the president-elect of a country with the largest economy and so much power. We are talking about someone who has promised the Bitcoin community a crypto-friendly governance. I'm not fully in support of Trump, but in times like this I don't expect less. Take it or leave it; any news in respect of crypto that comes from the USA has more effect on the price of Bitcoin, both negatively and positively, more than any other factor you might think of.",
