Since the account is not active for a long time I don't think if it is safe to use they already have negative feedback from DT here on the forum and I heard some posts here on the forum that they are scammer.  So I suggest better use other exchanges than risking your investment.",

      "body": "Have you used this platform before? Or have you used it for a long time? The platform in itself does not have a solid reputation so it is best to look for alternative options if possible.BTCC claims to be organized in both Hong Kong/China and the United Kingdom but BTCC isn’t regulated on the UK side.I do not think that the restrictions in China allow the work of such contract platforms so, in short, the platform will ask you to verify identity even though they are not known.",
