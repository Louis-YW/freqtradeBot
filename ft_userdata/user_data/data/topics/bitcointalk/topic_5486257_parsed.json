  "content": "One of my personal assumptions is that Satoshi was orientating himself on gold. If you calculate how many standard bars could be forged from the total amount of gold on earth, you come up with around 20 - 23 million standard bars, depending on the source of information.Of course, this is only if you add in the estimated unmined gold reserves.To think further, if you own one Bitcoin and it exceeds the market capitalization of gold, just to give you an idea, it's like owning a 12.4 kg gold bar.EDIT:(after numerous feedback)Thanks for your inputs! I missed the fact that my theory only works with todays data. https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/how-much-goldIt was difficult for me to find a specific source for the estimated unmined gold reserves back in 2000-2008 but it will be less than today. Minus about 50,000 tons which were mined since 2005. So when we redo the calculation with my guessed data from back then, we get way less than 21 million standard bars.I apologize for the \"primitive\" expression of my thoughts and also for my incorrect wording. Of course i did not meant, that Satoshi included this as a main reason, why there are 21 million.I did not give a direct source because, as has already been noted, there are various estimates and I therefore did not consider it necessary. Very unprofessional of me!It's an idea I've been pursuing for a while, as I see it as an interesting way of relating the amount of Bitcoin to an already proven natural resource. This could illustrate to critics (who claim Bitcoin is far too expensive and too less in circulation) that the 21 million Bitcoin could be the 21 million \"standard bars\", and for trading in the smaller market, the smaller units.Just for illustration:1 BTC as 1 standard bar of gold (12.4 kg as held by banks today)1000 sats could then correspond to 0.124 g of gold.This in turn shows how nicely Bitcoin can be divided up in contrast to gold. It was important for me to share this thought as it allows Bitcoin to be visualized in a natural way if someone cannot yet grasp whether it is made for this world.",

I am also confused about how he was able to know how many bars of gold would be gotten from the total amount of gold the earth has. Gold is a natural resource that cannot easily be quantified because there are always discoveries.  I read a report where 31 million tons of gold ore, from which an estimated 320,158 tons was discovered in Uganda in 2022. However, an estimate by the World Gold Council puts the figure at nearly 244,000 tonnes. 197,000 tonnes have currently been mined, while 57,000 tonnes are still unmined.https://www.bullionbypost.co.uk/index/gold/how-much-gold-is-there-in-the-world/https://energycapitalpower.com/5-biggest-gold-discoveries-africa-2022/",

I suggest you to do deeper research before making such assumptions. Bitcoin supply is always limited to 21 Million and Gold bars will increase overtime when miner continue to mine more gold. We still aren't aware about many Gold mines which exist on this Earth so it would be foolish to assume that there will always be such amount even in future.",

This is because gold is a natural resources endowed by nature, and as time passes by, there will be more gold to discover in various places. It is until the world has come to an end, that human do not exist anymore, that no one will be able to discover the rest gold, because there are a lot of gold that has not been discovered. Bitcoin was created by a man, and it is limited to only 21 million, which means that by 2140, when that last bitcoin will be mined, mining of bitcoin will no longer be possible. So why are you comparing these two as the same when we know that it is not true, and can never be possible. Are you saying that Satoshi is one Demigod that knows even the the things beneath the earth surface?",

His main focus was on a decentralised currency that could be transferred worldwide without any third-party involvement. I often see many people compare Bitcoin with gold, which is unrealistic. You can't compare a virtual currency with a physical element. We don't know why Satoshi limits Bitcoin mining to 21 million, but it has to be limited somewhere. So what's the reason behind 21M? Only he knows very well. It's not necessary to get an idea from Gold.",

You're saying about the standard bars and these are all melted and converted into bars, how can you know that? You can't prove that matter but I understand that this theory of yours is going to make sense only if you've got some proof of it. But it will be a good idea to give us some idea first on how you've ended up with this theory. Just for the sake of the argument and something to talk about since Bitcoin has always been considered the new and modern digital gold, it's always part of the discussion to compare bitcoin and gold but not to this point about the supply because both of them are scarce and hard to mine.Quote from: elkeppy on February 23, 2024, 04:44:34 PMTo think further, if you own one Bitcoin and it exceeds the market capitalization of gold, just to give you an idea, it's like owning a 12.4 kg gold bar.And the advantage with that, you don't need a huge storage and don't need to carry its weight because of how heavy it is.",

It would make sense if satoshi was inspired by the number of gold in earth but you must be forgetting that bitcoin was launched in 2009 and was probably planned way before. The number of gold mined and number of gold produced back in 2009 is not the same amount of gold mined and produced today. Every day, scientists and geologists discover something new. They might have not known the amount of gold left back in 2009 on earth but today they might have some kind of estimation. Time constantly changes a lot.
