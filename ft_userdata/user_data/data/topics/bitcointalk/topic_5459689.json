You may not be an \"expert\" in soma field of study but you have google or all those new AI.Check this questions on ChatGPT:Code:Q: Is there something oddly in the Text of the clues ?A: Yes, there is something odd in the text of the clues. The oddity lies in the usage of the letter \"B\" (capital beta) instead of the letter \"B\" (capital bee) in several instances. It appears that the letter \"B\" has been mistakenly used instead of \"B\" throughout the text.For example, the clues should read:\"Behind the result of the equations there are some variables that should be also a secret.\"\"Beyond all the discussions, it is worth mentioning that all the possible legacy addresses amount is 2^160.\"\"Every single Byte counts, how many Bytes have this message?\"The presence of the letter \"B\" instead of \"B\" seems to be a typographical error or an unintended character substitution. It is important to note this discrepancy and ensure that the correct letter \"B\" is used when interpreting the text and attempting to solve the puzzle.Q: what is B and Î› and how they are related to eliptic curvesA: In the context of elliptic curves, B (Beta) and Î› (Lambda) are parameters that are often used to describe the equations of elliptic curves in a specific form known as Weierstrass form.The Weierstrass form of an elliptic curve is given by the equation:y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B,where A and B are constants that depend on the specific curve. The values of A and B determine the shape and properties of the curve.In this equation, B represents the constant term, which affects the vertical shift of the curve. It determines the y-coordinate of the point at infinity (the point that serves as the identity element in elliptic curve group operations).Î›, on the other hand, is a parameter used in the definition of the group law on an elliptic curve. The group law specifies how to add two points on the curve to obtain a third point. Î› is related to the slope of the tangent line to the curve at a specific point. It is used to compute the x-coordinate of the sum of two points.To summarize, B determines the vertical shift of the curve, while Î› is involved in the group law calculations on the curve. These parameters are important in describing and working with elliptic curves in the Weierstrass form.As you see you can use the AI as entry point of informationWhat about the other clues?Code:- How do we know the math used in ECDSA is right?- Can someone cheat or change a signed message made with ECDSA?- Is it possible for two different messages to have the same signature?- How can we be sure that the person who signs a message is the real owner of the secret key and not pretending?Those are just valid question that you may ask to your self and search or think in what are some conditions mathematically needed to do something or prevent something.That is all...Regards",
