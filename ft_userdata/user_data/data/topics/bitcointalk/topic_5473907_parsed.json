  "content": "Does anyone know if it is possible to overclock a whatsminer ms30 with an avalon PSU? I've seen people do it with stock PSUs but I haven't gotten mine to work with an old Avalon PSU. I'm not sure if this is due to the fact that the Avalon PSU might be programmable - not sure if that PSU is or isn't. Anyone here have any experience with this? I was curious if it would even be possible with the s19 power supplies, or if those need to be reprogrammed in some way to function as a normal power supply. I'm lacking the proper documentation to know - if anyone has any experience with the topic or could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.",

      "body": "Starting with the A1041 Avalons have used variable output PSU's that is controlled by the miner software. Bitmain and Whatsminer's do the same. The reason is efficiency as losing the final Vcore regulators that used to be part of the hash boards and directly controlling the PSU to set the voltage fed to chips gives about a 10% increase in power efficiency.That of course means that your miner control board must be able to talk to the PSU to set whatever voltage the miner needs.You need to find what kind of communication is used, (simple voltage sensing or digital coms) and then provide the correct signals to the PSU.",

Any guide or resource that exists online?I think the PSU from Canaan is programmable because Canaan have some PSU firmware under their download page so I think you can't just make the Avalon PSU work on the Whatsminer unit due to incompatibility issue.I tried to search and it seems there's no guide on how to make Avalon PSU work in Whatsminer units. Why not, do the same as other people do using the stock PSU?",

Some of the sites mentioned in the guide that I found on Google is not a well-known company I can't just recommend them but I found one site that sells this overclocked firmware for m30 and I think you can ask them if how does this firmware work or ask them what PSU are compatible to your unit once you flash the unit with their overclocked firmware.Here's the link https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=2483",
