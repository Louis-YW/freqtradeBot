  "content": "For those of us who trade the trend of the market, Bitcoin has been so frustrating since the 23rd of June when it hit another year's ATH before the subsequent ones. That was the last time a viable bullish movement occurred, and it's almost a month now, but it continues to channel with no clear direction as many economic data, news and event updates affect it differently. On a closer look at the market today, this might continue, but two important levels could change the narrative in support of either the buyers or the sellers. These two lines are the $31450 (the year's ATH established in June) and the $29400 (where the correction of June's bullish run ended). By principle, both levels have constituted strong barriers that need to be broken before a trend could be established.However, more attention is on the $31450 as buyers seem to be gaining more traction compared to the lower level of $29400 which has not been threatened since the last day in June. Regardless, more sellers seem to be piling up around $31450, which could only explain why the market has not had a single close above the level in the last 24 days despite all the attempts of the buyers and some positive news.For this, I believe a daily close above the level ($31450) will activate a strong bullish trend, while a break and daily close below $29400 might pressure the market.",

This somewhat long term resistance point is being eaten away though and once it does, very similarly to how 14 months ago it plummeted from $40K to $30K, we will see the opposite.

And so not to complicated things, we can't do anything about it. Perhaps the selling point is really $31k for speculators and that's why it's obvious by now that it is the biggest barrier that we need to break for this year before we talk about how the price will be at the end of 2023.",

      "body": "But the Bitcoin price is down from $31,450 today and has reached $30k level, even though it is starting to look like there is a bit of strength in the Bitcoin price to rise. Hopefully, the price of Bitcoin can increase again tomorrow or maybe the price will start moving a few hours later. This situation is confusing, but I'm still fine since I don't day trade.If you pay attention to the market situation, it seems that the increase and decrease in Bitcoin today has strongly influenced several altcoins. Some altcoins are trying to increase again after yesterday's correction. So we will have to wait to see if there will soon be a price spike for Bitcoin or if the price will remain around the current price.So be careful if you want to trade Bitcoin because this unpredictable situation can confuse you about when to enter the market. Maybe it would be better for you to wait until you see signs of an increase before you can enter the market.",

Bitcoin has crossed $30k after months of waiting, but it has yet to go further. It could also drop below $30k anytime, so saying this is a sign that bitcoin could hit $37k this year is incorrect. Moreover, the bull season usually comes 1 year after the halving occurs, so it cannot be said that the halving will have a positive impact on bitcoin at this point. Bitcoin price is unpredictable, and all we can do is hope and pray that it turns out as we expect.",

Like when we reached 20k in 2017, that was the highest we can reach at that point, not reached, we could reach, there is a difference, we can reach higher normally, which we have seen with 68k recently, it's that we could not do that at that time because we didn't had more money in the market, after that we had more and went more.Same with crashes, it can go down a lot but then it will go up a lot after it fails to go down even more. So we need to be careful about checking where is the biggest and where is the highest levels that we can reach.",

For details' sake, \"as buyers seem to be gaining more traction\" and \"more sellers seem to be piling up\" denote the general psychology of the market even though the price is hooked at some place as captured in the picture attached. Even at that, nothing is contradictory here because the market has the right to sell on reaching $31450 when it encounters more sellers there even if it was bullish. And again, the sellers might regroup at the level for subsequent selling if the market recovers back to that level upon the initial selloff caused by their (sellers) activity. This could continue unless higher buying interest is indicated at the level, and this is just a normal thing happening in all markets.Quote from: NotATether on July 18, 2023, 11:31:48 AMYou know, Reddit is very funny.r/cryptocurrency was proclaiming a bullrun that turned out to last for all of two hours.

If you are really making up some short trades then you would really be finding this to be that mind boggling or would really be giving impression that it is really that truly random and non predictable on which it is always should be since from the start. This is why decisions and positioning would really be entirely depending on a certain trader or investorwhether they would really be waiting up for entries or would be selling out.The price gaps arent really that huge i should say but if you are really that capable or having the confidence for you to play up with this minimal price movements then you coudlactually be able to make or snip up some profits if you could take up the risks on playing with it.",
