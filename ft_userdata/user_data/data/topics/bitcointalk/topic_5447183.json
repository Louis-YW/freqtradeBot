      "body": "With the next halving coming next year then the urge to accumulate more before the halving is high because every halving comes with a bull run. This year we have seen bitcoin rising mostly because of the recent crises faced by banks which has prompted many into bitcoin. But would this bull continue after halving like you asked? I would say no, because in the past after every bull run there’s a bearish period and I think this will continue because many investors have the intention of selling off some of there holdings after this bull run and as such it could affect bitcoin. Also we can also be certain what kind of government policies or crises we will face in the future, should the government begin to hit strict bans on it again then it might affect bitcoin as many people will be forced to withdraw there holdings",

Leaving that to one side, my personal prediction is that we will have a nice bull run after the expected decrease of supply due to the halving.I would not necessarily happen immediately after it takes place, but once the market reacts to it I would not be surprised in the case we see a new ATH. Not financial advice, btw. Just my thoughts, always DYOR.",

There were discussions about supercycle last 2021 also which I was also expecting to happen because of the covid effect.  It could happen this time because of the macro investors joining to accumulate BTC while the hedge against inflation and the adoption continues on top of halving this 2024.",

I have realised one thing in crypto market nothing is impossible bitcoin going to below 10k is also possible in this scenario and bitcoin touching another ATH is also possible in this scenario. I say this because bitcoin has it's halving due next year and it has a history of reaching a new ATH in the year next to it's halving year, so who know bitcoin might be on another supercycle in just another 2 years.",

Prior to 2021, Bitcoin's bull-run cycles run out within a few months from the beginning of the climb to when the gradual descent begins, prompting many to call it a pump and dump. The recent bull-run was anything but. The price peaked at different times with a minimal drawback between and the overall cycle lasted almost a year.The next halving could bring the next bull-run in its wake. I would expect a similar or better version of that of 2021. maybe a super cycle as it is dubbed. - Jay -",

More or less market may transition to a bull run even before the scheduled Bitcoin halving on 2024 due to the news and hype this Bitcoin halving brings.  This kind of market activity had been observed in the past and may have a big chance of repeating itself since the Bitcoin market is cyclical and the halving event is the focal point.",

No brainer, yes.Quote from: Comingdown on April 01, 2023, 06:11:44 PM Do you think it's possible considering inflation and our global economy today? I know its a very volatile asset but what do you think?Definitely. Financial institutions, companies, and anything related to finance will find a way to hedge against inflation. And with bad stuff and news happening in the banking scene, that's gonna make them find another way to fight the inflation and potential collapse of these institutions. I think that these companies are done studying bitcoin and they do know the cycles are happening and with halvings, they do get what's in it for bitcoin and if they do understand it correctly. That means that they don't want to be left behind by potential profits that might get in their way. Yes, it's volatile but nothing is volatile that shall give them sweet profits even gold and stocks are also volatile.",

As you know we are going through a time of high inflation and some banks are among the companies that were \"swimming naked\". The governments and famous economists are trying to make us think high inflation is going away, but it's possible they broke the system by printing too much in 2020 and 21 and cutting rates won't save them this time.In a scenario where biggest currencies like USD and EUR go into 20% inflation and big banks in regions that were seen as safe like Switzerland go bankrupt we could see bitcoin explode and keep going for years without a bear market. I don't see it happening soon because the governments will try to slow it down as much as they can by dumping whatever digital assets they have on these low liquidity markets and trying to pass laws that prohibit mining.",

Do you think it's possible considering inflation and our global economy today? I know its a very volatile asset but what do you think?If I'm not mistaken, there are new school of thoughts about bitcoin cycle, which what they call now super cycle. The reason behind this is that since bitcoin narrative have chance, we might see super cycle before the bull run, or at least the catalyst of it all, the block halving. Initially I just dismissed this theory, but it seems that this year, before the halving, we are somewhat in the bull run. But for me, super cycles can only be achieved if we are going to reach a new all time high this year, so maybe $70k or higher. So that will be the first cycle, and then it will be culminated when we have our scheduled block halving pushing the price even higher and more than double the first cycle of $70k or up. So we shall see what scenario will work for this year as you have said there are a lot of factors, like the banking crisis or the inflation in our global economy. And if there is the right time to test this theory it will be this year and 2024-2025.",

That was the narrative behind the 2021 bull run. Big companies like Tesla and Microstrategy announced that they are adopting Bitcoin, post-covid inflation was kicking in and Bitcoin was theorized to be a hedge against it. If any of that was true and Bitcoin was indeed getting adopted, it wouldn't have crashed so hard.So, theoretically supercycle is possible, but on practice it's just public statements from companies that they will use Bitcoin, followed by no actual adoption. And Bitcoin owners aren't rushing to spend their coins when such option emerges either - they would rarther hodl Bitcoin and spend fiat instead.",

It's just the way btc works today. Volatility only plays into the hands of traders and allows them to earn. Volatility doesn't scare long-term investors, because one way or another in years they will receive their profit. So it turns out that volatility only scares those who are not in contact with bitcoin. That is, those who still have not bought this.",

Therefore, all moods suggest that bitcoin investments should be successful, and literate people, when making their calculations, prefer bitcoin.
