My question is any other altcoins that I have missed or should check out?Before proceeding in asking what altcoins you must hold, haven't you taken bitcoin yet? I have AXS and it seems that it's very passive for the past two years. I haven't had my ROI yet with it. And that's why if you're into altcoins, you have diversified a lot and I guess it is time for you to start reconsidering of owning bitcoin if ever you still haven't got it.",

My question is any other altcoins that I have missed or should check out?How about the \"AI & Big Data\" tokens? Now AI has full hype in the market, we can see it from the significant price increase of those type of tokens, specifically The Graph (GRT) and SingularityNET (AGIX) token. To see a complete list of \"AI & Big Data\" type tokens, you can visit the following CMC page: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/ai-big-dataThe rest you have to do your own research .",

For me it's a total gamble, the risk is big having to look for those kind of projects, but who knows?The current trend is AI, so definitely you will have to look at it.",

My question is any other altcoins that I have missed or should check out?Holding a lot of USDT is not considered as investment, I presume you will use your USDT to accumulate altcoins, right?Well, all I can suggest is just focus on the major altcoins, they are down now due to the bearish market in overall, but eventually once the bull market starts and bitcoin breaks its ATH, eventually the altcoins will follow and will also have their own run, and when that happens, the major altcoins will always lead the way. just check here - https://coinmarketcap.com/",

Rose is down from long time and have not shown any potential movement yet. Axie trend is over. Trx cannot give you big profit.we should choose those Altcoins which has potential to give us big profit in short time. if we look for just 50% or 2x then why not we hold BTC. now for big profit we should choose Altcoin according to trend. Now AI and staking coins are making hype so we should take advantage from this trend and enter in good potential coin .",

It's clear you didn't miss anything. Still, if I were you, I might consider buying some Ethereum. I think this dinosaur cryptocurrency should have some in every wallet. It is not easy to know what time will bring us, but it is impossible to trust any altcoin other than Ethereum. If you have enough Bitcoin, you might consider buying some Ethereum.

I'm sure some of them will perform very well in the next bull market. But I don't recommend you to consider altcoins as a long-term investment. Bitcoin is very good for that.",

It seems like gambling to me, you gamble that opportunity by investing high volatility coins. Give a big allocation on BTC and it will surely have no regrets.",
