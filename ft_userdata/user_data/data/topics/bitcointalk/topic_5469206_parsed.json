Because remember one man can not change the world, and regardless of how wealthy people choose to distribute their wealth, we will still have those who belong to the poor class and underdeveloped.",

I just wish you had such money so that you can contribute to society positively.  It is good to see people like you who have compassion for the poor and have the intention to help them. But instead of giving them money or accommodation, you can identify businesses or investments that can make them self-sufficient. You can start up a program to teach them some skills that will make them get a job and become self-sufficient. When you give them just money, they might end up mismanaging it but a skills or business setup will assist them in gaining lifelong skills. Your suggestions are positive but everyone has the right to use his money the way he wants. And most people prefer to make more money than to be a socialist. It is also encouraging to see philanthropists like Bill Gates committing Millions of dollars to help the poor, so you are not alone.",

They live in a different reality to everyone else, where they can be chaffeur driven and brought breakfast in bed by a butler, from their private chef. The one main reason that billionaires *might* not choose to buy a boat, is primarily because they cost a ridiculous amount and the upkeep costs are huge. You should be complaining to governments around the world for not properly taxing or encouraging them to spend their vast wealth, not the individuals themselves who are bound by capitalism rules. You'll also find that plenty of billionaires are very philanthropic and give vast amounts of money to charity compared to the average person.",

God has mapped everything out so that we as humans can be more grateful and can share love with one another. If you were born from a poor family, then God just wants to see you be more patient and fight extra hard to be able to achieve success and achieve divine blessing. And if you were born in perfect condition without any shortcomings and were born to people who were quite capable, then God just wants to see you be more grateful and share your blessings with one another.",

There are community services you can do without spending a penny. But we don't do it. Simply tell a person how good their work is and how they should keep it up might make their day. A simple kindness to a stranger might go a long way to that for that person, but we see those things are things that don't matter. All we care about is what billionaires do. We all have a role to play. You don't have to be a billionaire to impact lives.A lot of us chose to be rude and mean. People can't even approach us.

I don't have to listen to anyone before I would make a decision. The whole idea you've listed, are duties that should be done by the government. We can all help the economy in different ways but at our own will.I agree since this is why we have such high taxes to begin with, a person will work hard in order to build the life they envision, and in order to do that they need to overcome the huge handicap that governments put over their shoulders paying taxes that can go above 50% of all of what they earn, asking even more from those people is simply incorrect, if governments around the world cannot solve or at least diminish poverty over their respective countries then that government is at fault, and we should not judge the person that is using whatever money that remains after they pay their taxes to buy what they want.",

However buying large ship as a billionaire may not be used as a home, but could be rented out for different occasions. That yields money to the billionaire. Anything can be a utility and a source of happiness to people. Such things is what generates money to business men. Take few minutes to think about the number of people who would want to go on a cruise during vacation. Staying in a ship over the night, taking interesting pictures. Many would pay handsomely to do that. And are doing it everyday. Billionaires buy ships and make money from it. Many use theirs to ship goods depending on the size of the ship. I think you're wrong for seeing it as a waste of money. Or mainly for luxury purpose on the side of the buyer. That's not true. On the other hand, smaller ships, going at a cheaper rate, have provided nice shelter for people in America and some parts of Greece. Citizens now go to work from their boat home. People train kids aboard and save up enough money before moving to live in houses. I read in your advise that people should build houses. On the contrary, some people in the \"live-aboard niche\" may have an opposite of what you just said Op. They first pay or purchase a ship, before thinking about building a house. After spending years living in the boat or ship. Hence, while trying to give an advise always do that to those who asked for it. As you may be pissing some off. What do you expect a person whose home is a ship to think of this advise. In a nutshell, not buying a ship won't put an end to all the world problem you've listed above. These misfortunes have been in existence, before we came to this world. The floor is open for everyone to make this place a better one for themselves and others. It's a thing of choice and mindset. Self interest, leads how people spend their money.",

Do you think we can do that and billionaires won't? For me it's nonsense to do something without involving large capital to achieve large profits. You take a big role from the point of the post made, but difficult life forces people to look for ways to solve their own lives and lucky if there are billionaires who are willing to take on big responsibilities who want to help many poor people in the world.Not all billionaires are sensitive to the social life of small communities and they themselves must solve the problem. This work is limited and can only be done by people who have sympathy and high social feelings towards other people, but not regardless of the finances they have. It is impossible for people like us to build livable houses for the poor, provide free quality food and provide them with medicines.",

Hugh amount of money that should be enough for many is used for worldly pleasure or spent on things for the use of one or few people. Another problem is serving riches and trusting that it will solve all or most problems,which is the main reason people strongly desire to have it. And when they have it, problems increase and most of the riches is spent or wasted solving them. So, they have to spend most of their lives serving or chasing after riches to accumulate and waste more. And it becomes their god that fails all the time & can't satisfy their lust for pleasure.It's much better to serve and trust the CREATOR of the Universe than riches. Doing so shrinks or eliminates your problems and you then understand you don't need too much riches for yourselves... And be more focused on using most of the riches for others in need.When you trust and serve the CREATOR, HE strengthens the Shield around you which consequently strengthens the things in the shield and they last for you.
