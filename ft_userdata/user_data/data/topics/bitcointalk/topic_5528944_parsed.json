      "body": "Bitcoin didn't need to advertise (though it makes me wonder if anyone did make advertisements for it in its early day). It was a movement to make change to money. Forward-thinking people who understood problems with money, or those who simply wanted an alternative to traditional means, had been participating in this topic long before Bitcoin (since the 90's in fact) and there were already predecessors trying to do what Bitcoin did. Satoshi made it happen. He created Bitcoin and this forum, which bought people together to support its development. People powered the network, yes word of mouth would have factored into it (as does with anything good), but also utility, use-case, the fact that Bitcoin was real and could be used, showing current and future promise, all being enough to bring new people onto the network and into the communities.",

These thing are hard to understood by Average Joe, that's why not many people heard about it.A year later, people are keep discussing about Bitcoin price after it reach $19K, we always see many ridiculous predictions created by throwing random number until now. Most articles only discuss Bitcoin about the price, not the other thing.",

It can be said that at that time we were quite close to modern society.Bitcoin is a store of value, but in the beginning it had no value. The historical event that happened with Bitcoin in 2010 was that 10,000 Bitcoins were paid for just two pizzas and maybe at that time it's worth was only $25. It is really surprising that in just a few years, the price of one Bitcoin is now $100k for1 BTC.Then the promotion of Bitcoin started through various media and online community worldwide. The forum through which you asked the question initially played a major role in the adoption of Bitcoin from that time. This community is still working to spread Bitcoin worldwide and revolutionize it.",

I grew up from there. I first heard in 2012. And I know about Bitcoin through this forum. And since the beginning of 2017 I have been involved with this forum. To work here till now. If I had bought Bitzcoin in 2017 I would have been a lot of people today but sadly I didn’t give Bitcoin so much priority today that is why I am a poor man. Because I’m constantly working here but success has not yet been seen in my life but will soon be seen success.",

However concerning your question about people who never had the idea of Bitcoin in 2010 now talking about how Bitcoin is on the 2010, actually is a very easy question because even if most people were not aware then but now they have understood Bitcoin and from there they were able to trace back the price and evey movement of Bitcoin in 2010 and whe they talk about it is as if they were there during that time.",

Probably that must have happened to many other people as well between those past years.The fact is that many of us have heard about Bitcoin at some point, but we were negligent to not develop further interest for it on that moment. If we weren't negligent, all we would have to do was to create a BTC address in an online wallet service, access a faucet and claim 5 Bitcoins at once. And then we would already have enough money for our retirement decades later...It was easy like that, but we were more focused in worthless things, which didn't add anything to our lives. Anyway, it's not time to complain about anything. At least we are here now as Bitcoin adopters, trying to thrive somehow in this chaotic world.",
