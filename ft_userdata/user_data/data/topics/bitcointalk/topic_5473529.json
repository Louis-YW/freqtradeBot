  "content": "To some of you this could seem silly but maybe this actually gets attention from members around here.I met a number of issues every now and then while browsing Bitcoin Talk or trying to write a thread / reply.  I am not using Java Script and some features of course do not work.  But it seems like some of them are easy fix.  Here are the issues I am finding currently.  I can not remember them all but I will update the topic as soon as I remember more.> BBCodes.  I see the buttons.  I can hold the cursor over them to see the Alt Text.  But it would be helpful if the Alt Text also showed a really short guide of how the BBCode works by showing what the code is to insert that function in the reply / topic.  Alternative solution is adding a link or question mark icon next to the buttons that would open up a really simple Bitcoin Talk page showing examples of how to use BBCode.To find the actual code for the buttons, I had to quote some body else who posted the face or text feature that I wanted and find where their code was so I could copy it.> Show/Hide link for ignored users is non functional.  This means I have to first remove a member from my Ignore list if I want to read their message.  I do not know how easy this fix would be to be honest.  But maybe it is as simple as a few lines of code.Non Java Script users are probably only a handful.  Hello to you all.  What other issues have you met along the way while using BT without Java Script?",

      "body": "Quote from: PrivacyG on November 09, 2023, 07:05:11 PM~Snip~Well, the forum is intended to be used with Java Script and most of the functions of the forum will work when you enable the Java Script. A user has to face some issues if he/she disables Java Script and I don't think that anyone is going to work on the code of the forum on only to make it workable for non-Java Script users, but if someone makes that then that would be a good thing for Java Script disabled users.I would like to know that for what reason you have disabled your Java Scripts? Is it for security purposes or something else? Like decodx said you should remove users from ignore list and then read their messages. It's not worth it to ignore a users who may post valuable stuff that you want to view. But, when it comes to a fix then I think that show/hide link of the ignored users can be fixed by someone who is good at html.",

Another reason is we can check each tool one by one as it will not affect the forum or any of our activity but even if you are afraid that our action might affect our posts while testing those buttons then you can do that in the Archive section because many members test their ideas of creating post format there. If I mistook your idea then please clear it for me.",

Via extension on inbuild options from browser. Never went deep with browser settings, so I don't know, if it was possible.Disabling JavaScript removes a lot of security vulnerabilities, yes. It breaks a minimal amount of website functionality. The time when it becomes most problematic is the cloudflare captcha. I believe that when this comes up, there's no choice but to enable JavaScript to be able to pass it. (I don't believe these is a solution for this).It's very possible to use the forum without javascript, it just causes some minor inconveniences (as do most security or privacy measures)",
