      "body": "I just checked his YouTube and GitHub profile. This guy has a lot of contribution to many crypto projects but lacks the skills to be a good YouTube podcaster. The problem is not with his content the problem is the way he speaks. I was not able to understand because of his fake accent. Some of his questions were not making any sense. A good software engineer doesn't mean a good Youtuber. This is what I felt after watching his channel.",

I liked the monkey part.But tell me something, is it true that the guy is holding 50 crore worth of crypto ?If so then yes we must be jealous of him because we didn't put in the same effort as him.But if not then there is another example of a guy who genuinely put in so much effort and holds worth millions in crypto.He's none other than Vitalik Buterin and he's just 29 yet has achieved so many things already.",
