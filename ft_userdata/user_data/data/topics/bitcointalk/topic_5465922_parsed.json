Even before making NFT ads to be allowed, they've been allowing scam ads to get into their platform.I'll be happy and for sure that many will be happy too if they're going to be stricter with approving and declining these ads, whether they're NFT, crypto or anything that's related to scam and fake service ads to help people becoming victims of it.",

Yes. 2018 was the beginning of the rise of NFT, namely the world of art and entertainment, and this can be considered as one of the digital-based investments also in terms of art. I think they also read trends and one of them is NFT for advertising. We know that the most promising source of income for a platform is advertising, and this potential is the main impetus for Google itself, besides the demand from users as well.",

It seems like that google was changing its perspective to the crypto slowly but surely. People are massively using crypto even paypal has introduced its own stable token which was helping the addoption for cryptocurrency. Even though google was allowing it but it still scares me. I meant there have been also so many ponzi scheme games like wemix. So, that depends on what kind of NFT games gonna be accepted by google to do advertising on its platform. Google shall also care to stricter its advertising. The proliferation of fraudulent NFTs presents an opportunity for malicious links to spread. It's a good moving from google but this is not directly affecting NFT related games.",

I know a lot of devs are probably trying it out, hoping to get one or two hits to get rich quickly, but I don't think there that relevant on the scene anymore. I'd be surprised if one or two games ever held a constant player base of more than say 1k or so.Well in general I don't think it'd change things up. I mean it's technically just a subscription based game or a one time pay type in essence,  but a lot worse in terms of gameplay.",

Even in my twitter and instagram, I was shock to see some porno ads as well or even contents that I'm not interested. But in this case, 50/50 for me. I mean yeah it could be good for the overall crypto market, and obviously Google is going to make money out of the ads.But we all know how smart this hackers are, sooner or later we will see NFT ads that are totally scam, or at least it looks like legit because it copy the original site.

Not only Google but any platform especially social media like x, facebook, reddit those are gonna be an nft spam hubs. I just hope that they could be more strict that nft projects or clients would be legit as possible cause if a non nft user encounter something for first time and its a scammer then they are allowing such user to abuse their legality for quick moneys.",

All of the NFT's value right now went down significantly, and I don't almost hear them being spoke online. In the forum, nobody talks about it already unlike the time where it's hype. People here are always talking about NFT's, NFT's, and more NFT's. Now almost nobody is speaking about NFT's anymore. I don't know the exact reason why Google allowed NFT ads, but hey... it's a business, and they'll earn from it so... yeah.",

      "body": "They are reviving a dying hype. NFTs reached their peak a long time ago but they cannot preserve it because of the expensive prices they put on every NFT. Maybe a group of NFT owners, holders, and projects helped each other to push this through or paid Google for it to happen. When did we see someone talking about NFT now? I guess only those who own it are the ones active to promote it because they need the value of their NFT to keep on growing. But the truth is, there isn't much who took the bait and bought this kind of platform. If it's art then I'd rather buy the physical ones, if it's sports idols then I'd rather buy the rare cards where at least I have something to hold onto. I am sure Google received something for them to push it like this while they didn't let cryptocurrencies be advertised before.",

Legit exchanges & wallets, sure. But things like DeFi which has less regulation clarity won't get accepted by mainstream advertisers like Google anytime soon. Even traditional finance products and services have to comply with tons of policies, and some of the riskier products, e.g. binary options trading, are straight out not allowed.",
