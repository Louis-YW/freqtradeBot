      "body": "Hello, I am not bidding but have some new information reference the binary eagle 2014 sol noctis coin. I contacted top world coins reference why my binary eagle which I had bought from them directly over eBay was loaded in 2020 with 0.01 BTC. They told me they had reapplied the hologram. I do have eBay screen shots of the conversation if anyone is interested. I also own from presale a number of binary bulls still in the plastic bags, they are awesome coins and going to keep them safe. I apologise for posting here, I couldnâ€™t find anywhere else to share the information above ref the binary eagle.Dave.",
