I saw analysis on youtube that basically says all the previous bear market lasted about a year... and now we are already in a bear market for a year (starting from december 2021). Why would you think that this time it will be longer bear market?",

Why would you think that this time it will be longer bear market?Your problem, like many others, is that you are looking for information in the wrong place, and YT is flooded with various analysts and so-called \"experts\" who have no idea what they are talking about. The bear market will last as long as it lasts, anyone who says they know when it will end is just speculating. If I am going to speculate, then I will say that it will last in a more or less intense way for the whole of next year, and possibly during the first half of 2024, of course taking the halving as a reference point from which we can expect positive changes, referring to what happened in the past. A longer bear market this time could be caused by inflation, recession, increase in interest rates, and of course war - which is quite logical, right?",

Despite the fact that there are a number of excellent altcoins available on the market, I will only discuss bitcoin because I am less certain about the other coins.Go to Tradingview and check out the bitcoin chart. A picture taken from Zenledger will serve as a hint. These are the precise times of bitcoin halvings.  If you are now examining the bitcoin chart. Check the year following each halving, the prices of bitcoin were always higher than the prices at the year of the halving. After each halving year, check the third and fourth years. The winter years were always those.",

For every great opportunity there's always a great prize to pay, the same thing happened in the Bitcoin investment. However, risk in BTC can be minimized if you improve your knowledge about the Bitcoin 4 cycle because this is what determines the major pump and fall in the price of the BTC market. Although, the event is always triggered by some FUD issue but it doesn't mean it is the end of the market and what you need to do is prioritize your investment in BTC. The below image will give you a clear view of your possible chance of making a profit in BTC after the winter is over.Quote from: a298b112 on December 28, 2022, 06:56:55 AMThis is not the end, right? Yes, this is not the end. It is just the chance of buying low before a new ATH price happens again.",

After all, bear market is the best time for accumulation, and bull market is the time to reap what you sow. So no need to worry and panic, as we can always stay calm while silently buying bitcoin and diversify it with potential altcoins. As monitoring the market more often won’t help, just make yourself busy with other hobbies and while you’re enjoying it, you’ll be surprise later on that the crypto market has slowly got into bullish. So maximize your purchase now, and enjoy the huge profits later.",
