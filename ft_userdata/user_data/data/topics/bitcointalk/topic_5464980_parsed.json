If you are talking about bitcoin, why did you create this topic on altcoin speculation board? It would have been better on bitcoin speculation board.All that I know is that I am expecting a significant bull run in 2024 and 2025, the time that it would happen I do not know. If you are able to hold during the time, you will see the bulk run and be happy.",

But however, if invested in altcoins and waiting to make profits don't be surprised you could get disappointed by them so don't expect so much from altcoin rather try to expand your portfolio by increase your bitcoin holding than altcoin.",

It is still in question speculators say so but speculators have other views...There is no guarantee that the start of the bull run will be identical to the previous halving. I admit that this time things may not go according to the script and we will see the result completely opposite to our expectations. Otherwise, it would be too easy to make a profit if all our wishes came true.",

It’s hard to tell when exactly it will happen, as there are many uncertainties and challenges in the crypto market.It is important to note that the halving is not the only factor that affects the price of Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. The halving of the Bitcoin supply is likely to lead to an increase in demand but other factors such as regulations, adoption, and technological developments can also play a role.",

Note: Invest wtih your own responsibility. the bull run could happen like your prediction when you calculated it in math, but everything changes can happen in a speculative market. I've experienced in the past 2020, when the 3rd halving happened, we didn't expect on March 2020 bitcoin price to crash dramatically because of COVID-19. At that time I bought many bitcoins, and enough depressed when the price down almost 50%. So if i were you, I don't expect too much, don't buy full your money, just buy little by little, so when unexpected, you still have capital to cover it.",

Probably the halving effect will start to happen before the actual halving and that is the start of a bull trend.2024 will be a great year for us and I'm confident that we are going to end this year on a up trend which is the preparation for the halving. Don't wait for the pump before you buy or invest, start buying now while the price are still cheap because we might not see this level again when the bull started to come.",

There's no ETA when the big bullish trend will be coming after the next halving. people can only try to compare it to the previous halving through seeing some signals that may be coming up. The bull trend can come anytime but im not sure if it will be coming a few months after halving. You shall not be trapped with it. None knows when the pump will be occurring.

Now let me guess! Meanwhile i google about Btc halving and it shows, April 26, 2024.The dates that we're seeing on the internet about the halving are all speculations because it all depends on the block that will be mined. It is going to be the 840,000th block that will be mined and the halving will occur. It could be earlier or later but that's the actual basis for the halving to come.Quote from: Tahid12 on August 29, 2023, 03:48:22 PMAnd if so, then it is possible that bull will within some months after halving occurred. That means possible time could be within 2024? Or 2025? What is your thought?Yes, that's possible just after the halving that it will be followed by the bull run. Either of those years you mentioned.Quote from: Tahid12 on August 29, 2023, 03:48:22 PMNote: Invest wtih your own responsibility. As always, invest what you afford to lose.",

Well that's the projected date considering Q4 has always been good to Bitcoin ATH, it's either November or December month that it hits. I'm not worried about that yet, I'm worried I can't accumulate more considering the time is getting near. Besides, the final deadline of the spot ETF was due to 2024 too and many analyst are predicting that it will happen.",

So this time in 2024, it is not certain how the demand will lead the market but with the increased adoption rate, it might cause price to move higher and faster than expected.",

There will be a lot of hype before and after this issue causing the price of bitcoin to fluctuate wildly, speculatively I understand the benefits of early speculation for that time, there will be new trends coming soon with follow to increase the active part in the market.",
