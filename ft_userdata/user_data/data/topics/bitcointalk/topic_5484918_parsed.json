Actually, people are attacking Bitcoin because they are in reality supporting something else as if they can be able to diminish Bitcoin by using that strategy. They will fail, of course. Nothing can stop Bitcoin and its critics will eventually accept that fact of life. There is nothing wrong with supporting or promoting aside from Bitcoin, and that is why we have thousands of altcoins around. What they don't understand is that without Bitcoin, BCH and BSV and the rest of the gang will not be here if Bitcoin did not paved the way. No Bitcoin, no alts...that is the arrangement and not the other way around. These people are just wasting their time but then if they got nothing better to do then let's just let them so they got something to enjoy!",

I use to hear people say this that what you cant become, then you become jealous of it, that is the same explanation needed in making an interpretation between bitcoin and BCH, anything that is not like the way we are are, cannot perform the same role we play, their fork is not a complete victory that they have gained access over what bitcoin is to the people and the economy, that is why BCH is nowhere to be found wherever bitcoin appears.",

What distinguishes Bitcoin is continuous development instead of searching for Fast solutions, as both (BSV and BCH) provided quick solutions to the problem of high fees, but they did not continue to develop, which made them lose the advantage of low fees, while Bitcoin continued to develop, so it gained greater value, and the day may come when a cryptocurrency exceeds Bitcoin in terms of market value if it continues to develop.",

I didn't think it was a scary time, personally.  There have been quite a few forks over the years since I read about it during the summer of 2010.  Things that were potentially scary were the overflow bug in August 2010, but it was resolved quickly.  Ditto the March 2013 fork which also was resolved quickly.  😀. Everything else was pretty much ignored by bitcoin.",
