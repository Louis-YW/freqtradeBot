The duo is accused of attempting to launder thousands of pilfered Bitcoins via mixing services.They were slated to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, the Justice Department said in a statement.The authorities unearthed a sophisticated plan wherein the alleged thieves would drain cryptocurrencies out of victims’ accounts and then launder the proceeds through various mixers and exchanges using \"peel chains,\" pass-through wallets, and virtual private networks to conceal their identities.The laundered funds were subsequently spent on extravagances such as international travel, nightclubs, pricey accessories, and luxury automobiles.In the current case, the culprits robbed off 4,100 Bitcoin, worth $230 million, from a victim in Washington, D.C., last month.and these are the amounts that only recovered;ZachXBT added that over $9 million of the stolen assets have been frozen, and more than $500,000 have been returned to the victim.Your thoughts on this....read more.

That amount doesn't belong to a company or an institution, right? It belongs to a single person. And for somebody to have that much money, he/she must have a lot of rich and powerful friends. And he/she can be very generous in tips. Of course, law enforcers are always quick to respond to the problems of the rich. They're always the priority. It's not clear how the heist was done though.",

Kidding aside, I'm sure the victim still has more bitcoins aside from the 4,000 that were stolen. The remaining bitcoins might be used to get things done. Probably, the FBI received an under the table reward from the victim to make this happen. Or maybe the suspects were just too careless, which is why they were caught easily.",

Or it could be the one which has agreed to share data with the enforcement agencies for every big transactions. FBI and other enforcement agencies know this for a fact, that criminals who steal funds from others, will always try to mix their bitcoins to hide the trail. So it's not a surprise that they still allow certain mixing services to run in exchange of data. The good part is that, the criminals were arrested. Bitcoin should not become a free heaven for criminals like these people. They have NFT markets to play with where they can purchase a stupid looking monkey image for millions of dollars!",

Those people will do all stupid things to withdraw the amount and do partying and other stupid stuff to get attention. In most cases such scammers get traced because of the centralized exchanges as they mostly withdraw their money through those exchanges, and when law enforcement agencies do investigation then they trace the source of the money. I'm happy that those criminals were arrested for the crime they did.",

QuoteThe $230 million Bitcoin heist involved two suspects, Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano, who used social engineering techniques to steal over 4,100 Bitcoin from a single victim. This highly sophisticated scheme occurred in August 2024. The scammers impersonated customer support representatives from Google and Gemini, convincing the victim to reset two-factor authentication (2FA) and use screen-sharing software, which allowed them to access private keys and transfer the Bitcoin into their own wallets.",

They probably didn’t come from an organized group, which made it easy to trace them because of their spending habits. If they bought something that gets traced back to them, and an investigation follows, it will look like unexplained wealth.

Just as the title of the thread said \"Bitcoin Heist\", then it's possible the victim may have been monitored over a long period of time, both online and offline to study what coin he/she owns and where those coins stored, before the heist may have been executed successfully through the help of close informant, because this is a Heist that ever could have been possible with the help of one individual or a group of person, as judging from the amount involved, it must have been executed by an organization of hackers. QuoteGood thing is that the attackers have been apprehended, so the victim will be able to get some of their money back, they will also have to liquidate properties the scammers have bought with stolen funds, and use it towards refunding the victims.Yes, because that's the only means that can be possible in recovering money that may have been spent, since it's literally impossible to recover the exact amount that may have been stolen during the heist, as I agree to the ideas that luxurious assets bought by these criminals to be sold, and money recovered back to the true owner. Whereas, people should be very careful of letting third parties know about the amount of Bitcoin they own, as hackers wouldn't have known he has such Bitcoin if it wasn't made public to people working around him/her.",

A platform getting compromised sounds as there must of some technical fault but, kin of phishing scams, email threats, and other tactics should be observable, and how an experienced person can be so reckless while dealing with sensitive data.These days scam news are another trending topic seems like, more adoption is bringing more consequences, which needs the attention of the experienced ones, they should full effort in their own domain to educate people with security concerns while moving into the crypto market investment.",
