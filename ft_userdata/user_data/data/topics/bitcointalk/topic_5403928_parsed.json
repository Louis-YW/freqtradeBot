We have multiple wallets available in the market which are decentralized in nature. People are free to use it. Also Coinbase has never positioned themselves as an anonymous wallet service provider.

I am not that surprised because the trend is that all transactions made in cryptocurrencies are going to be perfectly KYC. That's what the powers that be want, and while you will always be able to trade P2P, anything that goes through a centralized exchange or a company is going to require KYC. Crypto casinos that don't require KYC or only from a few levels up are also in the not too distant future are going to require KYC fully.It's not a matter of Coinbase, it's a matter of the Governments. The amount of undeclared transactions in cryptocurrencies running around is going to be greatly reduced. Quote from: avikz on June 24, 2022, 05:31:38 PMYou have to understand that Coinbase is a legally registered company and also listed in stock market. So they can't operate in a decentralized manner. They have to follow the rules and regulations of the local markets where they have presence and supports banking transfers. It is like this. They want the transfers that go through exchanges CEX to be perfectly identified, that's why they ask for the name and address of the receiver. In a bank transfer they don't ask for it, but because the receiver is already perfectly identified by the receiving bank.Quote from: Myleschetty on June 24, 2022, 04:55:54 PMIs there room for privacy in the future?Not much:Goodbye, privacy, goodbye, it was nice while it lasted.",
