I am not really a fan of women football but if I am less busy and I feel like watching football and there is any women league going on, then I can just give it my time.I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy the last female world cup because it was interesting, but I still think that I wouldn't enjoy it up to when the men are playing their matches. I appreciate your effort to create a thread for active discussion on women football and I believe that other forum members will love it. Let's see how the league goes before I will know if I will be interesting in it or not.",
