Nobody else caused the normally scripted SBF to go off his tangent and get upset live on those streams.https://www.jrepodcast.com/episode/joe-rogan-experience-1951-coffeezillaReddit post on the podcast from yesterday:https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11l86v8/coffeezilla_the_crypto_detective_made_it_on_the",

I would love to have my art piece seen by him, but getting his attention might not be so easy haha  .Yes, I wholeheartedly agree that there are no boundaries when it comes to online journalism. YouTube is a massive platform backed by Google, making it the video version of searching stuff on the internet. You can literally find anything on there, INCLUDING Coffeezilla. That guy is just on fire right now with all of the content, investigations, and memes coming from him. He doesn't work alone, however. He is teamed up with content creators such as XQC, Moist Critical, SomeOrdinaryGamers, Asmongold, and Ludwig. I featured all of them in the piece of Fan Art I made.I also agree with you when it comes to Coffeezilla's fearlessness. The man just ISN'T afraid of calling out the bad players! God bless that man, we need fifty more just like him. We need to be fighting the fight for good. We need to be weeding out every person that wants to make money off of telling retail investors straight up lies about the space we care so dearly about.Hey No problem man, your art was really great and I think that Coffeezilla will really like it, and yes he can not do this alone for sure he surely has a team that is backing him up with the research and stuff like that was pretty much a good team to have and to be part of your wonderful art, actually, I really think Coffeezilla is a good person that many was helped in appealing with the scammers what he really wants to say, and his interview with Joe Rogan is really amazing to watch there are some very informative things that they have tackled,Well, there are other scammer buster Youtuber out there but not like Coffeezilla if Scammer Payback is targeting a call center in India and hacking their system Coffeezilla is targeting well-known personnel which is more dangerous because they can harm you physically because they know who you are, worst well known to be targeted with death threats, even so, Coffeezilla is fearlessly ditching those and go on with life,",

Variety confirmed the figure via a source knowledge of the pact.Citing anonymous sources, the Times reported that “the true value” of the deal negotiated between Spotify and Rogan — spanning three and a half years — was “at least $200 million, with the possibility of more.” Previously, the pact had been said to be worth more than $100 million, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal.https://news.yahoo.com/joe-rogan-deal-spotify-actually-202442278.htmlI saw some of the highlights from JRE's podcast with Coffeezilla. Excellent content for sure. Joe Rogan and Coffee did a great job breaking down every aspect of things on a play by play basis.",

I mean, there are proofs that he saw through what is happening and warned the investors about it and it's all over social media and the popular streaming service. Coffezilla tells he got lucky but I don't think that is the case, that may be because of long research and he found some gray spots that would make him back out on investing in FTX and supporting them. And that was before the collapse of SBF. And BitBoy is not done yet at reporting about what is happening with SBF, he may really want to dig deep into this and see that even their smallest connection will pay for what happened. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CKosy1iC4Man, these crypto influencers should really be careful about who or what they will promote.
