Also I remember there are flags with compilers that let you limit how much space they use and how aggressive their garbage handlers are, have you tried looking into that to see if you can limit it to the 4gb elsewhere (I thought it'd do it more automatically though - the error isn't too descriptive of where it got stuck either imo).",
