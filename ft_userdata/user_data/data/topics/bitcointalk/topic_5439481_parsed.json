I think it is good to have gold in case of a power outage or in case of domestic or global internet problems.I do have some physical bullion gold, silver, and platinum.

It has never failed me in the whole time I have been invested in it so I stick with what works. Like I said though, a diversified portfolio is important. For the average guy it might be quite uncomfortable being so dependent on bitcoin.",
