After home page is loading I think it's something useless sees a lot of messages on the right. (and potentially people could use this space for pulling scams if not moderated constantly but in some sites I have seen people scammed by other players like with loan requests).- The graphic (icons of the games in home page) it's pretty the same of another famous casino/gambling site ... I know that many of users are pretty aware. But I don't know if this is a choice made voluntary or there is a kind of affiliation with that \"famous casino/gambling site\".- Related this last point, I tried a couple of games and everything was fine... graphic and other related stuffs are completely differents - Free coins, even if worthless, are a nice idea to made players more familiar with games... this idea deserve probably more attention by admins since can lead to a lot of promo and so on...- it would be nice see here on forum some signature campaign or other promos since a lot of gamblers are around here and can easily join the website.- interesting option bonus for deposits and so on but personally I prefer rakeback/cashback and other promotions...- sports bet are missing  in a certain way must be added  since people want betting not only in casino",
