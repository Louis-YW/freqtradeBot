Bitcoin lacks the feature to entirely do that.",

Or, even more interesting, a salary that's constant in bitcoin can be interesting in such countries, especially in the months when the price is going up  But government will not like that because then the company that's paying can avoid taxes. Also the employee may need to be careful because he may have to legally pay taxes for the bitcoins he converts to fiat in order to buy all he needs (especially if the shops don't accept bitcoin).I am in favor of getting a part of the salary as bitcoin as investment, but all of it can be troublesome in countries with low acceptance in shops.So it greatly depends on the country too, after all.Quote from: Edcrypto91 on July 25, 2023, 07:22:48 PMso what is your take on this will it be a positive move on the Bitcoin ecosystem or notIn theory it should be good. In practice, if the employer will buy at pay day the bitcoins from exchange and the employee will sell them back to the exchange next day, ... not much. Something more is also needed.",

Let's say Crypto Exchange hired him and him working independently online. It will be a problem if the company is not making money in crypto. The issue is how will the government collect tax from these BTC earners because they will have to convert the coins to fiat before it's possible. The government might not allow this.",

That's how bitcoin remains different from all the other options pushed by governments.So, why is it a good idea? Because it popularizes bitcoin. Many people wouldn't be tempted to try it out if it wasn't given to them for free. They wouldn't bother to register at a centralized exchange, but an employer endorsing it, like they do in El Salvador turns things 180 degrees. More people trying it out means more people being interested in saving in bitcoin. More bitcoin savers means less centralized power, less freedom.",

The main concern is that bitcoin's price fluctuates a lot and making it unsuitable as a stable form of salary and I think that not all countries have officially accepted bitcoin as a digital currency yet.Perhaps, in the future such a scenario like that could happen but I don't believe they will completely replace fiat currencies.

Bitcoin can't be accessed without the internet. We all can see what's happening with that. Yes, I know and acknowledge that already companies/businesses are paying in Bitcoin but that's just a very minute population. These companies doing that shouldn't be a point of reference to use Bitcoin payment option because both scenarios aren't the same.",

Now I don't think of it as deranged anymore cause a lot of people in this industry has stopped receiving payments in stablecoins and are happily accepting money in bitcoin and other coins. I think this is great cause it drives usage and adoption, and in my case, it became a conversation starter that lead to some of my acquaintances becoming involved with the industry too. So while the threat of losing some of your money is still there, the overall benefits it give in the adoption department outweighs the risks by a longshot.",

Even if they can't control bitcoin, they won't want anything to do with promoting it, even if the people have started using it.  It's not a bad notion if your friend wants his income in BTC, but it will rely on the company he works for; nevertheless, waiting for the government to do so is a pipe dream that will not come true anytime soon or in the future. I as an individual who knows and appreciates what I stand to gain from being paid in bitcoin, will want that to happen, but individuals who aren't well-versed in bitcoin will lose interest if this is done without a thorough understanding of the bitcoin market on their part because of its volatility.",

In my country, you can't use Bitcoin to pay for goods or services. It can be used for an investment only. So, there is no way to pay the wages/salaries with Bitcoin. The owner of the company will be imprisoned and pay a fine if he/she forces to pay the salaries/wages of the employees with Bitcoin.
