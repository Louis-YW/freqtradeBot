With the kind of negative trust you have, No one is going to trust you even with a pennyCreating a sockpuppet account and then self sending some BTC pretending as though someone funded your account isn't going to work either. We know all this scam trickQuote from: Mehrdad666 on October 27, 2022, 06:11:55 PM>>snip<<Hi btcpepa04, don't try so hard, we know it's you.",

A newbie that has no background will invest 0.28BTC that easily. If I'm that newbie, I'll better be holding that instead of putting it into some unknown and random investments. Yeah, I may be an investor but I know where I'll be placing my money and won't trust anyone with huge amounts. This style of investment scam is like those that are on social media like Twitter when bots and scammers replying to someone's tweet/comment.",
