Of course, it's risky and you can \"meet\" here scammer and you don't know from seller had data also \"owner of account\" can't agree of used his data.But people sell everything that people want to buy.A few things why people buy:Firstly and most importantly: LIMITS, if you're a good bettor, you play surebets, tipsters and, in short, you are in + on the bookmaker they give to you limits per bet like 1EUR, Bet365 and others. If you're good, they can give you this funny limits after few bets. Second: It's not possible to register in your country, so you're looking for an account in a country where it is possible.3rd: You don't want show your data to your country system about tax etc.But of course all depends on your inner feeling.",
