Acer, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, MSI... These are all well known brands. I used HP too but somehow I don't like them. Mine was getting too hot. I used Acer, Asus and Dell before and never had any problems with them. Asus and Acer were great. Some of my friends say Lenovo is making great products too but I never tried them.The thing is, any of these good brands are making good laptops. You just need to use the right operating system on them. So, whatever you get, don't get a Windows machine. Get something freedos and install a linux distribution. It will be the best thing you will do to yourself.Also don't get a bulky laptop. Get a slim one with a very good battery life and a good CPU. Everything else is noise. Never ever think about playing games on your laptop. You will fry it.",

You just need a clean PC with any product and OS. We all have our preferred choices, and the kind of specification you need to see in your design system.For me, I will recommend MAC laptops. It seems more secure to me than Windows. But when installing an OS, you should make sure you get it from a licensed and direct store in order not to get your PC infected even before you start using it. Most strong system viruses, like clipboard viruses and others that target crypto-related applications and extensions, have always been confirmed to be from infected OS.",

      "body": "There are no specific laptop specifications required for crypto needs. However, for those who enjoy trading, investing, or simply monitoring the market, there are some laptop recommendations based on features that I would suggest.First, look for a laptop with long battery life, at least 8 hours of usage. This is especially useful when you want to monitor the market while on the go, such as when traveling or at a cafe.Second, make sure the specifications are sufficient to open the latest UI graphics. When using a laptop for trading, for user convenience, ensure that hardware such as RAM, Processor, CPU, and graphics card uses the latest model. Besides minimizing issues, the performance of the latest hardware models is also more effective.Lastly, look for a laptop from a reputable brand. This is for the benefit of user experience quality and warranty period. Asus, Apple, and Toshiba may be my recommendations.",

A mid-range or normal laptop would suffice for trading or other activities. However, I would advise against storing private data such as seed phrases, private keys, and personal documents on it, as it could be susceptible to hacking once connected to the internet.The best approach would be to purchase a new, inexpensive laptop and keep it air-gapped, meaning it is never connected to any network. Alternatively, you could repurpose an old android phone as an air-gapped device, but it should be thoroughly cleaned (formatted and free of viruses and malware) before using it to store your wallet and sign transactions.",

There's a lot of antivirus that can prevent your laptop pc from getting hacked. But you need to look at the specification of any laptop before you buy it. Processor and it's generation, ram, cooling capability. You can all that info from YouTube on internet. One channel that I can suggest is Linus Tech Tips(LTT). But you need to do your own research on what you are looking for in that laptop. And using a laptop as a wallet is never a good choice. Better to have a hardware software than using laptop for that purpose. Software wallets are never immune to hacks and hackers. And I have seen this many times because it has happened to me already. Once you get hacked one time, doesn't matter what you do, use new OS, change internet connection, all this can't prevent you from getting hacked again. Those hackers will always find a way. For exchange and trading purpose, you can use it and buy the one that suites you. But for hodling crypto? Use hardware wallets. Trust me, you'll be in safe hands.",

I donât think the model of computer or device matters in terms of security as much as the wallets you choose to use to hold your bitcoins. Use a non custodial wallet and store your keys offline. Observe security practices like avoiding suspicious links that may appear on your browser, also check for malware occasionally to know if your computer has been compromised.",

You can store them in any laptop or use exchanges on any computer as these things do not require any specific processors and do not take much hard disk space or ram usage.The important thing is that in which ever laptop you install the wallets on, make sure the latest version of Anti Virus is installed on that laptop and also try not to surf the Internet from that laptop, and even if you do, try not to click on links which you do not know.",

Any device would work as exchanges are basically online and don't need any much space to work except for browsers that can access them sites. Wallets just need a few kilobytes to be installed and run successfully, although how safe it is depends largely on what and what you install or choose to click on your device.Keep a device very functional would add you in working a exchange and so, you might as well want to ensure a proper well being of your device by updating antivirus programs, have well enough ram & rom, avoid over hitting of your device, close tabs that aren't in use and general stuff like that.",

Any device which have access to the internet can be infected by virus if the user is not careful enough. Hardware wallet is the safest even as that you need to also be very much careful in other not to connect it to an infected device. Just as a member above has suggested, it will be of best interest if you have separate device for separate purposes. Just as the OP has proposed for PC which it's it's primary purpose is to be used as wallet and trading on exchanges. The OP can have that pc separately for that, and bookmark all his trading website and download wallets only from the direct source, not using any kind of other apps which might endanger the system.",
