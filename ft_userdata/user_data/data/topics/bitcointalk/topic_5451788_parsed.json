Bitcoin price volatilities is not a new thing, and history have always been accompanied with alot of market volatility and Bitcoin creator Satoshi already memtioned that in the bitcoin whitepaper, he stated clearly that bitcoin should be allowed to grow organically with out much interferences.So despite the ups amd down in Bitcoin price, there was never a time Bitcoin value failed recover or correct back, this is what makw Bitcoin not become a bubble that will ride in a single direction and then burst.Quote from: Sidra101 on May 07, 2023, 02:27:23 AMIt's hard to know for sure what will happen, so people who want to invest in Bitcoin should be careful and think about the risks and rewards before doing anything because the Bull market may be in trouble.BTCBitcoin price unpredictability is what makes up for the ultimate advice that you should invest only the amount you can afford to lose or look away from for a long time, never the less, Bitcoin is less risky compared to other assets in its categories and the Bitcoin chart can easily be read.The best way to minimize risk in Bitcoin is to constantly DCA whenever the price favours you but then not all Bitcoin investors go through the stress of active involvement in the daily--weekly or even monthly Bitcoin cycle, must of the new age Bitcoin investors are all about the profits and it must come fast and since bitcoin doesn't guarantee that, they tend to migrate back to altcoins that promise them quick profits.",

We still have high volatility, it’s a feature of bitcoin due to the boom, bust 4 year cycles that center around the halving. Hopefully though we have bottomed at 16k & are beginning the slow, steady transition into a new bull market.Don’t worry about short term price volatility though, bitcoin is going nowhere & is here to stay. As always, if you are patient you will do very well in bitcoin.",

The bitcoin price must not remain statics or stationary as you think, the ability of the market to be able to complete it's circle is what makes it tradable and same thing could like happened as we may get another ATH for the year after bitcoin halving and the market could likely have another shape. If I am not mistaking the market may likely drop again since some would like to take profit due to the much increase.",

Volatility2. Decentralzation3. Anonymity4. Random/Unperdictability5. Government involvement6. False media/information 7. Critics8. Permabull/Perma bearsNo one really knows on when bull run market would happen or kicked in, this is why its better not to anticipate or making yourself in a hurry or really that impatient about it.Time would just simply come and would really be showing off on how this market behaves. We cant really just be having that downward market forever.There's always a time for reversal, we cant really just be that so sure on what would happen though on how it would be kicked in but usually this would really be on halving event whether before or after.",

Also, anyone who chooses to invest in Bitcoin must not just see it as a get-rich-quick scheme or as an investment that has zero risk. Bitcoin is always volatile, and anyone who wants to invest must have that in mind before doing so. As you have said, the bull run may be in trouble, which I really doubt, but even if it is, that doesn't mean that the Bitcoin price will not still go up after some months or year. Who ever decide to buy and hold Bitcoin must be very patient because that's what Bitcoin investment is all about.Whoever wants to invest in Bitcoin must really learn how it works.",

That's why it's an advantage that you know something about reading the trading chart at least so you know when you should buy and when you should sell if you're a type of short-term holder of bitcoin.Because if you are just an investor who has no idea about these things, there is only one thing you can do and that is to be a long-term holder, nothing else because if you keep up with the short-term holders, for sure you can grow and neither. Now my only question is what problem are you referring to? And what danger do you think we Bitcoin holders can face when the bull run comes?",

I think this is going to be the most important parameter in the next bull run. It's the obvious, while the supply is dwindling due to the halving, the price is going to go up because demand is so high. And with that, we have seen this already, right after the halving, the price will suddenly shoot up, not even there is a environment concern, which is pure FUD to me, I suggest you read this paper: Can Bitcoin Stop Climate Change? Proof of Work, Energy Consumption and Carbon Footprint (SoK), not even government regulations, and not even Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 deterred the eventual bull run. It there is more risk in crypto market? it's not Bitcoin but the altcoin market, wherein there's a lot of pump and dump, scams and others that you can lose your money.",

This shouldn't bother you because you have the knowledge of when to sell to make good profit.I don't look at the price of bitcoin pumping or dumping because I am cool with my investment and not planning to sell off so soon,until 2025 when bitcoin will hit ATH.
