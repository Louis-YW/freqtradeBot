  "content": "For my first year Bitcointalk anniversary, I wanted to prepare a little bit of a special post.It could fit in the mining section, but since it’s kind of a work in progress and “Development and Technical Discussion” was mostly my home for this past year, I will present my latest project here.As it’s rather easy to source BM1387 (and similar other) ASIC chips from China for cheap, I set out to build an open-source low-power home miner that everyone can build themselves. The chips are used in Bitmain's Antminer S9, which utilizes 189 of them.I paid roughly 2€ for one such chip and 6€ (including taxes & shipping) for 5 of the PCBs you see below. If they're not available, it's easy to find broken S9 ASICs or just the hashboards, for cheap and ripping out the ASIC chips; most likely the majority of them is still good.So, my first step was to create and order a breakout board to be able to reverse engineer the communication.I also wanted to create a matching power supply; popular 1-chip mining sticks like sidehack’s stuff utilize rather high power buck converter circuits that shift 5V input voltage down to whatever the core needs; in this case, 0.4V at high currents of probably well over 10A.I’ve started to learn about buck converters and power electronics, but I’m not yet done with a circuit that I’m comfortable to get manufactured, so I designed this PCB as a pure breakout board, without any power supply circuitry and instead just a beefy 2-pin connector (rated to handle 400V, 32A). My hope is that for pure protocol reversing, the chip won’t pull a lot of power anyway and will only do so once it is instructed to start mining. This means a lab bench power supply set to 0.4V might suffice for this purpose.Even though this is meant for development purposes, I don't see why this board wouldn't work in 'mining' mode, though; as long as you add a good heatsink. A future revision should probably include mounting holes, but I couldn't find standardized, small heatsinks with holes in them, yet. A northbridge heatsink may fit, but may also be overkill.All in all, the board you see above cost me ~4€ in total; a synchronous Buck DC/DC converter circuit shouldn't be much more than 5 bucks for components and PCB, so I think you could get 20GH/s from a 10€ setup. It's not much, but a starting ground to hopefully move to a higher-end ASIC in the future. I may even keep the current design where the power supply is separate from the ASIC board; as long as the voltage is the same, it could be reused.Anyhow, the Gerber files are below and will also upload design files shortly.Gerber download: https://n0nce.eu/src/Gerber_PCB_BM1387_Breakout.zipI will continue to work on this project, so if anyone wants to chime in and / or help in this project (for example working on the power supply), don’t hesitate to comment or DM me! Any suggestions are welcome.I’d like to take a bit of space here to thank everyone for the great discussions, helpful information and acceptance in signature & avatar campaigns very early on in my Bitcointalk journey. Thanks for taking your time to read through my topics and posts when my account was still in Newbie status.This has really been the best forum I’ve been registered on and it's enlightening and fun to log on almost every day. Some days I just read, learn and send merit, other days we have vivid discussions; what's for sure is that it never gets boring..",

Yeah, wouldn't have added it if someone else made it of course. Actually I found a footprint of the ASIC on the EasyEDA web editor - who knows, maybe they also created the Antminer S9 in EasyEDA!Other than that it was just a matter of creating large ground and Vcc planes and breaking out the pins.

I believe the biggest help would be someone experienced with power electronics giving advice for a good buck converter that takes 5V, 3A (such as from a GekkoScience USB hub) and spits out a nice clean 0.4V with dozens of amps available. But it may not even be required for now. I suspect the chips don't start hashing and pulling enormous amounts of power if you don't instruct them to.This repair guide with its 'signal description' chart should come in very handy during reverse engineering.https://www.zeusbtc.com/manuals/repair-guide/Antminer-S9-hash-board-Repair-guide.pdf",

From what I saw about the other BM1387 project, he doesn't have a custom power supply / buck converter yet, either (at least not on the PCB I've seen), so maybe it makes most sense to see if Skot is going to reply, first. This is kind of what I envision when doing such an open source project: multiple people interested in the same topic (in this case an ASIC chip) coming together and contributing what they can.In the end, everyone (involved or not) can order PCBs, assemble them & start hashing.Buck converters are power electronics though; kind of its own niche - it's not guaranteed that every EE guy has experience in this field.",

That's only 17.5 amps.This was anyways just meant as a starting ground to figure out the connections and protocol, but obviously Skot has already done all that. I will try to replicate his setup based on my pure breakout and building the rest on breadboard. I actually have 2 of these so I can also try the concatenation aspect and then maybe make an x2 or x4 board.It may even be easier to build a 0.8V or 1.6V buck converter instead of a 0.4V one due to less drastic voltage drop / higher duty cycle, right?But mostly, I am looking to build a buck converter next (which I think is also missing in Skot's project) as running off a lab PSU is at best good enough for experimentation. Actually, cheaper lab bench power supplies don't even exceed 10A, so there's that.Quote from: NotFuzzyWarm on August 31, 2022, 01:11:46 AMAFAIK Vcore for Sidehacks single-chip Compac-F is 1.48V which helps a bit with the current (10.14A for 15W) but more to the point allows for more stable operation at high speeds.

And yes, TI has some rather nice controllers as well as matched power stages to work with them.Yup, he uses a synchronous buck controller IC together with 2 mosfets.Looks something like this. They are switched on and off by the controller, which creates accurate timings to achieve the required duty cycle and thus output voltage.Quote from: NotFuzzyWarm on August 31, 2022, 01:11:46 AMPersonally I'd lose the idea of powering a 2-chip design through the USB connector and use 12v in via a barrel connector.

The higher input makes the power stages a fair bit easier.I mean 2 of these can be powered through USB; sidehack proved it. But while I'd love to have an open-source USB based open-source miner, I agree that it will be easier, more practical and even cost-effective (economy of scale) to have a power supply circuit feeding a handful of ASIC chips instead of needing a buck per chip. That would then obviously exceed USB specs and be powered directly off of 12V, for sure. Even a 6-pin PCIe connector could be used. They are rated for up to 75W each.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#PowerOptional connectors add 75 W (6-pin) or 150 W (8-pin) of +12 V power for up to 300 W total (2 × 75 W + 1 × 150 W).",

I know you're in the mining game for a long time.Theoretically, for the security and censorship resistance of Bitcoin, it would be optimal if as many people as possible were mining - ideally, every Bitcoin user; even if it's just a low hashrate ASIC.Quote from: mikeywith on August 31, 2022, 04:39:57 AMSo the summary of the above paragraph, I believe if this turns into a mass production product like Apollo or Newpac, it would very likely be something in the future.I'm not at all sure yet how the 'final package' will look like, but as it's an open source project, it's not unlikely that multiple products could come out of it.Once we have full documentation of the hardware (wiring) and protocol (which it seems Skot has achieved already), it's just a question of engineering different PCBs with different amounts of chips and matching power supply circuitry.I am sure there are people willing to spend a little bit more and go buy a PC PSU to power a 100-200W silent desktop 'pod', while others are happy to just fill the last empty slot on their existing GekkoScience USB hub.Quote from: mikeywith on August 31, 2022, 04:39:57 AMNow with that being said, why did you choose the BM1387, why not the BM1397?, they have double the efficiency and are more widely available in terms of 'second-hand', because the failure rate for the gears that use BM1397 is way above 50% (not a problem with the BM1397 itself), so for any sort of mass production when it comes to cost, the BM1397 beats everything else.Honestly I just didn't know BM1397 is so easy to get! When I started looking into this (remember this was end of 2021, beginning 2022), I couldn't find those on popular Chinese marketplaces (yet - I guess).It also appears that there's just much more documentation available for the 1387 through service manual and whatnot. I think power supply is the biggest issue right now; once I have the skillset to design a reliable one for BM1387, I can tweak it to work with 1397, as well. That's another reason why the actual chip choice is not yet so crucial for me.Quote from: mikeywith on August 31, 2022, 04:39:57 AMAlso, on a side but related note, should you need to source chips from China in large quantities, reach out to me, and I will connect you to the right people.That's awesome, I really appreciate it and I may likely take you up on this offer at a later stage!",

However for a full-on Antminer replacement / alternative it doesn't make sense to go DIY. An S9 (same chips) goes for $500 and has 189 chips on it; so just for the chips you're barely overpaying over component-cost (when buying them as an end-customer in low volume). It's also a whole different league building such a thing with replaceable hashboards, different voltage domains, integrated cooling solution, etc.Hopefully, after publishing schematics and board files for simple, low-chip-count ASICs, someone with design skills can come up with a nice case and cooling mount (e.g. 3D-printable).",

Looks like it would be a great node for home mining to!https://hackaday.io/project/179571-bitpirat-computer-gen1I started working on a PoE powered version for myself, but lost some steam once I realized CM4s with 8GB RAM are totally sold out everywhere.https://github.com/skot/bitcart",

It could just power 2 of these breakout boards with it or his Bitaxe and less problematic than a 0.4V power supply.Next PCB will definitely have 2 or maybe even 4 chips on it to make things easier! I just thought that for a pure breakout PCB, it is more convenient to have just one chip (less connections, less potential errors).So, little PSA: The project is continuing well, it's just that Skot and me are keeping the more frequent conversations in private for now, not to clog up forum threads unnecessarily and to get notified about a reply more quickly.He's looking at an ESP32-based controller and I'm hoping to order PSU PCBs this weekend or next week!I'll still be glad to read about any thoughts, ideas and opinions or contributions, and going to post updates whenever it makes sense.",
