So obviously there's nothing wrong with that and as for the future of crypto I think it will remain the same, namely experiencing better development because crypto is now being seen by everyone from various sides including the economic side so that this can really help crypto to experience development in the future.",

      "body": "If anything, the lenders probably see something on these crypto banks before they authorized that loan. Most of these loans go through a rigorous process before they can be approved, and so they must know that even though these crypto banks have liquidity issues, they still have the weight and asset to pay for whatever they borrowed. Also if whatever they loaned is to provide them liquidity, I don't think there will be any problems arising from that. At least, they are trying to look out for whoever they serve by getting that much needed cash/whatever to gain some liquidity and continue providing service.",

I don't mind crypto companies giving loans to fiat companies and vice versa(assuming that everything is legal and there aren't any sketchy financial schemes).What I don't like is the term \"cryptocurrency bank\". Bitcoin/crypto is supposed to be anti-bank and the existence of \"crypto banks\" is against the core concept of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. I haven't heard anything about those two cryptocurrency banks. Perhaps they are relatively small. I guess that they are getting loans in order to refinance other forms of debt(like paying back money to their depositors).",

I doubt it's an ordinary agreement (even if the banks that are lending the money are just wanting further exposure to the market).I think it's a large risk for the banks to invest in cryptocurrency firms given their nature of being unforgiving assets and ones that face issues as mentioned above with ftx (if the crypto bank defaults and holds lots of crypto, it might be easier to steal than physical cash - especially if the cash is held in an account with another bank).",

I believe that before the loan banks agreed to lend the crypto bank millions to billions of dollars, there may have been some sort of agreement that can serve as collateral if the crypto bank fails to pay back on time, and in most cases like this, the company's reputation and reserves will always be a loan shark's target.I must admit that the crypto bank's request for a loan to keep its business running by using the fund to provide liquidity while also informing the public that there is enough fund for them to trade with is a brilliant move and a good business strategy.",

The lender must also ensure that these crypto firms are fully registered in the US and not in other freestyle nations like the Bahamas. These borrowers must also prove they have collateral that can serve as viable securitiesBut the US home loan banks should be aware of the risk involved in lending to crypto banks because just as the fall of some exchanges led to the collapse of other crypto firms if anything negative happens to Signature and Silvergate it would also affect the lender. Genesis, Galaxy digital, Sequoia Capital, Blockfi, etc felt the ripple effect of FTX's fall. Giving any crypto firm an uncollateralized loan might be counterproductive because of the unpredictability of the market that is why I said the agreement must be comprehensive. They must bear in mind that what is at stake are taxpayers' funds just as Ontario Teachers Pension Plan lost about $95 million in FTX.",

Which could explain how they extended loans to crypto finance ventures, which also may be failing.Record numbers of real estate loans failing coupled with failing loans extended to crypto finance could converge to stress mortgage based lenders beyond their normal capacity. Which could lead to them needing another bailout in the future. While I don't think it will be as bad as the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, which was leveraged. I think they could have issues down the road. The eventual fallout and implications are anyone's guess. Most hope any major change in real estate markets will help home and rent prices to stabilize and become more affordable. But there is so much happening and so many variables in play, its difficult to say for certain what the outcome will be",

However, the question is how are crypto banks able to stabilize their asset growing in such volatile market? If high withdrawals started more often from the crypto banks then they will surely have recovery burden. Everything matters, when the money will be returned, what are the interests that are being levied on them, whether the time frame and interest matches the current volatility at all? Though banks will have these questions covered, then also it's serious one for crypto related assets.

Yeah, and that's the failed formula for most of the business. It creates looping interest burden on the borrower. To clear one loan, they need another and another and so on. This only goes until they go bankrupt and nothing else. Many schemes are also liable for failed borrowing in US such as people can skip few EMI's without any late fees or charges thus they are liable for the overburden on the shoulders of banks too.",
