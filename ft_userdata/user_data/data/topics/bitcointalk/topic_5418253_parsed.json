  "content": "Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.This is not some ancient history we're talking about, it's all recent. They recently went on a money printing spree during the pandemic and the consequences of it are being felt today in form of economic crisis. Euro, Dollar, Pound, etc all got dumped because of it and yet to solve the energy crisis they decided to print even more money and inject it into the industry to artificially lower the price for a short time; the reduction is not even that significant and we already know the consequences of market manipulation like this! QuoteIn Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, the leadership is trying to spend its way out of the crisis as only it can. But even there it’s not clear the relief will be felt in time, and whether it will further wobble the country’s already deeply divided stance on how to help Ukraine and whether to work with Russia or isolate it.They injected 200 billion euros in one of their attempts alone!The public is already divided and angry enough, with protests breaking out all around Europe every day, yet they put a bandaid on an amputated leg! Not surprising that New York Times is already comparing the current crisis in Europe with World Wars era!QuoteThat moment, it seems, is arriving as strikes and protests over the rising cost of living proliferate, ushering in a period of social and labor unrest not seen since at least the 1970s.“We have seen this after the First World War, Second World War and also in the ’70s,” said Kurt Vandaele, a senior researcher at the European Trade Union Institute. “There were strike waves associated with a real spike in inflation.”How much worse the ongoing protests in Europe are going to get in the future when inflation caused by today's crazy money printing hits their countries? The inflation is already at its highest in decades in the Union where poorer countries specially in Eastern Europe face the worse of it which leads to riots every day.QuoteIn the eastern states that are among the country’s poorest, and most conservative, tens of thousands of protesters take to the streets weeklyin France, the strikes and demonstrations are gaining in intensity as a fear of eroding living standards dominates concerns, polls say.Tens of thousands gathered in the Czech capital for the second such protest in a month, spurred by an energy crisis and rising prices that are affecting countries across Europe.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/world/europe/inflation-prices-britain-ukraine-russia.html",

As discussed by Morten Petersen in an interview. I think it can be a solution to the crisis they are experiencing.sourceI consider that this crisis cannot be separated from a country's excessive dependence on other countries for its needs. Regarding the EU crisis, it can be judged that the EU is too dependent on Russia for imports.",

The EU inflation rates will start lowering in 2023-2024, when the EU economy adapts to the new supply chains and the newly found \"gas independence\" from Russia.I know that the European central bank reacts really slow to the inflation, but increasing the interest rates will create problems with certain countries to pay off their debts(Italy, Greece, etc.).",

It won't happen right away but it is guaranteed. So you'll have to use that to your advantage by expecting inflation and looking for hedges against it.Remember the pandemic? Bitcoin price was below $10k and it even went as low as $3k while they kept printing money and while people (like today) were moaning about \"why bitcoin isn't mooning\". Suffice it to say that bitcoin price went up 2200% as inflation showed itself more.They are printing fiat again and bitcoin price is $19k today. There will be hard times ahead but I believe after the economic crisis in the West is concluded, there is a good chance that we would be seeing the biggest bitcoin rally in history specifically due to all the value that fiat will have lost by then.",

It will be like wanting more inflation affecting everyone in the world.Governments always choose the easiest solution for short term when facing a crisis instead of the harder long term solutions. This is why printing money has always been on top of the solution list at times like this. For example during the pandemic the choice was between a catastrophic recession and long term inflation so they printed money to avoid the former knowing they cause the later.Right now they have the same choice to either find a replacement for Russian energy to increase the supply (and decrease its price) or to increase inflation in long term by artificially decreasing the price to solve the problem short term. I think they chose this route (ending in inflation) to try and get over winter and postpone finding an alternative energy source for next year, which in my opinion is a big gamble since there are a lot of unpredictable variables involved in that.",

I remember power outages in Middle East (but I may be wrong) this summer(ish), but not in EU.Here I guess that nobody has expected this go this well this fast (I am also surprised). Of course, it may be just a false sentiment of the market; of course, Russia can reduce further the supply and the markets will become turbulent again.But UK is not in EU and this may matter much more than they are willing to admit. Plus, clearly, there were/are fears the electricity will become prohibitively expensive and even so it may be missing, just because some politicians thought that relying mostly on Russian gas is okay. And the politics in UK are going from bad to worse since they've left EU. Even in the days EU had no issues, UK had gas/petrol shortages (allegedly because of the truckers). In EU now coal is also being used for electricity again. Certain atomic power plants will do their job for longer. And the gas got cheaper too. There are now reasonably good chances we'll be OK even without Russian gas. Of course, at the expense of shutting down the most power hungry industries (steel, aluminum and many others).But UK...
