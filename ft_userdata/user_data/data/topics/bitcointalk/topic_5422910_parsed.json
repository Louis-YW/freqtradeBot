  "content": "HiOn the previous electrum versions every time I created a new request to receive BTC, Electrum would always give a new unique address to the new request and also the request label I would create for my reference would show on history once funds received for that request. Now, the wallet repeats past addresses on new requests and in order to get a new unique one I need to open like 4 of 5 requests until a new address is given and also once payment is received on history it does not show the label I created for that transfer.I have not changed any settings so I don't know why it is behaving this way which makes it so hard to track payment sin BTC from other users as it mingles with already used addressed and the label create for the address does not show on history so it makes it hard to find who send the funds.Anyone experiencing this and is there a fix or a setting I need to change as I look into all and nothing helps.Thanks",

I think it's possible it's just not writing what you've done to its data files.",

Also I use windows 11 and I have plenty of space.It just started to do this by itself without me changing anything at all. I Always had for addresses to never expiry and it always produced a new unique address every time I place a new request and the label always stays on history.Now it just does this and I even noticed a week ago while it was still providing new unique addresses that once I log out and log in again after a day or so if there was a new request that I created but which have not been paid yet, that address would not show on the request tab anymore, which is another thing it never did.... previously any request I would create, it  would always provide an unique BTC address, and would never disappear the list until it received BTC. Now it is just nuts, sometimes those requests disappear even if not used, repeating BTC addresses on new requests, and if a request received a BTC payment shows on history without the label created. Just insane... I tried to revert to version 4.3.1 but software message told me that wallet cannot open previous wallet file due to being too old version... maybe a major update was on 4.3.2... I can still manage things it is just it became a nightmare with the addresses, and tracking and I only can think of waiting for next update.I'm on windows 11 by the way but I think the OS is not the issue.",

The gap is even over a day or two it does not matter, it will always give me a repeated address and it does this in order. For example if I have address A, B, C and D... if I create a new request, it will give me address A again... if I create a new one, then gives me B and so one until D. IN this example only on the fifth request it would finally give me a new address in this case E. And it repeats this loop every time I create a new address and as the address list mounts as you can image the loop just gets bigger until I'm served a new unique address. It's just insane.
