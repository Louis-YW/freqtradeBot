  "content": "It might sound utopia now but if in the country have many PEOPLE who like crypto then the goverment in order to stay in power will need to try to do things what most people support, who does not support this kind of thing? Imagine how many cheap crypto holders are out there so it will make as the \"cryptodog\" mentoined on twitter the crypto holders will be upper latter of society and later on they wil be blamed same way as now rotchilds becouse they are wealthy more wealth then others.But crypto reset specially ownership of real estate like this give all the real estate to cheap coin holdersFor example we take DOGE becouse its cheap.So with 2057,17 you get 30,000 doge.So doge could be new dollar or alternative payment option but dollar value so then you have bought with just 2000$ the 30,000$ dollars.Also same goes for trx xrp xlm and other cheap coins.The cheaper is coin it means the cheaper you can buy the dollar its not the dollar but same value in future.Off course btt is one of the cheapest option to buy new dollar with cheaper price.",

      "body": "I believe mk4 is onto something with the denominations of Bitcoin. We could to satoshis, we could go for mBTCs if people need to have a lot of smaller things to feel better about it. But honestly, I don't think it matters much. I am comfortable with 0.001, 0.002 etc., it doesn't bother me how much less that is than 1. Also, I have a negative association with too much of something because big fiat banknote denominations are a sign of hyperinflation. I think people with thousands of dollars are happier than people with Zimbabwe millions. It's funny from a distance, and it might be the silver lining (you poor but you're a millionaire), but it's still a bad thing.",

It's one of those things where the community in it's entirety have very mixed opinions(different denominations, sticking with \"bitcoin\" but moving the decimal, do nothing, etc) that the discussion will ultimately amount to nothing and with us just sticking with the current denomination. Oh well.",
