  "content": "Hi, Folks, I guess I got scammed too? A few days ago I signed up for Mixabit Bitcoin mixer. It let me deposit coins of course without a problem and even let me withdraw a small coin amount ONCE. Since then for 2 days in a row now, I experience the same.provlem as posted here but with this Mixabit service, not Onion wallet. I try to send coins to different addresses, small or large amounts, and all I get is a blank page (sendbtc.php). It hangs on the blank page for awhile and usually nothing happens. Every once and a while, it comes back with an error that Bitcoin address is missing, which I know I entered.So, is Mixabit a scam service or they are just experiencing technical difficulties? It let me withdraw once after 2 deposits that I made. Might have been to trick me into believing them, of course. I cannot withdraw anything since then for a few days now. Messages to them of course went unanswered.I am pretty sure I used the good url to access it from hidden wiki, etc. If it is still a scam, why would it be promoted and link posted on hiddent wiki, onion links, etc. which are supposed to be \"trusted\" sites, Claiming Mixabit to be one of the best and highly recommended? Does nobody moderate these sites to ensure the links and sites are \"legit\"?I have read that there was a scam sometime back related to Mixabit, but the URL for the scam is not what I was using.Any insights will be appreciated. Thanks.",

I am sorry to read about what happened to you.It has been said many times and should be reiterated here, you really have to carry out due-dilligence whenever sending funds to any website (exchange, mixer, online shop, etc) because they might be using their services as a front in order to scam others.You should have tried Wasabi WalletQuote from: JohnBitCo on August 20, 2022, 11:23:40 PMI would not trust any bitcoin mixer site other than chipmixer which i know because it has a good reputation of this forum. 3rd party review sites are hard to trust as they sometimes give good reviews to a bad project by taking bribe.   Its our money, so we should not deposit in any site unless we are 100% sure of its authenticity.Chipmixer might have a reputation for being reputable but if their website was down from 6th-10th August this year without them even making an announcement to reassure their users, then I think that was a public relations failure on their part.Making a post 4-5 days after their website was offline to say they were back up and running probably would not exactly give confidence to all their users and I would advise those thinking of using Chipmixer to consider alternatives.",

That's really bad from a company like chipmixer to remain silent on this big downtime.Anyways, since you mentioned chipmixer alternatives, do you have some in mind",
