If it can access a lost wallet and recover the lost phrase, the same method can be used to access a user's wallet and retrieve the user's phrase and make off with the user's fund without the users notice. Just like the way the blockchain technology is built, everyone is responsible for their own security, and that's the best. A lost Bitcoin, I believe, is lost forever unless the real owner can be able to remember where he/she misplaced the security to the wallet.",

But on the other side Bitcoin holder are in trouble too as their funds might also be vulnerable and be compromise. Please more answer to do this please.All of the lost bitcoin is lost forever without the private key it is impossible to recover your bitcoin, Usually most of the people who offer ways to recover your bitcoin was a scammer, we all know that all you need is the private key to recover it. Except if you're talking about custodial wallets since you could just contact the support to recover your account etc.I guess it is possible since it's technology, we never know how technology could develop in the future and at some point, they might crack the bitcoin code or any wallets possible. But at the same time, security could keep up with the technology. If somehow they find a way to it, it might be the end of bitcoin since it already crack and there's always a possibility of accessing your bitcoin and taking your funds at that point since they can access a wallet without even the need of the seed phrase or private key or just calculating the possible combination of your privatekey.",

But for sure there's tech to save your private keys and seed but for restoring it would be a miracle to save what's lost. It's like you've revive the dead.

Please more answer to do this please.So far what still makes sense is that without a personal phrase or key then nothing can be done but to let the amount of bitcoin be buried. But talking about the future with any technological sophistication can happen, it's just that it will be opposed by many people even though the purpose is to help but will have an impact on the stability of Bitcoin that has been easily lost by certain parties for negative purposes.Say someone has found the tool and can restore the missing bitcoin, instead of publishing it, so I am sure that people will save it for themselves.",

If it should be allowed it means that blockchain is no longer safe to store assets and as far as I am concerned, this is the beauty of blockchain which no one can ever comprehend. Only you should have access or know the private key to your wallet and if it happens otherwise that their is a breach or loss of private keys,  your assets  are all gone. Now tell me if it happens that a private key predictor is developed in the sense that any wallet been imported it opens up immediately do you think your wallet and assets would be safe?",

Please more answer to do this please.I believe Bitcoin will no longer exist if this technology will be available in the future because this only means that they can access any Bitcoin wallet using the technology they are using. We know how innovation develops fast and those impossible things before is now possible. I will never remove the chance for having this kind of technology in the future because I believe humanity usually pursue to discover the current impossible things. But again. Bitcoin in general will be in danger if this technology invented because all assets is not safe anymore.",

If eventually you meet someone claiming that they have devices or means to help you recover your wallet with the use of private key or your secret phrases just have it in the back of your mind that they want to scam you or do something malicious to you or to your system and we do have alot of them out there.",

You may either loose access to your bitcoins or you loose your bitcoins to theft. For both situations I do not think that you should be in expectation that a technology will come soon to be able to recover access or recover bitcoins when locked out or lost to hackers respectively. As someone who has bitcoins, you focus should be how to not just to buy bitcoins, but also how to keep your seed phrase safe and your bitcoins away from hackers.

The popular notion is that lots of lost bitcoins will be recovered if their public keys are known, because it is believed that the public key to private key reversal will someday be possible, within then next 20-30 years. This reversal will only happen to lost coins, because long before it becomes possible, we will have moved our coins to cryptographically stronger scripts. However, lost coins (with public keys known) will most likely not return to their real owners. Other lost coins, which only have a RIPEMD-160 hash revealed, will take much longer to move (if ever), and isn't even a concern.",
