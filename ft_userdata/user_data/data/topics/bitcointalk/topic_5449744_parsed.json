  "content": "I saw a token in my wallet which I suspected could be a fake one. On visiting Coinmarketcap to check if the contract address on Coinmarketcap is the same as the one in my wallet, I noticed there was a difference. But that was not the problem, what bothered me most was the striking resemblance of the two contract addresses. There is some noticeable frightening resemblance:Token Name: CryptoGPTBlockchain: Binance Smart Chain Original Contract Address (from Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cryptogpt/): 0x153c0c947177e631e3dfc594ba28750d3a921fb5  https://bscscan.com/address/0x153c0c947177e631e3dfc594ba28750d3a921fb5 Fake Contract Address (Fake token sent to my wallet): 0x513C285CD76884acC377a63DC63A4e83D7D21fb5  https://bscscan.com/address/0x513c285cd76884acc377a63dc63a4e83d7d21fb5 On comparing the two:  you notice the last five digits of the two addresses are the same. There is also some similarity on the four digits after the 0x at the beginning of the addresses.  Also there is a ‘77’ somewhere between the addresses. The striking resemblance marvelled me and I decided to share this experience to alert both newbies and experienced. Interacting with a malicious token may lead to loss of tokens in your wallet. Please share your comments. Perhaps some of you already have such experience?",

If you think about it, isn't it such a waste of knowledge and talent?Anyway, I never knew that you can now generate addresses that are similar to other addresses. I used to think that addresses being generated per wallet are completely random.  And depending on how the contract was coded/created, this may be just a prank and also a study to record data on how effective it would be to use as phishing and stealing crypto online.

Hence, the best thing in this case would be making sure that we end up with a proper security of our own. Your mind is your own best security, obviously tools and software and better protected websites are all great, but when it comes down to security, your mind is the best one. How? Because if you end up protecting yourself from these silly attacks and fakes, then you would be able to do a lot better.
