  "content": "Hi, this is KJ. I am a Ph.D. candidate from the University of Liverpool.I am proposing a useful PoW without replacing Nakamoto Consensus. I named it Economic Proof of Work (EcoPoW).I have talked about this algorithm to several experts in Blockchain, including Dr. Jiaping Wang, Dr. Qi Chen from MSRA, Dr. XiaoKang Mo, Prof. Xi Chen from NYU, and received positive feedback. It is relatively simple to understand if you are familiar with PoW and Proof of Replication (PoRep).EcoPoW uses PoW as an encoding algorithm during the PoW outputs consensus. As the consensus uses the left bits of the hash output binary (the more 0s, the more difficulty), the encoding algorithm uses the right N bits. When N=8, we encode 1 byte at a time (around 256 sha2 hashes to encode 8 bits). Since N is adjustable, we can change the difficulty of encoding, such as 2 bytes a time (around 65536 hashes to encode 16 bits ). The encoding is expensive as designed, and decoding is cheap as it only takes one hash operation.The reason we need to use PoW as an encoding algorithm is that the computation can be used for Proof of Replication. It is the key algorithm for blockchain storage, such as Filecoin.Filecoin uses PoRep for user data security against Outsourcing Attacks.The core idea of PoRep is to encode the user file's original content into a unique replication with their unique name as a key (a public key can be used as the key). When verifying, the prover needs to compute the proof from the replication instead of the original content. Even the prover can perform an Outsourcing Attack by fetching the replication from others and decoding in seconds, and he still needs a lot of computation and time to encode the decoded content with his name into his unique replication. This prevents the Outsourcing Attacks as it is cheaper to keep the replication honestly on his storage device.After diving into the research, once the PoW is useful, there are some important impacts: 1. The miners are making money by selling their computation and storage resources. The coins are not the only revenue source for the miners.2. Once the computation is consumed locally, miners will no longer sell the computation to the mining pool to exchange the coins. It will bring true decentralization to the blockchain world.3. The PoW computation is task-based. If there is no demand, the computer will go to sleep mode to save energy.We propose to build a blockchain with storage and EcoPoW.",

If there is no demand, the computer will go to sleep mode to save energy.I think the last part here is key to building a proof-of-work based consensus without all the energy consumption.At some point in the blockchain economy, when the (logarithmic) price curve crosses the corresponding curve for difficulty - possibly with some adjustments because price and difficulty are not 1:1 - it will make no sense to throw additional hashpower to the network.So when such a situation happens, which I'm guessing will be after a few decades, ASIC vendors can include a \"sleep mode\" with Wake-on-LAN feature so that a pool can wake up the miner when the difficulty reaches a certain threshold.My suggestion won't lower existing energy usage, but puts a \"soft cap\" on the energy use without the need for a soft fork.Is there a link to the research paper of EcoPoW?",

Nobody would say that a car factory wastes energy to run their machines either, right? You are minting new coins and expending energy for that; I don't understand why so many people believe this is wrong.Secondly, also conceptually, adding a secondary use to your mining, such as using the heat or using an algorithm that performs 'useful' computations - since all of this has monetary value, you just extract more money out of the same energy, i.e. just increasing the efficiency of your gear. This means everyone will do it, the power consumption will not drop and the difficulty just goes up a little.",

Filecoin uses PoRep for user data security and PoS for consensus.Proof of Space (PoSpace/PoC) is a replacement for PoW. It outputs consensus but no useful user data on disk. It uses computation to pre-generate a lot of trash data on disk. After pre-generation, there are less energy cost for the consensus generation.
