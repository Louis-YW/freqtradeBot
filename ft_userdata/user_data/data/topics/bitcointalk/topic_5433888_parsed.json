  "content": "QuoteKatrina Bookman was playing the slots at the Resorts World Casino in Jamaica, Queens when she secured what would have been the largest slot machine jackpot in US history - $42,949,672 (£35.4m). She took a selfie with the machine to mark the moment, and later said her whole body went 'numb' when she saw the life-changing figure. Bookman was told to come back the next day to discuss her winnings, but when she asked an employee what she'd be walking away with, he responded: \"You didn't win nothing.\" The New York State Gaming Commission said Bookman’s machine had malfunctioned, and that she'd actually won just $2.25 (£1.86).The machine had a disclaimer stating 'malfunctions void all pays and plays', and as a result the commission said that they were required by law to give Bookman only what she'd actually won.Source: https://www.unilad.com/community/woman-won-43-million-offered-steak-dinner-instead-055644-20230108Some Casinos are just plain fraudulent. So this woman visited a casino, play slot and won $43million. She took a selfie with the amount displayed on the machine. The casino saw it and told her to return the next day so they could talk about the winnings. Next day she returned. Story changed. She was told the machine had malfunctioned and therefore it was what was responsible for the winnings. They went ahead to offer her a complimentary steak dinner. I got so livid reading this story.Isn't this just the stupidest reason not to give her her winnings?Couldn't they have known that their so-called machine was faulty before letting gamblers use it?How could they do this to her?",

Maybe the woman can file a complaint against the casino or even check if the machine is faulty or not, but who knows what could've they done to the machine after she won since she was asked to return the next day. In case the machine is faulty, everything in their casino should be checked since they will always use this excuse to avoid paying winnings.",

If it was a customer that played and lost his/her $42m to the machine would they have inspected the machine in question? That's the problem with casinos that don't have enough resources but just want to keep running the company so that they can keep draining money from their customers or from gamblers that use their service. At least they could have compensated her with some cash even if it's just $5000 from the $42m that would have been better.",

Also I doubt they've been forced to repay anything gambled on it for however long it malfunctioned.If they didn't know it was malfunctioning the actual amount she won was very low compared to what the casino could likely afford so I think they should've been forced to pay a higher amount (at least around $30-300k or the maximum that could be won on that machine depending on the size of the venue).",

At least gamblers would be able to know thier rights and privilege. The slot machine has a disclaimer that voids all wins if it malfunctions. But how would the firm prove that the machine has fault? Would they not hide behind slot machine problems to deny genuine winners thier funds?  I think the woman should seek legal advice and look for various means to recover her win. She is not to blame for the machine malfunctioning. If she has lost a huge bet due to the machine's problems, would they have recognized that the machine caused her loss? They would have concealed it and go on with thier operations.",

The casino cannot say that \"the machine was broken, you did not win anything\" this must be proven.In addition, I was struck by the fact that she went home to \"come back tomorrow and discuss the winnings.\" I understand that she was in shock, but you can't do that.",

Instead of paying an almost 43$ million jackpot they offer a steak dinner to compensate the gambler! What a shame this story is. If the slots had a malfunction it's none of the gamblers' business. The casino is responsible for it. And since the machine was disponible for playing and the gambler has won, it's their duty to pay the prize the machine displays. I think it's funny this kind of malfunction never happens for the other side. When a gambler loses there are no malfunctions with machines. It's purely lack of luck.Another advantage for crypto casinos: provably fair feature, so you aren't going to hear your payment is going to be denied because the machines weren't working properly.",

But if the roles were to be switched, the woman would be extremely persecuted by the casino, they may even press charges against her. In that regard, I think the woman should file a case against the casino to force them one way or another to pay her the supposed winnings or damage fees if ever. Casinos have become very confident these days especially live ones in taking advantage of their customers' already weak stance, thus situations like these are more common. What an insult by the way, to tell her that she only one 2 euros and then offer her a dinner instead of actually giving her the winnings.",

I doubt a luxury casino such as Resorts World Casino in Jamaica, Queens will ruin their reputation just for that case. Although my assumption will depend if the court settle the case properly without an under-the-table agreement or any related to corruption just to win the case in favor of the women. Because for me, if that casino is not true to its word, they should bribe the women instead as offering a dinner will make them seem to do dirty plays in the public.",
