Actually this is a bit late, but I warn you that impersonators have a hobby of being a reputable trader. You should not move if you have good experience trading in previous forum.Sorry for your losses",

Based on current evidence hard to tag though I am assuming it was a scam. Why should you trust random users without good trading history? Why you hadn't used the escrow service? A lot of scammers around the forum, just be careful and learn from the mistakes.",

Why you hadn't used the escrow service? A lot of scammers around the forum, just be careful and learn from the mistakes.It's a beginner's mistake, they don't realize that trusting random people about money is wrong. Without escrow everything falls apart unless the seller is really a trusted person based on his reputation. The OP should learn in the future no matter how much the money is worth, he should try to have escrow to handle his trades if done with random people.",
