      "body": "ATTENTIONThis is most likely a scam. Anyone thinking of buying Verified paxful accounts may end up losing the money the used to purchase the account plus the funds in the account1. Accounts are mostly likely hacked or stolen and at one point in time the owner may try to recover their account, and you get locked out since he can provide valid KYC and you won't be able to2. Paxful may freeze your funds and ask for further verification, in future of which you will present documents that don't match the original information. Your account can then be blocked with the funds.",
