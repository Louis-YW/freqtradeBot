This option can be specified multiple times to connect to multiple nodes.The above is a description of Bitcoin connection options. What is the maximum number of times the connection is used？in other words，How many nodes can a node connect at the same time？Question 2If I have an IP address of a node, can I obtain the IP addresses of all nodes connected to this node？",

This option can be specified multiple times to connect to multiple nodes.The above is a description of Bitcoin connection options. What is the maximum number of times the connection is used？in other words，How many nodes can a node connect at the same time？The default number of connections (nodes) Bitcoin Core works with is 125: 10 outbound and 115 inbound.This number is big - leads to a lot of traffic - and, depending on your internet plan you may want to adjust.Normally the peer nodes are \"harvested\" from the network, but you can add with addnode \"fallback nodes\" you may want to be sure you connect to (see here)From the way I understand these numbers, I think that the answer to your intended question may be 10.Quote from: ywnasdzkd on October 06, 2022, 09:42:02 AMQuestion 2If I have an IP address of a node, can I obtain the IP addresses of all nodes connected to this node？Nope.",

      "body": "In regards to your second question, you can only obtain the IP addresses of nodes connected to your own node, by inspecting peers.dat. Collecting those of other IP addresses requires you to build a custom version of Core that dumps peer gossip output to a JSON file or something similar.",
