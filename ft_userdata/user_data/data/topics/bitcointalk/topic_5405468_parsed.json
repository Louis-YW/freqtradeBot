The question is, is this asset of yours not released first, dude? I hope it's a miracle that you get that amount you're talking about again.",

And where did you exactly downloaded this tronlink wallet?The image you provided above is a different wallet compared to Tronlink available on Playstore.There's a possibility that you've been scammed by someone who give you a link with the fake wallet and forcing you to deposit to unfreeze your wallet.",
