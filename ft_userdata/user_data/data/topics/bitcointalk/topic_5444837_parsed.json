  "content": "Planting a tree and investing in bitcoins should wait a certain period of time.To plant a tree, first buy it from the market.  Then you have to plant.  Then the tree slowly grew and its branches grew.  Nothing can come from that tree without waiting for a long time.  After planting a tree, one has to wait for 5-7 years to get any yield from the tree. And if patience is lost before that, if the tree is cut down, then nothing much can come from the tree.So we should wait a long time like planting a tree.  Similarly we have to wait by investing Bitcoin.But we know what Bitcoin used to be and what it is now.  It will be bigger in the future.  So don't we think about the future?  Of course I will.  Invest in Bitcoin with the future in mind.For example, a tree bears fruit after a long period of time.  Bitcoin will also fulfill our hopes.  So those who are or will be investing in Bitcoin will have to wait a little longer.  And the result of waiting will be beautiful.  Good luck to you.  thank you",

Satoshi Nakamoto initiated it and early adopters did hardest jobs for us including you. The adoption of Bitcoin in comparisons with Internet users, world population show that how fast Bitcoin adoption is.Your task now is only hop on the boat, join the trend and wait to harvest.QuoteNothing can come from that tree without waiting for a long time.  After planting a tree, one has to wait for 5-7 years to get any yield from the tree. And if patience is lost before that, if the tree is cut down, then nothing much can come from the tree.With Bitcoin, you won't have to wait 5 or 7 years. It has a halving cycle that appears every four year. The last halving happened in 2020 and now we are in 2023, one more year till its next halving. I don't think you have to wait more than 2 more years to harvest sweet profit if you buy Bitcoin today and are able to hold it for a while (about 2 years).",

I think to wait 5 or 7 years is a very long time.They always say HODL for as long as you can, but nobody tells you how long you are expected to HODL, you decide that yourself, that is how long you intend to HODL and your target. For some people 5-7years is just fine and okay to HODL, but maybe not to everyone. If you can actually plant a tree to mark the duration of HODLing from planting to maturation of the tree, that can work and help you in your discipline. Just pick the tree you want if you have a space for it, some trees take a year, some two, others three and so on to maturation, Pick your tree and do some planting, planting trees are even advised.",

That's what the people that I've talked to for a lot of years have explained and even my mother when she's teaching me how to invest. I'm glad that there were those people that have opened my eyes to investing and fortunately, I fell in love with investing and that's through bitcoin. It requires a lot of patience and you don't have to rush anything upon investing in it. There's a certain time that we need to do nothing and sometimes that we need to take actions like taking some profits or selling in losses to cut more potential losses that are about to come. As we plant(buy) right now, it's known to many that holding it is worth it and it's not just me and you that have experienced how effective it was but many, the majority of bitcoin holders knew it.",

They must to have home and necessary money to live and survive before they can invest.And I also adhere to this opinion, before you start investing you need to ensure a comfortable standard of living, and only after that start investing.Because the creation of capital requires discipline, because for this you need to be able to save. But this should be done with pleasure, when you have everything you need for a comfortable life, then it will not be difficult to save money when you do not have to deny yourself something.Before all this can be provided, a lot of time may pass, but it will be right, than if you denied yourself something necessary, lived in poor housing, and walked in old clothes, all this would eventually bother you and you might quit it's about saving and investing.

Bitcoin has to \"sprout\" in your wallet in order to bear the \"fruits\" of the investment, and this will take time. 5-7 months is not enough here, and \"growth\" will take more than one year.
