  "content": "Hello everyone,I came across this hypothesis on a finance forum.I'll share it with you and ask for your suggestions, advice, comments, etc.Thank you!Let’s start here:Bitcoin was originally conceived as a peer-to-peer currency project. However, it seems to have failed in that purpose for various reasons (such as limited scalability, among others). Today, few believe BTC can be taken as legal tender currency. In my view, the best definition of Bitcoin is this: BTC is a \"thing\" that, in a digital environment (where money is information and thus potentially infinitely replicable), can be transferred across space and time without intermediaries and in a censorship-resistant way. Its value is solely determined by the relationship between demand and it solves the \"double spending\" problem through the shared and distributed ledger and through the immutability of the timechain.1) Governments disapprove of BTC's self-proclaimed role as money (=legal tender currency). According to governments, Legale tender currency must remain their prerogative due to the obvious advantages this provides. Governments pay their employees in legal tender currency, they claim taxes in their own legal tender currency , and, even when issuing government bonds, they seek monetary flows in their currency (except in cases where they negotiate long-term loans with the IMF in exchange for reforms, but that’s outside our scope here). Additionally, something whose price continuously fluctuates based on user demand and offer cannot truly be considered legal tender currency. This argument underpins the reasoning of governments (of course, the value of fiat currencies also fluctuates in the forex market, but that's another matter; similarly, GOLD’s value, which until 1971 underpinned USD with a declared 1:1 ratio, is also free to fluctuate based on supply and demand).2) Realistically speaking, there is always a strong complicity between governments and central banks in maintaining a system that, by design, devalues currency by artificially expanding its supply, increasingly decoupled from its underlying assets. This allows governments to ease their debt exposure to holders of government bonds and perpetuate their habit of contracting public debt, trusting that such debt will largely be held by their citizens.3) For several months now, there has been a \"movement\" by governments to regulate BTC. The narrative of \"drug traffickers' currency\" has completely faded. In 2024, the SEC approved the existence of spot BTC ETFs. Trump speaks of it positively, China maintains a \"fake ban\", there’s no hostility towards crypto in Saudi Arabia, and many petrodollars are being used to buy crypto, the European MiCA regulation is now in force, BlackRock suggest BTC as \"flight to quality\", some companies are beginning to explore holding a portion of their treasury in BTC, and BTC has a market cap of around $2 trillion without a marketing department. All of this suggests that traditional finance is starting to accept BTC, treating it as a unique asset despite resistance from the banking sector (which has already been using technology very similar to the timechain for years).4) Moreover, those who own BTC tent go hold it (exchanges have been emptied....) reflecting the tendency to offload depreciating currency and retain value-preserving assets, at least in the eyes of those who own both.5) Now, some Governments are quite willing —and already doing so— to tax BTC capital gains like any other financial instrument. In Italy, there’s talk of a 42% tax rate (borderline unconstitutional, but we won’t get into that here).What are the possible outcomes of this situation?I foresee the following evolution over a 4-8 year time frame. Since BTC can either be a Store of Value or a lkegal tender Currency, but not both (just as physical GOLD cannot serve as both simultaneously but has historically alternated between these roles at different points in its millennia-long history), I argue that it is possible, and even likely, that Governments will accept — if price volatility stabilizes — that BTC naturally evolves into a Store of Value to prevent it from being used as Legal Tender Currency. Governments perceive its use as Currency to be far more disadvantageous for two reasons:A) The technological \"DNA\" of BTC allows anyone, with a relatively low educational threshold, to acquire BTC pseudonymously and own an asset that is, effectively, non-confiscatable because it isn’t held by third parties (unlike large quantities of GOLD);B) Governments need and will always need the ability to act on the differential between the underlying asset and monetary supply, which is not possible with BTC unless the protocol is changed by the majority of nodes (currently a few thousand worldwide, with no interest in making such changes).Indirect Consequences?Governments will accept that (lucky) BTC holders — those who keep it on Hardware Wallets — will end up with an asset of very high value and less prone to volatility than today. Such an asset could then be used as collateral for loans aimed at setting up business devoted to generate what BTC is unable to create: cash flows (including government bonds).The final considerations should sound like this:The more indebted governments are, the more likely it is that BTC will become Store of Value (SOV).Thank you for your thoughts, and I apologize if some parts are unclear.",

      "body": "Bitcoin can be whatever you want it to be. That's why I find it so funny when, for example, Roger Ver talks about how bitcoin was hijacked. Hijacked from who? It's not like it was yours and people got together and took it from you. You stood behind the group who wanted bigger blocks but the majority went the Segwit route. It's easy to see which proposal won.Bitcoin is now a store of value and property rather than a currency. People hold it and speculate on the value to increase in the future. Perhaps this will change in the upcoming years, but Bitcoin will have to change with it. Its first layer doesn't scale enough for it to be the first-choice money of an economy. The fees are occasionally too high and that doesn't help. The Lightning Network is a semi-finished product that never reached its full potential. Hardware and storage aren't as expensive as they once were, perhaps it's time to think about first-layer scaling again. We can't play the \"it's going to affect decentralization\" card forever.",

      "body": "Quote from: Pmalek on December 15, 2024, 08:11:31 AMBitcoin can be whatever you want it to be.   Not sure about it. In actual monetary system, it is impossible that you can consider the \"same thing\" as SOV (Store of Value) AND as Legal Tender Currency. As the first underpins the second. The first can has few price variations, but the second cannot.  Of course, Satoshi has said the BTC is a \"cash system\". But it is clear that BTC is can be considered as SOV. Why? it can move value without duplicate it. Before the raising of Information Age, there was no risk of duplicate values, as the transaction was physically done. When duplication risk raises, BTC solves that problem. Moreover, transactions are impossibile to be stopped by an Authority. Quote from: Pmalek on December 15, 2024, 08:11:31 AM Its first layer doesn't scale enough for it to be the first-choice money of an economy. That is a good point, that fits with my argument. Governments say: See, my friend, it is impossibile that BTC will be taken as Legal Tender Currency. It is too slow, and I can ban it, as you know.......Btc holders should say: You right, but BTC has also some good features. What about to take it as Store of Value and to put it into Monetary Reserve? Otherwise I will wait that the developers will build a second layer.......Governments say: Wait, wait, wait. Really? So Am i asked to decide if ban it or accept it? No way.......Btc holders should say: You do, my friend, you do......... And because you can stop it.....make your decision. Soon, please.  (Sorry for my poor English)EDIT: the centralization risk on second layer, in my knowledge, is a false risk. But I have to focus on it in order to have more strong opinion.",

Back to the scalability issue, we all saw bitcoin's scalability limitations back when banana-monkey tokens were the hit. I am talking about Runes, Ordinals, and the like. That mania was enough to put a stop on the normal use of bitcoin. Could you still make transactions? Sure, you could, but you had to pay $10, $20, or perhaps $50 per UTXO if you wanted a confirmation. If inscription fans can cause that amount of problems, what should we expect if bitcoin became a P2P digital tender and hundreds of millions of new users entered the market, making transactions every day? Not that I believe that's going to happen in major economies because world governments will never give up their right to print as much money as they need.",

If you don't want volatilty, store your wealth in cash, but remember that cash decreases in its purchasing power.If you tolerate volatility, but not too much, store your wealth in gold because gold increases in price with time, and less volatility than Bitcoin.If you tolerate high volatility, accept bigger risk, choose Bitcoin to store your wealth.Gold, cash can not compare with Bitcoin in ROI.
