You can get yourself a  copper member account  to enable you to post your ANN in a well-detailed format with images, preferable, where most of your recently listed casinos could also be included.Your website has a nice view from what I can see, but I just have a few questions:1. What's in it for you in this project?2. How do you select the casinos that you list? Is it by paid application or recommendation?3. What method do you use in making your rating? Do you gather information from around the web, or do you make your rating of which casino is the best based on their popularity?And if sites are to pay in order for them to get listed on your CasinoX, would that also be another means for you to base your trust rating on who is willing to pay the highest amount?",

The design and theme is very good that makes browsing experience really comfortable fo the reader. I just find the categories on the sidebar almost useless since most of the casino nowadays offers full casino(sportsbook, live games and slot) that makes this categories shows same set of casino. I think you can just include the games offers on the casino descriptions review to save space on the category section.Also start adding popukar casino here in the forum like Duelbits since you are announcing here in the forum.",

As you responded to the previous comment of Nwada00, you listed those casinos on voluntary and not on negotiation and on one stand, you are promoting those casinos in the net, which is a nice thing to the casinos. Are you going to add more to that list or not? You can also do well to upgrade your ANN thread as others suggested. I also welcome you to the forum, as a newbie read the forum rules so do well with your services.",

If so then why have you added only 4 casinos and all of them are listed under every tab that is:1. Best Online Casino2. Live Dealer Casino3. Welcome Bonus. 4. Real Money Casino5. Crypto Casino6. Anonymous CasinoThe categories are really nice but all of them are showing the results. I hope you will update them with the proper filtering criteria. There is already one competition for you, and one user has posted an extensive and detailed website where you can have such filters and it has more than hundreds of casinos. Hope you keep your spark and make it to the high-quality reference website.",

The platform's design is engaging, and the in-depth evaluations are a terrific resource for casino fans, making browsing easyYour project's goals and mechanics intrigue me. How do you choose casinos to list? Do they apply or get recommended? Are your evaluations based on online data or casino popularity? What's the relationship between payment and listing in your trust ratings?Since most modern casinos offer full services, the side-bar categories might be refined. This may be simplified by include game offers in review descriptions. As you've announced in the thread, adding popular casinos like Duelbits may be a good ideaGood luck with CasinoX, a casino player's guidance",

I have checked your site and it looks nice and colourful,I wish you all the best in this your project and your service will help gamblers.Just like other review sites, they are trying to get some affiliates as when you click the Play button on their site, it will direct you to their affiliate link.So the more users will use their link, and with active accounts, the better for them as they will get some commission from it depending on the site's terms with affiliate commission.Compiling and making your own reviews will be a tedious job if they will really put their effort on this. But it will be rewarding if people start trusting your site.It means, people will gonna use their affiliate link and they will get passive income out of this. However, this work is continuous as they need to build a good reputation among gamblers. Not a half-hearted reviews but as much as possible, a comprehensive one where you won't get such info from other review sites.",
