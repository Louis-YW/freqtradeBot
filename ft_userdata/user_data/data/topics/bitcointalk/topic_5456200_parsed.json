The problem is how to approach it in accordance with their awareness and development, at a young age to be aware of the surrounding social environment, and instead give positive information about money as well as ways of life Bitcoin helps raise the male religion as a support tool. But self-made games and bitcoin sticker rewards, or btc-revised hero story books, I see that as an idea, finding comics I think will be difficult, and instead It's creative on its own, making everything about the market more familiar to children, and don't over-press complicated knowledge to them.",

There are numerous instances where influential concepts are introduced to young minds through comic books or other forms of entertainment literature. Introducing children to Bitcoin might facilitate a more accessible understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.I stumbled upon this on the internet: https://bitcoincomic.org/. The website offers Bitcoin comics in both digital and paper formats. They are available in five different languages: English, Spanish, Russian, Korean, and Brazilian.And here is the link to an Amazon store that sells the Bitcoin Comic: Amazone . The price is $8.99.",

Easy Peasy Finance for Kids and BeginnersThe World’s First Kids Cartoon about Bitcoin!These videos will surely help those children that you're going to talk about Bitcoin. It's much easier to learn if there are visuals and graphics that they can see while hearing what the discussion is all about. There are more of them so while you're still searching for those books or comics or any material that you plan to have, you can have a watch party with them through these videos and there's a lot more. That's only few from the many that's existing on these streaming websites.",

Your intention is creative and I like it because it is cheap to implement. I also use to read cartoon books while growing up and I find them very entertaining and impactful. Some of our role models and superheroes were cartoon characters. I am sure you can get many of them if you do some research and fortunately you have started getting responses from forum members. I am hopeful that this your approach will teach them about bitcoin in a simple and entertaining manner. You should also go through the cartoon book before giving it out to the children to ensure that they are void of misinformation.",

It was our generation that read book, current generation prefer gadgets and if we want to teach them something unusual, we must play on their rules.No matter how interesting book is, a simple offer «lets go read a book» or «lets go I will read you a book» isnt accepted. While reading, kid will be «flying away, dreaming» and thinking what he would do first when he get his mobile or tablet.",

Usually this is widely available on the Amazon marketplace, like many people show, there are several variations that I'm looking for there, maybe if you want to surprise your sibling, that would be very appropriate, let alone introduce bitcoin from an early age, although I know that on average, most young children don't like the concept bitcoin cartoon.I think what @tabas shared is clear enough with the cartoon videos that are made and you can easily click and let your siblings watch easily on YouTube instead of comics having to buy first, but it depends on your decision whether it is in the form comics or other stories that are on the Internet.",

You cannot force children to got an interest in bitcoin at early stage because for sure they will be more interested on cartoons and other fun activities. Maybe let them reached at the right aged where they can think clearly for their selves and their future since for that for sure they might get interest to earn money by trying their luck on bitcoin. But if there are young people in your area which you see have potential to learn about this things then help them by grabbing some helpful bitcoin.educational videos since this is more cheaper option and you may have good visualization to make them understand easily about the topics you want to discuss.",

There's been a lot of controversy about bitcoin education for kids lately, and I know that everyone has their own opinion. But for me, this age is still unsuitable for knowing about money, bitcoin, they have more to learn than focus on bitcoin and finance too early.

You're trying to take away their childhood from them by introducing them to Bitcoin at this tender age. 7–11 years aren't even teenagers. Don't force kids to learn this stuff except it's a part of their school curriculum and the education board will know how best to introduce it to them. There are still a hell lot of adults who don't know anything about Bitcoin. You can evangelize to those ones. Late Michael Jackson found fame as a kid around 5 years or so and lost his childhood to it. He couldn't live a proper life as an adult and that was why we had him act around kids in his adulthood.",

Until now I have never heard or seen about a comic book that contains bitcoin stories. Because maybe no comic writer is interested in bringing up the story about bitcoin. Because maybe bitcoin is currently only widely known by adults, so no comic writer has the idea to make a picture story about bitcoin. Maybe in the future if someone makes a comic about bitcoin, maybe it can be something very unique and will be useful for the spread of bitcoin at an early age. So your idea of ​​giving comic book gifts to your siblings who are still children is indeed a very wise idea. Because if you manage to find a comic about bitcoin and give it away, I'm sure it will more or less have a good impact on the child's future.
