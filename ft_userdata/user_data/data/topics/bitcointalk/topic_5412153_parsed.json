Most are actually centralized and ponzi schemes but most of the newbies are made to believe they are a sort decentralized financial freedom. They are money making schemes so obviously they don't care about security.I fee l pity for people who fall for such useless schemes that have no future.",

      "body": "There are some cases where the frontend issue is mainly due to the third-party problem, which is pretty ironic if they claim it as decentralized. Overall, if we take a look at how DeFi platform keeps popping up, on the other hand, the hacking incident also keeps showing up, it does indicate something. A lot of builders keep building DeFi while ignoring the security concern over the history of the incident that has been known, it indicates the ignorance of the DeFi's builders. A mass market of DeFi, really make each own platform become fast-paced, and here is where it is wrong where some platform is sacrificing their own security.",

While the banks that have the highest securities are also becoming a victim of hacking and not just their system but also social reengineering is happening to their users. While for these Defi platforms, they've got the money of their users, and yet they're settling for less tight security. And, it should be a continuous update for their security to avoid being outdated where the hackers can penetrate.",
