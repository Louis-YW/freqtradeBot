  "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) slumped further on Wednesday ahead of a widely anticipated interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve later in the day.BTC is trading at $21,200- down 4% in the past 24 hours. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has plummeted 30% since last week after a higher-than-expected U.S. inflation reading.Focus now turns to how the token could react to a Fed rate hike later in the day. BTC had tumbled when the Fed raised rates in early-May, and likely faces a similar capitulation this time.Technical indicators show BTC is primed to sink as low as $13,000 if this downtrend continues. Broader uncertainty over the crypto industry is also causing weakness in the token.BTC capitulated over 8% after the Fed raised rates on May 4. It then went on to slump another 28% to as low as $28,000 in the next week, as a crypto rout intensified.Last time, the Fed raised rates by 50 basis points (bps). Now, given the heated inflation figures, traders are positioning for a 75 bps hike by the central bank, according to data from CME Group. It would be the Fed’s sharpest hike in recent history.Source: https://coingape.com/can-bitcoin-btc-crash-to-13k-after-the-fed-rate-hike/",

I'm not sure what's wrong with that, seems to be a UI problem as I have plenty of dust TRX for the purpose of selling that off.So I won't have to worry abut my bills until at least late July or so",

But the thing with crypto is that we can bounce back even if it crash to $13k.And $13k is a big possibility, I mean we hit $17k already and then a recovery to $20k-$21k. The market though is very sensitive at the moment, any negative news will put selling pressure so it's better to brace ourselves the possibility that we haven't seen the bottom yet.",

A lower rate would have bumped us all up, a higher one probably would jave lost us another 10%.Only problem now is what the next hike will be. Still can't quite tell what the market is expecting, and what it will then price in but half a point seems the consensus for July.Once more... Meet expectations and we will be okay for now. But yeah anything else could resurface in the weeks until then. So fragile right now...",

Already today we see the S&P again rebounding from oversold conditions along with Bitcoin finding buyers below $20K all the while Gold is failing to hold it's 50 Week MA, indicating that it may well turn bearish if it falls much lower. I think if BTC is to drop much lower it would be later in the year, towards the end of it, only after a rebound to $30K, even $40K to $50K. It might also only happen if this bearish sentiment continues, or we see a black swan capitulation even like in March 2020. Otherwise, Bitcoin may just remain bearish until the end of the year while otherwise trading sideways between $20K and $30K.",

Well said, though I do see the domino affect here. People anticipating a rate hike creates a small correction, the small correction leads to liquidations, liquidations leads to insolvencies & collapses, etc. The irony being that a lot of selling (if not most) since $40K down to $20K was caused by Luna (LFG), Celsius and 3AC, rather than long-term holders. At least what triggered the aggressive sell-off.Although price dropped 75% from ATH, this does seem similar to May 2021 when price dropped in half due to how over-leveraged the market was to the upside (like CEL/3AC). Despite market conditions being more favourable back then, price did double in value within the space of a few months after just a couple of months of consolidation. The question is whether BTC prices can hold $20K for a couple of months I think.",

I don't think we need to wait for the next Fed hike for Bitcoin to crash much since there is a lot of crypto business is already crumbling due to the current bear market. I think this downtrend will continue and bad news will pile up since many crypto company especially defi will now gonna exit scam while there still a value in the market. This crash is inevitable but it is essential to build a new organic uptrend movement. We just need to brace ourselves on wha is coming in the following weeks or months.",
