Why do I say that, because the current supply of bitcoin is already and is almost approaching 21 million, maybe there are only 2.5 million left for all the bitcoin supply to be on the market. Of course, the influence of the halving is no longer very significant on price increases. And only mass adoption and use in the real world can influence prices because the more bitcoins are bought or used, the more demand there will be.I'm sure this time Bitcoin's halving will still be able to print ATH.",

      "body": "It’s always a trend that when bitcoin halving occurs the bitcoin price increases and always surpasses the exiting ATH. There are many halving count down timers on different site, timers are usually not correlated or exactly correct because of the divergence in the time used to mine a block. So as such the only genuine or accurate timer is that the halving period happen, 210,000 blocks apart from each other and the next halving is at block 840,000. The time usually varies but the difference isn’t that much from the ones calculated from by this timers except if there is a huge hashrate changes which will still need to Happen every 2016 blocks since the difficulty target will adjust each of those time. Here are some of the timers on different sites Quote from: ImThour on June 21, 2022, 03:22:26 AM1. BuyBitcoinWorldwide - 2 April, 20242. Binance Academy - 30 April, 20243. Gate.io - 3 May, 20244. CoinGecko - 4 May, 20245. BitcoinBlockHalf - 4 May, 20246. Nicehash  - 31 May, 20247. CoinmarketCap - 1 June, 20248. CoinWarz - 3 June, 2024Although after the halving the price is expected to increase but no one is so sure of when, and say such my advice to investors entering their first halving is to never buy more than they can afford to hodl for long time. Do not get carried away with greed of price increase and invest too much. The trend could change this time around and we might not see any change of price significantly for almost a year or even more.",

It can make it quicker or slower this time but if you have it in mind, you will be able to take profit around all time high price.I know investment relates to time and each investor will have different waiting time for investment plan. If you can have your plan for like 2 or 3 halvings, you will get massive profit. If you want to do it, you must not use all money for investment and need to have cash to use as well so that you won't have to sell your bitcoin.",

Always have good side of halving time because bitcoin potential will raise to higher price and left 140 days before halving we can see bitcoin up drastically. Have some opinion with before halving not positive side with bitcoin will raise and need several months later after halving but for this halving time I sure bitcoin will raise up before not after halving.

Tracking the halving countdown and related activities is a wise move. All time highs, highest price each year show prices when people are most FOMOing and corrections after that show panic around the market.To see the price growth of Bitcoin, see how it sustainably grows with time, people must be enlightened and see a picture with lowest price for each year, each cycle. Lowest prices show us a reality that when the market is most boring and most of people are panic, it still shows a steady growth trend.Yearly candles can help you to see the steady trend with Yearly lowest price (bottom of each yearly candle)",

FOMO here and thee. So many topics regarding bitcoin and the halving and also what would be the outcome of bitcoin after the halving. Seems no one is talking about the acceptance of the Bitcoin ETF we are expecting next month. Or have we lost hope that the application would not be accepted? However, only those who have not bought bitcoin earlier this year or last year would be panicking this period and struggling to buy even if it is a small amount. There have been awareness advising people to buy bitcoin since last two years and people took the advantage and got prepared for it while some persons where ignorant and did not buy. I would be here to see people that will benefit and be happ. Also ill not miss to see those who will regret because they did not participate earlier.",

Yet, I implore everyone not to go for a specific halving time, there are slightly days different in many places, so it's wise not to believe it's going to be a particular day.Also, halving itself is not the reason why people buy cryptocurrency but the sentiment that is attached to it, this is why it will might not make Bitcoin achieve any tangible bull run on that day, nonetheless, the post effects will happen most weeks and months after. There are pre-halving effects also, which is partly what we are seeing now in the Bitcoin market, more is to come or not come, and I believe that it would be fine if we plan our trading and investments appropriately. But for the fact that Bitcoin is almost $45,000 even before the halving of 2024, I wonder what would happen after the halving next year.A situation like this has never happened with all the past charts I've ever studied about it and the halving subject, only time will tell us what will happen with the coin this time.",

This halving seems to be very interesting with rumor that Bitcoin Spot ETF applications from companies in the USA. will be approved in bulk. The matter is will SEC. approves those applications and rumor is if SEC make approval, it will not be for a single application, one by one, but will be in bulk to give fair competition for those companies that submit their applications to SEC.I believe without Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the USA. Bitcoin will have its bull run with effects from halving. Bitcoin Spot ETFs will only be catalyst for the bull run but it is not most important contributor for it.

Bitcoin halving is an event as you have said and very much important in the Bitcoin community but however, that does not really mean it to trigger a spike in Bitcoin price but probably it could be that way.
