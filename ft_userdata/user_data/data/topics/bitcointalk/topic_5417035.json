  "content": "I want to warn everyone from buying anything in this fake website that is pretending to sell cooling systems for mining devices, he started promoting his website store in many sections in bitcointalk and the one that got my attention was in arabic section here i read all the informations he mentioned and there was nothing proving his business to be legit, i did a small research about his website domain and found out that it’s so shitty (if I’m allowed to say that) to be a store of cooling systems for mining devices. And this is the domain name informationsCode: Domain Name: ASICSHIELD.COMRegistry Domain ID: 2708806666_DOMAIN_COM-VRSNRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.wix.comRegistrar URL: http://www.wix.comUpdated Date: 2022-07-05T17:57:50ZCreation Date: 2022-07-05T17:57:49ZRegistry Expiry Date: 2023-07-05T17:57:49ZRegistrar: Wix.com Ltd.Registrar IANA ID: 3817Registrar Abuse Contact Email: email@wix.comRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +14154291173Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibitedDomain Status: clientUpdateProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientUpdateProhibitedName Server: NS0.WIXDNS.NETName Server: NS1.WIXDNS.NETDNSSEC: unsignedSo i replied on his topic and asking him about some informations and also for some evidence, all i can say that his words are all a contradiction and he also has anger issues rather than giving us evidence to prove his business and legitimate he prefers to curse me, so yeah I’m more than sure he’s just a scammer i don’t believe he is a guy that has companies in Dubai and wherever he claims. So he deserves to be tagged and warn people about his very suspicious store",

A legit business can create a domain yesterday and launch their website. It's also true that there are many mining equipment seller are in google first page who offer cheap mining setup which is too good to be truth. Most of them or could be all of them are scammers.I don't understand the language of the topic you linked. It would be helpful if you take notes of important sections of the discussions and translate here for us to get a good understanding of what was happening.",

And said what’s the problem if I’m arabic and i have a company in china[my website] he meant the signature that I’m wearing which is totally a different thing. On my next reply to him i explained that wasn’t my website and why he run from my question and started attacking me. And he also replied by thisQuote from: marco_kinaa on October 13, 2022, 04:52:57 PMSnipHere he still accusing me for promoting a scam website as he claims, and also confirm that it’s okay having a us phone number.So he confirms he is the owner of that phone number and by searching for that number you find it’s related to many other fake companies which proven to be a fraud.After that @Kavelj22 replied also and explained to him why it’s so suspicious to have a business like that with all those mistakes on his website.Once again he replies to thatQuote from: marco_kinaa on October 13, 2022, 06:03:27 PMشكرا على التدخل الحضري خدمة شراء المواقع كلها عندها خدمة  الاطو رينوال لي هي تجدد شراء الموقع تلقائي الالات لي شركتنا بتصنهها موجودة في دبي ، السعودية ، ابوا طبي لي عندو شكوك في المنتوج و الشركة ممكن يتصل بنا نعطيع عنوان واروح يشوف بنفسوAnd here he say that all domain name services are auto renewal so he didn’t pay for long period, and that he company that produce those cooling systems for mining devices are in Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, o for those who have doubts about his products and company he can give him his number and invite him to his company’s address@ Kavelj22 again asked him why he didn’t share his company address in public, and me i asked him why he always run from our questions and yet didn’t give any evidence which is a very easy step to prove his legitimate and since he invited us to to call him and verify his company i asked for his phone number and i will make sure by myself In his next reply he was just cursing me asking me to not talk with him again, he also claims that he never said i have any company but that company he talked about is 9 years old, he is full of contradictions. So for me he is a fraudulent until he proves the opposite",
