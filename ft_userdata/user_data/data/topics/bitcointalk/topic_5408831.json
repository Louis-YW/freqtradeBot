  "content": "Hi everyone,I am looking for decent Twitter cryptocurrency or Bitcoin engagement groups to grow my personal Twitter account. Paid groups are fine, if they have a good reputation.I am not looking for fake followers or cheap mass follow strategies, which don't work in the long run and damage ones account.Any ideas? Would appreciate any good info!",

Only a lot of inactive accounts and non-interested in your speech. your posts there will not have a single reply or repost.I did some analysis on Twitter and the results are more than devastating.it is best if you can manage your own account, but you have to be very active and attractive, so your account will grow naturally. that's the only way it can make sense.Or even you can run your own giveaway or something like that, where you will give some rewards for your new followers.",

Only a lot of inactive accounts and non-interested in your speech. There are definitely Twitter engagement groups on Discord and Telegram - I know of several mid-sized accounts that use them or have used them in the past. Unfortunately, none of the accounts would give me more detailed information. Probably because none of the accounts want users to know that they have used a paid service for engagement/followers in the past.Quote from: OcTradism on August 05, 2022, 01:52:33 PM~Thanks for the links. The thread is from 2019. Do you know if the service is still active?",

You can rather try to grow your follower naturally.

I guess the service is not for me then. If any of you still have ideas or more information on engagement groups please let me know. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything useful yet.",
