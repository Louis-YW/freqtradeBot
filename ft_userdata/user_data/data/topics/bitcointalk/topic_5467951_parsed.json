I still haven't done much reading about it, but I thought it would be a good idea to share it here since I didn't see any discussion about it. The network is still not open to the public yet,  but you can join the waitlist from the official site.

      "body": "Interesting. It seems that this year really something is moving when talking about sidechains.These spiderchains at the very first glance (have to investigate more) look a bit similar to a model @vjudeu proposed a couple of months ago in the Drivechain thread (from this post on, it's detailed later).There is also Nomic, which looks a bit similar too and seems to be already working, and Stacks (sBTC), which is in alpha state (I erroneously thought it was already working, but no).And Trustless Computer (which comes out of the ... Ordinals community  ) could also be mentioned, although I'm quite sceptical in this case, it seems difficult to find information how it really works (in theory it's an Optimistic Rollup). Perhaps it's ... not really a solution (to not write the S-word).PS: The Bitcoin Magazine article explains a bit more about the technical side. It looks like there are some similarities to the Stacks/Nomic system of \"dynamic federations\": The spiderchain (PoS) stakers select randomly a subset of their addresses as a multisig federation on the Bitcoin main chain, which is renewed each block (so we have 1 Bitcoin tx per sidechain per block, if I understand correctly). These multisig federations decide, by majority, about peg-ins and peg-outs, and if some of the stakers misbehave they're slashed at the spiderchain. I've not completely understood why there is a \"third\" layer mentioned (mainchain -> spiderchain -> sidechain) but maybe the \"third layer\" isn't really a layer but only the \"Bitcoin-pegged token\" which lives at the spiderchain.",

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on September 26, 2023, 10:06:31 AM[PoS] require Spiderchain to be popular in first place.I think security is really a challenge in this sidechain model. The native token of the sidechain has to be quite valuable if they want to ensure the incentive mechanism prevents them to steal money via fake peg-ins/peg-outs.There could even be a formula for that: the slashing penalty for the qualified majority of the selected subset of stakers which manages the peg in a block has to be higher than the maximum expected total Bitcoin peg-in/peg-out transfer. If this wasn't the case, a big whale could simply buy a lot of staking nodes and then wait for his nodes being selected as the majority of the staking nodes, then stealing all the Bitcoins or alternatively stalling the process and short the sidechain token. Both attacks would be catastrophic for the Spiderchain probably.So the value the sidechain is able to manage safely depends directly on the market cap of the native Spiderchain token, and of the slashing value. Of course, for PoW sidechains a similar rule applies, but Drivechains seem to be a bit more secure as they require cooperation from mainchain miners.Perhaps with this in mind, it would be recommendable to start not pegging a token to Bitcoin but to some altcoin instead, so the spiderchain can demostrate it works with low peg-in/peg-out volumes, and then slowly increase its value and then finally offer a Bitcoin peg once a certain level has been reached.",

I suggest something like what has been done in the bitcoin core base - hardcore a list of trusted addresses, and make a supplementary \"DNS service\" for finding the address for someone on this protocol, so that you have all these addresses connecting to each other and that the distribution in the multisig is random.",

In both cases, you have contracts on the mainchain which ensure that the supply is always 1 peggedBTC = 1BTC, and you can describe them as methods to bundle BTC transactions.On a sidechain/spiderchain, when the \"Orchestrators\" try to steal coins, this is very similar to a LN member trying to close a channel in an old state. Nothing is changed regarding the token supply, but there is an unintended ownership change which would not be possible only using on-chain methods.The only difference I see is that a sidechain in theory could be buggy in the sense that some unintended function leads to a supply inflation of the pegged token (let's say something like the Bitcoin overflow bug in 2010). From my limited understanding that would not be possible in LN, not even taking into account milisats, but all sidechains have this theoretical problem. As long as they work as expected though that's not a problem. Where a difference could be possible is if the sidechain stakers cooperate to create such a bug intentionally. This would however damage all Orchestrators, because they couldn't exit 1:1 anymore. So the attacking subset would have to profit purely by operations on the sidechain (e.g. fast sells of the sidechain tokens on exchanges, or buying goods/services) and I cannot imagine that kind of attack to be easy to be profitable as long as the sidechain isn't extremely popular (and of course, it would be detected in one block as a maximum).This little drawback however is compensated by the big advantage that you can \"onboard\" people completely independently of mainchain transactions.",
