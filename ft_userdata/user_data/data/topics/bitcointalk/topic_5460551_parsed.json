Dunno why... I guess he is used to walk over people here and can't accept when people stands up for themself and speaks back. That I should be Ps34 and the other user (i forgot his name) is ridiculous and I don't think he actually believe that, he just want to paint on my wall, and he is very welcome to do so if it makes him happy and makes him feel stronger.Maybe he is angry because I called him and Timelord same shit. but he just proofed us all that they are.But in the end it's just sad and so unnecessary.",

The royse tag was true by his own words iirc. Regardless I could probably remove that tag as well. Not sure whats up with the exchange as I forget what that was all about. 2017 was a long time ago. Looks like other users shared my feelings though and went as far a red tagging them. What happened in the past and what should be happening now are 2 different things.

So Yes he did abuse the trust system, and its not the first time and def not the last either.What I did was to ref to this topic and said he trust abused, witch he did. Then he deleted it and replace it with a new feedback, after that I deleted my feedback. I am not a clown that feel that I need to post on another peoples walls that I don't have anything to do with, that's a behavior of a nerd in my opinion.Next time you open your mouths, read the whole topic so you won't look like fools, or you think it's totally normal and OK to accuse accounts to belong to each other when they don't with zero proof?Shouldn't the accuser create some kind of topic with proofs and then use that as a REF link?

It's been that way for years in case you haven't noticed.  It's just that you're now on the receiving end of some feedback you don't agree with.  And I'm not clear on this: were you asking for all of those documents in your lending thread (the income statement, etc.)?  I looked at your terms and didn't see anything like that and don't know if you'd made changes or not.  Hopefully you weren't, because despite you stating adamantly that your intention wouldn't be to use that information to scam anyone, no one can read your mind.  A scammer and an honest lender would both say the same thing, so who's to say?Of course I did not, and I would never ask anyone for any documents. NEVER. (Why he don't just ask the people who applied?!)First am I an alt of Ps34 and after that I stealing KYC. 🤡The only thing I do is to offer non-collateral loans, and so far everyone that tried it are happy.Quote from: Timelord2067 on July 21, 2023, 09:58:59 PMCongratulations @dire your first thread full of angst and navel gazing.Your reply are really worried, you think this is completely normal. by the way the feedback you left me is wrong.I did not created this topic for the reason your saying, its because I was accused of being and alt of PS34. You really doing all you can to be as far away from that DT list you can. I mean 70+ people distrust you.Feedback from you means nothing absolutely nothing for anyone.A question, why do you feel that you must lie so much on daily basis? Are you ok?",
