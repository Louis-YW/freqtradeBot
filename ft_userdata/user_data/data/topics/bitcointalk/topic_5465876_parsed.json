Or does it also show up on the Electrum GUI?If the error came from the most recent version I suggest report this to the Electrum issue page and then let the developer release a fixed version.If you have a backup seed I suggest try to downgrade Electrum to 4.4.5 or lower and update here if it fixes your issue.",
