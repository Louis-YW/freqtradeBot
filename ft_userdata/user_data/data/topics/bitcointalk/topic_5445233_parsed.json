Being financial independent and sufficient is everyone's dream. However, have you thought about the losses in exchange for the material gains ? When you barely make ends meet, you'll bust yourself to make more money; when you actually make a lot of money, you'll find yourself in a position that is either stressful or boring. I wonder the purpose of making money can be easily distorted and sometimes we tend to lose ourselves in pursuit of money, instead of happiness. Just a fleeting thought, no big deal.",

Just a fleeting thought, no big deal.Life is more meaningful/purposeful when you serve the role you were created to serve in this world. The CREATOR of this World being a loving GOD put in everyman the ability/talent to solve a particular problem uniquely and the interesting thing about this is that HE made people to enjoy/love solving the problems with solutions HE has put in their heart and HE gives them sense of fulfillment in their solutions.Now the problem with fallen man is that he made money his priority/god instead of his role in life. The malevolent being who actually rules over the fallen man used this to make alot of people abandon their role in life to chase after money. The problem with chasing after money is that you do anything possible to earn it...and that includes things you hate doing. Imagine the human eye abandoning its natural role to become s*ithole flesh just because of money..  . while always being in contact with fecal matter it hates to see... something the flesh around the hole is created for and loves doing.Besides, when you serve your role properly it will be hard to lack as you will always be rewarded for serving your role properly. That should make you free financially.",

Just a fleeting thought, no big deal.There are two aspect that your post is touching and one is the economic theory of human wants being insatiable and the love of money by humanity. For the economic theory, it is a fact that no matter how wealthy some people are, they will still look up investment and this is more glaring to what we see today. The society now has a standard for glorifying and classifying the level of wealth that people have and ranking which makes top ranks in society to strive to remain in the position. So because of the vicissitudes of life and it challenges people keep searching for more to better there lives and as you rise in life, your class strata increase and your needs increases proportionally.",

As they said money makes the world round, and it's true coz nowadays without money, you can no longer survive in this world. We seek money not only  for happiness but for survival, in the end we became tired due to extreme competition that we have to go through to earn money. Nowadays getting resources such as money to buy our needs is very hard, lots of competition and so many competitors. Not everyone has the same opportunities, but we are all equal on the fact that we are all given the same 24 hours a day. Saying that we are all in the same boat is nonsense, as I've said, not everyone is equal to receive the same opportunities, that is why it's best to utilize what you are good at or what makes you unique. This topic is closely related to getting lost in your way in pursuit of financial freedom, but as long as you keep your feet on the ground while holding your head up, then you will be fine.",

Maybe we don't need to work hard to make money, but sometimes we work harder than before.But if we can divide our time well, even though we work hard, we can still enjoy our time and results. So if you are currently thinking about pursuing or looking for a way to make more money by working really hard, try to relax your work a little and just enjoy the time for a while. I think it would be worth trying because if we keep working without a break, we can get stressed and get other problems.

It didn't even occur to me to achieve financial freedom because what came to my mind to continue to survive was how to be able to make ends meet from day to day. I think there are many people who have been wrong to achieve financial freedom but they are still in the permanent job rule space. The portion of financial freedom is not standard, so everyone is able to create conditions that feel free. Able to meet the standard of living but not in the long run. Able to manage finances according to what you want but not completely enough.",

There are principles to help achieve this freedom of which discipline is one, and then selective relationship. Selective relationship means you should be careful and carefully pick the people you decide to be friends with. Some relationship can \"make you\", and other relationships \"break you\", as an individual in the quest for financial freedom, you should be able to identify these relationships so you know the one to keep and the one to run from.Avoid people that do not add any form of benefit to your life and have only been in your life to take from you. Build more gainful relationships that have potential to be beneficial, relate more with people who are dedicated to financial freedom and not people who have given up. You can get financial freedom from an information given to you, hence you need gainful relationship.Quote from: bitmover on March 17, 2023, 11:08:02 AMBut actually  ,investing and pursuing financial objectives is pretty damn boring.

He lives in a different time to everyone else, he doesnt have electricity, telecommunicationsor even a car. He only relys on himself and nature to survive he grows food and refers tohimself as a hunter/gatherer of sorts. He is financially free!The person who wins a €100,000,000 in the Euromillions lotto also becomes financially free.Why am I not financially free?

However, a day would come that you will realize that it is not just about the money anymore, it's about the little things that makes you happy. It could be your family, friends, pets, or even your hobbies. For me, you don't need to have a lot of money to be happy, you just need enough or more than enough, not a lot, just to survive and put food in the table while giving a healthy and happy life for your love ones, especially to yourself. Inner peace is important, because you can't have it when you're too busy building an empire all by yourself while in the shadows, there are too many enemies that won't let you sleep peacefully at night.",
