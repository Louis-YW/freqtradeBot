I think so. Di machine is 2 expensive nd if dat machine come to some states, pple no go use am sef, na 4 only big cities like Lagos, Abuja, Rivers nd few states go dey use am.. it would have been a gud development bcoz dey way I look at it, ATM machine is good with hardware Wallet and not software wallet, so with day pple for buy hardware Wallet wella.

Your understanding of the exchange use is correct, but I don't have information about the type of currency used by the ATM in those years. The ATM might not thrive since the alternative with of phone/PC is simpler, faster, more private, and portable, and there have been many discussions on why most cryptocurrency holders try to stay anonymous.",

Government fearing another uprising that might be too much to handle. The Bitcoin ATM is one that will soon be a norm. It is just because of its decentralized system wherebeit government can't track that makes it an issue. Other countries use the ATM already, let's just give it time, because as more physical structures are established to authenticate its presence, so will of its innovation as well as ATMs find ground.",

That was the reason Nigerians were not able to make direct transfer to centralized exchanges, also not able to make use of master card and other credit card transaction after CBN declared the ban, but Nigerians resorted to P2P. Because of that, P2P transaction (even mostly on centralized exchanges) become come in Nigeria among crypto traders.",
