If they have a good use case then why not though. But I do hope that they will offer something unique not a project that will just milk the whole crypto space as you have mentioned.",

But personally, for me, I think it's worth investing some money and time in a project that has Functions and products, and fundamentals because if it goes well, everyone will get a percentage of the profits.",
