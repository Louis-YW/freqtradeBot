If you want trading without any volatility from crypto-market especially \"BTC\", you should try \"Stable-coin\" and playing on staking.But the margin % profit would be really small. Also, you will fight against inflation from fiat since investment on stable-asset.",

I can’t see any coins/tokens that can move without Bitcoin basis, investors prefer the Bitcoin pair as well and that’s why every market trend, Bitcoin is the leader.",

But at least for the stable coins, they're all pegged to dollars if that's what you mean. Well, as for that actual coin that won't be going along with bitcoin. There is really no type of coin that does that.",

Stablecoins are not for investment, I mean if you live in a horrible nation with a terrible fiat, then you can use \"dollar\" as a leverage against that which I have done plenty of times and stablecoins could work out for that. But that wouldn't be a crypto investment, there is a reason why they are called stablecoins and not cryptocurrency. Hence, if we want to technically speak about this issue, there isn't a single \"cryptocurrency\" that would be independent from bitcoin. There could be moments when they act independently, move up  and down without bitcoin doing anything, but that would be moments and not in general and it wouldn't be sustainable at all.",

Altcoins has been traded on bitcoin and being the prime mover, everyone is depended on it, just look at trading pair, it's all being traded against bitcoin price.Sure maybe you can find one, but that's going to be a simple pump and dump altcoin. And it's good though that altcoin depended on bitcoin, otherwise, they will die if they are going to be stand-alone cryptos.",

But most often they are tied up with btc movement. But you can try to search some tokens that doenst have any pairing on btc exchange or ties with it. Usually those coins are paired only with usdt or being used on dex with another liquidity. Anything with btc pairing would likely be affected as thr value of btc changes drastically so means pulling downward too those tokens and coins.",
