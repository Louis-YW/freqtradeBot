      "body": "I know someone asked an identical question, but that was years ago if memory serves me well. The answer to your question is not simple because no one knows what will happen in the future, so any direct advice would actually be a mere guess as to which is the better option at the moment.However, if you buy a house, you have something that gives you a certain comfort and security in life, especially if you are old enough to have a family. On the other hand, if you are young and mobile, maybe it is better to rent an apartment, and then it is easy to move in search of a better job or only if you want to change the living environment.The question that arises is can you accept the risks that come with investing in Bitcoin and live with those risks for years or are you still someone who plays on safer bets?",

      "body": "You have to make sure to understand that the price of Bitcoins right now is not what we might call 'negotiable' to even sell. You might be loosing a lot more than you can comprehend. See we Are seeing ups and downs some of them even 4%+ but they are not comparable to the ATH which I think we should all wait for. The market is all about patience and whosoever is able to have faith would survive and make more profits. Do not put your money into alts because they are far too volatile at the moment and only good for short term holding and trading as well. For long term holding I think bitcoin might be the only option, property is only valuable in certain countries like UK and US, they are having extensive increase in price of it so if you live there and have money then ofc it would be a more stable investment..",

I cannot trust that I cannot guarantee the safety of my family, since we are raising children, and we cannot risk their lives.But I agree with Lucius that for very young people, it is possible to take risks, live in a rented apartment, and invest in bitcoin. But again, you must be prepared that at some point, it may happen that you will have nothing to pay for housing. Therefore, evaluate all risks.",

If you're buying on a mortgage, you'll probably get more equity faster than you would with bitcoin and might have spare cash too to invest later.If you're buying with cash, it'd make more sense to put any remainder into crypto instead of not buying the house and you could always find somewhere cheaper to live so you have more funds left over for the investment.",

When you can afford to get a house right away and don't want to mess around with paying monthly rents, the house is more important.but on the other hand if you really want to get a house but on the other hand you want to be in bitcoin investment considering they are being corrected then the monthly rent is indeed more worth it but maybe this will burden your finances for each month because bitcoin is not a guarantee that it will go up in the near future.I think this goes back to the choices you want to make regardless of what other people's opinions are, it's just a consideration and you decide",

But it will depend on the amount of money I have because I can't buy a house if I don't have a lot of money. But if I have to rent an apartment, that's also not a problem because I can still earn money from other sources. Investing in bitcoin is a decision that has to be thought about repeatedly because not everyone out there will invest their money in bitcoin right away. But for me, investing now is a good time because the price is still low. But I guess that doesn't relate to buying a house to live in or renting an apartment with a bitcoin investment.",

Someone may decide to invest on bitcoin rather than house especially newbies could be thinking on that or someone already having comfortable shelter. If you don't have a shelter covering you, you definitely want it and not bitcoin. Bitcoin is long time investment and would you stay under the rain and sun while waiting for two or three years more time to sell and probably get some profit ? Choosing for real estate can generate initial capital for comfortable bitcoin investment where you don't always get pissed off when price drop.",

We have seen how BTC grows over the past decades and expect the same in the future. But there are countless possibilities of a negative and positive outcomes from the crypto market. May be world makes BTC a reserve currency or everybody abandons it and its value goes to zero. You can not deny any possibilities because we do not know actually what is going to happen.The wise choice always would be to invest only savings or extra money in crypto space and always DCA in a bear market.",
