First of all, you have to ask yourself does it solves any real issue, check the team and their previous experience, whitepaper etc. But to become good at that you need some experience, meaning a lot of money lost in the process. Much better alternative to that is just buying bitcoin whenever you can so you don't have to worry about any of that. This azimuth thing that you mentioned screams \"scam\" from the moment you open their website; from unrealistically high APY, to a ridiculous claim that they will give a $450k worth yacht to one lucky investor.",

Token $AZM is used in Azimuth Finance stimulation model as a reward for online activity.Have you seen the entire website page? if we refer to the name of this project, it is certain that the use-case is closely related to DeFi. But if you want to know more about this project, you can read the FAQ on their official website.I'm trying to see how the conversation is in their telegram group. And the conversation there is quite active. But there is 1 strange thing that I saw from an Announcement about Pre-sale there. They said the pre-sale will end in 12 hours. But until now, they haven't closed the Pre-sale yet. This indicates a lack of public interest in this project. My advice, you better look for top projects that are at CMC.",

If the investors in that project are in tier 1-3 of the investor list, that's a good sign. You can look at the tier list here. Next we look at those venture capital venues where the initial sales of tokens will take place. Watch here. Next, we look tokenomics, if the offer is too large and the price is high for a public sale, then you should not expect any miracles from the project. If the initial sale of tokens occurs exclusively on the project website, then close this site and never open it again, because it is very likely to turn out to be a scam and a pacifier project.",

      "body": "Why even do it though? I never understood the appeal of the brand new projects some people have. Looking at places like pinksale, I see that there are too many people who invest millions of dollars per month, not per person of course, per project, but each month there are some 20-30+ million dollars going into brand new projects in the crypto world. Wouldn't it make sense if that money went to already established projects? I mean it would definitely be a lot more profitable in the long run. Thats my personal opinion, but if thats not the case then I do not know what to do, can't pick how to find good new projects.",

I would not just hop-in and buy this coin if I were you. I might not have researched yet really further, but from my rough observations, I would not invest a single penny and would just look into other projects.Read what Rikafip mentioned by the way.",

I have been visiting the site of azimuth and i just found this on its website if it was offering more than 4k% APY and 10% daily APR for mining the token which is a non sense thing to be seen. You can consider this as a shady thing from the project and it can also become a reason to avoid such project.",

If the site is still incomplete then I would not invest on that project right away, I still need to look for more information and the only way to know that is to communicate with them. Most of them have their own telegram group where they discussed more about the project and future promotions, it's also good to join on their social account. Doing your research is a must, and you have to consider everything before buying, early investors might not be a thing now since the usual trend is that, early investors are losing money because it dumps right away the moment it get listed.",

Fundamental analysis is also required in the early stages. but I'm more interested in projects that are very good at promoting their projects such as building natural hype. continuous massive promotion. and the project must have a clear utility as well. So what they are promoting is about how useful their project will be in the future.conversely if a project with promotional content is only about doubling money in a short time or with a lot of words \"to the moon\" \"LFG\" and so on. then such projects are mostly scams. and I avoid such projects. they only hope to profit from the hype for a moment. even their projects sometimes after being registered with CMC then they seem to slowly die. because such projects are not made for the long term. but only a fraudulent project that benefits their team and only those who participate in the private sale. or sometimes their coins only go up during the initial listing and after that continue to decline slowly. and their community group began to fill with fud. then the group admin will stop the chat in the group. and finally the team came up with a migration solution and all the other crap. such is the project of deception to put it mildly.",
