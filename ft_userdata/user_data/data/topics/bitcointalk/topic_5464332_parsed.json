If there's money laundering, they should pursue the launderers. If there's money involved in a crime, they should seize the money and arrest the criminals. Why arrest those who simply wrote open-source software? We don't arrest central bankers for creating money which is used in all kinds of crimes. We don't arrest the Toyota CEO or president for having their cars used by ISIS and other terrorists. If \"knowingly\" is the key word, do they know it? How about the fact that the ledger involved is public? Transactions are open for anybody to know. How about the fact that Tornado Cash was decentralized? The code was publicly available, free for anybody to use in whichever manner they see fit.When security hackers transferred almost $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank's Federal Reserve Bank of New York account and laundered almost $100 million in a Philippine bank, the bank wasn't penalized. The bank's particular branch itself which facilitated the laundry wasn't penalized. The one who was arrested was the very person who did the laundry herself.",

While they have responsibilities, they aren't built and designed to catch criminals and seize dirty money. Privacy-loving individuals love them. Criminals may love them as well. Mixers aren't created for them, however. Gambling lords, drug lords, corrupt local politicians, and other criminals love cash. They often avoid bank accounts. They have their own vaults at home. Should we hold cash and vault makers responsible? These two are perfect tools for their kind of life, but they aren't created for them. If Boko Haram loves Toyota Land Cruiser more than any other vehicle because it's perfect for their kind of operations, should we hold liable the car designer? If a mixer fits the needs of a money launderer, container vans are also tailor fit for the needs of human traffickers. Should we make container vans illegal? My point is that this is obviously selective. In other words, this is repression against crypto innovations. They're obviously suppressing the technologies that promote privacy and independence.",

However mixers attract those money laundering due tho this concept as I explained earlier and since it is decentralized, even mixers are dragged to it. They arent built for hunting down criminals but they are the platform at the middle we all knew Government would love handy things and evidence on the table already. Thats why this incident happened. I feel bad for the developers but with our current state they should expect something like this since their platform was used like scene of the crime.Quote from: Darker45 on August 24, 2023, 03:03:05 AMMy point is that this is obviously selective.

Yeah kinda get you mate but the question is how can we change that. See what happened to those developers even they arent ar fault here they take the charges due to that fact. This is really a crazy mixed up. So Im not sure the debate on centralized vs decentralized would ever be coincide in the future. Hoping one day it is.",

When it comes to bitcoin - refuse to be spied on. Refuse to complete KYC. Refuse to let them monitor all your activities via centralized exchanges. Run your own node. Trade peer to peer. Mix/coinjoin freely. Spend bitcoin directly with appropriate merchants. Opt out of their global surveillance. Encourage others to do the same.",

I am also trading altcoins which cant be done via peer to peer using an easy and convenient sell order or stop loss options, so Im really using cex for that matter. Its not like I like the KYC system, but since its required for that especially when doing p2p which is totally direct to our local remittance easily, I dont have much choice. I rarely find p2p for our local that can be transact that easily when I needed the funds immediately. I think mostly here on forum I bet, are using binance p2p even on our locals.",

But in the end I still used or send funds Ive gained on this through a trusted p2p service for me which is Binance p2p to cash out directly to our remittance and become php(currency). We cant do this easily being an anon here or somewhere out there especially without any trust and its not that easily to say avoid cex, Atleast for me. ( Ive bet Im not the only one using Binance p2p here Im pretty sure of that) Maybe for some other guys here they can and manage to do that without relying on cex conveniently then props to them. Actually maybe thats a good point, maybe we can survey whose users here dont have binance or zero cex account online and how they manage efficiently to trade p2p their tokens or coins for fiat. I'll be delighted to hear how they do that and even get some tips.",

My bad for saying that didnt mean to offend anyone but maybe the developer who got allegledy arrested (who created the tool wasnt just created it but explicitly knew or allowed the mixing of more than $7billion fund from hackers). Im sure those authorities do a solid investigation on this one and not blindly arrested anyone without a firm evidence cause that might be injustice. Im just reading the articles, and knowing the Government you think they sit and do nothing about it especially a $7billion fund was stolen and process somewhere. Surely the guy will be investigated and interrogated but if his clear he will be out right away. Im just saying that Government constantly doing the arrest thing as usual to pick up dust of info to have lead to those real criminals. Sorry for the developer cause he needed to experience this kind of norm which we knew happenign everywhere. Maybe they arent perfect and bias all the time but someone will take action for that.

We are questioning if it was right for the government to imprison people who had no connection to the crimes that are happening through the software that they only created.I assume the developer got arrested but that doesnt mean he was already imprisoned. I believe he is just investigated as per protocols and probably out by now. We know how things work, since they dont have a conclusive proof of allegations made.Quote from: bbc.reporter on August 26, 2023, 02:47:06 AMBut the cryptospace is giving some of this power back to the people. The government does not want this.Did I say I didnt believe that? I am here on forum and of course also a fan of decentralized approach but we live mixed up with the Government isnt it? there are protocols that we should also followed as part of being its citizen. Im just in the middle.Quote from: bbc.reporter on August 26, 2023, 02:47:06 AMIn any case, if you want the government to control the whole cryptospace so that criminals cannot use it then we should demand for more centralization of our favorite projects and demand for more invasive regulations.The hell I can be control by them. Not even work for the government eversince why I let them control me? Surely they acted like that due to the incidents happening on crypto. If theres no hack then surely they will shut their freakin mouth. The problem here is the composition of Government which mixed up with the sharks who wanted power.",
