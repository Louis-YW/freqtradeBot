Oh ok my mistake, i thought you only wanted to know about BTC. Well, if that's the case then you might use a wallet tracker where you might have to connect your wallet with those tracker and then those tracker might help you to provide a list (richlist) of all the coins you have received. Maybe like coinstas etc. I might be wrong again here. So bear with me as i am also learning.",

In that case, as far as I know, there's no such a website but I would imagine that with some technical knowledge, you could probably use the input data from here[1] and then group it by addresses and received value to achieve what you want.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5307550.0",
