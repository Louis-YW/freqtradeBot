When an innocent crypto user agrees to a sketchy smart contract and connects his wallet to a website or service, all the crypto in his wallet gets drained. I've seen this shit happening to Exodus and Metamask users.I hope that this is going to be a legit crypto casino and not another crypto scam.Is this your announcement thread? Just the logo of your online casino? By the way, I like the name and the domain of your casino. Just.bet looks simple, easy to remember and catchy. Many new casinos have weird and hard to remember names, which is bad for marketing.",

When you employ/hire someone to do something for you, then it would be logical to check whether that person might have a negative impact on your business - and as far as I know, only one campaign on the forum accepts members into its ranks, regardless of DT tags. Of course, we all know that this company has no reputation at all.",

No middleman, no KYC, no tampering, no bullsh*t.This means that your casino site is built on the Web3 structure.  In this case, a user has to play gambling by connecting the wallet directly from his Metamask or other wallet's DApp.  I have two general questions in this regard1. When a person connects his personal wallet to your site, if he has a high amount in his wallet, how do you secure his funds and how can a person fully trust you?  Is your site licensed from a trusted agency? if yes when from where? 2. Since a user needs to play through the Ethereum network or the Bsc network to gamble by connecting a wallet, how can a gambler gamble on your site with Bitcoin?",

That seems a bit strange and unheard of, to be honest. What happens if someone finds a fatal flaw in your systems that lets them cheat the casino out of money? Also, what kind of permissions am I giving if I were to connect my wallet to your casino? There are many casinos claiming to be web3 but in my own personal experience there is always a centralized party with all the control.Furthermore I cannot find any terms and conditions on your website. Just what am I agreeing to by using your services? I am not sure I would want to connect my wallet without knowing if I can trust this \"web3 casino\".",
