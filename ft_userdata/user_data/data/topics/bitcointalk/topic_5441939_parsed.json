  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussophobia as a phenomenonIf in the class all the students call one of them a fighter, then accusing them of a biased attitude towards him is at least unreasonable. Russian diplomats and propagandists accuse Western countries of Russophobia, so maybe not without a reason? It is no secret that Russian tourists were not particularly loved before the war unleashed by Russia with Ukraine.  The scale of Russophobia in Europe turned out to be much larger than Russian diplomats imagined, and, it is important to note here, Vasily Nebenzya, Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN Security Council, acknowledged this on February 23 during his speech at a meeting of the World Organization for Cooperation between the UN and the European Union. Thus, the diplomat said that although Russian politicians had no illusions about the presence of Russophobia in European countries, they did not represent the true depth of this phenomenon. If this circumstance takes place, then perhaps the cause of Russophobia should be sought in the Russians themselves and not accuse people of other countries of being biased towards Russians.The reaction of the Kremlin to such a mass phenomenon as Russophobia is interesting: Valery Fadeev, head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, proposed to legally define the concept of Russophobia and introduce criminal liability for its manifestation. Fadeev does not limit the operation of the law to the territory of Russia, in his opinion, in the future, when the opportunity arises, people living in other countries should also be punished. This Kremlin official appears to be confident that the Russian Empire will re-incorporate the former colonies. A certain Yury Khokhlov, the head of the oversight of the execution of Russian laws, does not lag behind him, recommending that Russophobia be regarded as extremism.It should be noted that in the days of the USSR, Russophobia as a phenomenon was not noted in Western countries. The fact is that at that time the communist regime only allowed people from the intelligentsia to go abroad, moreover, those who had passed a preliminary test for loyalty to the regime. Everything changed when, after the fall of the regime, the Russian people got the opportunity not only to travel around the world, but also to live abroad. With the war in Ukraine, Russophobia became widespread in the status of a social phenomenon, and the majority of the Russian people supported this war. (1)1. The reason for the aggressiveness of the \"Russian world\". https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/85537.html03/02/2023",

      "body": "For example in Finland where i live, next to Russia. We don't hate russians. But because of actions of their home country we are way more suspicious. I have visited russia often and i have russian friends, my ex girlfriend used to organize travels for tourists in there. And before putin went crazy we actually had hopes of having good ties with the country.But we fucking hate putler and putinist propaganda, and yeah for sure we hate russians who defend actions of putin yet choose to live in here. Same way as we hate handful of finnish trolls who are for putin. They are basically enemy combatants of refugees living in here and big middle finger to them. I think that they should be under same sanctions as people who live in russia. Yet we don't judge anyone just by speaking Russian language. But if i was Russian living aboard, i would be so shamed of my country's actions i wouldn't want to risk it by speaking Russian language and would totally understand that there might be people who hate my guts.Being a Russian now is like being a son of a Hitler. Sure, you are not responsible of the actions of your father but it's fair to assume you are being hated for him unless you are very vocal against him.On the other hand, as we have free access to russian media, we can see how much we are being demonized there. We are the next nazis they are after as they definitely are paving the way to attack in here and want to \"free\" our people. For quite a long time now we have seen fake news in there as we can monitor them pretty easily. They are slowly turning their people against us too.Russians on the other hand don't have access to free media. They don't know how we think about them. But they are being lied to how we think about them.",

They are indeed.Or are you telling me... these guys are Kremlin propagandists acting like Russophobes?Maybe you are onto something.

This was more that interesting.On the other hand, it is clear that many citizens (in Ukraine, Georgia, Chechnya etc..) have good reasons to hate Russian politicians and government. I think that anyone with a brain is able to make a difference between the people and their government, even more so when you know how the Kremlin propaganda works, you can't blame a part of the people for being biased. I imagine that Russophobia has origins dating back to the communist era, and that Putin's recent actions will not help some Westerners to not fall into the trap of mixing population and government.We should not underestimate people, it is not because 10 idiots make a lot of noise being racist towards Russians, that the majority of people are like them, quite the contrary.",

We should not underestimate people, it is not because 10 idiots make a lot of noise being racist towards Russians, that the majority of people are like them, quite the contrary.  You are a Bulgarian, Bulgaria was not a colony of Russia, and the peoples of the Caucasus, for example, experienced the cruelty of Russia long before Communism. They were destroyed, deported. For example, the Circassian people disappeared, and this was one of the many peoples of the Caucasus. The remnants of this people today live in Turkey and Israel, they lost their homeland through the fault of the Russians. The same can be said about the other colonial peoples of the Russian Empire. And to evaluate their Russophobia in 10 idiots is not reasonable. And who is the idiot here is a big question.",

He is getting rid of the Covid Vaccines in Russia.PUTIN ORDERS DESTRUCTION OF ALL COVID-19 VACCINES IN RUSSIAhttps://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=218480Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the destruction of all Covid-19 vaccine stockpiles on Russian soil, citing an undeniable connection between what has been dubbed the “Moscow Vax” and a sudden surge of HIV infections in vaccinated persons, Federal Service Bureau agent Andrei Zakharov told Real Raw News.Although Putin has not made a formal announcement, he has tasked his right-hand man, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, with purging hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies of the Sputnik and CoviVac vaccine variants. The military will ensure compliance by auditing vaccine repositories and performing spot inspections.Like President Trump, Putin was deceived by a lie; a global consortium of devious doctors, health professionals, and government stooges spun a convincing yarn about a virus that would ravage the world unless vaccines were developed to inoculate the population as soon as possible. The WHO had infiltrated the Russian Ministry of Health and planted agents of evil within the Council of Ministers and State Duma, and Western propaganda—fables of people sick with Covid falling dead on the street—seeped through Russia’s once secure borders. No nation was immune to the most elaborate disinformation campaign in the history of humanity.On 2 December 2020, Russia launched its first mass vaccination experiment, beating other nations to the punch and delivering 6.9 million doses in the first week. As of 21 June 2022, 81.5 million people have received at least one dose, with 74.3 million fully vaccinated. In the West and Russia, vaccine recipients presented side effects such as cardiac ailments, seizures, and blood clots, with many dropping dead at home, at work, or in the streets....",
