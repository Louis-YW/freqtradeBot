And make sure 2FA is not by SMS and you should be fine. Sure its not 100% keeping on an exchange but its better than using some wallet online and you end up getting a virus and getting it stolen.",

For mobile, I recommend BlueWallet (if lightning custody isn't a concern) and Zap if you want a wallet that focuses on lightning (and if lightning custody is a concern). Edit: Oops!
