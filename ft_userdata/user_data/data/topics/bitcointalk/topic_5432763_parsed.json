  "content": "QuoteDespite reams of misinformation found online, Ford dispels it all by sharing the truth about its EVs.You're probably well aware by now that electric vehicles are much safer for your health and the environment than their gas-powered counterparts. However, there are still many people and organizations working to make us believe that's not true, and many automakers were actually on the list of misinformation peddlers over the years. Now, Ford has come forward to tell it how it really is.EVs don't produce any tailpipe emissions. This means there's no smelly and dangerous exhaust. While the vehicles do create more emissions than gas cars during their production, it's quickly offset by the lack of emissions during use.While most EV owners are aware that their cars help the environment, they may be much more excited about the fuel savings. Saving the environment is virtuous, but saving money provides more tangible and immediate rewards.At any rate, according to a recent article published by Electrek, Ford reveals how much money an owner of one of its EVs can save over the life of the vehicle by choosing it over a gas car. Ford also shows how much it will reduce CO2 emissions over the same period of time.As part of its sustainable financing report, Ford says if you drive an electric car and use the US electrical grid to charge it, you can reduce C02 emissions by as much as 60 percent when compared to a similar ICE vehicle. The larger the vehicle, the greater the savings over time.According to Electrek, based on Ford's findings, F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck owners can save more than $27.2K (8,777 gallons of gas) throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. This is based on current gas prices and compared to a similar gas-powered F-150. E-Transit owners can save $19.2K (6,189 gallons), and Mustang Mach-E owners can save nearly $15,000 and 5,000 gallons of gas.Ford reported the C02 savings in metric tons as followed, according to Electrek:F-150 Lightning: 78Mustang Mach-E: 42E-Transit: 55Are you surprised by these numbers? Leave us your thought in the comment section below.https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/ford-reveals-how-much-evs-save-on-fuel-costs-and-reduce-emissions/ar-AA15zhHF....A different perspective on EVs.In 2016, volkswagen agreed to settle a lawsuit alleging they cheated on emissions tests. In the years following, other automakers were found guilty of similar practices.QuoteVolkswagen Settles Emissions-Cheating Cases For $14.7 BillionNEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) -- Volkswagen's $14.7 billion settlement announced Tuesday is the largest auto-related consumer class-action settlement in U.S. history, lawyers said.Volkswagen on Tuesday agreed to settle consumer lawsuits and government allegations that it programmed cars with 2-liter diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests. VW admitted to installing software that turned on pollution controls during emissions testing then turned them off when the cars were on the road.https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/volkswagen-emissions-cheating-scandal-settlement/Now that ford has 3 different models of electric vehicle selling on the market. They have begun to release data claiming electric vehicles are significantly cleaner and more environmentally friendly in contrast to internal combustion engine powered analogues.QuoteF-150 Lightning: 78 metric tonsOne specific claim ford has made is that its F-150 lightning electric truck will save an average of 78 metric tons of CO2 emissions during its lifetime.I can only imagine what type of geek war will blaze across the internet as a result of these claims.",

      "body": "Electric cars are definitely the future. It's great for reducing air pollution, it is certainly more eco-friendly than using a regular car, and it also seems to me that electric cars are quieter. However, if electricity comes from burning coal or something like that, such cars can have significant environmental impact as well, aside from the hard-to-recycle materials required. Also, while electric cars can be great for lots of countries, they can be a big problem if there's weak energy security within the country (frequent blackouts or something like that). Electricity prices within the country must also be taken into consideration.",

      "body": "And this is just Ford, which is not world famous for their EV neither, not like Tesla at least. Sure all other car companies are working towards having some EV car model but that doesn't make them EV car company like Tesla is. So, imagine how much you are saving by getting Tesla instead of getting any other car.I believe that even though I dislike Elon himself, he invested into a good company and grew it, we need more and more EV cars and motors and everything else so that we would grow more clean and also save money at the same time. If we could have this much profit on solar panels etc as well then all humans would go towards that for their home electricity as well.",

Perhaps they might get close.The real question to ask is how can reducing this number of carbon produced from each vehicle impact the net carbon emissions produced by a given country. Meaning after the carbon investments are made in the EV and the maintenance, what's the net impact at the end of the car's lifespan? Presumably a lot less than people realize. Then you still need to calculate how the reduction in carbon emission from EV's impacts global temperatures (because after all, that's the end goal). The number is close to zero. EV's aren't worth it.",
