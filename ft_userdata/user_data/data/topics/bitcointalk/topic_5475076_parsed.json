But what do you expect from person after entrusting your documents on their care, they all gladly cooperate with government when they request for your details, they will surely comply because they don't want to be out of the business.The best place your privacy can be protected is within you, nobody will keep you safe. Giving your documents just to use a service is not right, using their service one day can lead you to what you don't expect as they can even impound your coins and do what they wish because you accepted their terms and conditions before you registered on the exchange.Your privacy doesn't end with centralized, it goes beyond that. Be careful of the browsers you use especially one like chrome, I don't have a single trust with Google products because they love to personalize users data and do anything they want with it. Use VPN if necessary.",

I can attest to this that this update is not only beneficial to the beginners but also old-timers who does not have this security technical internet ideal just as me.Although at some points, I usually imagine the possibilities of web users privacy I assurances as the websites would always say that they have your Privacies covered and there all your informations remains confidential never to be splited out by web brokers.Meanwhile... Every websites is under operative of a governments authorities which by means I usually suspects it that if the government are curious to catch every web users up, they can obtain the needful lawfully or by authority Influencing the web brokers.OP, you are deeply on point to had brought this clarified my views on how sure we are truly secured with the brokers.So in by any means we get on the trace tracks the non exposure of our address and transactions histories would be the only way out for us as Bitcoin and crypto investors if by any means our government succeedingly in gaining names of membership in the exchange wallets just as formally our government asked Binance to give them lists of the local wallet users in their platforms.So at this take, your identity is possible to be revealed but your holdings and transactions may always stay anonymous if you stick by keeping your addresses and transactions by yourself on the secret moods.",
