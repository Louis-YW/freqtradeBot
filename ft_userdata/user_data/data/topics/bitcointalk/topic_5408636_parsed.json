User have the option to enter a pool and lock their tokens inside for a duration of 30 or 60 days.The APY value correlates with lock duration hence a longer lock period will yield a higher APY.It is possible to claim (harvest) the farmed tokens within the staking platform once the lock period has been fulfilled.User who wishes to continue staking and reinvesting may choose to compound the farmed tokens at any given time which in return would increase the APY.Our staking platform is also designed to gain passive income in USDC from SnoopApe’s daily trading volume.[NFT MINT]SnoopApe was born with a very specific objective that is to offer users with 360-degree services.Upon consideration, we decided that SnoopApe should also incorporate great NFT Utilities.Our NFTs were designed with passion and besides looking fantastic, they also give the possibility of providing a return on investment with passive income all from staking.The total Supply of SnoopApe NFTs is 10K[NFT STAKING]Staking of NFT(s) is one of the hot spots on our dashboard.Mint an NFTs right away and stake them for awesome rewards and passive income.…Ok… But When Launch/WL/PrivateSale ?Before we officially kickstart this project, there will be a round of private sale for whitelisted wallets in which all funds collected will be used for marketing activities prior to our public presale on Pinksale.Private sale will be held once the community is more established and mature.The application for private sale WL is open now so please fell free to complete the 👉Google form here https://forms.gle/361NHxozFJ1yb2d46 and we will keep you updated once we finalize the date.What other long-term benefits after launch?One of our future direction now is to provide a one-stop solution for upcoming ERC20 projects.We are in the midst of developing a sort of launchpad which enables new projects to integrate functions such as Staking, NFT Minting or NFT Staking seamlessly and effortlessly into their existing project ecosystem where they would be able to receive a ready-to-use source codes (generic or customized version) to be integrated into their website.A Sneak Peek of SnoopApe NFT CollectionOur DappsHome Center with News Feed / Chart / Reward TrackersStakingNFT MintNFT StakingSwapPrivateSaleSocial/Link:🌐Website: https://www.snoopape.io/📑Whitepaper: https://www.snoopape.io/assets/files/snoopape_whitepaper.pdf🧬Roadmap: https://www.snoopape.io/#roadmap💬Telegram: https://t.me/SnoopApe🔈Telegram ANN: https://t.me/SnoopApeAnnouncements🐥Twitter: https://twitter.com/SnoopApe👥Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/SnoopApe/🎆Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/snoopape_official/📖Github: https://github.com/snoopape🗂Medium: https://medium.com/@snoopapebsc",

So many.How many have the skills to develop dApps ? Few, and need external dev plus alot of money for developIs there any project that has some kind of launchpad with one-stop solution to get sources for launch their dapps ? None Well, is this SnoopApe's future directionQuoteWhat other long-term benefits after launch?One of our future direction now is to provide a one-stop solution for upcoming ERC20 projects.We are in the midst of developing a sort of launchpad which enables new projects to integrate functionssuch as Staking, NFT Minting or NFT Staking seamlessly and effortlessly into their existing project ecosystemwhere they would be able to receive a ready-to-use source codes (generic or customized version) to be integrated into their website.",

But the problem in general is that when your token has a low transaction volume, you will also only get a small amount of USDC to share, and when the trading volume decreases you don't have enough USDC to share. do you have a solution for this?",
