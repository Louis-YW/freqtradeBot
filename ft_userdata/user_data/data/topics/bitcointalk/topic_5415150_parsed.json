  "content": "Our mission is to create universal and fair access to decentralized assets for billions of people.Website | Whitepaper | Discord | Twitter | Medium | Github | Forum  | ExplorerAptos is a new, independent project to fulfill our vision of delivering the safest and most production-ready blockchain in the world. Aptos was designed with an emphasis on absolute safety, extensible scalability, and credible neutrality — values that we know firsthand and viscerally understand.We are the original creators, researchers, designers, and builders of Diem, the blockchain that was first built to serve this purpose. While the world never got to see what we built, our work is far from over.We have had the luxury of thinking about these problems alongside some of the brightest engineers in the world for years. Since departing Meta (formerly Facebook) we have been able to put our ideas into motion, ditch bureaucratic red tape, and build an entirely new network from the ground up that brings them to fruition. We’re now ready to socialize those ideas more broadly and start shipping the infrastructure that we’ve been perfecting.We have years of experience developing and deploying systems at scale, and our entire team has dedicated our careers to this calling. My cofounder, Avery Ching, is one of the world’s leading experts in building distributed systems and scaling them for billions of users. The rest of the founding team at Aptos consists of an impressive group of PhDs, researchers, engineers, designers and strategists including Alden Hu, Alin Tomescu, David Wolinsky, Greg Nazario, Jake Skinner, Josh Lind, Max Kaplan, Mo Ahmed, Neil Harounian, Rati Gelashivili, Rustie Lin, Sasha Spiegelman, Sherry Xiao, Sital Kedia and Zekun Li.",

If you have bought during the listing site and i do believe if you have been suffering the lost with your money. The price was dropping a lot from its ATH to the bottom. This gonna be the next ICP for sure. I have been dumping my airdrop tokens at the top price. I got very nice profit for free.",

Hopefully, time will change my mind.Retail has been eaten by VC investors yet it's not all of tokens owned by VC has been fully unlocked. I guess there are so many tokens that is still owned by VC investors but these tokens are still being locked. Aptos has been getting so much funds from various VC invetors. that's more than enough to develop a layer 1 blockchain https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/aptos-96b4-seed--636977deIt has been raised around 350 millions USD. there's no point for aptos to do various investment. VC invetors are greedy. they were robbing retail investor's money. This scheme may become long last scheme. The retail invetors will always be the victim.",
