  "content": "My Retired Uncle's Gratuity Invested on BitcoinThe IntroductionI see it a great opportunity for me to make impact in bringing people to know and understand the benefits of bitcoin from fiat and I'd thought about how to get started not until i realize the need to begin with my household, i know the benefits and risk involved in bitcoin investment just with my little experience in it, last weekend was my Uncle's retirement party as a Civil Servant retired from the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC), then i remember i could engage on a conversation with him considering our level of relationship and his trust in me.My First StepI went straight to him after the whole events when calmness was restored in his privacy, that i have a question i will like to ask him but shouldn't take it an insult on his personality because I'd never take my relationship with him for granted, and i asked sir, what is your plan and next move after your retirement? he looked at me and sighed with a deep thought nodding his head, he said nothing until after about 20 seconds before he responded and said \"I don't even know what's good for me right now cousin!\" but all i know is that I've been given my gratuity fund the government could have hold down against me.His PlanHe further explained to me that his only plan with his gratuity is to save it up in the bank on a fix deposit and when his pension arrives, they will be adding an incentive from the fix deposit to his monthly pension and he will be using them all together for his basic daily needs, then here comes my opinion as an advice for him and he admitted i should go ahead, i told him i have three basic plans i would like him to take from me over his retirement, i advised he should divide his gratuity fund into three segments, and then i will expose him to how he will be making a good return instead of spending from it.My AdviseI asked him to invest 30% of his gratuity fund into agricultural farming business since we are in the raining season, planting of arable cash crops like vegetables could be a good business with high demands,  another 30% into starting a roadside Snack Bar, while the last advise was to make an investment with the 40% left in Bitcoin, then i begin to discuss with him about bitcoin and how he can invest in it instead of having his gratuity with bank, i took time to explain to him many reasons why he needs to invest in bitcoin, i went through some search on the forum for related topics about bitcoin, and i clarified him the differences bitcoin has from other cryptocurrencies.I used my experience as well in explaining to him and gave him some online materials to read about bitcoin investment, he finally agreed, come into symphony with me and asked me to give him some time to think about it, but to my greatest surprise he called me the third day to say all my ideas were all accepted, that he related everything we discussed with a family friend after his second thoughts over it and all the outcome he concluded about it was a good and welcome idea, he told me he has heard about bitcoin before now but don't know anything regarding it, sometimes he sees the billboard or handbills on bitcoin and heard news about bitcoin, but all that never draw his interest in knowing better about it nor give a try, then i explained to him about bitcoin, how to acquire it, differences between centralized and decentralized exchanges, bitcoin price speculation, what volatility means, advantage of digital currency (bitcoin) over fiat or CBDC, and introduced him to bitcointalk.org forum to know more about bitcoin from the community. I also explained the types of wallets and recommended electrum wallet for him and asked him to safeguard his keys away from everyone including me, right now he has invested in bitcoin taking the current advantage of the dip in bitcoin price and set in with the exact 40% from his gratuity fund while other project plans where in progress just as advised.My MotivationThere's a slogan that says charity begins at home, if you're thinking about seing bitcoin adoption a global responsibility then it begins with you right from where you are.",

So, your uncle is investing his entire stash into high risk assets, which has potential for high returns, but also the risk of losses.P.S, I'm not shitting on your ideas, they can possibly be profitable overtime, but it would be wise to do your due diligence in research on all the suggested investment ideas and draw up an investment plan over a period of time, rather than going all in. You should take this more serious if he does not have more savings besides the newly gotten gratuity.",

I can introduce and teach my family members about bitcoin. Maybe give them the positive and negative point of owning bitcoin. I will not give them financial advises though. We do not know how people will react to losses so giving them financial advise on something that we know is very volatile can backfire to us. It may ruin the relationship with them if they cannot take the losses when bitcoin price goes down. If they understand bitcoin and they already know how to protect their assets, then they can choose on their own to invest or not. In understand, I mean the bitcoin as the technology not the financial asset that others are pushing. The way I see it, your uncle is already old and most old people are not tech savvy and sometimes they can be easily scammed. So it is vital that he understand and know by heart how to properly store and protect his bitcoins. I hope you discussed it thoroughly to him the utmost important of security here since he is the only one who can protect it.",

At this stage of life, people do not understand new technology very easily and crypto is even more difficult to understand as any carelessness with the private key can make him lose his hard earned pension.

If it's a good bank, and he needs to ensure at least some of this money doesn't get lost in the process (and investing in Bitcoin means one should be ready to lose), I'd say it's okay. As for businesses (snack bar and agriculture), I don't know how risky it is, and I probably wouldn't try to find out. I do know that starting one's own business is pretty risky and few make it to profits. It's also a labor-intensive thing, while buying and hodling Bitcoin is not.",

Farming is actually pretty safe these days, especially when we could be facing shortages in Europe, which can have impact on the whole world. Buying agricultural land is one of the best things you can do if you have a lot of money lying around in a bank. As far as bitcoin goes, I don't consider it to be high risk after over 60% correction from the high price. If we were in an uptrend, 100% above 200 week MA, we could say it's high risk, but we are at the level where bitcoin used to be only a few times in its history and those were always low price points. Chances of us going to 100k next halving are very high and compared to that you have inflation higher than what any bank can offer you. If what his uncle has is for instance 100k USD, he's going to be losing 5% a year, no matter where he keeps the money, unless he puts it to work in a business, buys some art or real estate.",

Farming isn't an easy business to indulge. It may look simple to the eyes as one would think it's just putting crops in the soil and watch them grow or just buying a few birds from the hatchery and allow them roam around, feed and grow. Farming is like taking care of life. Crops and birds die the same way humans do too.I've mixed reaction on the invest in Bitcoin thing for elderly people. I feel elderly people should learn how to relax and have a feel of life through nature. Watch birds sing. Everything isn't about making money. Old people should steer clear of Bitcoin. It's volatile and erratic. That won't be good for their frame of mind, as most of them are prone to high blood pressure disease.",

It also needs a big dedication to raise this investment and more time should be dedicated here.  It's not just a simple planting plant, raising animals and so on. The other business, Snack Bar, also has lots of concerns to deal with and in order to have this investment successful, it should also be hands-on, as always.What I'm saying is, with these various investments that will be executed at the same time, agricultural, snack bar, bitcoin - do you think it can be handled properly along the way?

It may look simple to the eyes as one would think it's just putting crops in the soil and watch them grow or just buying a few birds from the hatchery and allow them roam around, feed and grow. Farming is like taking care of life. Crops and birds die the same way humans do too.I've mixed reaction on the invest in Bitcoin thing for elderly people. I feel elderly people should learn how to relax and have a feel of life through nature. Watch birds sing. Everything isn't about making money. Old people should steer clear of Bitcoin. It's volatile and erratic. That won't be good for their frame of mind, as most of them are prone to high blood pressure disease.Since they are old then it would be understandable that they are really having those issues with health and its true that whenever you do reach out into this particular age level then money wont really be the mainpriority but rather making yourself relaxed after all the years you've been into and trying out to face up lots of challenges just to raise up your kids and make them grow and live their own lives.Your responsibility is already done and enough and aiming for more money is somewhat pointless on this particular time.Its not bad to aim for money but it should be on that certain extreme extent.",

I guess some of them seeing the high inflation in place are beginning to see what we saw before and they are now buying the idea of seeing Bitcoin as an investment .",
