Such discussions are very much helpful in terms of analysis provision and other information that can help sports bettors make better-informed decisions as they stake the bet, More exciting it is that this thread is coming at a time when various football leagues are on,  this is just a start of a new season so we should expect to see comments.",

You are completely right, unfortunately my team lost against Colombia, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth, I didn't see the team as bad, but I didn't see them well either , plus one comment that I didn't like was that they said that Luis Diaz was more valuable that the entire Veneuel squad, which earned me a comment in bad taste, because okay, I know that Luis Diaz is a star, but in Europe, because when he played against Venezuela he couldn't even score a goal, so he was a star in everything. In both cases Hubeice scored many goals, or at least one, and in truth the goal they scored was due to the carelessness of the central defender who was careless and did not run until the Colombian arrived and scored the goal with a header, an almost flavorless goal, but at the same time final is a goal, so good for the Coloibano who did a good job, but I think the team lacks more, in addition we must recognize that they were stuf in Barranquilla, where the Referee also greatly favored Colomiba, worthy of any local, to have certain rpivileges that the others do not , However until now the elimination rounds have begun, there is still a long way to go.One of the most Popular games in the second half was Argentina vs. Ecuador It seems to me that the Ecuadorians have not lost the level they had during the World Cup , and here their star Messi came out and scored a great goal like If he placed it with his hand, he didn't have a chance to hit the goalkeeper, Messi is very good at free kicks, he totally fooled the Goalkeeper, I think that until now in the qualifiers that has been the best goal of all , I have I have a lot of hope for a game in particular, it's Brazil vs Bolivia, I want to see how the Brazil team is playing, which I don't know, but I'm very curious about how they will be playing , because Brazil has so many stars that I don't know what they will come out with, although Maybe there I read something that I didn't like, that maybe Anthony hadn't been summoned, I don't remember why, but I don't know if it was fake news , since it was on Facebook and sometimes they make some of the very fake Publications.",

American and Asian competitions are rarely discussed here, that's why it would be better to make a unique topic about all of them until we see that they deserve their own thread Brazil punished Bolivia with 5 goals to 1, good performance from Rodrygo and Neymar who both scored 2 goals. Uruguay 3 - 1 Chile, I expected more from Chile, at least a draw..Next round will take place in 3 days with Bolivia - Argentina and Peru - Brazil mainly.",

Now we can enjoy every discussion on football.It is very \"strange\" that there is not a thread for one of the most successful confederations of all, given its relationship between countries and World Cup winners, in short, I think that hopefully the thread will manage to stay in good contention, with true analysis and no \"template\" answers, it's a shame that OP hadn't put in a thread with moderation and the truth is that I don't like them, but given the situation with the sports topic on the board, it would been preferable.Brazil should have scored 12 goals, that's my calculation, I already mentioned it recently, I like it when they win these easy games 1x0, 2x0, that gives them reflection, and not overconfidence, in any case it's a long road...I didn't see the other games, so... but I saw the summary of the vzla, Colombia and Argentina-Ecuador; two \"powerful\" teams against the supposed \"weak ones\".Venezuela and Ecuador, they did what they always do in this Zone,  defend themselves and take advantage of the opportunities , it was not easy but they are two teams that if they do not want to find themselves with difficulties at the end of this difficult conference, They should not let these close matches slip away. Valuable draw points are crucial.In fact, the home factor is crucial to qualify (Obviously, but in the CONMEBOL qualifiers, even more...), so the only one who could do the \"task\" on this first day was Peru, who managed to get a valuable firts point. (So, Bad job! for the others visitors teams, since everyone who played at home got the 3 points).",

Now that Neymar has played for Brazil. It is now that he does not have the zeal to play for his new club in Saudi Arabia.Who says that he is not willing to play for his new club. If Neymar is not interested in playing for his new club, why sign the exorbitant contract? It is just that the media likes whoever that is doing well and whose name is popular. They make more money when they mention names like Neymar, Ronaldo, Mbappe, Messi and more of them.",

Its also good to watch Brazil win without a number of players; with Ancelloti coming soon; they are in good hands.",
