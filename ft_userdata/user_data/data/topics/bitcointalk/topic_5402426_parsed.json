I was upsetSorry to hear this kind of story.   I am glad that you were not at home during the robbery.  Or else you could have been hurt in that incident.Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 13, 2022, 02:09:32 PMWhat is the most expensive thing you've bought with your winnings from a casino or sports bet that you've never used or used only a few times or even maybe regretted buying?I won a jackpot in FortuneJack Dice twice, the first one is $18k+ and the next one is $6k+.  This almost covers the cost of a small townhouse worth $26k  so I  just add an extra fund from my earnings in the signature campaign and bought it.   It feels good to buy something from both earnings and luck in gambling.  Though I would not advise making gambling a source of our income but rather take the opportunity to buy something that will appreciate over time when luck presents us the opportunity of winning a huge amount of money.",

At that time my annual rent was a month due, i used my winnings to settle it, and the little fraction left well, can't say i remember what i used that for  and that is something i can't say i regret.So the most expensive thing i have spent my winnings on, is not something that i regret.",

That's one thing i came to regret because of all my winnings from gambling, i have never bought something valuable or something that could be very beneficial in the future. I could have bought a piece of lot because its price will certainly appreciate in the future or even a car for my family. All i have are just these small gadgets that i think will only lose value later on. And the rest of my winnings were just lost in a thin air, maybe some were lose too in gambling since i keep chasing my luck that time.",

For me I didn't win that much as well because I do not have such a good luck but then again it was amazing and worth it !",

I was fortunate that I won so much money that would be enough to stock my house with food. I immediately called my wife and she was coming she was complaining that I needed to do something before we starve to death. Immediately I brought out the cash I just won and gave her part of the money to go to the market. My wife gave me the warmest hug I have ever received from her. She went to the market and bought all we needed. I had enough food until the lock-down was lifted.
