      "body": "Another news item in this style, but with the recent price increase, items like this I think are more wishful thinking than reality. And mind you, I too wish the worst was over and the price was going up, but to mention $500,000 now is laughable, when someone predicted last year that we would be at that price as of today. I also remember the famous \"I will eat my dick on national TV\" who made similar failed predictions.  FFirst of $1,000,000 and then $500,000 by the end of 2020.We will get to $500,000 at some point but I don't think it is very unbiased to talk about it now.",

Right now his opinion is on pair with the dirty socks in the laundry, zero!What is annoying is that instead of simply doing the great exit of shame, the %$^% keeps opening his mouth, now with a bullish prediction of course to try to get some sympathy back by coming with the 500k pe bitcoin song.QuoteNovogratz said his heart doctor recently lost $1 million in the collapse of Celsius.I would change doctors!We're up back to 24k and seems like every gerbil that ran 10 feet deep underground during the crash has come back up and declared everything is over!One more dip back to 20k and all they are going to go silent again.",

I want to be optimistic but what is the argument for bitcoin now? It is a weak hedge for inflation, it cannot be a reserve currency and will the fees sustain the network forever? I am afraid this reality is slowly being understood, but also being silent about it.",

I personally would be ashamed and would not go out in public for at least a while, but some people obviously have no remorse no matter what they do.Quote from: bbc.reporter on July 21, 2022, 05:31:42 AMHeheheehe I agree that the person who has said it is a joker, however, is the worst really over or is he someone similar to our favorite 2018 friend Tom Lee?I already mentioned something before about Tom Lee and Novogratz, and that is that I never thought that I would put these two in roughly the same category, but that's what happened. Tom Lee is a man who has been consistent in his statements, no matter how misguided they may have been, and honestly he always seemed very confused and hesitant to me when I watched any video where he talked about Bitcoin. When he announced the ban of Bitcoin in the US because Trump banned some kind of cigarettes (flavored or electronic, I don't remember anymore) I think he hit the bottom of his speculations.Quote from: bbc.reporter on July 21, 2022, 05:31:42 AMI want to be optimistic but what is the argument for bitcoin now?

I am afraid this reality is slowly being understood, but also being silent about it.Bitcoin has always been a decentralized cryptocurrency and that is what it is intended for, no matter what people want it to be. You worry too much about what other people think about Bitcoin and the way they treat it - because if I had respected the opinion of those around me, I would never have been as involved in Bitcoin as I am today. Bitcoin has another very important feature, it is not a political or interest project that has to fulfill a given expectation in a certain time, which means that it has a great advantage over many projects.",

Should we as investors begin buying again and wait for the bull market to return or do we wait for a dump lower? I really want him to be correct but his Luna tattoo might be a warning sign that he might be wrong again hehehehehe.In any case, there is also news that coins from Mt.Gox will be returned to the owners. I speculate that much of them would become the marginal sellers of this bear market and dump much of their coins causing another low.",

      "body": "@bbc.reporter, any statement regarding the current state of Bitcoin in terms of price is just speculation based on someone's personal opinion without any concrete facts or evidence, or based on TA that is far from reliable. My feeling tells me that the worst may not be over yet, although I may be wrong and the price has reached the bottom. A serious investor knows that it is very difficult to guess the best moment, so he will invest gradually using the DCA method, regardless of the price - so he may only increase his investments during a bear market.I think that MT.Gox is an overblown story that wants to manipulate the market in the sense that everyone will get their BTC back at one time and that everyone will sell it at the same time. However, it is known that everyone who claims their funds received a choice of payment in fiat or BTC (BCH), so we should not be afraid that some kind of mass dump will happen.It also seems to me that I read somewhere that the payments will be made gradually, so not everyone will receive the payment at the same time. However, considering how long that Japanese drama lasts, I wouldn't be surprised if nothing happens this year either.",
