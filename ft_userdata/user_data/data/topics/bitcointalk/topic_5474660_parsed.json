  "content": "Hello everyone, for a long time I wanted a physical bitcoin to put in my room, like a decoration, I even bought some online but I never liked their quality and I always found them very ugly, as most are made in low-quality matrices. quality. So from that I decided to make my own bitcoin made on a CNC machining center, I really liked the result, it was a unique and VERY EXCLUSIVE item, detail, I wrote the name of our forum and my nickname.I hope you like it as much as I did, it's the way it came out of the machine, I still don't know if I'm going to have it painted or polished to make this item more beautiful.I will post photos of the final result and below photos of the manufacturing and development. It's even cool for those who have no idea how metals are transformed to know it too!edit: NEW PICS!detail for my nickname and forum namedevelopment and manufacturing carried out with SolidWorks and SolidCAM softwareNow in the manufacturing process, the part was made in a ROMI D800 machining center",

The cost of one of these is per machine hour, it costs about 50 dollars per hour, the piece in total took about 7 to 8 hours each side.

The price drops a lotthe complete manufacturing we have a total of 800 dollars on average, as I work on it, I did it myself, the cost was just my time. Due to the quality and exclusivity, I don't think it's expensive, but it's relative, it can be expensive for one person and not for another.Quote from: NotATether on November 21, 2023, 12:34:23 PMAw yeah!  Given that the 3d model is quite complicated, I wonder, did you design the model yourself, or had someone else do it?Quote from: criptoevangelista on November 21, 2023, 10:56:22 AMThe cost of one of these is per machine hour, it costs about 50 dollars per hour, the piece in total took about 7 to 8 hours.

To solve this we would have to place an even smaller tool, and with a smaller tool, we must necessarily reduce the cutting increments and machining feeds. which would result in much more machine time, which I didn't have available on the day. I needed the piece to be manufactured overnight. Where the equipment would have free time.So the size that was an interesting value for money was this, diameter 130mm. the original idea was not a coin or something, it was an item to display on a table or shelfwriting tool:",
