I think domain names doesn't made that incredible gains yet even in the recent bull run. In my opinion, domain name market is set to have its run and I think in the coming years it will be a thing. People will surely want decentralized domain names and I don't think it's a failed experiment, that's the thing they say in the past. Everything is going decentralized and I won't doubt if it will replace ICANN.",

Space Id works alot in decentralized domain and still working on providing best result. This is new technology and will be used when all sites convert to web3. Security in these decentralized domain is much higher and many people love to hide privacy will definitely prefer these domain. As far as replacing ICANN i think it is not easy for Blockchain based domain to complete replace over technology which already used in world wide. Decentralized domain will help empowering the current sites system just like btc is still not replace over banks system but help people in many other ways and same I expected from Blockchain based domain also",

I have read before about decentralized domain and how they are supposed to help to fight against censorship and abuse from domain registers. Though, I must say people never seemed to be very enthusiastic on the decentralized system for the registering of websites. People still continue to use centralized services like GoDaddy, etc.Â  Probably, because in the eyes on the average no coiner is more convenient to go for the traditional ways, instead learning and educating themselves about projects like Namecoin.It is kind of disappointing how people did not care enough of Namecoin.",

      "body": "The problem with decentralized domain name services we have right now is that, we need to have decentralized id/names for each chain across an array of Blockchains which doesn't seem to make much sense. The reason why ENS is so popular is because it is easy to integrate it to wallets and smart contracts to support it. But it becomes a problem when we need different decentralized IDs/Names for each chain and they're not interoperable or used across other chains.Adoption isn't rapid as well because it cost between $10 - $100 on average to get a decentralized name on a particular chain (this is dependent on a number of factors like # of years to register amongst other things).",

There needs to be a way to admin the content. At least for the node runners option not to participate something illegal and disturbing.Decentralized domains names are \"immutable\". What's not \"immutable\" is the server where the website is hosted. That can be easily fixed by using alternative networks such as IPFS or ZeroNet. Unfortunately, developers don't care about this as they're only \"following the money\". It's this reason why it's so easy for governments to shut down websites, particularly those that are crypto-oriented. The perfect combination would be to host the website on IPFS and use a decentralized domain provider such as ENS or Unstoppable Domains. Websites would become truly-decentralized, and most of all, censorship-resistant. Darknet doesn't come even close to Blockchain-powered websites, especially when I've read that the Tor network is compromised. I understand the issue of \"hosting illegal stuff\", but isn't the whole point of the Internet about \"neutrality\"? People are responsible of what they put on the web. Ultimately, validators on a decentralized network will decide whenever or not they will allow illegal content \"to go through\".Â  As long as everything is done right, there should be nothing to worry about.

Hype is what kills promising projects in the long run. Decentralized domain names hold promise to make websites resistant against government censorship. If only developers put them to good use, things would've been different now. So far, decentralized names have been used for NFTs. ENS and Unstoppable Domains seem to be the most popular services right now. There was Namecoin-based domains (ending in .bit), but I believe the project is nothing but dead. A pity because this, combined with decentralized CDNs (eg: IPFS) would've made the internet a better place. Maybe someday, right?",
