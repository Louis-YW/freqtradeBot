  "content": "Rizful is a tool I recently found Stacker News that I think has a LOT of potential for bitcoiners of all kinds. Basically it is a service for instant and disposable lightning nodes.This could be really helpful for people who travel a lot or who live a more nomadic lifestyle and accessing your own node might not be very easy. If you're new to lightning and want to learn how it works without having to run your own node and manually manage liquidity, Rizful is probably the best tool I have found on the internet. 🏠 Your home base for⚡zaps.  🚀 High-performance.  🕙 Online 24/7.    🚮 Disposable.  ⛓️‍💥 No big tech💡 Built for education✨ Ready to use   Nostr wallet connect📱💻 Use any deviceLet me know what you think.",

      "body": "its not a node. its an appyou have to give your funds to a central service and they give you inbound balance displayed in app. you dont have your own wallet nor do you have your own full node of archived blockchain. instead your app speaks to a central server which reconciles balance when payments are made.dont be fooled into thinking this is an easy to use full node and full self custody wallet thing.. its not",

      "body": "Hi, thanks for posting about this. We built this project, you can see some background about us here: https://megalithic.me/... And you can see a description of the service here: https://rizful.com/Rizful is designed for people who want to run a Lightning Node, keep relatively small balances on it, but don't want to actually run the node on their OWN machine..... You can see our guide to ACTUALLY running your own lightning node, on your own machine here: https://docs.megalithic.me/category/should-i-run-a-lightning-nodeRunning a Lightning Node on your OWN hardware effectively requires 24/7 uptime -- i.e. a computer you never turn off, and an internet connection that never goes down. It's a interesting thing to do, but not for everyone.So if you try Rizful, you'll see that you have your own Lightning Node running in the \"the cloud\". Note: It's not a \"web wallet\" as such -- it's literally an entire Lightning Node -- you can open and close your own channels, etc. If you are interested in the technical side -- we're using Docker to give each user his own node. One issue we found with a lot of \"node in the cloud\" solutions was that they were pretty slow to start and stop nodes... Rizful is designed that, if you want, you can have a \"disposable\" node -- i.e. literally start one up, open some channels, sends some sats around, and then literally stop and delete it five minutes later.But --Yes, you are relying on us to keep the service up-and-running... but most of all -- you should not use Rizful or really ANY online service to store SIGNIFICANT amounts of BTC -- you should always use a hardware wallet with a seed backup... Rizful (and other cloud nodes, and actually Lightning Nodes in general!) .. should be looked at as \"hot wallet\" where you only store a small fraction of your sats, that you might want to spend in the near future.Rizful is also designed around NWC -- Nostr Wallet Connect -- which allows you to hook up your node to lots of Nostr application.Any questions, please feel free to shoot! thanks!",
