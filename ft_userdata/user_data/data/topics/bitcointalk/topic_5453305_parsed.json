If interested my telegram @Faiza910 or pm. it is a great idea that you are trying to promote your referral link on the forum by giving only 10$. But I doubt you will receive the fund or not if you cant share the link on any social media sites. You should know that they are able to verify where the lead came from and also if they can catch you are misusing the referral system then I think both the account of you and/or the account of the referred user will be banned.",

If interested my telegram @Faiza910 or pm. First of all, can you tell us which 100$ reward you are referring here ?Also since you are a newbbie with 3 posts only, maybe you do not pay anyone who signed under your referral code. So do you think you should go for a grantee that you will pay this 10$ who will do the task ? (as this task will require a KYC).If you think that 10$ is not worth the escrow, deal with anyone with a good repute by paying the amount first.",

As I'm promoting my referral link through my cryptocurrency blog, I'm getting a few referrals every now and then. I got the same offer as OP and I'm lacking 15 USDT more to reach $100, so I can withdraw the fund (as a trading fee rebate). OP, if you are thinking you are going to get them as USDT, I think you are missing some info (or am I). They are going to give you a trading fee rebate which still is a good offer though.",

Yesterday I saw a 100$ offer and today I have seen it is a 50$ offer. So, op is trying to take such an offer, I think. Hopefully, think you have got the point of view of the OP. You can see the screenshot below. Also, you can check it from the Lite referral",

Anyways as he told he was just one referral away, better he get that referral naturally as he may have got other referels. If he does not come to this thread again, it would mean his work has been done.  By the promoting referal links on the forum is prohibtded. Is it allowed to promote them via PM",
