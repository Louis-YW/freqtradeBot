No problem at all.QuoteWhat exactly the current status of your miner? Why did you want it to upgrade it?Its keeps restarting again and again once start. Sometimes shows quite high temperature and sometimes keeps the hash rate zero while everything connected okay. And sometime works good without any issue. So i think upgrading the firmware could fix the issue.   QuoteIf its not working due to firmware issue your last hope is to replace the control board.I am not sure whether its firmware issue or power supply issue as power supply is normal.  Thanks.",

I can't say if it's a firmware issue but it is more likely a PSU issue.Can you still access the WebGUI or dashboard?If you can still access through the miner's IP would you mind checking the API logs or any logs that contain your miner's activity logs? Maybe we can find the issue under that logs?Post the logs here don't forget to put it inside the code tag a # button you can find it while editing your post.Also, I would like you to try is to hard reset the miner by holding the IP or reset button for 15 to 20 seconds then release.Set up the miner again then test.",
