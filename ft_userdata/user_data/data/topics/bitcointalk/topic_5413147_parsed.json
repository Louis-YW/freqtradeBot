He is determined to make an impact in the world with his music and direct interaction with the fans. Contrary to most celebrities, Shaddow is taking an approach where he is easily reachable; which is very admirable. This time, it is with a very exciting dance challenge dabbed #BitcoinBillionaireDanceChallenge.Shaddow's Bitcoin Billionaire single was produced by Tre 8 in 2017. His motivation for making his version of the song was to sensitize people on the unlimited possibilities of making a fortune with cryptocurrency. His intention was to encourage more people to use bitcoin and cryptocurrency around the world. The artist, best known for his Street-Jazz style of music, had this response when interviewed: \"You know I saw myself as being a bitcoin billionaire…\" he said. \"It's spread out amongst the people so that every man and woman got a shot at becoming a millionaire or billionaire with cryptocurrency.\" The song is available on all major streaming platforms including YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, iHeart Radio, Spotify and Amazon.This challenge creates an opportunity for Shaddow's fans all around the world to join and participate.
