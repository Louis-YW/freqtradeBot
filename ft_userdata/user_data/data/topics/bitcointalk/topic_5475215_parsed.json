      "body": "That transaction fee was either payed base on mistake by the sender or rather just a way to spread FUD just like how you have fallen into it now. If read through the forum many have made mistakes of such in the past where some got the excess payment back by the mining pool. Although one can’t predict the future but bitcoin transaction can never even amount to a 0.1 bitcoin been payed as a fee. The high transaction issue is just because of the congestion of the mempool due to ordinals and inscriptions, something that I bet you the hype will die down soon. Should it last long it will be to the bull run after then just like all shit coins do it will rug pull",

It is very convenient for sending large and even medium amounts but not for small payments, and LN, which is a proposed solution, is only partially so because it is necessary to open channels in the blockchain and it is not clear that it could support all global payments either, given that there are many other alternatives for this.",

You can send your money to whoever you want, without asking for permission. With a good degree of privacy. And fast (10 minutes is very fast)If you don't care about decentralization and only about fees, just use Visa. Bitcoin wasn't made so you can buy a coffee (although you can already do that )About $1 being too high... I can say you just don't need bitcoin. When you need it, you will find it very cheap. For example, a SWIFT can cost you more than than 20 USD and take nearly a week to get your money.",

Transacting the whole of Bitcoin in circulation can not even amount to that transaction fees. Something fishy is behind that transaction if it wasn't an error from the sender. What a waste of coins!Recently, there's actually a hike in transaction fees due to congestion and the ordinals hype but that's a temporary situation that'll last for little moment. There's nothing to be panic about here as things will be back to normalcy soon. If fees are this high, then bitcoin will be more worse than government and their banks in criminality.",

But still I can see that bitcoin fee are rapidly increasing which is not good at all for the users. I think the fee will be reduced in some days and even if the price of the bitcoin moves up then it would  be another scene.",

Actually you have 2 sending solutions here, using LN or a centralized wallet.Bitcoin has been dollar indifferent since its inception, the famous term is \"1BTC=1BTC\". $5 satoshi today was only worth a few cents 7 years ago.",

The simple reason is that almost nobody has 100BTC to use for a transaction fee, given that the supply is limited to 21 million BTC.Simply put, there are just not enough bitcoins to fill up every transaction in the block with that kind of fee.",

Mempool can not be that congested for people to pay such fee. Paying one address from one input takes just less than $6 right now at fee rate of 104 sat/vbyte.I will like to use an instance of when the mempool was congested few days ago and users have to increase their transaction fees to get attended to by miners, which made some of the transactions delayed for a whole day while others were more than that, because of these congestions, users have been faced with increasing the transaction fees which have been increasing gradually. Although it is still very much at the affordable rates as you mentioned, but over time, as the population and the usability increases, do you think the transaction fees could ever rise to the level of paying that much? I think that's the question the questioner asked, just to put it in a proper perspective.Also, I am aware that this act could be centered towards causing FUD in the market, and not just a mistake. Even though as human beings, we are inevitable from mistakes,  we are most times very careful when it comes to finances especially as it states that it is nonrefundable. Don't you also think it in this perspective?",

QuoteWith transaction fees like this, and traffic inevitably going up over the years, will Bitcoin become unaffordable to use?I cannot deny the fact that the transaction fees of Bitcoin is at all time high. If this continuous then Bitcoin's mainstream adoption will take a big hit. Because no one would use Bitcoin just because of the high fees rather they would be more comfortable in banking transactions. I don't know if there is any way to remove ordinals from the Bitcoin network, but this seems very necessary. Bitcoin needs to stay competitive in order to gain mainstream adoption and acceptance.",
