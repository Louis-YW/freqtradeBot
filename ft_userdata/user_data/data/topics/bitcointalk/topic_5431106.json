  "content": "This could be good idea or stupid idea but what would it be like if we use the space on the profile to display the QR code for the address which has been entered into the BTC Address field?Well just a small edit to imagine how it would look like. This can help us send the bitcoins quickly to any user we want. Lets say by just scanning the QR code from you phone you can capture the correct address. We can also avoid mistakes of copying incomplete addresses or wrong addresses on the clipboard. For QR codes, it will be error free as long as user has entered the wrong address. We could take this even further by adding one more QR code below the address QR code. This could be our PGP key for profile verification. This can add additional account authenticity. As far as I have seen, we are sticking the bitcoin address and signed message on the thread and someone is verifying it for us. We can either link PGP to QR and display it directly. Or if this idea ring a bell for even more other ideas related to this then do comment about them too.",

      "body": "The idea on its own i think is a good 0ne but it faces challenges. One of those might be a lack of checking the address you've scanned is the right one. I've an updated version of android where you can derive the text of a qr code from a photo/screenshot, for those that rely on third party apps this is another spectre of attack.There's the question too of what you scan? Do you scan a bitcoin address or a link (this isn't standard among bitcoin wallets either, especially on mobile)? And if it's a link, you could argue a link should be placed in the address field too (although I'm uncertain as to why it isn't).I think it'd be a good use of the space where an Avatar is though (perhaps below it) and it's not a bad idea as most mobile wallets have qr Integration.",

      "body": "Okay. May be in the future when it becomes more prominent to use only bitcoin as way of transacting everywhere. :-DJust for heads up, I was talking about the address linked on the profile. So whenever I copy paste a new address in that field it shall create new QR and update the same on my profile. However, since we will have PGP key QR it can not be updated or signed with new address as long as new address really belongs to us! But anyways it seems there are only couple of advantages and lot of disadvantages in implementing such QR integration. May be we can only update a public address which is apart from our cold storage wallets. Endless possibilities but I think it will take time for perfect executions.",

Every time you lose your focus and attention, you increase the likelihood that something might go wrong or that you will commit an irreversible mistake.I guess it depends on what kind of horror stories you had in mind.First of all, you can't send bitcoin to a non-existing address. That would be rejected by the network. I am not sure if something like that is possible on a protocol level even with faulty wallets. But, you can send BTC to the wrong address, lose your money, and don't get what you paid for. Other dangers with QR codes is that hackers replace them with their own addresses. This also depends on the location of said codes. I haven't done any research, but I have never read or come across a case where a person scanned a QR code and ended up sending coins to the wrong address (one that has got nothing to do with the one they scanned).",

I dont know, there are some good points that its useless ideas since no one really cares about the QR codes. Or simply how many of them might be using it to scan and pay the users. The idea really came to mind after seeing that our devices are capable of \"reading\" the QR codes right from the screen. This means you do not even need your phone camera to see the QR, because it just gets read by the screen itself. The technologies developing with lightening speed. May be soon it would be available for the desktop/laptops where, once we are on users profile it will read out the QR and ask whether we are interested in sending the funds. User can simply proceed or not proceed as per the intention of visiting the profile. For instance this project:Code:https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode#easy-mode---with-end-to-end-scanner-user-interfaceQuoteSupports two kinds of APIsHtml5QrcodeScanner — End-to-end scanner with UI, integrate with less than ten lines of code.Html5Qrcode — Powerful set of APIs you can use to build your UI without worrying about camera setup, handling permissions, reading codes, etc.Support for scanning local files on the device is a new addition and helpful for the web browser which does not support inline web-camera access in smartphones. Note: This doesn't upload files to any server — everything is done locally.For example, working on the same example as I have mentioned in the OP (@theymos address). Lets say we hit the profile of theymos and it read out the QR and shows below result.Obviously below is just example, without proper UI, not meant for such application but it could be something like that. May be there is time for such tool integration.",
