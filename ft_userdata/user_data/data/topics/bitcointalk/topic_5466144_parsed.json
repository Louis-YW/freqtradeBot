  "content": "Transaction blocks would have remained so bulky and more resource demanding if merkle trees wasn't introduced. Maybe the cost of making a successful p2p transaction would have been so discouraging. But with the level of structured transaction data and less resourceful demands the merkle tree introduced to the blockchain through hashing of a made transaction with an equivalent hash value where by hash values that are produced are paired with another hash value so they can be hashed again.This hashing keeps going on until a final hash value is produces the merkle root which provided the general summary of all the transactions of the block it contains which then gets inserted into the block header. And this process makes it more resource managing and efficient for transaction to get structured in a tree like entry reserving more space in the blockchain.Lets say we have a hash value 'BC' which gets combined with another has \"BD\" the both will create a \"BCD\" hash such that the data remains temper proof and unaltered. Benefits of Markle Tree It doesn't consume disk spaceValidates data integrity and consistencyIt provides a very efficient data formatIt is flexible enough to provide just tiny chunks of data across networks",
