  "content": "Does anyone know some reliable ETH testnet (Goerli) faucets out there? I have found a few, but most of them require you to have some ETH in the main net first. I'm guessing that's on purpose, so you don't spam them with multiple addresses but I'd like one that doesn't have that. Please share if you know any.",

Alright so in case anyone is interested, here are the limitations for each one of them:https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de -> This is what I went for. It takes some time (a few minutes) since you'll be \"mining them\" but doesn't require you to have ETH on mainnet.https://goerlifaucet.com and https://faucet.quicknode.com/drip -> Both require you to hold 0.001 ETH.https://sepoliafaucet.com (Just for sepolia testnet as you might have guessed) -> You don't need to have any funds on the mainnet, and you can get 0.5 ETH per day.You probably won't need to use anything but the last service though. Georli is going to shutdown by the end of the year so if you don't need ETH for a specific service that only supports Goerli (like in my case) you should probably go with Sepolia instead.",

Are there mining process on this testnet? And who is responsible for it?Cheers,The faucet is mainly used for testing. It's no different than the Bitcoin testnet network. If you're developing a new service (exchange, wallet, etc.) you don't want to use (or your users) real BTC or ETH. That's where these faucets come into play. So yes, you can interact with smart contracts just like you would with the main network.As for your second question, SepoliaFaucet is run by Alchemy (a very well-known company) in the Web3 space that provides APIs and SDKs for EVM-compatible chains. I would imagine that the main purpose of the faucet is to make life easier for developers building using their tools so it makes sense for them to ask users to link their Alchemy accounts.I don't believe there's any mining process involved either since ETH is now Proof-of-stake. The mining referred to above might be just set by that specific website, in order to stop people from spamming the faucet and draining it (it's just a guess though).",

Honestly, I had not heard of this network before, and I am sure that many others did not, due to the absence of discussions about it. And after I checked this network, I saw that it is important not only for developers but also for beginners to learn the basics of using the main network Ethereum.On this basis, I intend to create a topic in my local section that talks in detail about the Ethereum testnet, its benefits, and how to use it. All I need is more time to try out all the features and evaluate them properly. If you have any other useful links, please feel free to share them with me here.Cheers,",

Especially those who want to test new projects need test ETHs continuously. That's why testnet faucets dry very quickly. There is currently no problem in Sepolia. Fill your addresses with test coins while you can. It may be needed in the future.",

If you have any other useful links, please feel free to share them with me here.You can start from here, there's a list of Ethereum's testnets, and a few articles for each:https://www.alchemy.com/list-of/testnets-on-ethereumAs mentioned by @EFS. You may want to stick to Sepolia.If you want to play around with it, you can use the faucet above to get some ETH and then head to Uniswap -> Link your MetaMask and then change the network to Sepolia (it should be there by default, you don't have to add it as you normally would for the other EVM-compatible chains).",

Yes, there is such faucets, for which you do not need to have a minimum balance in the Ethereum network and which allows you to mine sepolia - https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/ And you correctly decided now to accumulate this test coin, since it will be required to work in the test network if you are engaged in performing tasks in the testnet.",
