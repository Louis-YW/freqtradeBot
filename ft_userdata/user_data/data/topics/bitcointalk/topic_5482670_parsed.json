      "body": "119k Bitcoin by a couple days ago. And as of morning of the 25th (yesterday) Blackrock alone had already added about 1600 more btc to their ETF holdings since a day or two before. So ETF market (excluding GBTC) is probably up to 125k now, or over $5 billion, in just two weeks!Seems like the ETF market currently is adding probably roughly $100 million a day, maybe more (obviously was higher the first few days the ETFs were open).If the FTX/Grayscale selling is basically over, and the sell-the-news market participants are done, both likely to be true at this point I think, then the ongoing large accumulating of bitcoin from the ETFs is going to start shocking the supply soon. If ETF buying can hold in the $50 - $100 million per day (1k-2k btc) range in the coming months that is going to cause a huge upward pressure on the price, and even moreso in three months after the halving. Wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin hitting $50k in February as ETFs soak up a lot of supply and the sell-the-news people buy back in as they see the price recover up through the $40,000s.",

Bitcoin is a life long investment so I am very careful of how I dispose regardless of the profit. Selling might be easy but one might not have the funds to refill our wallets because the price might skyrocket in the future. So we should always look beyond the offers by these ETF operators.

I will be on the lookout for the Coinbase quarterly report for 2024. It should be really good since they custodian for a lot of ETF companies.

Not sure what you're arguing here or why you are trying to describe what trading is haha, I understand how trades work :pMy point was to dispel the other person's mistaken assumption that all the grayscale selling was simply to move that money into other ETFs, which is very much false as perhaps a majority of grayscale selling was either arbitrage trades on the Grayscale NAV or FTX selling off their assets in Grayscale, and that money entirely left the market and did not move to other ETFs. ETFs are not a closed ecosystem simply buying and selling to one another.A bunch of money left the market from Grayscale, some money got traded from Grayscale to other ETFs, and a bunch of new money came into the market through ETFs. Of the billions of dollars that actually left the market from Grayscale (was not simply moved to other ETFs), that selling had to be absorbed by the already existing spot market as well as the new money flowing into the other ETFs.It does seem that people think the Grayscale exodus will be ending soon though, so that selling will dry up while the new money flowing into ETFs and the spot market will no longer have to absorb massive Grayscale leaving-the-market sell orders and so price will continue to recover and move up.I was just pointing out the guy's very mistaken assumption, I wasn't arguing how trading works haha",

I have no idea how long it'll take until the OTC selling market starts drying up and supply from exchanges is going to have to start being bought and moved into the OTC market for these ETFs, but with Grayscale selling going down, and with the other ETFs still buying up hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin each day, I imagine it won't take too long.If OTC market has to start pulling thousands of bitcoin daily from exchanges in order to fill ETF buy orders that's definitely gonna start affecting the price in a big way.",

      "body": "On the 30th Grayscale sold 5000+ bitcoin while Fidelity bought 2700+ and Blackrock had a huge day buying almost 7000. So with the other smaller ETFs another maybe ~$200 million net positive day for ETFs.Grayscale selling has slowed down substantially but selling 4000/5000 bitcoin per day is still a lot. Wonder how long that will last. I figure it's likely most of the money that was straight up exiting the market from Grayscale through FTX and arbitrage trades, which was probably like $3-$4 billion, has done so at this point, and these few thousand daily bitcoin being sold now are probably mostly going into all the other ETFs, with these ETFs providing roughly a commiserate amount of new buying as well.New money flowing into ETFs is probably roughly $200m on a daily basis, which is very large! If this number can optimistically hold throughout February that'd be about $4 billion scooping up bitcoin into ETFs this month, figuring bitcoin price will go back up to so let's say average $47k price that'd be another 85,000 bitcoin scooped out of the market this month. I would think that would run the OTC selling market pretty dry by then and OTC would have to start pulling from exchanges, though I don't really have any idea how big the OTC market is.Update:and apparently Fidelity and Blackrock flipped yesterday, with Fidelity buying ~5400 BTC while Blackrock \"only\" bought ~2700 BTC. Grayscale sold ~4300 BTC.So two days ago Grayscale sold 5186 BTC and the rest bought 10,730 BTC, for a net positive buying of 5544 BTC or about $235 million.And yesterday Grayscale sold 4364 BTC while the rest bought 8962 BTC, for a net positive 4598 BTC or about $195 million.Biiiig daily numbers of buying through ETFs still three weeks after they launched.",
