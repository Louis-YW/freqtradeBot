  "content": "Edited, to shorten the ask,Hoping to connect here with anyone that may have had any discussions, worked with any of the founders of voise, bedore my takeover.Â  I am writing the story of what happened, the journey of a pump n dump. Voise is but one small part in this drama of rug pulls hacks and treachery, things that have cast a terrible light on crypto.So I am writing a book that will be sold in auction in crypto as a stake in the books royalties in print via a well known publisher. The funds raised will be for a non profit organization an operating system for music, the foundation to build the group that assembles what we truly need, non toxic, neutral, community social media, music and arts, a purely democratic system..This discussion thread will help me in writing, as your stories and imput will help broaden the scope and reach. This will be a great adventure one that culminates in a case use of fractional ownership of a print book, and other interesting things.I truly hope there is interest here in helping in this endeavour.Love and light,Andre Ledoux",

      "body": "Didn't read it all, seems like a sad story. But what's so special about buying a failed project account (honestly never heard of Voise)? I'm not sure your failure will prevent you from making something even greater, as in this story was the developer. Maybe your skills can be channeled into the development of bitcoin nonprofit projects.",

And why someone would like an account who was behind a bump and dump scam? for sure some users in the future will hate that account and even claim to the new users for a scam when he wasn't really involved.I will wait for the book, please let us know when it comes out.",
