  "content": "Quote from: ➥ Thread in [Eng] • [Rom] • [Ger] • [Por] • [Ita] ➥ Last year's [Results]   ➥ Bitcointalk Quiz  [Live]  ➥ Ledger Nano X [Free Raffle] 🎁Bitcointalk Community Awards is a great opportunity for us to express our appreciation to those special people who are doing their best for their community, for all the good deeds, and for the impact they have on the forum. Even though 2022 has been a very challenging year for everyone, it won't stop us from taking stock by voting for significant events or users who you think deserve an award, (especially since this year we will have 30 prizes!). 🏆       What prizes await the winners?You have probably heard from us repeatedly that public recognition is the most prestigious award, it really is. However, our sponsor 🦊 Betnomi made sure that the winners really felt they mattered. In addition, everyone's favorite [C]ryptioS is also preparing a surprise (this will be announced later in this thread). Please note that Bitcointalk Awards 2022 is not an official event and is run under the auspices of the community.🥈 2rd place🥇 1st place🥉 3rd placePrize of 6 mBTCCustom Ledger & 12 mBTC ➥ NotePrize of 3 mBTC                                                                                                                                                                              How it works?From the moment of publication, and for 60 days, public voting will be open, in which any active user can take part. Any user has the right to campaign for or against other candidates in a separate thread specially created for this. Who will be among the top three winners in each respective category depends only on your activity. For the voting system to work, any nominated candidate must have the support of at least three users.Up to 3 users you can vote in each category ➥ Note.You can edit your application until the thread is locked ➥ Note.You must have 50 earned merits to vote ➥ Note.No merit sending is allowed from nominees to users which nominated them & Votes cast for inactive users will not count ➥ Note.Custom titleDescription of the Nomination  AbsoluteHero of GoodThe award is given to the informal leader, (the presence of a cult is encouraged). 🎭This outstanding man has devoted many years to serving the community and has left an indelible legacy by doing community service without regard for personal gain.Golden FeatherThe award is presented to the participant whose name symbolizes trust and wisdom.There have always been users on the forum who stand out from the crowd in writing style and objectivity, those whose posts are always pleasant to read, and discussions with them bring satisfaction.Bitcointalk NinjaThe award is given for exceptional contribution to the development of Bitcointalk!A person whose activities are extremely useful for the Bitcointalk community, or someone without whom you cannot imagine a forum. In this category, the truly creative people are judged, and now it's time to determine the best!Bitcoin GeekThe award is given to the participant who you felt was the most helpful in the Bitcoin-related areas.Tell us which of your acquaintances is passionate about Bitcoin to the extreme, who can easily explain to you such nuances that you did not even know about or who simply chose a ASIC for your grandmother.Event of the YearWhat event had the biggest impact on you?This nomination is a tribute to the most notable events in the crypto community or the most significant for you personally. This is the third annual award, you can only nominate and vote for all significant events of 2022.Fail of the YearThe most promising event, which brought a lot of disappointment to the community. It is much more pleasant to remember pleasant events, but nevertheless, it will be useful for us to draw conclusions in order to avoid disappointments in the future. What was the most difficult thing for you to come to terms with?Discoveryof the YearPerhaps one of the most unexpected but at the same time iconic categories, which shows that the forum is alive.The award is presented not only to novice Bitcoiners, but also to other users who have been actively participating in the life of the forum over the past year ... heck, you can even nominate your best Bitcointalk friend!SpamBusterThe award is given to a volunteer user for their invaluable contribution to maintaining order on the forum.We tend to think that this award is best suited to the most important figure among moderators & reporters or who contributes in every possible way to the suppression of fake activity in the threads.  ScamBusterThe award is given to an outstanding volunteer working exclusively for the benefit of the community.He adheres to a fairly strong moral codex, is a role model and consistently demonstrates an inexhaustible enthusiasm for identifying abusers on Bitcointalk, (here [1] [2] you can get to know such users personally).  Craft MasterThe award is presented to those who sincerely love their craft, whether it is a professional activity or a hobby.We tend to think that this award is best suited to the most significant figure among collectors, managers, escrows, designers or users who are so passionate about sports and p2p that they motivate others to bets solely in BTC.  AntiheroHe never wanted to be a villain, but he had to accept the rules of the game in which he “plays black”.Even \"evil\" has its own principles, so such a person is capable of anything, even if it does not benefit him. 😈  Miss BitcointalkAlthough girls are now in the minority on Bitcointalk, 5 to 1, they are still wonderful, interesting and important to us. I understand that choosing three winners from among all our beautiful girls is problematic, but still we will try.Who do you think especially deserves to be Miss Bitcointalk?__________________________________Quote from: Mr.X ➥ I would like to express special gratitude: Cyrus, Sorsis, GazetaBitcoinFor the most part, this thread is for voting, to facilitate the counting of votes / the thread for discussion and agitation is here.",
