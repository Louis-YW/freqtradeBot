  "content": "As you may know Blockfolio was a mobile app that you can check coin prices and create your portfolio. FTX bought the app and changed the name to FTX. Now when you open the app it doesn't refresh prices, instead it says \"Looks like something went wrong. Please try again.\" Of course something went wrong, you went wrong. FTX bankrupt and now the mobile app is gone too. What are your suggestions as I don't check its alternatives. It fulfilled my needs for a long time, now I don't know which app is the similar and suit me best. I'd like to hear your opinions, there are a lot of mobile apps so it's hard to choose a good, reliable and secure one.",

It shows how much I gain/loss everyday.It may not be as convenient as blockfolio or any other app but if you have the ledger hardware then you're obliged to download the app to look at your portfolio. I usually use the desktop version and as per checking, they've got the app version for smart phone users.",

If you are lazy then you can use the other suggestion above but I'm currently using these trackers below for free.- Coingecko app - it needs to register but it's free and most of the coins are listed there.- CryptoMarketcap - using this for a long time for free and I like their widget.Other tracker that you can check.- Crypto Tracker Coin stats - The Crypto app - Coin Tracker",

      "body": "While there are some solid apps mentioned before me, I tend to be more geared towards open source solutions, especially the ones that deal with investments. According to their Crunchbase profile[1], Blockfolio was mostly a \"mobile portfolio tracking and management for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry\" - at least prior to FTX purchase - and if your sole intent was that feature, I strongly recommend Portefolio Performance[2] . I even made a guide for it[3] that you can use to start recording your crypto purchases (but the method can also be used for traditional investment options such as stocks and ETFs...).Granted, my solution isn't perfect and may not suit your interests - it lacks an Android app (for now) and the interface to add an investment option isn't very intuitive - but considering the fact that you know that no one is \"watching\" your data or reselling it, it's an incredible feeling and for me it's totally worth the hassle of not being that intuitive (good news: it gets easier the more you use it!).[1]https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockfolio[2]https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/[3]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381647",

      "body": "Back in 2008 when everything imploded in the financial world there was a lot of talk about who got what bailouts and such.One of the things that I always found interesting was the fact that a few of the banks that got money was not to bail out the banks by themselves, but all the intertwined businesses with them. Bank goes out, some loans get called, aluminum foundry that had a 10 million revolving line of credit all of a sudden can't pay bills, they shut down, people waiting on parts for them can no longer make whatever customers had ordered, their customers are now in trouble. So, although the BANK might not have been bailed out, to avoid some of the ripple effect you keep them going so other places do not go under.FTX had their hands in 100s of projects like Blockfolio. They are not getting bailed out.This week and next, we get to see who else / what other projects had their funds in FTX and related.Buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy ride.-Dave",

I was using Delta for a while, but it didn't always show the prices correctly. In fact, it was not easy to follow the price of some tokens, especially it could not show the price of non-volume tokens correctly.Advice on this subject will be very useful for us, we need a new app",

FTX was second largest donator after George Soros... surprise surprise. Â People should also check how they used FTX for money laundering, sending ''help'' to other countries in need and than returning same money through FTX.Just 'trust'' your governments, and don't ask questions, right?!",

If I were to guess, the reason why Blockfolio is now not working is because of server-related reasons in general.",

Eventually, I was forced to create a throw-away email for the sake of having a Coingecko portfolio tracker. I really don't understand why a tracker has to require users to sign up. Anyway, it's so sad that the rest of the separate products and services acquired by FTX will also fall down along with the exchange and the research and trading firm. The former Blockfolio, for example, couldn't go insolvent and was probably earning nicely.",
