You must recover it with your seed backup or restore your wallet with your wallet.aes.json file you can use the link below to recover the wallet.- https://login.blockchain.com/wallet/import-wallet",

I know it was possible to use blockchain.info for logging in sometime earlier but not anymoreIt wasn't merged, it's the same blockexplorer and online wallet service but with updated features.They just got access to the '.com' domain and redirect '.info' to it.Quote from: shlomogold2.

Was it possible to use just any address i.e. 1BitcoinEater..... as your log in info or was it only possible to use an address that was provided to you by the BC wallet?No, ever since the start, it's the \"Wallet ID\" or in the earliest versions, via \"Alias\".Login using Email was just added recently.If you mean, pasting the address in their blockexplorer; no, that's not a log in.It's only meant to search for that address' transaction history and other info.",

Is this here the case, or is it not possible for the owner to access the funds?It's possible but I didn't hear it yet.This would be an unethical business practice to them and would likely result in legal action if discovered but however, but I've never heard of a case like this before.Â  The most common problem is that there's no customer support and it takes how many months before they will answer your queries or your ticket, in short, they have poor customer support.There's no problem if you've your 12 words seed, you can Brute-force your online blockchain.info wallet with btcrecover.",

Is this here the case, or is it not possible for the owner to access the funds?The old version is still recoverable using their backup phrase which isn't BIP39 seed phrase but only a way to access the user's login credentials which is the \"Wallet ID\" and \"Password\".And during that time, users are given a encrypted json copy of their wallet file in their Email which can be used to recover their Bitcoins.The major issue is with the very first version which only has the \"Alias\" that can't be used to login today.But IIRC, I've seen some successful recovery of such wallet through their slow customer support by providing the required info.To see if there are successful attempts of recovery of old blockchain(.)info wallets, browse through this board: Service Discussion > Web Wallets",

I find it hard to believe they don't offer their customers the possibility to change their deposit address after each received transation. Most other exchanges offer this feature, correct?It is the same in other exchanges, for example, in Binance they only provide you an address for deposits: one legacy address and one segwit address. I have done several deposits and they remain the same, exchanges do that because makes easier for them to link the address to a specific client.I believe there are exchanges which can change the receiving address if you personally request so to the costumer support, but I have not tried. So it is a normal practice, as far as I know.",

Webtricks compiled a list of these platforms here, which I believe is still relevant (except for OKX).",

Is this here the case, or is it not possible for the owner to access the funds?Not really there is an option to extract your private keys in their dashboard so you can transfer your funds to other wallets, I have done that many times, but unfortunately many blockchain users do not know this, on all the wallets where you keep your funds be sure that you know where to access the private key and always keep your private keys but most of all do not keep your wallet in centralized exchange or custodial wallet, do not trust these two to keep your funds.",

It's possible sometime in the future that they might change the login procedure but then if it's said that you should keep those recovery phrases keep it but not your balance there.2. That's your address but not your login info. There's specific login details that you need to make on them but I doubt it that you'll be able to use that as login since the requirement they'll be asking you is either your email or wallet ID which is gonna come from them IIRC.",
