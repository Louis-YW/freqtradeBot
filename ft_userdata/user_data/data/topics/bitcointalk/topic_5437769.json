      "body": "I think it will neither be bearish nor bullish. It will remain sideways and continue to do that with some gains until the next halving. If you are not aware of when the next halving will happen then it is scheduled to happen next year. I am expecting a good bull run after the halving. Till 2019 Bitcoin somewhat was following the cycle of 2017 when we saw for the first time a big ATH. After 2019 it did not follow that same cycle but after the last halving it took some months then we saw a big bull run. I am confident we will see the same cycle next year or in 2025. We should be happy that Bitcoin never went down in 2022 or 2023 as it did in 2018.",

The year just started and it is difficult to predict too far-off, we have to wait and see what events happen this year to know if it will continue in a bullish way or be bearish.",

      "body": "Bitcoin has remained bullish for years if you follow the charts. Even when we think it is bearish, it is still bullish from the chart since it was created. I hope you understand me. There is no year that bitcoin has clearly been bearish or bullish. There is always a mixture of the both, bearish and bullish. My assessment of it this 2023 is that it will do more of bull than bear, we can feel that already starting in January. I want to see more of price rise in February than what we found in January, and more in the rest of the months this year. That is my position.",

Even a person who bought at the pick of December 2017, and who didn't decide to sell on the 2021 bull run, enjoys profit. Convince yourself it's a desired asset, and add the fact that it has a steady supply schedule, and you're done. The combination rocks. Find me another asset with such feature.",

I personally believe this is a bear market rally or something similar.       Maybe when the price of bitcoin plays constantly between 22k$-23k$ until June 2023 it can be said that we are still in a bearish season, but if the price value of Bitcoin goes beyond that then it may be a sign that we are gradually entering the Bullish season. That's why it's better than anyone accumulates bitcoin little by little like I do while it's still early.  Because let's just remember that the market is volatile, we don't know and no one knows when its price value will increase and decrease in the market.",

Although I expected the first quarter to be bearish but this seems more like a recovery period and not bullish I would have to wait till it crosses over the 25k mark and see maybe it has stability there. The second might follow same trend of the first but I have a feeling that the last quarters will be bearish because the 2024 halving might be hyped then.

Indeed we saw an increase when this year started which is a good thing, especially after seeing how long the market prices have shown no signs of recovery last year. But I doubt it is enough for a bullish run. What's expected is for bullish trend to occur in 2024 because of the anticipated Bitcoin halving and assumptions are based from the past. But since this year started with green marks, I think there are chances for atleast half of ATH prices to be reached if things would be somehow consistent. Let us just hope that there'll be no correction to happen as this year goes by, in order for this industry to not struggle that much before this year end.",

Because the recovery that still looks a little unable to conclude whether it is bullish or not at this time or for this year. From the improvements I've seen over the past month, I consider this a very normal thing to happen and I don't consider it to be bullish because it's too early to assume that at the start of this year. So all this time I've been waiting for a real bullish and even bigger increase from the one that's been happening over the last month",

Well, maybe we still see market conditions like this for a while. And even though the market has crossed the $25k barrier, we still have to be patient as the current dips are deep and it will take time to get around the last ATH price. But as long as you don't sell your bitcoins at a low price but hold them and try to do weekly or monthly DCA, I think you can see a bullish process coming soon.
