Remember that strategy is only a tool that you can use to predict the market price. For now since the market has declined massively, you can do spot trading which is moat likely traders use when bear market comes.",

The difference between the trends is that at a point, the market will sell for a long time and at another time it will buy short which is the correction of a bear time. For traders you can make profit even in bear season.",

Because the up and down movement, will give you the chance to make profits. The simple rule of trading - buy low, sell high, is your guide here. But not all know how to implement this strategy.Traders know where to attack the market. They won't wait for bull season to get their hands on the market.",

Just like like today as sample image below.If you bought BTC at around $17k and then sold it at around $19k you already made around 9% to 10% but the problem it is not worth it if you only have a small investment in trading you can only notice your profit if you have big amount of funds in your portfolio. And you should be ready for the price drop and set a stop limit before you lose more profit.The only difference between a bear and bull market is that you can only get a small profit in a bear market unlike in a bull market you can make more profit and you do not worry about price drops because you HODL and wait for another price rise to cover loses.",

It doesn't mean once it is a bear market, you cannot make profits, there are short positions or long positions with leverage that can help you.

Instead of having to think over it, they rather trade based on the numbers and not with the emotions.For them a bear market is a time to buy and spend the liquid cash for the investment, while the bull market is the time to sell and cover a profit to get back the liquid cash and the difference.I have myself seen that keeping this mentality saves you from a lot of trouble of anxiety that happens with the market and it makes you a more efficient trader able to take decisions that dont nag you in the course of the market.",
