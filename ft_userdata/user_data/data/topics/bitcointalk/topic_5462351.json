I answered them with the following, though they don't really accept, so what do you guys think?1. If Bitcoin is smart contract active it won't be able to keep it's decentralized part alive because smart contract ability will give access to centralized projects building and running on Bitcoin.2. Many new projects will tarnish the respect and image that Bitcoin has right now, because meme coins and stupid shit coins will run on Bitcoin and this will make people to lose money, once that happens Bitcoin as scam is just going to get worse. 3. There will be bridges chaos and more money will be lost, the problem will be much more than what it is right now because I believe it's easier to lose money through smart contracts e.g hacks that happens through bridges and other. 4. Bitcoin is perfect as it is right now, adding smart contract or trying to perfected Bitcoin, into all in one would have make it a less noticeable in crypto space, because it will be contending with Ethereum and others, it's best because it's not like other projects.

Therefore, regardless of what features Bitcoin does not have compared to some altcoins, I don't think it would change the general perception of the average investor who doesn't really understand the difference between Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency.I therefore do not think that there would be fewer scam projects, but I can agree that more people would invest in Bitcoin if some other altcoins did not distract them, and not only the one you cite as an example, but also some others that have appeared in the past years and are presented as cheap alternatives to Bitcoin.If you ever have the opportunity to ask the following question, what do you think the answer will be?For the same amount of money I offer you 15 ETH or 1 BTC, which would you choose?",

Both assumptions are wrong.Bloating bitcoin blockchain with tokens (the form of smart contracts you have in mind) will effectively kill bitcoin even if in short term it could pump it a little.It also doesn't do anything to scam projects because by nature when anybody is free to create a token, many will create scam ones not to mention that the idea of creating a token out of thin air that has absolutely no purpose and selling it to people is a scam by nature (ie. without exception)!Quote1. If Bitcoin is smart contract active it won't be able to keep it's decentralized part alive because smart contract ability will give access to centralized projects building and running on Bitcoin.Bitcoin has smart contracts, the locking/pubkey +unlocking/signature scripts are all smart contracts.Adding token creation option is what you mean and it can remain decentralized and be a token creation platform. Keep in mind that just because a shitplatform like ethereum is centralized doesn't mean every other one should be too.For example we have bitcoin side-chains like RSK that are a lot more decentralized when compared to ethereum.Quote2. Many new projects will tarnish the respect and image that Bitcoin has right now, because meme coins and stupid shit coins will run on Bitcoin and this will make people to lose money, once that happens Bitcoin as scam is just going to get worse. That's true but lets not forget that such a thing will change the utility of bitcoin from being a payment system and a currency into being a token platform.QuoteI believe it's easier to lose money through smart contracts e.g hacks that happens through bridges and other. It is easy to lose money when the smart contract is built on top of a buggy platform/protocol like ethereum like the case with DAO and many others like it. Otherwise if the protocol is solid and bug free, it will be extremely hard to lose money by using that protocol.Case in point bitcoin smart contracts (ie as I said every transaction we have ever made) from 2009 till today have been completely secure.Quoteit's best because it's not like other projects. Bitcoin is the \"best\" because it does what it is supposed to do and does it correctly.Bitcoin is supposed to be a decentralized censorship resistance payment system and it is exactly that.The problem with other projects is that they are not doing what they are supposed to do. For example  Ethereum was supposed to be a secure immutable decentralized token creation platform but it is none of that. It is an insecure centralized token creation platform with a mutable blockchain that they can reverse if they wish to.",

So, having an advanced smart contract that is seperate from the main chain is the best way to go especially for experimental purposes, until developers are certain it can be safely applied on the mainchain, or whether it's better to keep using it seperatetly. In regards to decentralization and using the smart contract by users ... a good smart contract system will need to be run on the Bitcoin principles. like the Bitcoin nodes, it should be possible for participants to run and verify every contract for security, correctness, and according to laid down rules to prevent people/things from abusing or misusing it.",

      "body": "If Bitcoin indeed becomes smart contract active, the decentralization part might be intact... or might not. Though centralization could enter the picture, its complex. One could argue that Bitcoin's essential nature is its decentralization. Smart contracts? Maybe they change it, maybe not. But digital gold should be digital gold, after all.Meme coins and stupid coins tarnishing Bitcoin's image is a valid point; however, it could increase its value and decrease it too. It could both enhance and diminish people's trust simultaneously, as long as Bitcoin remains what it is today - digital gold.Bridges chaos, hacks, loss of money, are genuine concerns with smart contracts; though these concerns might be less or more concerning. Maybe it's easier to lose money, or it's not. But one thing is clear: Bitcoin doesnt need more stupid features; it only needs to be faster.Bitcoin's perfection is subjective. Being all-in-one could make it less noticeable or more noticeable, depending on various factors. And yet, it's best because it's not like other projects.",

That's what exchanges are for. It is theoretically impossible to code the swapping of two coins in a secure way, because at any given time, the funds will belong to a particular address, which can change, if any kind of security vulnerability is found inside the contract.It's easy to make bugs - we make thousands of them every day.

I'm not comfortable relying on exchange if I want to swap one coin for another, and the bridge is not really the best solution since it is geared more toward developers or businesses to take profits from market exposure instead of assets security IMO.

Plus, there's just a big difference in what we think bitcoin is and what they think bitcoin should be, a lot of us believe that bitcoin should be as it is and the only thing that we should add to it is something that has little to no downside but huge upside.
