It's almost like Islam... become a Muslim (Ukraine soldier) or we'll kill you right now, and steal your property.FORCED CONSCRIPTION: Ukrainian troops are KIDNAPPING ethnic Hungarians to be deployed to the front lineshttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-01-ukrainians-kidnap-hungarians-deploy-war-front-line.htmlHungarian men in the Trans-Carpathia area of Ukraine are being terrorized by brutal and forced conscriptions by Ukrainian police and recruiting officers to go into war against RussiaAccording to reports of M1, Hungary’s broadcasting network, Kyiv officers are “kidnapping” ethnic Hungarian men between the age of 18 to 60 from highly frequented locations such as train stations, petrol stations and near shopping centers and markets. They also go into homes.In the video clip that was translated by RAIR Foundation USA, a grassroots activist organization, it was revealed that 100 locations are raided every day in Trans-Carpathia alone. Soldiers and policemen point guns, kick and tackle down those who resist.A large group of people has already been forcibly taken from the said area of Ukraine, which is bordering Hungary. Allegedly, many of them already died or were wounded as most were deployed at the war front line.Some reports said hundreds of soldiers’ bodies are being stored in specially designed refrigerated goods wagon by Ukrainian authorities near the Hungarian border.Kyiv reportedly wants to recruit thousands of civilians to replace losses in the Ukrainian army. It is unknown whether Ukrainian authorities are also forcibly conscripting Romanian, Moldovan, Slovak and Polish ethnic minorities.There are approximately 150,000 ethnic Hungarians in the Trans-Carpathia region, the area which is the legacy of the non-negotiable Treaty of Trianon signed by Hungary on June 4, 1920, following loss in the first world war. Trianon dismembered the thousand-year-old Kingdom of Hungary, costing it 70 percent of its territory and three million of its population. President Woodrow Wilson later referred to the treaty as “absurd.”Hungary, Austria not sending weapons to Ukraine...",

It's almost like Islam... become a Muslim (Ukraine soldier) or we'll kill you right now, and steal your property.If this is true, then I must say it is very bad.It is a crime against humanity. The international community has to look into it.FORCED CONSCRIPTION: Ukrainian troops are KIDNAPPING ethnic Hungarians to be deployed to the front lines...Which part? The fact of Hungarians being forced to be soldiers in the Ukraine War? Or the fact that Muslims have been doing this for hundreds of years with the general populace?There are something like a billion and a half Muslims in the world. If Ukraine keeps it up, we might wind up with a billion and a half Ukrainians... except for the war-dead Hungarians, of course.",

Kidnapping young people and recruiting them into the ranks of the fighting is not a new thing, and there are experts on how to do this. These abductees are separated and trained under strict supervision, then put them in the front rows in what looks like a human shield. They will find themselves directly under fire and will have to face their fate, either they kill the Russian soldiers or they will kill them. That is, it is not in his interest to kill his colleagues on the same front, because this will not benefit them in anything.",

Sometimes you hear news that turn out to be lies from these two warring parties. It was widely publicized that Russian Naval force killed all the Ukrainian soldiers stationed at Snakes Island but it turned out to be false. You can't forcefully push people to war and expect them to wilfully fight for you. Most of them will end up becoming saboteurs. I suggest both parties respect the global war laws and I am sure it prohibited forced conscription.",
