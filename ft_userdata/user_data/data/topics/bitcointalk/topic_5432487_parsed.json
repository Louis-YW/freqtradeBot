The prize pool is not that huge so the OP doesn’t need to be concerned on what will be the outcome. What I’m concerned on this type game was a whale can monopolize the game by trapping all small time gamblers that making a bet. This is the reason why this kind of game is not that popular anymore. The OP itself can compete to all the bidders while gets 2% commission per bid. What’s the rule for sniping bids?",

If you can get even a 1 satoshi bid into a block it will be accepted by the website.2 - We are working on soliciting help from more senior members to gain trust. In the best setting, this will involve a serious escrow with a trusted member of the forum.3 - Thank you for the feedback. For reference, I am a native English speaker who is 32 years of age. I have updated my personal profile website to remove the immature sounding paragraphs.4 - I was never a senior developer at Facebook or Google. At Google I was an intern, and at Facebook I was there for 10 months between August 2014 and June 2015. You can call them to check this with them.5 - I'm glad you could laugh at this. Thank you for the feedback and it has been removed from my personal profile website.I hope in time we can change your opinion about users depositing their funds with us deserving to lose their funds.Quote from: bitbollo on December 31, 2022, 05:53:16 PMthe idea itself is something funny and a nice application of betting with blockchain but a whale could easily have a monopole on that game vanishing all players effort to get a result I think it should be added some \"lucky\" factor not related only to bigger bets....24 hours is a long time to place a bet... whales will have time and interest to place a bigger bets even I am not sure most of players will participate since it can be easy get \"trapped\" with higher and higher amount Thank you for the feedback.

Let me share my personal opinion here and correct me where I'm wrong.The statements I'll be taking are from your website @OPQuoteIn a penny auction, each bid is paid for in advance, and there are no returns.This means that the bids are final, and nothing will be given back to the bidder in case he loses the auction. Got this point.QuoteThe prize starts off as 10k satoshis.Ok, so the starting prize money is 10k satoshis, who pays these 10k sats? @OP will you pay this for each auction out of your pocket?What if the total bids are made by just 2-3 members and it doesn't even reach total 10k sats? Won't you lose money?Let's take this game as an example, there is just one bidder and with just 300 sats, he can win 10k sats.Why don't you set up a minimum bid column too, so that you can start the auction with a set minimum. And why are the bids transparent? Can't you hide the bids and keep it fair for everyone? If not, why don't you do this as 'lowest and unique bid wins the auction'?That will give a boost to your game because this maximum bid kinda games were already played in the past and were not so successful.When we will participate in this game, will the auction starter be allowed to decide the prize amount? Or it stays the same for all the future auctions?QuoteAnybody can make a bid for the prize, at any time.So, aren't we cutting away our own head with an axe by bidding here when someone who wants the prize, comes and manipulates all the previous bids by his biggest bet? Even if the manipulator pushes the bid with just 1 satoshi ahead, he becomes a winner, won't he?QuoteIn the case of a tie, funds are distributed equally to the winning bidders and any fractional remainder is left with the host.How can there be a tie when the bids are already known?If not all, you are showing the maximum bid amount, so why would someone place an exact same bid like the maximum one? What's the point here?And what is this fractional remainder? I mean, what units are counted as fractional remainder here? A few satoshis? uBTC, mBTC, what exactly?Tbh I'm not so satisfied with the overall concept and I believe that you should make some serious changes before taking these games live as even with an escrow, this can still be manipulated for someone's personal winning agenda and will be unfair to those bidders who made earlier buds but lose due to that last minute bidder who sends a very big bid like (possibly) 0.01, 0.1 or even 1 BTC bid if the winning amount that the auction carries is huge.",

However, it's important to note that both SatoshiAuction and Coinballer appear to be in the early stages of development. This means that they may still be in the process of addressing issues such as potential abuse and implementing safeguards to prevent it. Well, at least the dev is off to a good start by acknowledging the game's shortcomings and working with the community to make it better! Here's hoping he can follow through and implement some effective safeguards. After all, no one wants to play a game that causes more headaches than fun.",
