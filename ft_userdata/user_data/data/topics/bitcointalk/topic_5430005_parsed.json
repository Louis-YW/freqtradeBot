Using a chemicalwill help reduce the rubbing but also to be mindful of corrosion.",

The \"goof-off\" method seems a hell of a lot easier and safer to do than just applying 91% alcohol. Silver pieces are quite delicate, so it's best for me to use something that's proven safe for removal of sticky residue. I've bought the solution online, but will not be able to apply it to the coin until after the holidays. If things go wrong, I will be sure to let you guys know about it.Thanks for your suggestions, btw. It's very appreciated.",

If I manage to remove the residue, I will send them to ICG for grading as \"blank\" coins.You need to apply heat, maybe with hair drier and use something oil based to remove any leftovers.I had to remove one hologram style void residue from laptop cover and for that I had to use rubbing alcohol with magic sponge, but be careful with this stuff.It removed everything from laptop but surface is visibly different coloration compared to surrounding material from laptop cover.I don't",
