This is more serious than I thought it was.The fact that it is not only the email but also the phone-numbers of the people are allegedly for sale means the possible buyer could have the chance not only to go for a classic fishing campaign but also more elaborate kinds of attacks like SIM-swap or even go as far as de-anonymize those who are deemed \"rich enough\" in order to get them to pay through extortion.I hope this ends up being false, but just in case, I recommend anyone reading this to treat your Twitter-linked phone number as compromised and delete it as 2FA on your exchanges and bank accounts, as soon as possible until this gets confirmed or debunked officially.Merry Christmas",

I also suspected this possibility at first. Musk has certainly gone overboard with the way Twitter is taking over, at moments perhaps even humiliating according to the previous structure of employees. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was a reaction to the entire process of change.Musk certainly deserved a punch in the face, but not over the user's back.",

Not even mentioning the fact they could get sued and imprisoned if caught.I have a friend which works on the technological sector and he told me companies take information leaks very seriously, to the point they let their employers to know they are not supposed to talk about anything going on within the company which is considered to be privileged information.For now I doubt this was made by former Twitter employees themselves.Perhaps they disclosed the vulnerability while anonymous but did not act beyond that, so they can deny their part.",

In the past year, there have been many similar cases that have become a trend in my country where someone will sell people's personal data on the black market, even state officials' data is in it. Regarding Twitter, I think the seller has had the data for a long time and is only now willing to sell it.Of course I really have to be careful about this case, even if I haven't used Twitter much longer than now. Online platform security is inherently bad, we should avoid it as much as possible.",

This is a possibility that cannot be discarded as there are a lot of former employees that are mad with him and how he is managing the company, still assuming this is the case this is a very low move, because even if I also think the way Elon is conducting himself leaves a lot to be desired, this is not an excuse to affect so many Twitter users.After all not only they are losing some of their personal data, it is possible this will lead to a significant financial loss on the future as well.",

Either some ex-employee decided to screw Musk over, or Musk's incompetent and harmful management resulted in this. And by bet is one the latter, because Musk fired a lot of workers, made absurd statements about the inner workings of Twitter, demands long work hours from the employees who remained, made a lot of stupid changes and so on.He's a great example why we shouldn't worship any supposed billionaire geniuses, and that just because someone is rich, doesn't make them smart.

And it seems they are also toying with Elon Musk, asking him 276 million in return, sort of ransom and if he pays, they are allegedly going to delete the data (but I doubt both parties are going to do it).I suspect that the hack though happen prior to Elon taking over Twitter, and perhaps the cyber criminals again, wants to troll Elon Musk for releasing his supposedly hack accounts and sell it and have someone independently verify at least 1000 accounts, to look like the data is real.",

Lots of stuffs been sale on BM which it isnt really that limited to this.If you are really that mindful about privacy then you should always consider on making some actions which would be avoiding you this.Email spams and scams are something next in line.",
