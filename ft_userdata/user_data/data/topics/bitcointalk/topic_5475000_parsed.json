  "content": "So, I asked bing AI the question and it answered like this:QuoteDigaran is a user on the Bitcoin Forum, a platform for discussion and news about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Digaran has been a member since March 18, 2016 and has posted more than 5,000 messages on various topics. Digaran is also known for being a troll and a controversial figure on the forum, often provoking other users with his opinions and arguments. Some of his posts have been deleted or moved by the moderators for violating the forum rules. Digaran's current avatar is a picture of a masked man holding a gun and a sign that says \"[banned mixer]\", which is a service that claims to provide privacy by mixing Bitcoin transactions with Monero. You can find more information about Digaran by visiting his profile‚Å¥ or reading his latest posts.Source: Conversation with Bing, 22/11/2023(1) undefined. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile.(2) digaran is an alt of... - Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4456384.(3) View the profile of digaran - Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=806776.(4) Latest posts of: digaran - Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;threads;u=806776;sa=showPosts.Then I had the pre stated option of asking about why he is controversial, so I chose to ask it and this is the awnswer:QuoteDigaran is controversial because he has been involved in several conflicts and disputes with other users on the Bitcoin Forum. Some of the reasons why Digaran is controversial are:- He has been accused of being a troll and a scammer by many users, who claim that he posts misleading or false information, insults or harasses other members, and tries to manipulate the forum for his own benefit¬π¬≤¬≥.- He has been given negative trust ratings by several reputable users, who warn others not to trust or deal with him. Some of these ratings are based on his alleged involvement in blackmailing, extorting, or threatening other users for money or merit¬≤¬≥.- He has been banned or suspended from the forum multiple times for violating the forum rules, such as spamming, plagiarizing, or posting low-quality content. He has also been reported to the moderators or the admin for his abusive or disruptive behavior¬π¬≤¬≥.- He has expressed controversial or unpopular opinions on various topics, such as politics, religion, or cryptography, which have sparked heated debates or arguments with other users. He has also challenged or criticized some of the established or respected members of the forum, such as developers, merit sources, or staff¬π¬≤¬≥.These are some of the reasons why Digaran is controversial, but there may be more that I am not aware of. You can find more information about Digaran by visiting his profile‚Å¥ or reading his latest posts.Source: Conversation with Bing, 22/11/2023(1) Latest posts of: digaran - Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;threads;u=806776;sa=showPosts.(2) Merit Source @digaran has gone too far - Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3283912.0.(3) Merit Source @digaran has gone too far - Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3283912.60.(4) undefined. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470732.msg63017139.(5) undefined. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile.Do you think this is a good summary of this troll? I use practically every day the AI in my daily life and I can see that in some aspects it has to improve, so I don't trust it to be 100% accurate, but it seems a pretty good summary, and it has made me understand some things, for example, from the last links quoted, I see that he was a merit source, and that he was probably removed, so I understand better that he opens stupid threads like this one:Petition for 1miau to be removed as a merit source!",

      "body": "üò≠, I apologize for the confusion, here is the correct answer:Now we know why people keep repeating the same thing, they are either AI or ask AI to write something about me, I'm disappointed in her, me and AI were close friends, this shows we can't trust anyone coming to our lives. For a second I thought I'm isis for holding a gun in a mask, well now we know where the medias get their information from. üòÖI'm pretty sure I can sue the AI company for such defamation and spreading lies, or even the OP for the same reasons if he fails to prove the content of the OP was generated by an AI.But in this community? I don't think anyone cares, actually some people are doing it over and over without ever facing any consequences.I sincerely apologize for calling developers pat and mat and incompetent, When fees go up and dust spam is damaging the image of Bitcoin in the eyes of the world, I lose my temper. *We should not criticize any one, the best way to go is to learn from Japanese, they have this habit, when they want to show their respect, they bow down.But in my opinion *we should kneel, it's called advancing, the next stage of our evolution is being on our face kissing boots. Because that's what happens if you stop criticizing.**= Never. Long live the revolution, decentralizing the justice system= Bitcointalk reputation board.Decentralizing doesn't work for everything, there should be mechanisms in place to prevent people like OP to reach any where near the chair which is a sacred place for judges, which is one of the most difficult jobs in the world to be a judge.EDIT :QuoteAlright, I mean I know every one thinks I'm a troll, but I will say this no matter what, even if it's deleted.@Poker Player, did you honestly used this topic on me as your resume to then bump this thread and show people that you are up for the task?I suspect a few members to be your alt on puzzle thread, because I just read your post on meta and it seemed very familiar especially the insulting part. This is bad, don't be like that, there is no future in such businesses.So now I get how people weasel their way into DT, literally anyone could be a DT, what happened to this community, back then we could directly blame admin, now we need to go against a group of either alts or buddy-alt combined and get no where at the end.Quote from: Poker Player on November 22, 2023, 04:38:17 AMI thought of bumping this thread because I was thinking after the last update of http://loyce.club/trust/ that now I think I meet the requirements, and I see that, indeed, according to what was exposed in the OP if I would meet them to enter the lottery of DT1, and as I see in http://loyce.club/trust/ranking/ I am there.Not really too bothered, more curious, I guess it was only logical that it would eventually enter the lottery. With more time on the forum, if you do things right, more people will include you. Kind of more responsibility I think because if you become DT1 and you have someone on your trust list and only you have them, their feedbacks become visible only thanks to you. Thanks for another useful thread LoyceV.You are sure there bud, just hang in there bud. Just look at the time on both posts.¬† I can tell you already your application for DT1 is approved.

In their current state most of the information they produce is wrong and I would call it misinformation. I'm sure that in future they may get some improvements and maybe somewhat useful for some tasks but I still believe that the information they produce is inaccurate and should not be treated as valuable information.",

In my thread on him.After recent developments regarding 1miau, by seeing so many people keep calling me troll and harasser of innocent DTs, I believe they can't understand anything on their own, as if they have been brainwashed into thinking when a DT Member says something it must be true.I mean look at jollygood, he must actually believe what he has done is the right thing, right? Otherwise why would he risk losing his status by wrongfully accusing me? So if and when his time comes, if he feels confident enough to not take any necessary actions, could mean that he thinks he is untouchable and that nobody would take my side.Without realizing it's not about taking a side, it's about the reason.
