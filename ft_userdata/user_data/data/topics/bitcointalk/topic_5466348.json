  "content": "so many old members here were invited to Bitcointalk by family members, friends.while some were invited through Google search and YouTube. At first on getting here you find yourself thinking how you might get started, so you can also feel like you belong to the community and rank up.    As a newbie, you have so many taughts running through your mind, ie \"would you rank up or get stucked in a lower rank for long, when next will you earn merits. while doing this, you become so careful creating or interacting with members so you start earning recognition and trust on the community.Many times, I think that not having more newbies here on Bitcoin will actually make the community less active.So, why do I think it's essential to welcome more newbies to Bitcointalk? The presence of newcomers injects vitality into the community. They bring fresh ideas, add value, and help spread the word about Bitcoin. New members can also play a pivotal role in inviting others and creating engaging discussions. I think that without new topics and discussions, it could become challenging for signature campaign members to fulfill their weekly tasks. Interestingly, around 50 percent of daily topics and threads are initiated by newbies and low-ranked members.Again, Newbies can revitalize participation, particularly in competitions like the Roobet monthly contest, October Halloween contest and so many other interesting contest on Bitcointalk. Senior members often have busy schedules due to their signature campaigns, but newbies can ignite interest in such events and participate.making it more challenging and competitive.On the other hand, some newbies are finding it difficult to join or even last here on  Bitcointalk for long. this is because of the fact that they get distracted by some of the other activities here on Bitcointalk including bounty, signature campaigns or try to outsmart the rules of the forum (plagarism).For these reason, they are not willing to learn. newbies these days, don't want to learn but trys to teach others what they don't have enough much Knowledge about. they forget that one must learn to crawl before they begin to walk. when inviting someone to Bitcointalk, you should see to it that they understand what it's all about and yes you can equally tell them all the benefits that come with joining Bitcointalk but be sure to inform them about all the rules they have to abide, to so they don't come here and start spamming the forum without understanding the rules.so far I have invited 3 person to Bitcointalk, but just 1 of them is here and still actively engaging on the forum. I thank LoyceV for her thread: The future of Bitcointalk: Low Ranking Top Merit earners in the past 30 days. I know so many has raised the question, like why she has decided to continue updating that thread, but the truth is that she sees a future in these newbies and I too see because I was once a newbie who faced somany trials while ranking up, but I overcame. I don't know about others though, but i always loved being mentioned every month on LoyceV thread, as this encouraged me to work harder towards achieving a higher rank. so if you are one of those person doubting their self here on Bitcointalk if they can rank up fully, just be patient and engage with the forum regularly and you will see it's result. don't forget to follow the rules.To cut the long story short, I strongly believe that we should invite more users to the forum. This will not only boost engagement but also bring fresh ideas to benefit both new and old members alike. So if you know of someone who is willing to learn about Bitcoin, don't hesitate to tips him about Bitcointalk.",

You should only tell anyone that is willing to learn bitcoin about the forum after you ahve spoken to him and the person showed interest on learning. If you tell them that you can earn from the forum,this is what they will put in their mind that will make them to register here and not to learn. This is one of the reason that most newbies find it difficult to grow and they will end up being banned from the forum because they are eager to earn merits and they will be too lazy to learn but very strong for plaigarismQuote from: Hatchy on September 10, 2023, 08:39:36 PMTo cut the long story short, I strongly believe that we should invite more users to the forum.

So if you know of someone who is willing to learn about Bitcoin, don't hesitate to tips him about Bitcointalk. You should invite only who is ready to learn or ready to invest or has already invested without a proper knowledge on how to keep his funds safe because some bitcoin investors thinks that leaving their coins in an exchange is the best due to lack of knowledge on how bitcoin should be stored. The forum has always encouraged members to bring in more people into the community so that the adoption of bitcoin will increase in the world,which has always being the target of this forum.",

Sometimes I think if there isn't any signature campaign this forum would lose organic users and activity slowly. If your friends or family recently learned about bitcoin and want to learn more then invite them to this forum. This forum contains core knowledge about bitcoin.

If the signature campaigns are to be stopped someday on Bitcointalk, the no of members here would drop. Alot of members here on Bitcointalk will tell you that they are here to gain knowledge of which is one benefit of being a member of Bitcointalk but they all know deep down that if there wasn't any signature campaigns then alot of them wouldn't be here, but only visit when they are less busy or when they feel like.. I won't lie I too might just do same . But let's all be realistic. The signature campaigns and contests keeps the forum active daily giving every members a way to share their knowledge and driving them into having a reason to continually use Bitcointalk.

Let's say just like a car that won't move far if it doesn't have gasoline. It helps to sustain your expenses while you are here just like the electricity bill and your internet bill.But newbies shouldn't think first about the profit/benefit and shouldn't not only the reason why they are here.  It should be a determination to gain knowledge and improve skills while they are here.  Because IMO, the more you are eager to make a profit will have to idea of cheating while you are here which probably ends up destroying your account once you've caught it.Anyway, encourage someone is a good idea to join here in the community but there's no reason to force them if they will not.",

The signature campaigns and contests keeps the forum active daily giving every members a way to share their knowledge and driving them into having a reason to continually use Bitcointalk. Financial motivation is a very big reason why a lot of members use bitcointalk and that in itself is not a problem at all. We all have bills and real life expenses to pay, getting some income while doing something you love doing and have an interest in is something that comes very easy for everyone.That being said this does not mean that we solely invite someone with the promise that the forum will give them an extra source of income if they do certain things right. We should only invite people who have an interest in Bitcoin or use this forum as a means to spark an interest for someone we want to get to know about Bitcoin.This will reduce the rate of spam from members who are here just to join bounties and get rich quicky or at least make some dollars quick.If signatures ever stopped more than two-thirds of the members here will be totally inactive and those who do remain here will either do it sparingly out of love for Bitcoin or in the hopes that signatures will someday return and they will have grown their accounts in preparation for that.",

As soon as the background of the news changes, people's interest awakens, and some even find their way here without an invitation.On the other hand, for my personal example, I told several friends about the forum when I came here, but unfortunately, no one was there since people did not show interest.
