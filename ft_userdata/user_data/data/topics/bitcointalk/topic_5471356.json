If not, how many bitcoins holding is equal to being rich in your opinion ? To answer your question we have to define the \"Rich\" concept, i was reading a Forbes article that explains how the different generations have different concepts of how much you need to be rich:Millennials (de 24 a 39 years): 1,4 mddX Gen (40 - 55 years): 1,9 mddBaby boomers (56 - 74 years): 2.5 mddAnd since BTC price is $30k then 1 btc is not enough to be rich, you need at least 45BTC to be rich with bitcoin.

This can depends on the location of the person, but my on side I can called myself a rich person because right now one bitcoin cost $30,799 and the rate of dollar in myself now is ₦1200 so if you multiple 30,799 by 1200 you will have ₦36,958,800 which is huge amount here in my side. Even though things are very costly with this amount now someone can achieve so many things like building a house let say three bedroom flat with complete ideas needed in a house like air condition, refrigerator, toilets fittings including hot water system, kitchen and also decorations of all the bedroom, sitting room, dinning room, even buy a simple domestic car and they will still be some changes that will remain.",

So how much more if you hold more of it, then you’ll be a billionaire once you decide to sell it and gain huge profits. That amount can already buy you house and lot, and luxury cars and live a very comfortable life. However, if you hold your bitcoin and decide to panic sell at a bearish price, then most likely the value will also depreciate. If that happens, instead of earning a million, your profits will certainly decrease because you sell your bitcoin at a very wrong timing.",

If not, how many bitcoins holding is equal to being rich in your opinion ? Well, it depends on your location as in some countries a single Bitcoin is enough to be rich while in other countries you may require multiple Bitcoin to be rich. If you live in poor countries of Africa then surely 1 Bitcoin is a sign of richness and there are a few countries in Asia where holding 1 Bitcoin will make you a rich person. On the other hand if you're living in a country like United States, Canada, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, then 1 Bitcoin won't make you rich at all. The current value of one Bitcoin is over 30k and if someone has 30k in a poor country like  South Sudan then that person is surely among the rich ones and if someone has 30k in a rich country like Luxembourg then that person can't be called as a rich person.The level of richness varies from one location to other location so in one country someone with $20k is considered as a wealthy person while in other country someone with $20k is not considered as a wealthy person.",

If not, how many bitcoins holding is equal to being rich in your opinion ? The level of well-being in each individual country will differ and therefore, the threshold for joining the ranks of the rich will vary depending on the country of residence. As you remember, there are countries with developed and developing economies, with the same amount of money (bitcoins in our case) you will either be rich or barely reach the middle class.1BTC now sells for $30.000. In 2023, this can hardly be called wealth. How much will a bitcoin cost in 10, 20, 50 years? If the predictions that 1BTC will be worth $1.000.000 are correct, then someday those who own 1BTC will be considered rich.Perhaps, owning 10BTC or more can now be called wealth to one degree or another (depending on the country of residence) at the current exchange rate.",

If you own 1BTC in my country it is very normal and you are just one of those people with average assets, you are not rich. When we talk about bitcoin it means that bitcoin has the potential to bring us high profits, not that owning 1bitcoin or 2btc will make us rich. With the current value of each bitcoin worth $30k, that's actually a pretty small number to call rich.",

Looks like we found a place to migrate after this coming halving.  You could really spend 1BTC deliberately you can spend it all in 1 hour but with the price to reach $100K, you gonna live comfortably in your country. Anyway, to OP don't think owning 1BTC is already you being rich. You can only consider yourself rich if you have a constant flow of money. Because you still need to work to make money then it's not something you can rely on.  You best need to invest and put up a business.",

Again, we're yet to come to the end of 2023 to ascertain what amount per the price of Bitcoin you're looking at to guage who's rich or not. At the current price, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $30k. It wasn't so a few weeks ago. It can even go pass that a few weeks from now or relapse to the $20k region again. In my country, $30k is a substantial amount of money, and yes we can describe someone hodling one Bitcoin as rich in my country. This, of course, won't be the reality in other countries.",

Mate, you have used almost all the money to take care of needs that will make the money not last long. Why don't you think of investing the monet and wait for your returns, rather than rushing into spending it on things that wouldn't give you any income. Your country economy is declining and your fiat currency is also depreciating gradually.Yes OP, if you have 1btc, you will be rich if you leave it till the next bull run and sell during that period, because there are possibilities that you will sell your bitcoin above $100 by 2025. Although, for one to see himself as being rich depends on the individual. Some persons as long as they they buy whatever they need and have a home, whereby everybody is happy and peaceful, they see it as being rich. While one the other hand, some people see riches as investments and having exotic cars and living a flamboyant life-style.",

If not, how many bitcoins holding is equal to being rich in your opinion ? The answer to this query depends on many factors like the country you are living in, the inflation rate, the health of the local currency you are using, the dollar rate in your currency, etc., etc. For me, the current dollar rate is around 288pkr and If I will convert the 1 BTC to local currency then it will become around 86,40,000 PKR, which is enough to make me rich.Well, another factor that matters here is, what are your definition of being rich is, if you think rich is having enough money to buy anything that comes to your mind, like some car, house, or brand clothes or fashion wares then 1 BTC (at current rate) is not enough even in my local currency. So, I would say, no 1 BTC will not make you rich. But if you take rich as having enough money to fulfill only needs and no wishes then you are rich enough, to spend 8 years max and a minimum of 5 years, which are obviously not enough.",

Having 1 Bitcoin may feel cool but it is far from rich, and in the country where I live, having 1 Bitcoin compared to 1 house can only create a minimalist house. However, it all depends on the country and region where you live and if you are in a remote area, maybe you can build a house that is quite luxurious but not in a busy area.And the real advantage of owning 1 Bitcoin is that you own a unit of true wealth that is not under the control of governments and central banks, and in the long run the profits will increase which will most likely make you a little rich. And not very rich.And having just 1 Bitcoin will make you feel financially comfortable, but having more than 10 Bitcoins will make you quite rich.",

The economic discrepancies in both nations are wide. From the standard of living to the quality of life. They all differ.
