      "body": "To be honest, El-Salvador is gambling on bitcoin big time. I understand that the president is very bullish on bitcoin but the country will face a bad financial date if the price of bitcoin remains down. They will definitely gain if the price goes higher but Not sure what's their contingency plan if the price goes down? So whatever bond or instruments they are releasing, are gambling only. Not only for El-Salvador but for the investors as well. I hope they will find some institutional buyers.",

A small poor country with a small population of 6.3 million will not start the mass adoption of bitcoin. The project may be interesting, but it may be more profitable to invest in bitcoin.",

      "body": "The issuance of the instrument is expected to raise $1 billion. According to Bitfinex, the funds raised through the Volcano Bond will be used to repay the country's sovereign debt, create infrastructure for mining, and build Bitcoin City. After recognizing the first cryptocurrency as legal tender in September 2021, El Salvador began mining digital gold from the geothermal energy of a volcano the very next month.They have their own goal to pass a law on digital assets and I think they will succeed!",
