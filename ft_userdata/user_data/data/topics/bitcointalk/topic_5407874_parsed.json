Notably, this lull in attention also coincided with a sharp decline in trading volumes, which are also sitting at their level in half a year. With that being said, the ADA price recently experienced a resurgence, adding roughly 10% over the past week alone. As reported by U.Today, the token briefly surpassed Ripple-affiliated XRP by market capitalization on Sunday.   Read more on U.Today https://u.today/cardano-losing-luster-on-twitter-despite-looming-vasil-hard-fork",

That is not really so surprising to me to be honest. A few months back Cardano was one of the projects that pumped the most because back then the news came up that finally the smart contract functionality will be going live on the Cardano mainnet. After that announcement the price of Cardano pumped up to 3 collars per coin and there were already a lot of projects that announced that they will be launching on cardano once the smart contracts are live. There were already at least 5 different Dexes announced back then and of course each of these projects created a twitter account back then and was very active on social media.Now the hype about Cardano is over or at least pretty low at the moment therefore not much to talk about.",

      "body": "Is Twitter a good measuring stick though?On the other hard, everyone is losing luster isn't it? We are in a bear market and so projects are going down despite any news of upgrades and latest development. So this might be the case for Cardano. I have nothing against the report, but it seems not giving the real picture of the market. Sentiments are really negative right now.",
