So the best you could possibly do now is to stop the regret and move past it. What matters is what you could do with the opportunities that you have at hand now that you know how important Bitcoin is.Â No time is too late to join the line; it's not about having millions first; if your mind is determined, you can start with any little one that you have, and little by little you will accumulate more. When the price pumps, everyone is going to realize profit according to their invested amount.",

You think like a bitcoin critic that is now seeing himself missing out of opportunity that increase in bitcoin price would have offered. Go and learn about bitcoin limited supply and increasing demand. Probably you will be able to know why bitcoin is an asset and why the price will still continue to increase than decrease.",

You are not required to do so especially if that is how you view this technology. Those fanboys you are calling are simply ones who made profit from doing so. They are creating a hype and they are getting something from it; nothing's wrong with that. There are other investments you may choose from, you're not limited in this industry. But don't mind asking why there are many investors even if things are made of 'thin air'. If you're really that curious, just surf this section of forum and you'd know why. There are also other platforns such as social media sites you may also visit. People are doing and engaging to things because of a reason. And if I were you, you should also atleast have one, towards this industry before you actually start.",

Well you have to look long term, and that is the secret of early adopters. So I don't think there is a missed opportunities here, just buy as much as you can and then simply be a bitcoin holder. The longer you hold the better it might be for us, just like what the early adopters did.Quote from: Saucyhead on June 21, 2023, 11:38:35 PMHow can i understand Bitcoin more ?

Seeing how you don't see how companies make a profit from Bitcoin, I believe you're simply looking at the wrong place to understand Bitcoin. You can also browse around the Dev & Technical discussion on this forum. If after doing that you still don't understand or don't believe in it, then don't buy it. Nobody is forcing you to participate anyway, and if you're more comfortable with gold or other things then just buy that. Don't get trapped in FOMO.Quote from: Saucyhead on June 21, 2023, 11:38:35 PMSo now that blackrock made some noise in the Bitcoin space and got everyone rallied up will this be the biggest money grab in history to then crash it on the recession? Nobody can give you an answer. Who knows, maybe someday you will ask the same thing but you'll replace $110 with $60k. At the end of the day, it is a high-risk high-reward investment. If you don't have the means to shoulder the risk, maybe you should look for alternatives. Obviously, you can just spend $100 and then forget it for 10 years or so.",

I'm glad you noticed that even a bit late, oh no you don't late, you still have time to buy even have a little money now. The Blackrock is just one euphoria of this era.

The coin wouldnât stop circulating or halving after the next to suggest that it is an already missed opportunity but rather it mining would continue till 2140 before mining stops and that seems a very long time to come. And due how scarcity brings about demand, everyone that got the coin before then is still in good shape. Reading through your post I found that it is your skepticism that has and is keeping you away from been part of the early adopters. If at this time after you meet bitcoin at $110 and you still think it is just a thin air token then you would certainly miss more lows to buy on. Thereâs nothing bad having to cast your doubt before investing your money into something but if you actually have those doubts then thereâs no reason to cast an eye on the people that are gaining after buying at such lows because they took the risk that most of us couldnât, so it is best they enjoy the most of it now",

As you guys mentioned like the Blackrock, there's always a new trend in years so there would be an opportunity for everyone to witness and experienced the bullish market where people could ride in. And I agree that you don't have to overthink about this company, just buy low, sell high to everyone and you could do better than those companies. But for sure there's no late comers but take your time to study the Bitcoin or else you would rush on these things which makes your life more complicated.",

But anytime is the best time to start investing in Bitcoin. because the price you see today, may not be available in the future. Don't let the Fear of missing out decide your next action.
