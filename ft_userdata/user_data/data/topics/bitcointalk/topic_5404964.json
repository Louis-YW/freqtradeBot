In fact, 1 BTC is still 1 BTC and even though you hear out there based on speculation the price goes to the low $10K line the fact has to be determined by obvious factors. If inflation in all countries becomes unstoppable then the war rages on it could be more than $10K. But you need to pay attention, when people believe that the current price decline is shrinking, that's where we will buy more. Bitcoin still has the greatest power of any coin on the market. If you're not ready, then let us take that road for the long term.",

A lot of things can happen with BTC, anyone says about the bottom might be correct but of course no one can confirm that because its just a prediction, but it’s ok to be more ready about that possibilities. BTC can go the way he wanted to be, it can start to pump again and may never look down on this price again, also it can reach the bottom that no one expects it to happen, it’s just a matter of time and time can really tell that.",

In any way, I don't really care if this is even not yet the bottom. To be honest back in 60k+ up to now, it should be a lot of \"discount\" for all of us to buy more BTC now. Otherwise, just hodl. We've been down to 3k from 7k back in couple of years.",

Once the market hits the bottom, you can expect for the price to rise again since no one knows what the bottom is, you can assume the last bottom price was already the bottom but still there's no assurance for that. BTC is still doing good, and if the price reach $10k again, I don't think it will stay longer on that price, many whales will surely catch that bottom and that might be the start of a strong pump.",

Everyone is just saying their predictions and speculations meaning they are just taking an educated guess or just a wishful guess.  So it is not surprising the opposite thing might happen.  So we really need to be updated especially when the market is highly volatile.  Things that people predict or speculate is always have a 50/50 chance to happen.",

That explains why Bitcoin is unpredictable and I don't think no one has predicted the outcome accurately though there are some close ones. Well, I notice that the price did decrease but it also increase during this times that you may see that it is always decreasing than increasing of the price since I have been notified about the BTC price when it changes.",

I don't want to be pessimistic but now that it's sitting on $19k, there's the chance that it may go lower than that. I'm still hoping that we will really never see that price again and if it starts to recover then at least we go ahead to $30kish and be stable there.But the usual thing in the market, has never been stable and there will always be the fluctuations that we like and the reason why we're here and that's due to the market's continuous volatility.",

People tend to keep positive despite the decline just for the sake of boosting themselves and keeping their faith still strong. But saying it is always the opposite, that is to happen if your analysis is wrong. Of course, we can never expect a bullish trend at this time, prices went down but never I think this will lead to the worse scenario reaching $10k. I will say the worse scenario cause I was just expecting $15k as the bottom price, not $10k. But we can't hold it if that will happen, yet we can't be hopeless as well knowing that there is still a chance to recover even do it drops more.",

You have a point,  just like when everybody is saying that we are going to reach $100k last December 2021. And it didn't happen, and there are many times throughout our bitcoin journey, not sure what is the reason for all of this, but perhaps it just shows how resilient bitcoin is.So why not take advantage of the price point right now? still very cheap right? less than $20k, a good price to enter. And if ever the price of $10k is hit then invest more.",

Because no one knows the what is the bottom, so they make predictions based on the current flow, i.e. technical analysis. And maybe it shows that it's possible that $14k, or $10k can be the lowest.However, the lowest so far is $17k, again we don't know if this is it, or there will be news in the future that can bring the market to another bloodshed. So there is this chance that the price could go or it will not, simple as that.",

The stable idea is to keep DCA'ing if you have some cryptocurrencies that you aim for, it will create a constant flow of fund no matter how the market move, but it's one for the long term.

Did you see last month what happened? everyone was saying the price would drop to 17000$ but the price was still above 34000$ so everyone got it wrong? not! In the past, when everyone said that the price would fall, it would go up but things have changed and in the bad condition of the market today, taking care and listening to what everyone says and then researching better can be a good choice. we cannot simply think: \"everybody is wrong\". it can take years for the price to get back above $30,000Quote from: vv181 on July 02, 2022, 11:00:20 PMChasing the bottom is what always has been people keep doing it.this reminds me of 2018 when the price dropped from 19000$ to 3100$ and many people said that the fund was in the 1000$, nothing else was said to me, everyone wanted to get it right that the fund was 1000$, but no one got it right and no In the end the fund was 3100$",

Well those people who will listen to them will probably have been FUD.Even altcoins have been followed by the bitcoin price movement, so if there is a bottom price on bitcoin, it will be the same on altcoins.Perhaps the market now preparing to have a bull market again but it will not fall down go far dip $10k and that will never happen. The only thing that we can do now and help bitcoin and never sell or buy bitcoin in a DCA so that you are safe buying not at once.",

Everyone will be wrong in their bitcoin prediction, as we know that there is no so called experts here. Anyone is just like you and me, just guesses and some random numbers and then they think they all got it correct.So it's better to do some careful planning, like DCA if you are planning to buy bitcoin monthly. As for the expectations, it's better to expect nothing. Just focus on your long term goal of accumulating, and sell at the right time.",

One of the mistakes people make is that they bet everything in a single outcome and if it does not happen then they lose money, if bitcoin keeps going down then that is good for me because it allows me to get more bitcoin for the same amount of fiat, and if it begins to go up in value then this is good for me too as my profits increase, so as you can see regardless of what happens I win, but not many people can take this approach to the markets and this is why they lose to them.",
