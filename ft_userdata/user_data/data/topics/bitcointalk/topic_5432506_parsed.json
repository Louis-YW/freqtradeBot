Well it's the same thing in wagering tournaments but at least you don't lose all your money if you are not the winner in this kind of tournaments. I don't like very much those games actually because we never know when the owner or one of his friend is playing. And if he is losing he could simply say something went wrong, and cancel the round, but it wouldn't be fair.",

Why not merge it on a single casino so that you will have more games offered on a single brand name. The games is obviously share same theme and it will be perfect to be running on one casino.I really like this fresh idea of games but as @seoincorporation pointed out, It’s very hard to trust the game like this which is just a PVP much while you hold the prize pool in your wallet. You are new in the forum so I doubt user can trust to place any bet on this PvP game.The game is very nostalgic and same idea with the old FishvsFish before which 2 sides compete by putting BTC on each wallet. This is a team effort game which is why it’s exciting to play rather than a single betting competition.",

Revealing your identity is not ideal for fast gaining trust, probably it will boil out to the worst if revealing your identity becomes a danger to your side. Running a signature campaign or any business ad, being active here in the forum will make your reputation increase. However, you are in a good step, in answering those concerns about your website on this thread will increase the chances.",

Which i think is need risks knowing there are escrows or services who runs its users funds after building its reputation.If something a smart contract can do about the holding and dispersing the funds to the winner, it will be a great feature.",

OP should not be focused on how to get reputation but he should be focused on how to manage the site and serve the players so players will feel great to be there. However I really doubt that this kind of game will survive in this gambling industry. He has started a signature campaign but he forgot that it wont attract players to play, because campaign is just an advertising tool to make people aware about its existence but what make people attracted to play is something else.",

Running good promotional events like signature campaigns, and contests is just a plus.As for now, focus on building your site since currently, the website itself looks bland and uninviting. It would have been nice if it had a little artistry or even just a few touches of colors before you launch a campaign to promote it. But since yo have Jayce working on it, I'm sure it'll turn out great. Also, adjust a few mechanics in the games. Coinballer for example has a 144-block waiting time just to see the results.
