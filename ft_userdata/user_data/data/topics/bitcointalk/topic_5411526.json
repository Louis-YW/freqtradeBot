How does it happen that it has such a huge balance (as today about 94,505 BTC ). Also it seems to be very active and there were outgoing transactions. I also notice some weird messages within some OP_RETURN scripts.Any clues? Looking forward to your comments.",

Actually the small sums now and then are associated with different user account selling or buying the bitcoin now and then and all the time. The frequency of miner is very stable and it entirely depends upon mining power. For example if I am mining any coin then I would generally set the payout at fixed rate (let’s say 0.05 BTC) so each time this threshold is reached I am actually getting paid by the pool with this amount. In short it would have been concluded as miners address if the pattern was consistent and being repeated with specific periods. This one is way inconsistent and irregular amounts are being transferred so mostly exchanger and nothing to be surprised about.",
