I don't discourage anyone from investing their money wherever they want, as long as they can accept the consequences and take responsibility for their assets. I believe that's fair enough. Their decisions should be well thought out.From what you've written, it seems you prefer lower risks. However, if we compare Bitcoin, your choice, with stocks or gold, Bitcoin actually carries more risk. Aren't you attracted to other investments that promise smaller wins but have a higher win rate?Knowing that you only choose Bitcoin, I don't really have any objections. It's good because I also have BTC.",

It is better to win small and lose less than lose more and win lessOkay @ OP, you have made some points.I am going to generalize my thoughts on this as the topic and board is concerned.So I am to take that power of choice making in any form of trades is first considered what to Invest on because otis business wise to engage on a business one is knowledged about and then environmental surveys is run to find a suitable location were your nature of trading is required and not just investing on any kind of business because it has been favorable and lucrative.You also think about of the nature of the business is attracted to seasonal income so you can implement some marketing strategies so as to keep your trading firm actively productive.Most of trading idealed investors who are business oriented who doesn't have a particular business ideal up the head sometimes are inspired to indulge on a particular business by the nature of what the environment is needed but doesn't have one around. This is were your creativity in creating incomes on untried businesses is activated.It is investors decisions to decide if running a short-term or a long-term investment. All good about it is making profits rather being concious and taking earlier measures against retirements is a one considerations that is why a long-term investment and diversifications of investments is considered a business wise.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and safer to hold long term but that does not mean it will bring us greater profits. I'm not saying that investing in altcoins is good but I also don't want to deny that, today some altcoins are giving better returns than bitcoin and their risks are also higher. Therefore, depending on the taste of each investor, there is a suitable choice. The best choice is when your investment offers the highest returns. I invest mainly in bitcoin but I still respect those who make huge profits from altcoins. How can we say they are stupid when they make more profit than us?",

It is better to win small and lose less than lose more and win lessWe are all different when it comes to investing; some people have the heart of taking, and some do not. Personally, I don't like switching from one coin to another because I can't afford to lose money, even though it's not bad to invest in any coin that will be profitable. Purchasing any cryptocurrency that is not bitcoin is akin to investing in a coin that you are unsure of what you will receive; as you pointed out, some coins may have a high supply but low liquidity, while others may have a high market capitalization but very low value. These are the two main issues I have with cryptocurrency.Some coins are not ones you should jump into because they don't work out. After one of my guys tried to invest in a coin that made him wonder why no one had invested before, I changed my mind because my friend actually went broke using 80% of his funds to purchase a coin that he was certain would make money on, but in the end, he ended up crying. Ever since, I have avoided taking any risks with any coins other than bitcoin, and I advise any newbie to avoid buying any coins that aren't bitcoin.",

You can compare the amount of profit and loss potentials between Bitcoin which we consider win small lose less against Altcoin which is vice verse you will find Altcoins may give you huge profit or huge there is nothing much stable in Altcoins hence either profit or loss it has to be more. Bitcoin would be ideal for most of us but a mix of Bitcoin and Altcoin would be best for traders and those who wants to take extra risk and fine with losing as well but aiming for high and quick profits.",

In the process of making a viable investment plan, you would have options available and would have to shuffle through those available options to determine the best way forward. It’s also worth noting like you did about the need to diversify on your portfolio investments. It is never a good idea to have all your eyes in one basket. With cryptocurrencies, it’s best to stick with what you have an understanding about and staying clear of alt coins with no viable future.

I said this because the other traders or holders may have held Bitcoin for the long term, but at the same time they are also doing short-term trading in other altcoins.There are so many people doing that that they can really eat crypto or bitcoin. But of course you must have a wide and deep knowledge of trading here. It is not possible because what others say is that it is only good to hold long-term in Bitcoin, because if everyone holds long-term, then the market will not move because no one will sell because they will only hold. There is nothing like that because you are not traders who can be considered if you only hold short-term.",

Take for example jumping on every new coin we find on reputable exchange might not be enough guarantee that coin will do well in the future.We can apply little strategy if we really want to invest on new altcoin and that is to sell them fast once we are bullish then find another platform that can give us another chance to earn. Forget about holdings since it cannot bring any good result to anyone especially that there are so many scam coins pretending to be a good one. Reputable exchange listing is not enough but it gives plus point that's why if we see a huge hype build up we should do a good action and treat bullish season as time to sell and never doubt for taking profits since mostly greedy people suffer from huge loss.Quote from: Pablo-wood on December 01, 2023, 09:28:50 AMSome coin might have good Supply but low liquidity, some might have high market capitalisation but very poor volatility.
