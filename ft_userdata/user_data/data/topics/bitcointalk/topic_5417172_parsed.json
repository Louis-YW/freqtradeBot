  "content": "This week is the first week for me to be able to follow the signature campaign which is managed by the senior manager of yahoo62278 i.e. Best Crypto Casinos Sig and avatar campaign. At first glance, there seems to be nothing different about the managed campaigns, but looking more specifically at the Rules section, there is a new rule implemented by yahoo62278, namely \"Users must earn 1 merit per week to stay in the campaign\". This becomes a rule that will emphasize the quality of posts and not just how many posts can be made in a week. I myself am not used to getting 1 minute in a week, but this is a new challenge that I need to try, so I will think more about the quality of the posts that will be made rather than just chasing the number of posts.I observed similar rules were also applied to the previous signature Campaign i.e.ðŸ’¥WINZ.IO SIG & AVATAR CAMPAIGNðŸ’¥ and may be the first rule applied to the campaign signature belongs to yahoo62278.This will be a rule that automatically selects campaign members and who can earn 1 merit per week for fulfilling the requirements to stay on the campaign.and finally, I just want to get some good tips from seniors here so that they can get merit in every post that is made, and will the law of reciprocity or mutual support for quality posts with merit also apply?some of the senior forum members who got the most merit to date, I need to learn from them too.Big Thanks to yahoo62278",

Managers have their own rules and the implementation of new rules by yahoo67228 may change depending on the conditions of the forum. But if it really helps to produce quality posters, it might be applied to all campaigns or just as a backup option. About the burstposting you said, it seems to have done some debate, but either way burstposting is unjustified.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 15, 2022, 07:24:36 AMThe rule it's self is still subjected to change according to Yahoo.

Although this rule will be hard on members that post only on Gambling board since merits are hard to come by on that boardyahoo will certainly take good steps for mutual convenience, This rule is still newly implemented and of course there will be some positive and negative responses and there may be some revisions that yahoo will do. I can only follow the existing rules, although right now I'm still trying to collect merit to fulfill the 1 merit rule per week.",

      "body": "The merits system can certainly be a powerful tool to help fight spam and it is about time campaign managers started using it more. I mean, that is what they are meant for, right? And it is a valid one given that many people are not exactly fond of the idea of reading through countless threads filled with spam. Most signature campaigns require five merits in the last 90 days, which majority of campaign participants can meet with ease, but this is not enough so I support this initiative. I believe that yahoo will not automatically kick out members who do not receive a single merit per week, but I am sure he will pay more attention to them.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 15, 2022, 08:04:00 AMIs this me or anyone else is also seeing kamvreto is just making the whole things cheesy?Cheesy?

That's what you do to get things done correctly. There you go with the merit you needed for this week to get paid. But know that consistency is the key. Forum people are more aware about merit fishing than before they were. If you try that path then it won't work.The first post and the 2nd last post were only to talk cheesy to impress your manager to get his attention (others may have different view).Quote from: Stalker22 on October 15, 2022, 08:28:06 AMCheesy?
