Elon musk is doing a horrible job in dealing with those scam bots and I think the old twitter had less spam. Anything crypto related usually has tons and tons of spam replies that you need to filter thru all that before you get any legit replies. In the future, any claim like 20% gains in a day is just too good to be true and a scam.",

A 20% ROI is a huge amount on a 24-hour arbitrage trade. Thinking in real terms, is there such a platform that provides huge profits in just 24 hours? Getting 20% ROI in trading also requires a pretty good strategy and analysis and is not easy to do. Even fraudulent sites promise a higher ROI that can reach 50%. Must be more selective and do research so as not to get trapped. Sometimes we also have to think like a fraudster to know what the fraudster is planning. We must think critically and not be tempted by promises of large profits that do not make sense.",

You don't stand a chance with self-written software, because speed is what counts in arbitrage. Speed is required in Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies with high liquidity, but if you want to carry out arbitrage with some altcoins in which liquidity may differ, you can simply make a good profit without using a fast bot. with arbitrage here is that the value of the currency may fall quickly or it may not. You find sufficient liquidity to execute your order quickly and you need to use a market order (it will eliminate all your profits)although arbitrage in altcoins is profitable and without additional bot costs, I prefer a fast bot with Bitcoin.",

If you have been in the crypto world for a longer period of time and have faced similar situation before, then you can easily identify a scam and a legit scenario. Knowledge is the key and the more you learn, the more you know. Imagine a person who is involved with cryptocurrency for a longer period of time, then you will know that the offer they are providing are not legit. I'm in 20% ROI within 24 hours time is achievable, but how are they going to make it? In trading lost and profit is inevitable. It carries risks. If they guarantee you that you can gain 20% no matter what then they are lying. It is better to stay away from this kind of things and do it on your own. Enjoy what you are doing and not rely on something that is too good to be true. Greed is a thing that led to losses. Instead of relying on some bots, be happy with what you are making on your own and work on your strategies so that you can make more in the future. Relying on to something else would never help improving yourself.",

Yes, because arbitrage can also be done manually and this is where it all begun, but experts think of a more efficient way of doing it, so they think a bot can handle it better. If we have a talent with it why not depend only on our own ability? If not and if we are curious of trying it, we can just pick the best arbitrage bots in the market today. Trading was still unpredictable after all so yeah, they shouldn't set a fix profit that we can earn by using these bots.And if it's possible then why can they just solo their bots and print unlimited money? There is no point of selling them for some tiny amounts. We should be careful at them. They definitely use it as a marketing ploy.",

Still good that you bring attention to this.A few years ago there were different type of arbitrage scams. A few exchanges had several markets where they listed coins for a much higher or lower price. This created a situation where people tried to arbitrage but when they deposited they lost all their money as the exchange never allowed anyone to withdraw. That was pretty damn nasty",
