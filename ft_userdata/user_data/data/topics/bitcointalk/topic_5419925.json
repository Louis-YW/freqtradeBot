Apart from the well documented cases, it's far more likely to be neither. As humans we tend to think of the extremes because it's less tedious than the more likely outcomes, simply moving on or losing access to their accounts as examples. Ultimately, ten years isn't a long time for either of those two outcomes to come true, especially in the majority of the cases. You could argue that Bitcoin is the exception in getting rich, but most humans think alike, and most wouldn't have held all of their Bitcoin once it started to increase in the early stages.",

It's something that took you --atleast, sometime to pull through 'em; we have alot of people that can't persevere, just the way you, I, and everyone else did. I really think that a user with proir intensions on learning alot would hold on to what they came for, but any one that registered with an unclear motive -- if it takes too long to leave its embryotic stage, then they'll simply give up.....it's as easy as that. I understand that some had been forcefully snatched from life itself, by the cold hands of \"Hades\", but that's a different ball-gameSandra 💇",

The description states that the Admin can tweak the parameter settings for the period of time, setting it accordingly to fit one of these options:QuoteThis mod allows you to select periods for which to display the forum statistics.You can choose between first/last x days/weeks/months/years or custom start and end dates OR their combination.Not sure how the parameters are set here, but I presume that the period is set globally to the Statistics Center to keep a consistency in the displayed data (as opposed to set per counter).Having said that (as a context), it seems clearly inconsistent: If we take the average posts per day in 2022, and contrast it to the average number of user online per day, we get a ratio of over 43 posts per day per active user. The ratio is just over 3 in the 2012 snapshot.Note: there are probably many bot type registrations nowadays with 0 posts, than back in 2012, so the average number of registrations per day may not represent accounts with real intent to participate in the forum.",

At first it was open to everyone. I don't believe they were the first either, but probably the one who popularised it and was certainly one of the longest running. They were also the first campaign I saw on the forum and also joined. Yes there were quite few old bounties as early as August 2010, but those were not signature campaigns. I found one more signature campaign earlier than PrimeDice, is this one Buying Your Signature!

Do we still need to see a graph for BTC price from 2009 to 2017 to compare? I don't think so... I'm sure now it's embedded in everyone's head forever.",

If you studied the statistics posted by other members of this forum, you could see that the activity on this forum is actually dropping, especially in the local sections of the forum.So we have a lot more members but less activity on the forum, and I would say less quality discussions based on my personal experience, than before.Why is this so and why people register on this forum and then do not write on the forum?A very difficult question. Somehow it seems to me that lately there are a lot more crypto discussions in Telegram groups and on social networks. Maybe the time of internet forums is over.As far as I can see, young people are no longer interested in internet forums and older members are mostly active there.",
