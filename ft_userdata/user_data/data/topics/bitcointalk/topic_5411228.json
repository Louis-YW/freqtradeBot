  "content": "Backpack Bag Bitcoin Mining Machine is a device that is used to mine bitcoin at anywhere at anytime. It is hanged like a normal school bag. I may say, it is a mobile machine for mining whenever location the miner found him or herself. Really, I have not seen such in my life before but when I saw it on instagram I was amused and I asked a friend who is conversant with bitcoin to explain it for me and I also made some study in it. But in the internet source I did not see this particular one but real laptop bag for backpack mining.I really love this new technology for mining bitcoin with less energy.",

That should be obvious to anyone.Why would you even create a new topic just because you found a funny picture online?",

And I'm sure this is not profitable you are just going to waste your money with this bag pack. It would be better if it's a USB stick miner like NotFuzzyWarm said above the weight of a USB stick is around 0.05kg, unlike a mining machine like s9 with a weight of around 5 to 6kg plus the battery weight which is heavy I can't endure bringing them anywhere. If you want a lightweight USB stick, raspi, and portable power bank would be enough to bring them anywhere without getting tired.",
