Would the world economy suffer or would we be fine?If you are referring to the impact of BRICS toward world economy then that's bad for whole world because most of the countries in the world are using US dollar as there national reserves and if you are asking what impact does this alliances will make for the whole world then that's will be a productive one too. Because if they do what they really say then there will be more goods in the market more diamonds, more agriculture business, more energy production units, more foreign business will tend to join. And if they do it rightly, then along with Africa those who are from Africa spread in worldwide countries will get some relief and could do some more productive works. Overall, the countries are connected sorry not countries the impact of such decisions are connected between citizens of one country spread all along the world. One who is in Spain, US, in any other country doing something productive then the rate will increase. No to mentioned the import and export will also increase of your country with other countries and also other countries will also make money so one country is making profit out of another.",

The African leaders are pushing away the French bases in those countries you mention. Wherever the Wagner Army goes, there is always going to be a purpose and because they are on the side of African leaders, it seems like the West will have no power over them unless they fight over for the resources they wanna plunder.All economies are already suffering though. I bet they all are just planning for economies to fall so they all could launch their digital currencies, the idea was been fed to many influencers.",

Now this alliance will probably have an impact on the economy perhaps not as noticeable to the rest of the world, but it could specifically bring good things to Russia, since if we think about it, this territory is going through a conflict that, although it caused it, has severely harmed it, trying to generate agreements with other countries can help it remain stable and not collapse due to the sanctions that have been implemented, one of the reasons why I consider that it has been The war against Ukraine has spread so much, since the countries that are against Russia have not managed to weaken it to such an extent that they have forced it to give in, due to this type of event, what i Wonder now is...for how long will it continue the war if it continues to be fed from outside?",

Everything boils down to development of the African continent and what Russia stands to benefits in doing so, the African continent has suffered decades of underdevelopment and poor economy strength to strive. So having discussion's like this is a welcome development. But However, I don't see any war happening, whatever alliance the counties you mentioned are forming, is basically for business and economics strengthening because I believe they cannot be gathering for war purposes but for the good of their people. just as, Winston Churchill will say, \"it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war\".",

I mean, we all know that he doesn't try to hide his detestation of the West and anything that can affect them sorely, he's game.I wouldn't call this an alliance but a subtle method for him to gain control of Africa because in truth, there's not much Africa countries are benefiting economically from them as he's not looking to invest but these African countries see no problem with that. For them, just having Russia with them gives them some validation of power. So far, it's just four African countries that Russia trades with; Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and South Africa and since Africa contributes for about 2.4% of the world's GDP, I doubt it would affect. All Putin is concerned about from this so called alliance is to slowly dominate and since they are gullible it would allign with his vision of a multipolar international system",

For his 15 wives and himself. The people of Swaziland got... You know what....And all this alliance - it is not for the sake of creation, but for the sake of creating a semblance of importance of Russia on the African continent. By the way, you remember that only 1/3 of those invited to the summit \"Africa-Russia\" came to the summit. And now evaluate the economies of the countries present. Most of them are depressed economies. How can they do anything? The only potential \"benefit\" is the minerals that Russia will try to monopolize in order to sell through African countries and get foreign exchange income.And a few words about the \"amazing coincidences\" before the summit: how fortunate everything happened in Niger. It looks like the Transahara gas pipeline project from Nigeria to Europe via Niger and Algeria will never materialize. Europe was planning to receive 30 billion cubic meters of Nigerian gas through it. Guess what is the purpose of NOT selling gas to the EU? And who benefits?",

Most nations pretend that Africa is insignificant to the global economy. Yet they are scrambling to establish their influence on the continent. The Western powers are pushing West African nations to go to war against Niger because they want to reinstall democracy. But this country has been under French economic exploitation and oppression. Their central bank is integrated with the French Central Bank yet the country is one of the poorest in the world. France is not concerned about the growth of the economy, neither are they concerned about good governance of Niger but their main concern is to exploit raw materials. African nations should seize this opportunity to make hard choices. They should strive towards economic independence and not rely on either the Eastern or Western bloc. Their focus should be on how to make favorable bilateral deals with any bloc that will promote the development of the continent.

But it's still struggling a lot, following a long colonial history that made sure that what Africa can give to the world would be systemically undervalued, and that regions would simply be exploited by the richer nations. So for now, it's not looking good overall, with high rates of violence and poverty, very high rate of corruption and low GDP, a lot of dictatorships, etc.Russia plays their card of opposing Western imperialism really well with Africa, making sure it is seen as the strongest force actively opposing the countries that made things so hard for Africa. Too bad that many countries don't care to see that Russia still follows a strong imperialist mindset, and it led to lots of colonization and suffering of other nations as well.But whatever's going on there, it's small in comparison with Western economies and solidarity, so I don't think there will be any measurable impact of this alliance on the World Economy. Russia is slowly drowning because of the war it's waging against Ukraine, and it's going to drag other countries along with it.",

But if in yuanization they just involve not very smart rulers of some countries, then \"rubleization\" is built on lies, corruption and theft. I know that corruption in some African countries is on a gigantic scale. After the arrival of \"Russian friends\" the level of corruption will increase by orders of magnitude, and accordingly the lives of ordinary people in these countries will go down, although you probably thought that it could not be worse. In addition to the fall in living standards, these countries will also face wild destabilization, civil wars, and deaths. Why? Because this is Russia's favorite method of \"solving\" its problems in the region. I will remind you - terrorism/destabilization/civil conflicts \"staged\" and \"conducted\" by Russia - Armenia/Azerbaijan, Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine, now Niger and other African countries where military coups are being organized/prepared.

Niger for example had a military coup and the world is not working together to resolve the issue. There are countries now supporting Niger, then there are neighbour countries that want to attack it and restore the previous president and there is the former colonial power France that tries to intervene as well. What surprises me the most was a survey in the countries that asked the people who they would prefer to see and intervene in the conflicts, the majority voted not for USA or Europe, but rather for Russia. Russia seems to be more open towards the military needs of those countries and has no restriction on arms exports, compared to the West that focuses more on humanitarian missions. For the world this is a problem, because countries are not working together anymore and there is a lot of rivalry.",

These leaders should know that that region is under serious attack from ISIS, Boko Haram, and other militant group. ECOWAS troops will be unable to handle the outcome of a conflict in that region. The outcome will be more disastrous than what is happening in Libya. Protests are still going on against any military intervention by ECOWAS with many citizens willing to volunteer to protect their country. To show their solidarity Mali and Burkina Faso has dispatched warplanes to Niger. The price for freedom from exploitation should be paid if Africa wants to develop. After all other nations have survived with multiple sanctions from powerful nations. They should go and learn from these nations how they survived these sanctions. Africa should not be under the influence of any bloc but we can be trading partners. If you really want to help us develop, don't focus on just our raw materials, build industries in our lands and help us achieve economic growth.",
