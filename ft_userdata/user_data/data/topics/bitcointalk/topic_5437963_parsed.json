I also understand that we humans at some points are the majors reasons to our problems and despite all the warning and recent happenings with the FTX, people are still using centralized exchanges and this is because the centralized exchanges are been simplified for easy usuage I guess and people want things easier at all cost.",

People's attention has been drawn to those exchanges, and they are completely comfortable using it. Some people are too lazy to keep their keys safe with them, so they entrust their keys to someone or a platform they trust based on their first impression and how far they’ve built themselves. I'm also confident that if FTX resumes full operations, people will continue to save their money with them. They've invented a trademark that can't be changed or broken.",

Trading services in digital currencies are provided by private companies, and governments have not yet organized an attempt to fully supervise one of these platforms, even as an experiment. Apart from governments, I do not see a more reliable broker to make the process of change in the current market situation after the collapse of ftx.There are those who advocate the use of decentralized platforms, but these platforms also have their drawbacks. Centralized platforms are not within the reach of all users' capabilities. The current decentralized platforms cannot meet the global demand for trading.",

A good example why CEX won't be leaving anytime soon in this market.Binance is one of the top trusted CEXs among crypto community, so even if we had FTX fallout, it won't affect customers.Maybe the thought of pulling out their funds from CEXs and transferring it to their own wallets,but still people will use the services offered by centralized exchanges.Just an example is that you can't get a lot of trading pairs from DEXs. Most top alts are still available from CEX trading platforms.",

I have a feeling that sooner or later the CEX will be bought or replaced by our \"beloved friends\", the banks themselves.I have a feeling that they are not going to be replaced by banks and more likely become banks if they haven't already- you need an ID to open an account, you need to go through KYC, and even Proof of Funds - you have your wallet's addresses, like an IBAN- you can get a card in your name from them, linked to your account, and you can do internal payments between users, completely off-chain - you have \"Earn\" accounts just like some banks do- you get your account frozen even easier than with a bank with nobody to talk about, this is a bonusSo, what really are the differences, other than one is using BTC and the other $ ?",

Am I evil for wanting to see CEX go or at least become less important? Lets just face up the reality on which no matter how issues of CEX do pop out in the market, they would be still mainly be supported by the community or lots of users.Why? The main reason is that this is the platform on which you could trade up your crypto into stablecoins or simply make out conversions to fiat which is something that you cant be able to do on DEX.Yes, it does really sacrifice when it comes to overallanonymity or totally opposing up its real essence but we dont have any choice unless if you do hold for long term and dont make out some active trading then this wont really be that much of an issue.Thing here is that we should not put up all of our assets on these centralized platforms which we do know that risk is always there.It would be an endless cycle i would say.",

One of the things that we do really want is to have that security because not all transactions we are dealing on would be perfect on which there would really be errors which we do need up some support and this is where people do really find out themselves to be comfortable with centralized exchangers on which they do know that they could reach up someone if ever there are really some problems that arise up in regarding into their transactions.Decentralization is best but we know that not all people would really be that tech savy or likes complicated things specially in cross chain transactions.I could honestly say that it is really that hassle and complicated.",

Am I evil for wanting to see CEX go or at least become less important? CEX vs DEX is the same competition as Bitcoin vs fiat/banks. Most people are using whichever is all-around best for them. Which is CEX and fiat/banks. Some people have different priorities so DEX and Bitcoin works for them.Traders want to be able to do many trades per day instantly and with low fees. If DEX requires onchain + bank transaction for each trade, it's going to take a lot of time and have high fees.

Even though using DEX might seem easy and simple to us, for most that are new to crypto currencies, and those that aren't interested in the technology, but only in making profit, they will always prefer using a centralized exchange. All they have to do is send money, buy crypto and hold. The FTX incident won't also change anything. Perhaps more people will be cautious, but like you said, after things cooled down, most people are back and using CEX again.",

      "body": "First thing isn’t taking centralized exchanges away just yet is the more features they offer than the DEX. no matter how we talk about security and privacy on decentralized platforms, many investors prioritizes profits and could swap there privacy to get that. And with features like spot and margin trading people easily ditch CEX for DEX. Another reason why centralized exchanges will be hard to get people off it is the fact that the government easily leans towards them since they could easily be regulated and this helps spreads its popularity in such a way that this is probably one of first things new investors know a thing about. Take Binance for instance, we could see or read about them offering scholarships in some countries in blockchain and this helps them to create the popularity they need. Liquidity which is more in CEX than DEX is also another reason to why people still use them. Quote from: KingsDen on February 03, 2023, 10:43:15 PMI don't have any problems with exchanges. I only advice that exchanges should be used as exchanges and not as wallets. Live and let live Definitely the only advice to be given on centralized exchanges. Just take out your funds after trading and store them on wallets.
