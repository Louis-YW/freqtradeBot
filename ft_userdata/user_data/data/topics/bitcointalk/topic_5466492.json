It means you may end up installing a malware along with/without a bitcoin wallet which may compromise your personal data.All I emphasize here is, just do not target only $20 but you must take all pre-cautionary measurements against possible malware injection.",

And the Testflight is currently gated by phone number. So you'll need a phone number to test. Since many of you are privacy conscious, I'll add this doesn't have to be your personal number — you can use a service like https://anonymsms.com/.",
