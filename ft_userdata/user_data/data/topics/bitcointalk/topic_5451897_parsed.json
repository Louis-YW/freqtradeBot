  "content": "The prediction of bitcoin's price made by Balaji Srinivasan, a former CTO of Coinbase (1 btc = 1 million USD), is unattainable for the majority of individuals. Some people view these actions as a strategy for his personal campaign. Others see this as a reflection of his long-held opinions towards bitcoin. But it is simple to see how Srinivasan's ambitious estimate of 1 million in 90 days would have a significant effect on the Bitcoin market. I think it doesn't matter how much Bitcoin can rise in value over the next 90 days because those that believe in it don't hold onto it for a short time. According to Srinivasan's prediction, Bitcoin is probably going to soar to unprecedented heights. Balaji Srinivasan, the former CTO of Coinbase, should show respect for his latest opinion about bitcoin.Although Srinivasan recently made a prediction that some may find ludicrous, in the long run, it turned out to be a pretty accurate prediction. It is challenging to discount his prognosis because it was based on the US banking system and hyperinflation. Generally speaking, we are aware that a market cap has the power to push Bitcoin's valuation to previously unheard-of heights. The market capitalization of Bitcoin has recently increased due to a variety of institutional investments. Billions of dollars are now being invested in Bitcoin by publicly traded companies including Tesla, Voyager Digital LTD, and MicroStrategy, which inevitably increases the currency's acceptance as legitimate.According to the current price of bitcoin, if one bitcoin is valued at $1 million, then a market cap of roughly $20 trillion is needed. Even while it could appear to be more right now, a crypto revolution could potentially cover it. The domination of Bitcoin's market is yet another significant factor that will help it rise in the next days. As of right now, we can see that Bitcoin accounts for around 45 percent of all market investments. The price of altcoins on the market will alter substantially, and the market value will climb sharply, as long as Bitcoin maintains a rise of at least 65 percent.The last thing I'll say is that people are starting to understand the value of Bitcoin, so even if it doesn't happen in 90 days, we will be able to do it soon.",

Coinbase CTO go to twitter to made a bet, risking the same 1 mln $, but to earn 1 mln $ intead of 29 mln $. So it was the dumbest bet in a history of dumb bets maybe ever... betting against the CTO of Coinbase, all you had to do was hedge the bitcoin exposure and enjoy almost free money.It was just pure marketing.",

That sounds good! The only problem is the possible fiat inflation... I mean, BTC and other stablecoins can become more expensive due to the decline in dollar and other fiats values. This process is able to bring the whole financial market to a little or big mess...",

It might be that he wanted to create media hype that will attract more people to the Bitcoin space or he just wanted to attract attention. Currently, the Bitcoin space is affected by some unpredictable economic factors. We saw how the war in Ukraine and the increase in the price of power affected the price of Bitcoin last year. These factors have made the price of Bitcoin unpredictable. But I am not sure that Bitcoin will go below $20k before the bull session. Regardless of the attacks and challenges, I agree with your heading that Bitcoin will definitely succeed. I don't have confidence in social media bitcoin price forecasts because many of them have failed, making them unreliable.",

No one would ever concur to such an outrageous speculated price even if bitcoin is given 10 years to reach that price. There are speculated prices that can easily be accepted by many. Like a $100k price tag of bitcoin in the next bull run. It can be possible or not during the bull run, but a 1 million dollar price will hardly come by based on bitcoin is still at its early stage and not yet widely accepted globally",
