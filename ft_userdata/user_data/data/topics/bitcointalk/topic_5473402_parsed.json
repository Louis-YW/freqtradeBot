Meriting the official eclipsepayments.com thread is the first step.Remove this requirement as soon as possible.Merit as a condition for participation in the giveaway is an indirect way of buying merit. Even if it is not interpreted like that, it is not desirable to ask for merit, then it's begging.Quote from: hilariousandco on January 16, 2018, 12:24:24 PMCan I ask for merit?There is no need to do this and this behaviour is usually seen as 'merit begging' which is frowned upon by the community and may lead to you receiving negative feedback. Keep making quality, constructive posts and you will surely be rewarded over time. Can I sell merit?Selling merit is disallowed.Also step two, demanding and conditioning to comment in the ANN thread and offering a reward for it is prohibited.",
