I have only learned about how it can be used in trading and not other places, so my answer may not be accurate at all. Also even if it can be used for other things, I do not think it can be up to what you are talking about, but there might be some AI that can be used for that purpose. You can correct me if I am wrong because my knowledge on AI is very little.",

I mean, the game is played between two to ten players, each of them have different combination of cards, there is no way an AI can build a strategy out of thin air because there are a lot of combinations that its opponents may have in hand.Imagine, an AI can beat a person in chess game because it knows opponent's pieces and knows where they are located. Because of that, an AI is capable to mathematically calculate every possible way and always act according to the best one but Poker is a guess what your opponent has game. If I have good cards on hand, absolutely no one and nothing will be able to beat me.An AI robot may have an advantage in real-life poker matches if it's advanced and capable to understand the emotions of its' opponents as they change facial expression.",

I mean, the game is played between two to ten players, each of them have different combination of cards, there is no way an AI can build a strategy out of thin air because there are a lot of combinations that its opponents may have in hand.I think it’s possible because an AI can easily calculate the winning percentage of the initial hands quickly same when the flop, turn and turn card is available. Actually the can easily play bluff once it analyze the game play of other players based on the past rounds like Player A keeps bluffing, Player B is just playing with good hands and etc. The advantage of having an AI was it can easily calculate the winning percentage and risk involved on the hands. It can play proficient because it doesn’t have emotion and will just play based on stats which is a common advantage of pro player aside from bluffing since bluffing is not always being use by the pro or else they can easily be setup by a trap.",

      "body": "Until now I'm still confused about how to use chatgpt to beat poker online, if we have to play against opposing players why should we use chatgpt or AI because basically poker games also require the skill of bluffing opponents like I usually do when playing poker and against other people in poker table, but maybe for poker machines it might be used because AI technology is currently being widely used to help facilitate human work.Right now I have never even tried it to think about how to beat the dealer or someone at the gambling table or online poker using chatgpt AI technology, after all it also requires a human touch too if we use it, to be honest I often find threads like this discussing chatgpt AI technology and gambling, they want to find a way to win using technology. it's pretty much impossible to beat the bookies except against someone.",

Would it be possible??Why chatgpt?There are plenty of RTA (Real Time Assistance) programs for poker available already.Also, if it gets out that a player is using such programs this has resulted in getting banned on sites like Pokerstars or GGpoker.There have even been some prominent cases such as Chris Brewer  . Some examples:https://www.tympanicklaw.com/blog/2022/05/bombshell-cheating-allegations-rock-poker-community/https://pokerfuse.com/news/poker-room-news/211765-ggpoker-reimburses-over-4000-players-following-recent-rta/These programs have so much data already, it would take a while until chatgpt would have the same % of \"poker knowledge\" to be an alternative I think.",

Pshaw, human inventiveness—who needs it when AI is at our disposal, am I right? Why even partake in games when loss is virtually impossible? We might as well recline and assign the toil to the machines.But truly, friends. The concept of nurturing an AI to trounce human adversaries isn't only achievable—it's already a reality. So, why confine ourselves to poker? Let's take it to the max and authorize machines to rule the Earth. I, for one, salute our novel robotic rulers.",

It's not going to turn a game of luck into something that can be read, even with thousands of data available, it won't become the AlphaGo of poker simply because of how poker works. It may be harder to defeat it since it has the know-hows of what to do, but unless it can actually start reading human emotions/face, then we can only expect it to fold on cards that are bad and fight on cards that are good. Maybe a bluff here and there can work, but it won't exactly feat a person who can bluff themselves, if they knew what they were doing.",
