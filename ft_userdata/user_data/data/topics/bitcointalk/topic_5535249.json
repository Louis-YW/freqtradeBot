It's never satisfactory for some people. They want more every time.I would still consider bitcoin to be cheap rather than considering it to be expensive knowing it's capability to reach greater heights.If people do think it is expensive then why do they hesitate to buy when bitcoin price dumps ? They still have some dumb reasons like it's falling and wait for the right time to buy which never comes.",

When you check pass data till now, bitcoin has been consistently good to us. Bitcoin has not disappointed us in any cycle. Even if we are still expecting more from bitcoin, we should at least praise her for the things she has done. Before now, we use to be fearful that bitcoin might disapear very soon, but today we are sure that bitcoin is not disapearing.",

Many large companies, whale investors have had an interest in Bitcoin and this cannot be denied in this era that we are facing.So now that the US is also one of those that made Bitcoin a reserve through Trump's executive order, it is really a big impact on all bitcoin or crypto communities in this industry. Didn't even the institution investors also have an interest in it? that's because they witnessed what it has reached in the market all over the world.",

Whatever remarkable Bitcoin tends to achieved is not their main concern because they have their mind placed on Bitcoin profits",

But they're still unhappy.  There are several obvious reasons for this.Yes, bitcoin has become popular, but it has not solved all the problems. For example, it is still volatile, and transaction fees are sometimes high.Decentralization and security are good, but they make bitcoin slow and not as convenient for everyday payments as we would like.Also, many people wanted to get rich on bitcoin at the time, but not everyone succeeded. Someone bought at the peak of the price and is not complaining about losses.As for regulation, the authorities of many countries have not yet decided how to treat cryptocurrencies, which creates uncertainty and fear.Well, in general, people will always find something to complain about, especially if their expectations were too high.",

However, crypto is not very casual that anyone understood and not every have them. The government still is attacking it, its only the big people like the president approved it.",

The complains and feel of dissatisfaction is era base. People who started buying bitcoin when it was below $100 are definitely wealthy as at today and they do not complain or grudge against bitcoin. But those who knew bitcoin recently will continue to complain because they do not know how it was for early adopters. We are currently living the dream of old adopters in terms of bitcoin acceptability, but in terms of reward or profits, they will continued to be ahead of us.",

We've been asking for that for a long time, and then it happened. The financial institutions are also in then we still looking for more I guess. The governments have joined, and yet we seem to be not satisfied. So, I think that this is just a natural thing for human beings that we keep asking for more and we never get satisfied with the favors that we're getting. Although some arguments are valid that this isn't what satoshi has envisioned but can we ask for more?",

There was a time when we wanted Bitcoin to be widespread and globally accepted but massive problems started with massive adoption, mining became a commercial business and it significantly affected Bitcoin's decentralization. If years ago everyone could mine Bitcoin with their computer or GPU from home, now that's impossible, even if you own ASICs, you need to have access to very cheap or free electricity. Also, with time, Bitcoin became more controlled and kyc free world disappeared. Also, as Bitcoin became famous, lots of companies and people started manipulating Bitcoin's price. For example, Elon Musk manipulated the price in 2020-2021, then the SEC manipulated it a few months ago, there are also some other examples. Increased adoption and increased popularity are good but it comes with the cost and the cost is heavy.",

However, generally much has not changed as to how most centralized governments view BTC, they still attack privacy in the network and if there was a way they could control it, i am sure they would have done so, but they cannot.
