  "content": "The History of BINGOBingo is one of the most well-known forms of gambling that can be found all over the world. It is actually very popular among older people in my country and usually has a place of its own, but it can also be found in almost any casino.It is said to have been brought up in Italy around 1530 as a form of Lottery and was called   “Il Gioco del Lotto d’Italia”. Furthermore, it was later exported to France, where it grew to become one of the most favourite games of the French aristocracy. It was much later named \"Bingo\" in the US, when it hit the spotlight over there.

More like their resting (gossip) place while they are waiting for dinner time so they could go home and prepare food for their family. But now, I rarely see it.Internet, computer, smartphones, all of those changed everything.Online? I haven't seen one but if there is, I doubt it will be as fun as shaking the bottle, getting one, and shouting out the letter and number.",

BINGO PLUS but it's a local fiat gambling and I'm not sure if it can be accessed outside the country as we use our own currency to play here. Everything is automated that's why lots of people here got addicted to that gambling. It's a good time killing for those who don't know how to spend their time and past time for housewives.I don't know if there's a casino yet that has a bingo platform listed as one of their games.",

The reason is, it's just cheap, to begin with.Since everything is now digital, the traditional bingo that used to be a pastime before is not present anymore. Probably just to share and learn knowledge about this game. Bingo I think is a boring game but it just becomes entertaining because of the interactions between players (not sure if same thing goes in your country while playing Bingo, but in my area players tend to joke on it and to socialize while playing). Usually, Bingo is being played secretly if the local government won't see its importance relative to an event (such as if someone died (yeah quite weird culture), or if it is taxed or registered or commercialized).However, I just tend to watch my friends while they are playing this game because I'm just not into it; still boring on my end. It's just entertaining everytime the announcer is connecting different things just to announce a number.

But it's not like it's as attractive as slot or roulette that maybe only few of the gambling platforms wanted to list it. And it's really fun either playing alone, but it is more entertaining if you have your family playing with you.And it's only very competitive game to say the least because you are playing against so many players including your family members. And you really need to focus specially if you have many cards to play with. But at the end of it, just another game that is base on luck.",

It's like a casual casino games you'll see in fiestas and carnivals and even in normal households. I'm not a big fan of it, but I would say it is fun to play. The mechanics is really easy to understand and I think there's another form of this game called black-out where you need to fill all the numbers to win instead of just marking the winning patterns.",

It was losing its ground before the pandemic as it was only popular among older folks. Besides, a lot of Casinos opened in the country and this also hugely affected bingo houses. The regulation for tobacco was also pretty destructive to Bingo houses but they were still able to survive after that. Once the heavy regulations that was put in place due to the pandemic was lifted Bingos got a lot of affluence once again, but as said they were not able to captivate the interest of yonger people. Young people lost their interest in Bingo as soon as online gambling was made possible.",

Maybe because of a lack of popularity, there's no massive demand or request for this game.Since BINGO is a live game, it will be under the \"LIVE CASINO\" features. And for live games, I believed the overall betting market on this game should achieve decent stats and there should be lots of users that will participate in the game. Not the case I see though if we talk about bingo.Good thing that here in our country, playing bingo becomes easily accessible thru online gambling. Everything is automated from purchasing cards and no manual markings (local word: tantos) are needed to play the game.",

I think an online bingo site cannot be successful, there are much more exciting things to gamble than a bingo. A bingo game is also more for relaxation and fun, you can't normally get rich with it.

This is entertaining as well and your winnings will depend on how lucky your card is. Hoping to see a crypto site that will introduce this game on their platform, good to know as well its history.",
