  "content": "Please permit me to begin by showing my shiny teeth   (I am actually laughing.) My DisclaimerFirst of all, I will like to acknowledge that I know that, this is one I believe not many users will agree to, most especially, those who have a hard time earning merits due to too much shitposting or reasons best know to this forum, but be it as it may, I am still going to suggest it any way.About This IdeaIt's a wild, adventurous idea, a crazy one, but with lots of benefits to the forum, it will definitely contribute to the overall good of this great community in the long run.What Is This Idea?The idea is simple, reconfigure the forum, as well as the merit system, reconfigure it so that if a user does not earn atleast 1 merit in 120 days, that user drops he's current rank for the lower one, and if in another 120 days, the user still does not earn 1 merit, he or she again drops the current rank for the one lower, just like that until that user is back to newbie... This can only apply to  junior Members rank and above. Merit Score:Merit score doesn't have to be affected, Infact, it is very important to keep the user's merit score intact so as to show that such user was once at a certain rank, but dropped due to lack of Merit to keep maintaining that rank or move higher. Example 1:UserA earned 1 merit and attained the junior member rank. If in 120 days, UserA fails to earn at least 1 merit again, his/her rank drops back to newbie while maintaining the 1 merit earned in the merit score board, to show that userA was once a junior member. Example 2:UserB earned 1000 merit and attained the rank of a legendary member, to continue to keep that legendary rank, UserB must make sure to earn atleast 1 merit in every 120 days. - If 120 days passed and userB didn't earn at least 1 merit, userB rank drops to Hero memberwhile keeping his merit score intact and he will be required to earn 500 merits to become a legendary member again.- If in another 120 days, userB still does not earn at least 1 merit to maintain his now hero rank, he drops to Senior member rank, now, he will be required to earn 250 merits to become a hero member and another 500 merits to reclaim he's initial rank of legendary member. - if in another 120 days, userB still does not earn at least 1 merit to maintain he's now senior member rank, he drops to full member, now  he will need 150 merits to become a senior member, and 250 merits to become a hero member, and 500 merits to reclaim he's initial rank of legendary member. - if in another 120 days, userB still does not earn at least 1 merit, he drops from full member to member rank. - if in another 120 days, userB still does not earn 1 merit, he drops from member rank to junior member. - if in another 120 days, userB still does not earn 1 merit, he drops from junior member and finally is back to newbie, now, this is a newbie with 1000 earned merit, and to rank up again, userB has to start earning merit as it is needed for each rank until it reaches 1000 merits earned to reclaim he's once lost legendary rank, if he doesn't put in the effort, he will remain a newbie or end up on one of the lower ranks - in correspondence with the level of his effort. How Will This Idea Help Improve This Forum?1. It will drastically reduce shitposting2. It will install a sense of seriousness in the minds of every user, especially those that wouldn't want to loss there current rank.3. Even in the absence of signature campaigns, this will encourage all users to stay active and post frequently, as no one wants to drop in this ladder of ranking.4. Even in the Altcoin board, those participating in Altcoin signature campaigns, instead of spamming the altcoin board, will have no choice but to start adding some quality to their posts, in other to earn merit that will enable them to at the least, keep their current rank intact.5. Dormant accounts/alt accounts/accounts that are placed for sale will start loosing their rank if their owners don't start making quality posts from those accounts to earn merits.6. This will discourage alt accounting/account farming since it will be difficult to keep them all active at the same time making quality posts to earn merit to keep the ranks intact.7. Accounts that only make posts for the sole purpose of meeting their post quota, will now have to look beyond their signature campaign.8. 1xshit will have no choice but to leave bitcointalk for good, since in the long run, they will have a bunch of newbies as their promoters, as all their promoters will all loose their ranks to bacome newbies, and newbies don't wear signatures right?  The benefits and improvements this will add to the forum is endless, but I just can't mention all, but like I said earlier, it's a crazy idea which not many people would agree to, most especially, those that have hard time earning merits because of lack of quality posts.Contributions please....",

You don't have to think too hard about the merit system because in fact the current merit system has made forum look better than they were before the system was introduced.YesEver since I joined this forum, it has been one of the best I have known. As people are posting that before the introduction of the merit system, that posting quality of most members are of low quality, but the merit system helped a lot. Merit system may not be perfect, but at least, it helps in quality posting.On each posts, there is a report icon, which means any spam and unworthy posts can be reported to moderators as a suggestion for deletion which is also working effectively. Spams are reported, plagiarism are reported, many other unworthy posts are reported in a way this forum is keep clean from poor posters to a large extent. Some people could suggest a way merit to be received could be hard, but what happened was that theymos increased the merit sources and yet the forum continue to be good as it was when I joined after the introduction of the merit system. Now it is about a means a good poster can just leave this forum for whatever reason and later have a newbie rank. That is very unnecessary in my high opinion. It would do bad than good is all I could think.",

But, I was not too fond of the requirement to get the rank back again. Problem:A few quality posters don't even wear signatures, and they are not too active. They will be disappointed to see this. Think about yourself. Suppose You were too busy with your personal life and are a legendary member. You came back a year later and noticed you are now a Sr. Member. Wouldn't you be disappointed? Don't you think it's unfair to you? After all, You have to earn another 500+ Merits to regain your rank. Solution:Instead, I would suggest a Legendary should earn another 50 Merits to regain his rank in the next 120 days. If he can gather those merits in 10 days, he should regain the rank immediately. If he is a shitposter, He wouldn't be able to earn more than 10 merits like some stake.com signature participants (Not everyone). 1xCraps will be very disappointed.",

That alone plays against me seeing the idea with a shine … (kidding – a bit).In general terms, people are used to the concepts of ranks, and the possibility of reaching them in life or getting stuck where they are. What has a different tone is the concept of being de-ranked, be it in life or on a forum, and although that’s part of the idea behind the proposal, having a ranking-system should, in my opinion, play trying to incentivise reaching higher ranks (if that is one’s game), showing the carrot if you will, but not waving the stick.I figure that the main practical use for ranks is to participate in campaigns. I haven’t looked at them in detail lately, but I believe many decent enough campaigns play around with the idea of earning a certain amount of merits in a given period of time to participate. That kind of does the trick, leaving out those who, merit wise, are at the end of the food chain, whom may be relegated to lesser campaigns which may consider them, if at all. There will be of course the chance to join campaigns such as those mentioned in your eighth point, but it seems like an overkill to implement a de-ranking system because of that. It would be better to, let’s say, subject signature bearing on the whole to earning at least x Merits in the last y days, leaving the ranks be, although there are still plenty of drawbacks, especially for those that are not active or roam boards that are not often merited.Edit:Quote from: PowerGlove on September 21, 2022, 08:46:55 AM<...> instead of X merit in Y days, I would make it X merit in Y posts. That way, you're not penalized for low activity and you can't spam the forum hoping that some small fraction of your posts will get merit.It would need to take into account created posts and not consider deleted posts though, to avoid rigging the system.",

Good posters won't have problems getting 1 merit per month. Many don't have difficulties earning 1 merit/week/day right now. So they wouldn't be affected anyway. Who would be affected? Shit posters who barely made it into the next rank or those who rely solely on their airdropped merits. Now they have to step up and earn at least 1 merit/month to not lose their forum rank. That will result in an increase in shitposts with a hope that at least one of them gets merited. Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on September 20, 2022, 09:29:08 PM4.

If you are a bounty hunter with nothing constructive to say, that won't change if what you are proposing gets implemented. The only thing that will change is that they will start spamming other boards with low-quality/low-effort posts trying to find that 1 merit lifeline.

This can only apply to  junior Members rank and above. Merit Score:Merit score doesn't have to be affected, Infact, it is very important to keep the user's merit score intact so as to show that such user was once at a certain rank, but dropped due to lack of Merit to keep maintaining that rank or move higher. As far as I guess, ranks mostly matter for the signature campaign on this forum and the problem is that spammers are spamming the forum for money. But your \"solution\" can make things worse and let me explain what would I do if I were a spammer 1. People, who don't care about signature campaigns, may not spam this forum and probably don't care much about their rank. We both agree that people in this category aren't a problem. So, this solution doesn't improve anything for them, instead, it may push them to post more than usual to keep their rank.2. If I am a spammer and my intention is to earn money from signature campaigns and I know that if I don't get 1 merit in 120 days means that I'm fucked, then I'll post as much as possible because higher the posts, higher the chances of getting at least on merit. I think if this is the source of money for spammers and I'm a spammer, then I'll create alternative accounts for more profit and feed, keep my ranks with each other. Even me as a spammer, I'll put an effort at least once in a year and get 1-2 merits on my accounts. Then I'll spam and spam. I know that I can't get merits because of my spam posts but I have five accounts that are five source of profit, so, lets count:Accounts: A, B, C, D, E. Imagine I have 1-5 sendable merit on each of them and it's the time when if I don't get merits soon, my account rank will decrease, so this is what I would do:1. Send merit from A account to C2. Send merit from B account to E3. Send merit from E account to A4. Sent merit from C account to D5. Send merit from D to B.This lets me to continue spamming for another 120 days and the higher number of alternative accounts will make tracking hard for you because more accounts = more combinations to hide traces.",

Other modification of this suggestion already mentioned some times. Few similar discussion in past,Reducing (removing) airdropped merits for those who didn't earn 1 single merit[Proposal] Tackling the spamQuote from: PowerGlove on September 21, 2022, 08:46:55 AMExcept, instead of X merit in Y days, I would make it X merit in Y posts. That way, you're not penalized for low activity and you can't spam the forum hoping that some small fraction of your posts will get merit.It's interesting idea, although member who only post at board with low merit circulation is at disadvantage.",
