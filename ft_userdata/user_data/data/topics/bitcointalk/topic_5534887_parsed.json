This is the most fortunate moment to stack up some more satoshi, whenever the market is down, it opens up slots to buy at a lower price, it's an advantage for those who understands the buy low and sell high perspective, a good investor will fall in love mostly with crashes than when the price begins to soar high, new investors are also in advantage with the price, being part of the market before the next ATH happens.",

Buying now can be pretty cool for the future, bitcoin will never loss it value just time frame and patient to navigate the marketShort term investors or traders are the ones that would be worried about the drop in the price of Bitcoin. However skilful traders know how the market works, hence no cause for alarm. Newbies and ignorant investors might also be perturbed by the fall in price. But long term investors have patience and courage that the FUD around would not force them to sell off. Bitcoin price is affected by the global economic conditions that is responding to tarriff wars. Hopefully the price will increase when this trade war settles. Buying now is not a bad idea but I wouldn't advice any newbie to target short term profits.",

This is one of the best time that you can actually buy because this what a lot of people have been waiting for a very long time and this is one of the reasons why when the price is low you can buy at your wish but there people that don't really have the resources to buy but just how the price that's going up they start regretting and this are issues that have suppose to be addressed before even the price come down when you have your money prepared then when ever the price comes down you can buy when ever you want and this is why the DCA is very important and sometimes when you even have a job it easier for you to invest in bitcoin but when you don't have a source of income investment will be very difficult for you with without a job. When you have a job everything becomes easier you will know exactly how to plan to approach your investment.And people need to start making plans early because even if the price is not stable you need to act fast becausethere is a lot of reasons, people are becoming wiser and they will want to buy at what ever price it is because no matter the amount you buy the price of bitcoin will still go up and will still come down, buy when ever it's convenient for you that is the best thing that can happen.",

I definitely agree with your statement.As someone who started in this forum way back in 2017, these price drops of BTC are nothing but normal occurrences in the cryptocurrency world. In fact, this should be treated as an opportunity for people who are planning to make an investment by acquiring and purchasing BTCs during this price point.Personally, I really and deeply regret selling my BTCs as I failed to HODL majority of all that I have earned in the past 5-6 years. Nevertheless, every opportunity should be taken advantage of, and I submit that this price drop is an experience that everyone should consider investing.",
