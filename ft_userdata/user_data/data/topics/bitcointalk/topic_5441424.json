Obviously, by its domain alone people would think this is just for Solana users but then we can see different tokens are accepted in this casino. It doesn't even need to have an \"SOL\" in its domain. Welcome to bitcointalk though.Â  Do you also have giveaways?",

But from their web title, it says Web3, so yeah, I think you have to connect your wallet to play in this casino. And it makes sense why they can't allow real bitcoin if I'm correct in my assumption. However, this is not an announcement thread of course, it's a fan-made discussion thread as we have here on sportsbet, etc. I don't think it's necessary to move the thread anywhere. Gambling discussion is the perfect fit for this type of thread.",

If they keep using that method, that's fine too.For the safety and convenience of each user regarding connecting a personal wallet to the casino, we can actually still overcome it by creating a special personal wallet just to play at the casino. We can also save a few assets just to be able to play there, so you don't have to worry about things that are do not want to happen to our personal wallet.That way all the assets that we own and store will never be known by anyone because the wallet that we use to store is different from the wallet that is connected to the casino.Solcasino definitely has views and goals that they have calculated beforehand so even though their policy is a little risky and is not of interest to some gamblers, they know better and understand more about the policy.I appreciate the advice you've provided and all that for the comfort and safety of every gambler out there.",
