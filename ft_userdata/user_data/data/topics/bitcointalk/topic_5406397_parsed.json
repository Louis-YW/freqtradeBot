  "content": "Hi allI am 3giving and have been connected with CompoundCoin for a loooong time.  Alex Prav (connected with this project longer than me) originally he set CompoundCoin with a freelance developer (as I understand it) and there are others working hard in the backgroud across the world also.I set up the compoundcoin.org website to assist the compoundCoin community and as a backup to http://compound-coin.cc/  website, which has the link to it from the secure website compoundcoin.org.   I am not good with social media and tend to leave this to others... the website has had problems with the SSL certificate and I had not realised.  It is paid, for hosted and has an SSL certificate (which is working now!) I am aware that CPATEX has totally changed their website and I don't see support for COMP... it feels like they have pulled the rug on our crypto coin and others!On behalf of the compoundcoin community I am looking at getting CompoundCoin listed on FreiExchange.  The website compoundcoin.org  is here to stay, as is support for CompoundCoin.As for the COMP ERC token on Bianance - this felt like Compoundcoin was did a dishonour and ripped off - especially as they use the COMP symbol for it BUT it is ONLY a TOKEN.Anyway just to say CompoundCoin is on the floor at the moment but it will get up again with the help from those in the community.All the best to all of those working with CompoundCoin 3giving.",
