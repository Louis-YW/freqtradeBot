  "content": "[Image of a Palestinian child buried under ruble after Israel bombardment last week]Up until last month the record for the number of innocent children murdered was kept by head of the terrorist organization known as ISIS or Da'esh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This rate was an average of 8 kids per day.But recently Benjamin Netanyahu the head of ISIS sister organization known as Israel broke that record. This record is now 144 kids per day.In Bitcoin terms each time we find a new bitcoin block on average (ie. every 10 minutes) a child is murdered and 2 more are injured in Gaza[1] by the order of Netanyahu and with the help of United States.A special congratulation is in order for the supporter of this terrorist organization, more specifically the pariah state in Washington DC.[1] https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-22-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-Jerusalem",

Gaza has been termed \"a graveyard for children\"These are very scary statistics. It is for reasons like this that wars should be avoided. Nobody wins in cases like this and the worst losses are the civilians and children.What was Hamas expecting when they attacked Israel? I know I might sound insensitive, but we have to talk about this stuff.Was Israel supposed to just watch while Hamas attacked them?Whenever I read the news about a war-stricken area, what I think about first is the innocent lives that would be lost. We don't have to pick sides and support.The fact that Israel can comfortably kill innocent civilians like it means nothing says a lot about them too. That being said, I can't fully believe anything that comes out of both the Palestinian and Israeli camps. We know how media are used to push propaganda.Funny enough, Israel didn't deny killing civilians but their excuse was \"Hamas are using the civilians as human shields\". What an excuse.But I also believe the numbers can be inflated or deflated to suit a narrative",

Bear witness to how the U.S. profits from war and the destruction of human life. Just days into this genocide and Israel already approved oil drilling licences along the coast of Gaza...Just today, Justin Trudeau was caught fumbling his own words when he almost said that a ceasefire is needed, only to correct himself... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwztLw9IRnQMost if not all western governments are so hypocritical on this matter that this is beyond belief. We're bearing witness to who's really controlling governance, and it's big capital and the war industry. Hopefully more people see the media and governments for what they really are through this. Here's to hoping things will change, because to a degree we're all responsible to what we have allowed our governments to do to the Palestinian people.",

I have purposely tried to avoid looking at pictures from war zones like those in Ukraine and Caza because I personally do not want to further disturb myself, but knowing these things are necessary if we intend to break the apathy and lack of sensibility many people around the world is facing when comes to this fighting in the middle east. At this point, I am not even sure whether Palestinian people will be able to forgive Israel someday for this \"collateral damage\".I hope God helps us all.",

This has caused the G7 to support Israel for self defense. The problem here is innocent children and civilian are being killed for a war that was suppose to be fault by strictly soldiers but Israel is going in deeper to cause greater harm to children and defenseless people in Gaza. It is unfortunate and this has to stop.",

I have children I know how it feels when they have a little illness. They could be disorganised and remain restless until they get well. Now I have to consider the feelings and devastation of hearing your child scream your name under rubbles of heavy and rough broken stones but you don't know what to do because there is no equipment to help in their rescue. Some parents had to dig with crude tools or even their hands to rescue these innocent and beautiful creatures. The parent will keep hearing the shout for hours until it gets fainter and finally dies down. The devastations the US and Israel are causing in Gaza will not stop Hamas's attack on Israel rather it will give rise to a more radicalised set of fighters that have been hardened by these recent bombings. It will give rise to soldiers who will develop a deep hatred for Israel because of the loss of loved ones. Nevertheless, we pray for peace.",

Even the UN condemned Israel multiple times for violating international laws and making Gaza the biggest open prison. But now everything changed and people are supporting killing people including children by bombarding residential buildings and even hospitals and the reason they give is bullshit.",

Quite literally, this argument lacks humanity. War is wrong, its origin will lead to a war that will never end. I once read somewhere about people who are said to be on the Hamas side of the young generation, people born in 1995 - 2000, witnessed their relatives being killed, and that is the main reason why hatred creates the current conflict. And similarly, we will witness another war with the current surviving children, who in 15 -20 years will become avengers again. In fact, their conflict of love and hatred will probably never be resolved.",

So when you are outnumbered and surrounded by murderers and criminals, you can only pray. Because we experienced when we tried to change things from within, we got killed  tortured, raped, mutilated, so yes, we tried not to sit on our asses.If everyone thought like this nobody would ever be able to defeat the invaders and liberate their homes. Whether it was European resistance against the Nazi invasion or the Palestinians against the Western invasion with the help of Zionist fanatics. And of course solo Iran in the 1980's would have never been able to repel the full scale invasion from a coalition of 30+ countries and their 30 more supporters in a war that was bigger than WW2.They would have said \"why stay in Dezful and defend, you should only pray\" as they literary bombed every inch of that city, or \"why try liberating Khorramshahr, just give it up and let them annex it\".It's not a coincidence that these images look very alike. The enemy and even the manufacturers of these bombs are the same!Quote from: digaran on November 14, 2023, 12:07:31 PMEvil has many forms, sometimes in a form of prophets(mullas), sometimes in a nice suit and tie. When our teenagers were being raped and murdered on the streets in all the cities, where were Palestinians?  You should start by fixing your house before trying to destroy other's.  With the world we live in, dying by a mass extinction event is a deserving fate.On the other hand, God has already promised jews that they will always have enemies close to home, to harass and sabotage their livelihood to the end of days, so even  if they kill all the Palestinians, people like you will be there to continue delivering on that promise. If you didn't know, religion is all that matters, without it, we are the same and even lesser than animals. Reading your post I feel like I'm on silly Instagram, I have no idea what you are on about or what this has anything to do with the ongoing genocide in Palestine, specially since this has very little to do with religion, mullas or even Jews considering those who are currently committing crimes against humanity are a radical fraction known as Zionists who have killed more Jews than Hitler.Not to mention the resistance in Palestine and specifically Gaza is not new. It dates back thousands of years, even before religion time. The today's defenders of Gaza are the descendants of the same warriors who defended the East from the Western barbarians who kept trying to invade East for resources in ancient times.",

Bill Gates who is working so hard to eliminate Polio from kids around the world is silent on this bloodshed of kids in Gaza. But why Blame Netanyahu for this when we have Leaders like Muhammad bin Salman, King Abdullah, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In recent Oh I See (OIC) conference KSA, UAE and few other countries reject a proposal to cut all sort of ties with Israel. Deep down in there Heart KSA still dying to establish relations with Israel. KSA leader MBS has this misconception that making friendship with everyone will make KSA secure.",
