What came to mind for me was to use the name of the environment where I lived and that was how Mpamaegbu was birthed. Basically, it was the name of where I lived. I've grown on that username to the point that I now have a type of sentimental attachment to it.",

So, when I create account on forums (or anywhere else for that matter) I usually use name that means something for me. In most cases its character from movies/books I like so I tried today do the same here. Unfortunately all the names I wanted to use were already taken and after like 20-30 minutes of trying to find something that wasn't taken, I got bored, went to a random name generator and Rikafip was born.",

But I later gave up singing due to lack of fund, but I decided to keep using my stage name, but after I discovered that another company(a new hotel in town) got opened with the name \"Fivestar Hotel\", I decided to add \"4ever\" to mine, which turned it to \"Fivestar4ever\", MVP simply mean \" Most Valuable Personnel\", An abbreviation I decided to add to my username while registering on this forum.",

Or atleast for the fact that it's been repeated almost simultaneously?? ...ain't tryna dissociate from the topic sentence but I think I saw something like this a couple of weeks ago, is that even true? I guess so.Well, when I got registered in here, I thought it'll need proper and authentic details and credentials so I added my name; Sandra isn't my official name, but it's what I'm commonly addressed as. Some would quickly scorn at people's opinion; You don't have to anything in here, anyone could claim to be someone else.....and so, from a movie line, I got the name \"Hakeem\" to the conjunction of the whole brand you see today...lolSandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

When I joined Bitcointalk, I was struggling to choose my username. I wanted to have cool username which would be easy to remember. But I didn't wanted to use my nickname which I use on other forums, because I wanted some privacy and I wanted to separate my crypto activities from my other hobbies.I decided to use \"LTU\", what is abbrevation of my country Lithuania. I wanted to show that there is some crypto enthusiasts from my country. And then I just added \"btc\" to my nickname. But some people here call me just LTU. I don't use this username anywhere else, except few other crypto forums.But if I would sign up on Bitcointalk now, I'm not sure that I would pick same nickname.About your name, I knew what cygan means, but I always thought that there should be some other meaning and you didn't called yourself gypsy .",

Price: $4,089 ¬†Short version: as with the BFL Monarchs - major delays and pissed customers. Almost 8 month delay and I along with literally a handful of others did eventually get our miners, in my case a 1TH one for services rendered doing forensics on the crappy, incredibly poorly designed, early versions of the AMT/Bitmine boards.",

The most painful part of his death for me was that my friend has so many good dreams and aspirations not only for himself and his family but for our community. And he was also highly gifted and talented in his field. His selflessness and humility made the community cherish and love him. After his death, I was pained and confused that how will God give someone so many gifts and talents and let him die without using them to bless himself and humanity. My friend died filled with great potential and talent. But I don't want to die full, that's why I chose the user name Die_empty.",

My father was a rebel soldier during a civil war in my country that lasted for three years. He talked about a powerful machine gun called Mark 4 and as a kid really wanted to see the gun because my father talked about its functionality and power. I have never thought about googling about the gun because I have never remembered. I am glad you reminded me today I saw the picture and I took the time to read about the gun. It was indeed a wonder of its time, easy to use, clean, and maintain, yet very functional.Mark Four.https://www.britannica.com/technology/Bren-machine-gun#ref126500",
