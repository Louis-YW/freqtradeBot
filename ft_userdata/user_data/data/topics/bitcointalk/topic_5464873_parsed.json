I don't have a season of the year that I usually play or have higher chances of winning, but I do have a few gambling friends who always make a lot of money betting on the Champions League season as it gives them multiple game options to bet on, and they usually consider it to always be the time they have their most winning numbers.",

In other periods, the game develops much worse  .What I have noticed in gambling is that there are days I can keep on winning and win more than I expected, and there are days I may keep losing and continue losing in a way that all games or matches I gambled will be at loss for me. But most days in general are not good if I keep playing after I have been losing. And if I win and I continue to play, the day may later be bad for me.I do not have any month like you said yours, any month can favour me or not.",

Well, if your experience is telling and sensing you that there's a relevance and you're doing better on particular months of the year then that's your intuition. But as for me, I haven't felt that way. I've heard that some chinese beliefs like during ghost months that there's not that much activity on it and it's like a slow month. Maybe there's an opposite on it pertaining to bigger wins and particular months.",

      "body": "Gambling websites usually have provably fair games which means that the outcomes are determined through a known algorithm and they can be verified by players. There is no way for the house to change the outcomes and it doesn't matter when you play. Take note that due to the house edge, it's always expected that the house earns a guaranteed profit in the long run. For example, in a casino with the house edge of 2%, it's expected that you lose 2% of the total amount you bet in the long run and the time you make your bets doesn't matter at all. This is assuming the game is provably fair and there is nothing hidden from users.",

I've suspected for a long time that casinos adjust odds of certain games depending on their financial situation, meaning that if their bankroll goes down because someone wins a lot of money, they will adjust odds so that it doesn't happen again for some time, so that they have time to readjust and gather funds. Of course i have no proof of that, but there's no way they'd allow the business to fail. They'd rather risk it that someone finds out than give the business away and admit defeat if another high roller wins within a week or two.",

Maybe you exert more bankroll nd you are positive on this months which is the main contributing factor to your success in 9 years. I’m not regularly playing in daily basis that is why it’s impossible to measure my luck on each month but there’s surely something that you specifically do during those months that makes you win lot such as you are more focus on the game.December is my usual lucky month because this the time which I have have a lot of money to spare that makes me more free and less pressure to gamble due to plenty of room for losses.",

In winter, I stay home mostly and staying home makes me want to play more. When I play more, like you already guessed, I lose more. It is because the games are designed to make you lose if you are a regular player. So in my book, playing less equals winning. The professionals might not agree with my thoughts because they are professionals which means they are making money in the long term. An amateur like me can't even dream of making money from gambling.",

As far as gambling is concerned there are periods you may be fortunate enough to have streaks of winnings in a particular month and it's normal cause it's possible you may not have to win as much again in the other month's, you can make one win even in two months or more, all of these falls on our luck and theirs no particular months or months for winning in gambling for anyone, I have never heard of it.",

I believe some people have had such experience and some do not. I have heard a man saying in my area of residence of how he has been winning his bet back to back and I was wondering and I keep asking myself how he does it to be winning serially but till now it's still a misery. So I am not surprised at OPs questions. There are people who win back to back serially and some who win big time after several times and some win big too just their first time of playing bet. It just happens that way that no one can explain unless otherwise.OP I would assume nothing attached to the seasonal winning streak. It just happens that way.",

We might be able to make out some patterns or observations basing up on what we are experiencing.If you do able to experience it out in a row for differentyears then it would really be just that normal that you would really be thinking that it is really that actually having on the same outcome or results but i would definitely say that it is really just that coincidence. This is whyits better not to think off about these patterns on which you have noticed because it would  really be just making you desperate later on, on the time that you would really be having this kind of belief in mind then it would really be that instilling and would really be the main thing on which drives you to play on that particular time of the year or month since you are really that believing that you could really be able to win withouteven tend to look back and realize that everything do really relies on being lucky specially in speaking about gambling.",

Naturally, there'd be generally more players winning in seasons where a lot more players play since, well, a LOT more players play.  In a personal sense, mm, could be, if again, you were playing more compared to other times of the year. In general, you'd expect to win more during that period of time compared to other months. It also scales up with the amount of money you bet in the first place, unless you're like me who always only have a set amount to bet in each session, then that could definitely be a possibilty.Outside of that, it's just your imagination.",
