This reason alone is why most people say that you must find the areas of bitcoin that interest you the most and then dig deep into them.However, the phrase \"how not to lose it\" is easier said than done. You still have to do a bit of legwork, including running your own node, understanding how an air-gapped wallet and multi-sig wallet work, coin mixing, as well as inheritance planning.

Everyone must know basic steps to protect their capital first. Safety for their capital must be their first priority. Unfortunately, people mostly forget about it and they only chase for profit that is related to risk.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsJust like people chased for profit, accept risk and ignore basic steps to protect their capital and eventually lost money in FTX, Celcius, Voyager ...They must know where are best places to store their bitcoin and I am sure it should not be on exchanges, online accounts.",

The basics would suffice for you and maybe a little extra bit to properly secure your wallet. Trying to learn things you have no interest in for the sake of it, like trading would be counter productive cause it would lead you to get overloaded with information.This should not discourage anyone who really wants to learn the intricacies of Bitcoin, go ahead by all means. The process of gaining knowledge in one area could prove useful in that area and even other aspects as well, in this case it would help sharpen your understanding of how the financial market and money works.

Still, I agree that every bitcoiner should force themselves learning those. I would argue that running your own node and understanding of how multi-sig wallet works are not criteria for securing your bitcoins.The first helps the decentralization of the network and your security, and the latter could add an extra layer of security if you know what you're doing, but a simple 1-of-1 would suffice for security as long as you keep to the basic rules.",

If it's just about investing then those two that you've mentioned is what they need to learn.While I am seeing those newbies who have the intention to learn how to profit through trading, they're rushing things and just want to get there as soon as possible.But even if they want to get there so fast, they need to go through with various losses. Everything you said are correct and if there are newbies there that still don't know what to do, take these wise advises.",

Another example is, one might not know the calculations involved in generating private and public keys, but they must have the general knowledge that private keys is like a secret pin to their wallet, whilst their public key isn't, that's the general knowledge i'm talking about, without technically going into the specifics.",

You don't need to learn all about mining if you don't plan to mine. You don't need to learn advanced cryptography if you are not a developer. Using bitcoins is more generally placed on investments because so far not many countries or purchasing services use bitcoins to pay, which means that what needs to be understood is only two functions, investment and how to get profit.To explain these two functions would cover some of the basics of bitcoin, but I think a lot of people have explained it properly. I just want to say that you don't need a lot of knowledge about bitcoin, if you are just taking profit from investment because the most important thing is implementing a long-term strategy is far from enough, the more you learn the more consideration so it will give birth to a lot of doubts.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on April 02, 2023, 11:37:59 PMThere's two ways to make money with Bitcoin - buying and waiting for the price to rise, or doing some Bitcoin-related work.

Reading this forum for many hours per day alone won't make you rich.In general, long-term investment does not require a broad understanding of bitcoin, we are only required to understand buying patterns and in the end keep bitcoins as long as possible in a safe wallet. While an exit strategy is also not needed for long term investment, because we have set it at the price we want.But in further cases we have to understand bitcoin so as not to panic when the price hits a period low, because most people will make mistakes in these conditions if they don't have knowledge in bitcoin.",
