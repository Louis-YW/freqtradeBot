This our country na so so short sighted politicians nai full and na all of them just dey after their interest especially that fool emefiele wey put this law on crypto ban with banks but still on still btc and crypto still dey thrive well even with their ban on so for me I feel they should just lift that ban restricting banks from transacting but I no naija e day hard for them to go back on their word.",

There is nothing better than the government to legalize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. All those exchanges that Nigerians are using should be taxed. Also Nigerians should pay their 10% capital gain tax.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on July 25, 2023, 09:07:03 PMFor me, the only thing wey I for like make Federal government do to encourage Bitcoin na to create a conducive atmosphere to enable people trade and transact their coin in peace, because nothing sweet pass say when you want buy Bitcoin, you fit just use either your MasterCard or Visa carry run transactions without limits placed by CBN at easeNigerians have the conducive environment within themselves as they do not depend on CBN and the banks before they can trade between and within themselves.I will prefer the way we trade now than the profit to be centralized on payment gateway like Mastercard. But using such cards might make the transaction faster. Trading within ourselves too is not that slow, it depends on the buyer or seller. I have done many of such transactiona that are very fast.Another thing to consider is if the payment gateway will use I&E window or the parallel market price. Even after the naira unification, people will still likely gain better if they use parallel market. Recently, dollar increased to $870 in the parallel market, it was around $777 in I&E window at the time. But if Nigeria government legalize cryptocurrencies, I do not know how the exchange rate would be. Or likely some traders may see arbitraging opportunities.",

Na the country we find ourselves be that oh my brother, but shah, we go always survive despite whatever plans this government holds for us crypto lovers, because moreover with the high rate of our Nigerian youths getting involved into crypto-related stuff this days, I dey sure say this thing called regulations go soon become a thing of the past when we have the right people in governance who are tech & crypto inclined. However, it seems the harassments by our Nigerian police on young boys found to have a crypto wallet on there phone (i.e Trust wallet & Binance) been tagged as Yahoo boys don reduce small now abi?

I go like know which laws about bitcoin whole reason say government fit put for Nigeria way go favor the economy? Baba truth be told, this thread lack direction because from the topic one will think is about individual vs government benefits from Bitcoin,Â  and how Bitcoin has better both government and individual at all level within the Nigeria space.Secondly, in the first paragraph, you dived into the action of the central bank of Nig against Bitcoin, and how they made an attempt to either create something that could compete with Bitcoin or become a Bitcoin replacement in Nigeria in the form of the e-naira, but then you have to note one thing that e-naira doesn't have the features of a cryptocurrency and can not be used as an alternative to Bitcoin.The only way I think the fovernmen6can benefit from Bitcoin that will impact directly on the economy is in the area of cryptocurrencies income tax and in doing so, Nigeria has to first of all draft out crypto regulations and policy framework that can help the government generate income for the Bitcoin/crypto volume generated in Nigeria.",
