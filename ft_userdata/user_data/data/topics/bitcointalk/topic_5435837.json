They serve a different purpose. Like comparing stamps to fiat money.And i don't see it's NFT's \"turn\". NFT can coexist with fungible tokens, they are not fighting for the same space.Quote from: Pandji02 on January 18, 2023, 06:14:12 AMI still think NFTs are pretty pointless. Someone just might make an NFT using art os someone else and make money out of it. But NFTs can't be fully protected by the government, because it's crypto. But if it's not verified and protected by anyone, then what is the point of it and why the price of some of them is so high?First we would need to understand why people view scarcity valuable in anything culturally semi important, then turn that scarcity to digital scarcity and you have your answer.But what do you mean by not being verified or protected? Their whole deal is selling collectables with an easy verification. That someone is stealing art is more of copyright issue, not the NFT issue.Flipping physical collectables in ebay means you would need to be sure they are original, how are you going to do that? You need just trust the seller, you can't check the smart contract being correct one. Not to mention you would need a dry storage space to store them.With nfts it's impossible to sell digital counterfeits that could be confused to be part of the original collection. You can sell copies for sure just like in ebay you can sell cheap chinese knock offs but no one wants to buy those and you could check them way more faster then physical copies.I guess your question should be why price of altcoins is high as this is all about concept of digital scarcity. Marketcap of BAYC is around 1 billion dollars while marketcap of doge is 11 Billion dollars. So maybe better question is why dogecoin has over 10x value to the biggest NFT collection out there. It doesn't even have links to pictures attached to the tokens .",

You simplified it too much that you ignore what distinguishes between NFT and Bitcoin itself, and it is wholly unrelated.After all, as you have indicate that the implementation is spread across many big players, do in mind there is also a platform like Opensea, etc. The main point is the future of NFTs will completely rely on how many platforms centralise any aspect of NFT. If the NFT ecosystem wants to thrive, it is necessary to narrow down how the users interact with the ecosystem. With that in mind, it will significantly rely upon the big platform, for example, in which Twitter implements a feature that is able to connect their NFTs into an account.",

Nfts have been around for a quite a while now and they most likely are only down because of the bear market. Most nfts obviously are just silly low effort copy of a copy but so are most of the altcoins so how they differ exactly?Quote from: wheelz1200 on January 18, 2023, 04:18:31 PMDon't give me this art thing they are mostly all just cash grabs for their creators.

So, the \"smart contract\" in this case are the physical characteristics of the product which can be evaluated by a specialist.And to acquire that kind of collectable really makes sense, because it's a physical good, which shows physical differences between the copy and the original, while NFTs don't present any physical differences, if I take a print-screen of any of them and reproduce it in different places on the internet. I won't have the smart contract, but they will look exactly the same.",

While there are some truly unique NFT pieces that have surfaced, most are still a rehash of one idea hoping to milk the hype created from it. Then again, different strokes for different folks. A lot of people see NFTs as something that they can work with and something that they can make money off of, so I guess I'll just let them be.
