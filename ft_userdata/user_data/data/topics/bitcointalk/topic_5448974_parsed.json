Some exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, allow you to withdraw USD to a linked bank account, which you can then transfer to your Wise account. However, you should take into consideration that there are fees for these transactions, and It's up to you which exchanger you want to pick.  As far as i know Binance does allow you to transfer crypto directly to your Wise account using the SWIFT network.",

The problem is that I cannot send those USD to Wise, I have asked and they have told me that they have problems, I think that if it allows sending EUR to Wise, 0 fee, I have tested and I have to wait a few days to see if it is true, but it's not what I need.What I need is to buy BTC, transform it into USD and be able to send them to Wise, if possible to do all this process without any fees.This is why I ask in this advanced cryptocurrency forum.",

If you're actually going to submit AML/KYC, it might as well be Binance. At the very least with Binance P2P(or any decent P2P platform), you're not directly transacting with the exchange so there's a slight advantage in terms of privacy.",

Agreed!Though most usersa around here don't like the centralized p2p platform Binance has , but I think its among the few best options  we have at the moment and you get your crypto to fiat exchange in no time!Users need to be guided by the system  and not the user on the other side to avoid being scammed  of your hard earned money.Quote from: Aikidoka on April 15, 2023, 09:19:54 PMNot all exchanges allow you to send fiat USD directly to Wise. Most do bank wires unless you try using some third party service  to achive this. For traders you could use deel if you dont mind.",

However, almost all CEX that provide P2P trading provided this service and I can only recommend Binance among all cause it's the exchange I also use for crypto to fiat trading. Quote from: coparker on April 15, 2023, 09:06:04 PMand if possible, that they allow these USD to be sent to Wise.Thanks. If you are not sending the crypto through the lightning network there's no exchange that won't allow you to move your crypto to Wise except Coinbase which require extreme KYC request for some geographical when sending or withdrawing crypto.",

Once you bought those USDT then you can send those coins to your wise account by clicking the P2P trading page. In P2P trading page select the payment method as wise. After that find a trader with positive trades, and then open a new trade with the trader. Now select the amount of USDT that you want to be converted into fiat USD, and wait for the trader. Within few minutes you'll receive your fiat USD in your wise account then release the USDT to trader.",
