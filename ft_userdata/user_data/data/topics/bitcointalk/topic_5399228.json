I do not see those who trust you, and it is somewhat inconvenient to search separately by profiles. Probably if you had a list it would be easier to watch it. If you don't make any global mistakes, you are unlikely to drop their DT members.edit: I'm stupid, sorry. I see that you are trusted by two DT members. Nevertheless, on the recommendation of LoyceV, it is desirable for everyone to create lists.",

Good find Pandu Geddon!As I can see, two of them are taking part in Helena.Financial Signature Campaign, but Hhampuz has already flagged them as cheaters, so they will not get their share.

The appropriate thing to do is to ensure that user has been reported to a place DT member can easily see it. Or you make it official by creating threas for it in order to call the attention of other people to peruse into and see actually the thing you saw. None DT member red tag will not deprived the person or user access of restrictions, and Managers will hire the user because the trust is not visible.",
