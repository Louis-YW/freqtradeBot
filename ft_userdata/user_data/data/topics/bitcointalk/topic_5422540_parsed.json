      "body": "This woman is beyond depressed that all she could do is commit suicide. Murdering her child in the process was the only solution. I could only imagine how high the suicide rates there are in China, a country that does not support human rights. The driver and passengers can be call heroic as suicide has been prevented. However, it can somewhat resume the depressing cycle. Suicide attempts can’t just be erased. The woman and child will undergo daily and many years of mental health evaluations—both living the trauma itself, in hopes that the child can overcome the situation.",
