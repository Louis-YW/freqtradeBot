Although I don't know him in the forum, maybe because I have not stayed all that long here but from his activity and the strength of his account, he must have been someone that has contributed positively to the growth of the forum.We can only wish his family well and render the necessary support that we can give. This should also send a strong message to us all that no one is coming of of this world alive, we only have a stipulated amount of time to leave after which we exit the world no matter how good, influential, rich or educated that we are.RIP light_warrior.",

It's a painful death, and we gats to accept it that no mans lives forever. Death can come knocking at anyone's door at any given time. Na why be sae peso need to live an upright live because you never can't tell wetin go fit come your way unexpected when you are less expect. My condolences na to the family of light warrior, make God give the fortitude to be able to bear the loss of their son, and brother(don't know whether he is married or not) Amen!!!",
