      "body": "Wow, it’s quite surprising that a snr rank member would make the mistake of engaging in a risky trade with a newbie account without using an escrow. From $25 to $24.6 shows that he does not want to put any doubt in your mind, normally he would have bargained for the price to go down more since the official price and your selling price is too different but he just accepted it and I guess the total amount got you that you didn’t even bother to check the authenticity of his account. But what is done is done, even if he receives a thousand negative feedbacks it will do him zero harm as the account in question is a newbie account and he can create a new one at anytime and continue his business again.",

Either way, the scammer didn't really profited that much out of this scam, 30$ worth of Pi Coins is just a pathetic scam, might as well just return that coin, other scammers are probably laughing at that scammer right now. I feel bad for that scammer a little bit, sold his soul for 30$, that's not even enough to pay rent lmao.",

Unfortunately, they are widely spread on the forum and in PI buying and selling groups, and what has allowed them to continue their scams is that the PI coin has not yet been traded on any of the exchange platforms so far, so there is an obstacle for those who hold this shitcoin and wish to sell it after months and years of fake mining. However, a trustworthy escrow service provided by a reliable middleman will solve this issue without the seller entering into deals for Newbies members who have not yet built a reputation on the forum.Thank you for this warning, and I hope this loss will also be a turning point for your friend to stop wasting his precious time mining and collecting this worthless currency and looking for investment in other good currencies.",
