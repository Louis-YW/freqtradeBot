The same goes for crypto investment. We are all advised to buy the deep and hold top coins like bitcoin, Ethereum or any other altcoins. Which is a good idea but bitcoin or any other top coin requires a huge amount of money for investment to be able to have profits. Your suggestions would be investing in other altcoins you can afford to invest in, right? but nobody knows what the future holds for them in this bearish market.Am asking, what will be your candid advice for those that have little money for investment but don't know the exact coin to invest in.Mine owe advice to them is no amount is too small or too big in crypto as long as diversified your investment. I see opportunities to invest in what you can afford to lose. Nothing is good or bad until the mind makes it so.",

Csn you remember November 2021 when bitcoin reached all-time-high of $69000. Because of small amount, you do not want to invest in bitcoin?

You are wrong in this very concept of yours, I guess what you intended saying is that for you to make huge profits you need huge amount of money for investment, because no amount of money is too small to invest in top coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, because an increase or fall of either 10% could uniformly affect an investment of either $50 or $1000.. So no amount of money is too small to invest in Bitcoin",

Check out the premine figures if its not a VC handle cause it can really go down hard. Focus on the tokenomics, know as much details about the vesting period of the tokens on the model they shown. Check its marketcap and what kind of project they are building for the community if its worth a shot. To minimize the risk, pick a top altcoin wherein it showcase stability even on bear market. Historical price data can help at what price could they grow more.",

Investment does not replace income, it's rather a means of purchasing assets and not putting your income into liabilities.Quote from: Marykeller on June 22, 2022, 08:40:50 AMbitcoin or any other top coin requires a huge amount of money for investment to be able to have profits. Your suggestions would be investing in other altcoins you can afford to invest in, right? but nobody knows what the future holds for them in this bearish market.Bitcoin technically does not require a huge capital, you can buy fractions of it and hodl. But, most people would rather invest in altcoins with less value as it's believed they have a higher potential for growth, similar to Bitcoin when it was less that a dollar; but many of the time this is not the case and most end up losing money in the long run.Quote from: Marykeller on June 22, 2022, 08:40:50 AMMine owe advice to them is no amount is too small or too big in crypto as long as diversified your investment. I see opportunities to invest in what you can afford to lose. Nothing is good or bad until the mind makes it so.I agree fully with the first part, no amount is too small, but diversifying in crypto is one way to get easily rekt, especially when you don't have much to invest.Build sources of income and find a percentage to invest (DCA) for the long term. (Could be 10-15 years, or more)",

That's what investment is, if you're want to know when Bitcoin will reach x price and when you will take profit, that's trading.",

So why choose to trade in crypto if you don't have any basics or are trying to figure it out? as you said, there are many ways to earn money other than crypto trading.",

Now, if you are thinking of being rich with a few thousand investment, you are not in right direction.Let me share you something.I have been in this field for years. I have invested very little amount back in the days, got some good return and reinvested in the dip. I sold whatever I had in the last bull and waited with almost all the USDT till now. I just have recently started buying BTC once again for long. This is how I believe you can grow your balance. You can't simply look for some shitcoin and expect to be rich within a year. You have the chance to lose everything in such circumstances. Look at Luna, it was supposed to be a great altcoin but now, it has turned into a real shit. No altcoin is good enough.",

Nothing is good or bad until the mind makes it so.If you actually meant diversifying as in buying Bitcoin and then other altcoins as well, then i am afraid you aren't diversifying at all, if you have been reading threads in the forum especially in this board, you'd have come across posts explaining what true diversification is, Bitcoin and altcoins are instrinsically similar, thus if you buy the both of them you aren't diversifying per se, if you want to diversify then buy Bitcoin and other assets like gold or silver, etc.Quote from: Marykeller on June 22, 2022, 08:40:50 AMYour suggestions would be investing in other altcoins you can afford to invest in, right? but nobody knows what the future holds for them in this bearish market.I do not think i have or can advice a user to buy altcoins, many of them are pump and dump coins and have no utility at all, so you can be prolly sure that most of them will dump and not rise again, you are advised to buy Bitcoin cause it has an actual utility and even if it plunges, it will always rise back up again, altcoins are different, they are backed by hype and fake promises and not its utility which most of them lack.",

Buying altcoins along with the Bitcoin investment is not really diversification. You are basically buying the same type of asset with different factors of risk associated with them. Altcoins will always be susceptible to price fluctuations of the Bitcoin market as they usually correlate with each other.Good examples of investment diversification are government bonds, corporate bonds, and other fixed income securities for hedging against a dips in the stock and crypto markets.",
