Because this is how they responded to an offer coming from there according to I know.    At the same time I'm wondering what Osimhen is thinking about this now. In my opinion he would like to stay in Europe just as Mbappe did the same.Sometimes teams want insane amount from the teams they don't want to send their player to. This must be one of those moments. For example if a top European team make an enquiry for Osimhen I don't think Napoli's response would be the same as the one against Saudi Arabian teams. They would demand a much more reasonable amount.",

I don't think Lazio has the capacity this year for such a huge achievement.They are a solid team with good results overall but in order to become Champions in Italy Serie A you have to be clinical when it comes to getting results as just some mistakes here can cost you the whole effort that may be the team have put up during an important huge chunk of the season.I don't think Lazio is at that level,mostly Inter is a strong heavy favorite during this year as they have been very active in getting good players plus they already had good ones,they made many mistakes last year which I think won't be repeated here this season.",

I would like to see the same success from Roma honestly.    It would be lovely to see Mourinho achieving a Serie A title with them before he leaves the team. But until now their performance hasn't been enough to even finish in top 4.    Maybe the current general player quality isn't enough to have such a big achievement.Roma and Lazio both are longing for the Serie A title of course. Because the last times they made it were in the 2000/01 season (Roma) and 1999/20 season (Lazio). They really became champions right after each other the last time and since then there is no such achievement.It was extra difficult when Juventus were dominating the league. But we are seeing different champions every season lately. Maybe Roma or Lazio will also make it in the coming years.",

This Lukaku issue has become very serious because neither Juventus nor any other team are interested in trading for him, and because Chelsea already have a number of young players who are capable of performing well this season, I think that they should sell Lukaku at any cost because they also do not need to have him back on the team. Because of his performance for Inter Milan, I think that if Chelsea needs Lukaku, they won't want to trade him for another player; instead, they'll want to use him as their season's leading striker.I've heard a rumour that Juventus supporters shouted at their stadium yesterday after the team's game that they did not want Romelu Lukaku to join them because he is a traitor. I think Juventus should consider this situation before signing Lukaku to the team because if the supporters of a team dislike a player, there is a problem. In order to be able to sign Lukaku, Juventus should ask their fans and also communicate to them in a reasonable way that would calm them down. If they get Lukaku and the fans do not want him, they will lose a lot of fans.",

If they get Lukaku and the fans do not want him, they will lose a lot of fans.Unfortunately this whole situation was created by Lukaku himself! last year during the coopa italia semifinal match between inter and juventus, lukaku quarreled with many juventus players and accused them heavily, he also responded to the insults of the juventini fans, then swore eternal love to inter! but when inter reached an agreement with chelsea for his permanent transfer, lukaku disappeared into thin air only to discover that he had reached an agreement with juventus. That's why Inter consider him a traitor. Now most likely the agreement between juventus and chelsea will not be done because the parties are distant between supply and demand and I think the last resort for lukaku is to move to Arabia and end his career thereQuote from: babo on August 10, 2023, 09:15:18 AMin any case, I cast my predictionIn my opinion this year the best candidate to win is Interhe didn't upset the team, he didn't change the coachso for me it is the most solid team among other things second in the Champions LeagueInter are certainly a strong team, but they have also changed too many players to be labeled as the number one contender for the title.Onana, Handanovic, Skriniar, Brozovic, Dzeko, Lukaku, Gagliardini and D'ambrosio are goneVirtually all owners and department headsthe new signings instead are Sommer, Audero, Bisseck, Cuadrado, Frattesi, Samardzic, Thuram, Di Gennaro.All good players and Frattesi and Cuadrado stand out but the technical gap between those who have been sold and those who have been bought is very different.Talking ahead of course is easy!

I think you're right, an uncertain future lies ahead for Juventus and it will be difficult to return to being the Juventus they were a few years ago, unfortunately for them mistakes made in bad faith are paid for and also at a high price.Lazio, as you rightly said, hasn't won the Serie A championship for many years, 2001 I think? I don't remember exactly... but currently it doesn't have a team capable of competing for the final victory! I want to be wrong but it is highly difficult! even the bookmakers quote it at 15 on the final victory. who knows! maybe we will see a new happy ending.What makes you think that Lazio could win the Scudetto?",

While Filip Stankovic will instead take the opposite route and join Sampdoria in Serie B to gain experience, a second sin! Stankovic seemed very promising to me. Now we await the official purchase of Samardzic and then Inter will concentrate their efforts on a striker, Taremi, Arnautovic are on the list but Bologna are asking a lot, and Martial from Manchester UTD.For Juventus it seems that he is working to terminate the contract with his captain Leonardo Bonucci, news that is leaving the Juventus fans speechless.These are the latest transfer market news from Serie A",

Because there are 6 central midfielders in the squad already. They are just making the number too high which can cause big problems about playing time. I hope Inzaghi has a plan about this situation.Balogun would be a really nice replacement for Lukaku. He has been quite productive in the recent times as a young striker. Maybe we can see a similar coherence between him and Martinez to the Lukaku - Martinez duo in the past. But I think this wouldn't be a permanent deal. He would be loaned to Inter by Arsenal.",
