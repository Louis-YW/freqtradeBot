Users can download the official Ghost Electrum App directly from the Google Play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ghost.ghostelectrum&hl=en_US&gl=USGhost Electrum paves the way for Ghost to be integrated into hardware wallets such as Trezor & Ledger. This is because the wallet supports third-party plugins which users have complete authority over. A huge advantage of this wallet is the easy to use coin control features.

Relax Point is, at least OP should have given it a lot of thought and effort rather than making such a post at all. If one is very excited in the release of their app, shouldn't it be evident in the announcement first and foremost? I'm not accusing the app and its creators anything, just agreeing with the other commenter that there should have been \"more\" with this announcement of theirs. Hopefully OP relaunches and with a lot of effort the second time around.",

Ghost Electrum is open source, as it should be.Then why creating an Electrum to support Ghost when the developers of such apps can simply name it Ghost Coin wallet and that should be much better and not create confusion for people.I think though that the majority of the people who are dealing with crypto since a long time they have already settled what wallets they use,they use Electrum/Hardware wallet for their Bitcoin operations and there are a lot of multi currency wallets that most likely the majority of us use for such other cryptos like,Exodus,Atomic and Zelcore wallets to name a few.For coins like this there is Metamask as the best wallet.",

Ghost Electrum naming. not entirely good, because there is an electrum element, so that makes the members a little hesitant to try it. If indeed anyone can check every code in the source code, please check, and let us know if something goes wrong. But if it's pure, there are only changes for coins that can be accepted, meaning that this is for the storage of the Ghostcoin.Then, there is one thing I wanted to ask @OP. on Github the domain of this project is https://ghostbyjohnmcafee.com/ is this McAfee's project",
