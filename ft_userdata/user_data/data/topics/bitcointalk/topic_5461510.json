I don't know much about land or house selling but there should be a way for people to check out the property and the necessary papers that matches what you say.I'm not an expert in world economy but isn't Greece the one that filed for bankruptcy or something years ago and that there's been a lot of economic and social problems there right now?Code:https://talkimg.com",

If you're interested in buying a house with crypto in Greece hit me up.Interesting offer and I didn't know Greece is giving away residency for buying a 250k house, but is it even legal in Greece to purchase a house with Bitcoin or with other crypto?One friend from Greece told me that you can't even buy anything for cash above 1000 euros (I think) because everyone is asking for digital confirmation of purchase, probably for tax purposes.",

      "body": "Hey guys, thanks for the replies sorry for the late response I was on holiday, so I'll be happy to provide photos and the listing of the house and everything in DMs I somehow feel uncomfortable to provide photos of the house and dox myself, so if anyone is seriously interested hit me up in DMs, the house absolutely requires renovation but I'm selling it at market value in the current condition as is. About the guy asking if you can actually buy stuff with crypto in Greece you absolutely can't that's why the buyer pays in crypto but the transaction will be made in cash as far the Greek government is concerned. As for people that ask for prove of ownership or something similar, the buyer will have to hire a Greek attorney to check the deeds and all the required paperwork I can assist with giving a few suggestions although google is your friend too. Buying a house in Greece is a rather bureaucratic process so the transaction won't happen without checks and all. So yeah if you're like seriously interested in buying a house in Greece with crypto, send me a dm and I'll be happy to send more info and everything",

If you're interested in buying a house with crypto in Greece hit me up.The best form of convinction for the people on this forum as concerning this transaction is when its pictorial. Most people will scroll past the thread but the pictures and the serenity of the environment the property is located will be catchy enough to awaken someone's interest. Consider adding the pictures and more concrete details that can be verifiable. Links, cordinates and other stuff. You must have put it up on other sites, the link to those sites are also relevant.",
