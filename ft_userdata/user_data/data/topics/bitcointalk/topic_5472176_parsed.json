Looks like you gather nothing from Bitcointalk community , after a week of being this posted none have responded , maybe you need to find different approach to lure members of this community by providing much better thread , you did not even mention about the prizes and also this seems to be no escrow at all to provideÂ  assurance from participants being paid.sorry for dragging here but you as part of the team must know how to handle promotions and events properly, also why not Hire an manager to do the job and gather more participants?",
