That might be a good solution to see if you need it (I'm thinking if you get a captcha trying to put a trade through).If it's the .Io site then it looks like you can put in a return address and that should work fine even without Javascript (Javascript is mainly for dynamic styling and autorefresh and a few other things).My issue with it would be the lack of reviews? I can't find many.",

I visited wizardswap.io with JavaScript enabled. I checked their source code and as I see, one JS is for bootstrap framework, another one is a jQuery framework, another one is also a Popper (UI) JS and the last script is https://www.wizardswap.io/scripts/scripts.js this JS file. You can have a look at it yourself if you want but from my inspection, this script is on the website for basic functionalities like Balance replace, fee replace, rounding numbers and that's all, very simple, basic DOM manipulations.You do not have to worry about visiting this website with JS enabled.",

I myself haven't noticed any radical changes to the interface since then.",
