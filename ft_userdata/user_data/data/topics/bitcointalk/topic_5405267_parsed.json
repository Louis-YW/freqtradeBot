  "content": "Good day. I want to share some of my thoughts and get some advice from you, I make money on staking and farms on sushi swap and a couple of protocols, I get a stable and at least not some inflated percentage like on some scam coins, but a good APY in the region of 2-3% eat more eat less. So I'm looking for other protocols on which I could confidently earn money and not be afraid for my money, and it would be desirable that there would not be some complicated sites where there would be a bunch of different incomprehensible garbage, so that everything would be on the shelves, here this here this. Do not offer sites and protocols that offer terrible coins that offer 1000% per year. Thank you for your attention",

      "body": "I have recently discussed this issue on another forum, there is an aggregator that keeps all pools and staking with farm in one place, this is convenient because you can do everything on one site and at the same time it is absolutely safe, you do not give this aggregator your funds, it is an interface to simplify. There are many different options on AnalytEx, and most importantly, these are far from the most junk coins, there are also stables and so on. But the best thing is that the aggregator does not take your money for itself, it is like an interface to simplify you can put your money on different platforms and all in one place. Look at it AnalytEx as it’s convenient for me, I myself use lying, I won’t be convenient, I haven’t seen this anywhere before.",

      "body": "Have you checked Curve.fi? BSC is the next popular destination when it comes to staking because of lower fees. Some staking platforms there are well established now so no need for those insane APY. There's also Solana network but I wouldn't recommend it since it's probably the most centralized protocol among \"Decentralized\" Finance out there.",

      "body": "You can try the Solana network, there are a lot of Defi platforms there already. Another is using centralized exchanges, I believe that most of the popular exchanges now already have this, you can stake some coins and get some good APY but the only downside is it is centralized, and your fund may be put at risk.I also observed when participating in farmings or staking, that the more APY is high, the riskier is.",

Meaning that we are in a bear market and the value of token/coin may drop significantly.try to check binance they have too many of those staking offers.",

My recommendation, you can tried started with \"Binance\" first before exploring to other site or some other staking coin.Just to get more experience about these one.",

Look at https://www.mycointainer.com/assets if you think that the current assets they support and its APYs are likeable to you.

I think this risk could have been taken when there was hype, but again, big risk and gambling, don't take it as advice. I always say that when the market is so fearful, it should be completely avoided and turned to major coins. There have been so many emptied Cefi and Defi projects lately that investors do not want to lose money out of nowhere.",

Thank you for your attentionMy suggestion is to compare your DeFi rewards to what you could get simply staking a POS crypto like CNDL in your wallet. I think you will find that staking CNDL or NEAR is easier, has less risk, and can provide higher APY than farming.",
