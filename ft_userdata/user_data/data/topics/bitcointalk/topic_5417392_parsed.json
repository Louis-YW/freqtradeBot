  "content": "Good day guys, I'm Alex. As I’ve shared, today I will begin a series of pump-and-dump analysis of hot projects and tokens during this time. And the beginning of the series will be Lazio Fan Token. The whole world is eagerly awaiting the World Cup and Fan Token is the top target for price pumping. So there we have it - an analysis of LAZIO.The purpose of this article is to analyze the performance of Smart Money cluster by utilizing TokFlow AI and the role of this cluster in the pricing process of LAZIO tokens.First of all, for those who are new to crypto space and on-chain analysis, Smart money refers to wallets with unusual behaviors that greatly affect the price. It details what they are holding and where they are transferring their capital. In brief, it refers to trading or investing in crypto entities that are considered experienced, well-informed, or \"in the know\".Upon accessing the Smart Money dashboard, we can see:https://i.imgur.com/AgKMI2W.pngSource: tokflow.orgThis chart shows the LAZIO buying/selling volume of Smart Money clusters at specific time and price range. You may have noticed that every time the Smart Money wallet buys/sells a large volume, the price of the token increases quite sharply. For example: On 4 Dec 2021, the total buying price of Smart Money was 1,035M USD, the total selling price was 808K USD (buying is larger than selling), which caused the token price to go up to 95.61%, starting from the lowest price of 3.85 to the highest price of 7.6. And the very next day, Smart Money continued to buy a volume worth 827K USD, pushing the price to the highest of 8.59. However, selling over 1M USD made the price drop as low as 6.01. https://i.imgur.com/UreEBII.pngSource: tokflow.orgCurrently, the buying/selling volume of Smart Money is relatively large from the beginning to the end of August, the average transaction value per week is between 700K and nearly 1M USD. Meanwhile, the price also increased from the lowest of 3.3 to the highest of 9.1. And there are signs of a gradual decrease in the value of trading volume starting from the end of August until now, the weekly buying/selling price decreased from 300K-400K to only about 60K. Accordingly, the price of LAZIO also gradually reduced to the lowest level of 5.4.Hence, we can see the role of Smart Money wallet clusters in the price of LAZIO. Investors can also rely on the unusual buying/selling signals of this wallet cluster to create a reasonable investment strategy.To be more specific about the activities of each Smart Money wallet, I will analyze the 2 dashboards with the top buying and selling orders of MM in the screenshots below.https://i.imgur.com/tQmksbn.pngSource: tokflow.org https://i.imgur.com/d2Hbu1d.pngSource: tokflow.orgAccording to this dashboard, the wallets with the biggest buyers are concentrated in wallets 0x53312c0d00adadb6cc217d6b9335a952c3064f4e and 0xa26c6be0770a1c62df74e6195b774c50aa3fdeed, accumulating wallets; and the wallet with the biggest selling transactions 0x64c9768db394c38700b7fa425f91659c60038aae, known as dumping wallet. You can check the details of each transaction at https://app.tokflow.org/smartmoney/0x77d547256a2cd95f32f67ae0313e450ac200648dhttps://i.imgur.com/WX7glsZ.pngSource: tokflow.orgThe bottom of the Smart Money dashboard shows the Asset Value Percentage of Smart Money wallets. From this chart, it can be seen that LAZIO volume accounts for a very small proportion of the total asset value of more than 1.7M USD of Smart Money wallet cluster (accounting for only 1.17%).https://i.imgur.com/PSypAFv.pngSource: tokflow.orgAlthough the LAZIO’s average buying price of the SM wallet cluster is 5.63 and its average selling price is 5.7, the profit rate of Smart Money is negative 3.49%. It is possible to deduce that the Smart Money wallet at the moment does not hold too many tokens and at least the wallets will not dump massively. There may be an adjustment for Smart Money to accumulate more tokens!So that's the perspective of Alex, how about you? Let’s share in the comment section!",
