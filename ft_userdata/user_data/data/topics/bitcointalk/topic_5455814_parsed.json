Here is a chart showing how many people will win this airdrop and how much money they will get.Its not fake Im following the official site and you could see some posted their eligibility for archway. What you mean chart? Are you saying they wont distribute the tokens? I doubt that since the project is legit and got presale on coinlist. Regarding the price value, they would do 0.20$ each on their sale if you compute that on possible reward 207 x 0.2 its $41 but if its the same as on their sale of course it will go up thats how tou could earn more.",

I have seen a friend whom I know too well received about 400 Uniswap token at then it was around $2 to 4$ per token and he sold out make some pretty cool amount.So don't see some of these airdrop as fake or do you think this user who posted would come to post shit airdrop or promote fake airdrop?From my little research @cryptoaddictchie is not someone who would come to promote a shitcoin or fake airdrop in that such manner.",

Most of the airdrop being promoted by @cryptoadditchie requires a participation on the blockchain of that specific project therefore there’s a work done here to receive an airdrop. Legit airdrop usually requires participation on blockchain ecosystem to rewards those early users and have a marketing at the same time on these communities.Most of the fake airdrop usually doesn't require you anything rather than filling a form or sending some tokens on a specific smart contract address. The OP doesn't give financial advice here so don't look on his reputation when participating on these airdrops. DYOR always since no one will be liable when you accidentally loss money by participating on this airdrop since he just share. The only thing you can guarantee here is most of these airdrop has a high success rate.",

Its not that Ive trusted them I just found out this drop few days ago since they announced it.

Yeah mostly retroactive drops cause since then nothing gets from actual free airdrop and if they did most likely its a scam compared to retroactive ones. But this one though, involved staking, using bridge, or deploying a contract. Only got the staking alone.Oh and btw here is the summarize from the team.https://blog.archway.io/the-tl-dr-behind-archways-genesis-archdrop-d4a2904336fe",

Just that for some while now I have not been active anticipating on altcoin due to their uncontrollable price drop and failures.",

In general, it is useful to follow such airdrops because they can make good profits. Here's a post on twitter about who will get how much. I don't think this airdrop could be fake because of a legendary member sharing it.",

Thanks. Well in this situation where those tokens are down. Its really great opportunity to get some. Though its not a financial advise, since its quite risky. Those airdrops arent sure to come at your way.

But just expect the unexpected like this one.By now I should get used to the cryptocurrency market and how it operates knowing that anyone doing investment is on their own risk and should do due diligence on the respective token and coin I wants to venture into. Generally as said, the entire cryptocurrency market is unpredictable so anyone making a decision should understand what it takes first before working on the action to buy those tokens.

Though I know some few user who would post airdrop that will attract my attention and entire users here. Airdrops that results filling of form are often turn out to be scam and shit airdrop, some of which are likely to be used to boost and increased their social media profiles etc.",
