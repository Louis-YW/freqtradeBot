      "body": "this T9+ was working on a friends house in venezuela (I was not in venezuela by then) and to be honest I think he did not care much about the maintenance of it.. he told me one day the hash rate just drop off half.  Now that I have the T9 in my hands I teared it down and noticed this issue... Actually all 3 boards are in the same condition (inductor drop off)  I start thinking the problem are not the inductors, this is just the result of another bigger problem :/ please take a look of these images and tell me what you think.. thanks!! https://imgur.com/D3FxQbmhttps://imgur.com/KBMwPZL",

      "body": "Hard to tell from just images but that looks like corrosion. They do get hot and if there were running in a humid environment that could be the issue. More resistance = more heat = more power needed = more heat. Add in some moisture that is being cooked off by the heat and generating more corrosion and it's going to pop.Unless you have just about free power you are going to loose money running a T9+Back of the napkin math at $0.02 a kwh are you are generating 0 profit. Anything above that cost you are loosing money.-Dave",

The manual has instructions on the clamping circuit. If L5 falls, it is also necessary to check whether Q2, Q7, and U88 are damaged.",
