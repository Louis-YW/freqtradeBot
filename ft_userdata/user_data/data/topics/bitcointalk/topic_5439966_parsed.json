  "content": "There's currently a heated issue between an older cousin of mine and his fiancee, it's a gambling related issue that's now looking like a threat to their relationship. Here's what happened;My cousin as I know has been an active gambler for as long as I could remember and he's one person that gamble responsibly as he takes it as something that's part of a side hustling and nothing more and he added that the winning streaks he has been getting has really been supportive to him financially too. I get to know this cause that's what he told me when I asked him why does he have to engage in online gambling when he has a good paying job. The disturbing issue here is that a day ago his fiancee whom both have been dating for about a year now, she for the first time had access into his mail and discovered lots of email messages both previous and current from the particular gambling sites he has a gambling account with and her awareness of this has made her to ask my cousin to either chose between quiting from engaging in any form of gambling or ending their relationship.Her reasons is because she has this brother that's into gambling and his gambling habit has led to him selling off important properties of his and some that belongs to the whole family just to meet up with his uncontrollable gambling urge. And this experience scares her to death having anything to do with anyone she notice that engages in gambles activities especially for someone she's in a serious relationship with, that she can't deal with such reality.I'll really appreciate to have you share some advise on what decision to take if you were to find yourself in this my cousin shoe. For It's been a difficult moment for him this past two days as he has  been thinking of the financial support he at times get from the gambling wins and at same time his fiancee too.",

A year sounds like a very quick engagement too but what does she want him to do with the money instead?If he had no other use for the money, gambling with it might not be too bad a thing if he's got a good paying job anyway. Taking himself away from gambling too would be much healthier than having someone else make him do it.It sounds like she's in it mostly for the money (that could just be how you've worded it but it does sounds like she's a problem).",

For It's been a difficult moment for him this past two days as he has  been thinking of the financial support he at times get from the gambling wins and at same time his fiancee too. Both make good points actually, but are innately wrong at their own right as well. For instance, your cousin doesn't have to gamble religiously, even if he's what you can consider as someone who's a responsible gambler. Dishing out hundreds of dollars on a regular basis all for gambling is a little detrimental especially when it stockpiles, so I can see why the girl is concerned that your cousin might've been addicted already. In any case, the woman is also making a valid point here, although It is worth noting that for instance, the girl is actively controlling your cousin's life. This is not a good sign of a woman that you'd want to stay with for the rest of your life, as you'd find yourself eventually wrapped around her finger controlled by her every directive with no active motivation of your own. Also, she's speaking from a previous experience, which is not to say that she could be right, but is something that's giving the idea of someone who's traumatized in one way or another. All in all, I'd have the two people discuss this matter clear-headed and with no biases involved. If they wish to carry on with the relationship, few compromises must be made by both parties. If they decided to part ways, that works too.",

For It's been a difficult moment for him this past two days as he has  been thinking of the financial support he at times get from the gambling wins and at same time his fiancee too.First, I will say that this is a very small issue, and it boils down to understanding, because in as much as most people gambles irresponsibly to the point of selling personal belongings just to satisfy their gambling urge, we have got few others who only gambles for pleasure & fun, and most especially sport lovers, as that's the only way through which they derive their joy. So what I will personally advise is for your cousin to sit his girlfriend down and try to make her understand that in as much as he gambles once in a while, that it's equally been an extra source of income for him, and he is a responsible gamble who loves her and values there relationship, and as such will always place her first before any other gambling needs. Because gambling shouldn't be a reason why a man let go of his relationship with someone he love, as every issue can always be settled through meaningful conversation.",

She is in need of reassurance that your cousin who she is about to get married to will not turn out the same way. Your cousin can do that easily by letting her understand that people are different and handle gambling differently. He should be sincere with her and not try to fool her into believing that he has stopped it when he hasn't, that will be bad. If it gets to the point where he has to choose between gambling and his relationship, that decision is up to him to make, but personally I do not think people that do not want to stop gambling can be forced or cajoled into stoping gambling. People stop gambling when they personally make the decision to quit.",

Also if the guy is not addicted to gambling, then I don't think anything is bad in gambling, but some people will be addicted but they will alway denial that they are addicted, he might not be addicted currently but later in future he might become addicted. If you are gambling to make money then that's really bad because you will easily get addicted, but if you are gambling for fun, I don't see anything bad in gambling.",

It's not easy to tell if the relationship is worth saving but if i'm in his position i'd probably cut the relationship unless the fiance is willing to discuss it even further until we reach an agreement and convince her that it shouldn't be an issue by allowing her to track my spending habits as an example.",

I really understand what the fiancé of the OP's cousin feels. anyway, as you said. marrying a gambler who is out of control is the biggest fear for women, especially if he also has the same history in relation to the closest people around him.In the OP's story, the fiancé has a brother who has compulsive gambler tendencies. I will not blame the woman, just like you said. that the woman has the right to be assured that her future husband will not act in the same way as her brother. the point is, OP's cousin should make a wise choice. it's not nice, if the cousin leaves his fiancé only about gambling problems. supposedly, there is mutual trust built by the two partners so that it does not cause further turmoil in the future.",

For It's been a difficult moment for him this past two days as he has  been thinking of the financial support he at times get from the gambling wins and at same time his fiancee too.There's a couple factors that might play into this situation. Firstly, when they first met did he exhibit and share this same behavior, because if he did then trying to change him - even if his gambling addiction is destructive - is unlikely to work. He will need to reach a certain low in life where he realizes that gambling is something he cannot control and something that is not beneficial to his future success. It's only him that can deep down change and stop this activity if it's damaging. If he is selling off and consistently losing money on a large scale then he is willing to lose it all chasing some futile dream. It's a tragedy but she would probably do best for both of them if she left, there is a slight chance it might be enough to snap him out of it, because he may end up dragging both of them down in the long run",
