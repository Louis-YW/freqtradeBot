Here, I made a post about why alts are important and mentioned Solana airdrops in the last paragraph https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5474528.msg63178295#msg63178295 So now, I'm wondering if it will follow a similar path to what happened with BONK. Recall when the Solana community minted the memecoin Bonk, and many benefited from it. Now, Solana plans to airdrop Pyth to over 900 wallets, and various exchanges like Bitget, OKEx, Bybit, and few others are already listing it. I haven't seen any information about Binance listing it though. I'm just curious, what do you think about this? Do you think Pyth will follow the same trend as Bonk, or will this hype only bring volatility that could potentially wipe out users' assets? Also, which mentioned exchange do you believe will efficiently list Pyth earlier than the rest?",

I remember the BONK airdrop on Solana, and it's cool that they're doing something similar to Pyth. The whole concept has indeed gained a lot of attention, and people are trying hard to get their hands on PYTH through this airdrop. Since the Pyth hype is increasing continuously, I think there is a possibility that it could surpass the BONK.",

But you should also know that airdrops has made and also break people. Ok, that of Uniswap, we all can tell how well it went and how people made money out of it.I think the team giving the airdrop knows this and I feel this would make people want to be in the ecosystem because who knows what will happen next. Currently, the coins under the Sol chain are all doing well you might still want to check even bonk those who bought earlier before now are already in profitAlts is all about making profit we should all know how to use it for our good",

Solona is not just a single token and any token built on Solona network success mean it will indirectly promote Solona. If anyone want to buy Pyth on dex then he will first buy solona and then Pyth token..You can see Zksync has high number of transaction because people thinking that the more they interect in this network the airdrop they will get.. Pyth airdrop gives a smart profit to many Solona users..Airdrop hunters will now shift money to Solona for getting airdrop which will increase number of transactions and wallet users in Solona network.. Isn't it is promotion of Solona? Quote $SOL is about $60 right now, you want $100k!???
