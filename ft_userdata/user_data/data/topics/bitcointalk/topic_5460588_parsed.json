  "content": "Hi guys I didn't find a topic in this category about this, and in an upcoming Bullrun, this might be one of the best ways for speculation for upcoming projects. ICOs or in general terms Initial Offerings/Pre-sales were huge before 2022 with tokens like $DAO, and platforms like Coinlist getting strong uses and valorization. But where to find or spot these ones early, well my best tool is this webpage https://icodrops.com/. The page grew a lot and is more and more info since the beginning. On this page, I found tokens like Goldfinch, Solana in its Moment, IMX, and more. Now the platform shows you (if it's possible) where is going to be the ICO and a solid overview of the project, chain, and most important the rate of hype of this one (you also can filter from Higher Interest ones). Now one of the Highest Ico Drops scores is Ensofinance (at least the upcoming ones, LayerZero has the highest but is not a launch date yet). Hope this info results useful and if you have more pages like this one, or a better one, be free to share it",

I guess, a great part of this, is due to the Actual sentiment of the Market. The Ico was a banger in Bull seasons, but now I am finding again some strong ones(that also have airdrops incoming) Zksync and layer zero I discovered first there and later the proper Airdrops (well possible airdrops because SUI is a case that didn't have one)Quote from: livingfree on July 22, 2023, 04:38:47 AMEveryone is aware that ICOs are no longer a thing today.

Many of them turned into a scam.For that reason (scam ones) we must DYOR, the problem here as well is to follow the instructions of Content creators blindly. Personally, I go into ICOS that are with high expectations (there is tags on that platform) and are in pretty solid hosters like Coinlist. In 2019-2020(after the crash of the COVID) I saw plenty of projects that anyone that had the lucky to enter got huge rises. I know that now is not a thing (bear market stills here) and the Airdrops are more popular (even in that you have to invest something or even more).And I know that the most experienced ones and older users here should know (for not say must) this kind of platform but also I am seeing more newcomers and \"The public is renewed\" Thanks for comment!",

From my observation, this approach doesn't seem fundamentally distinct from current practices in the space. Recently, there has been a limited number of IEOs hosted by exchanges. As a result, new projects are now resorting to IDOs conducted on their websites. Despite showcasing significant developments, these projects are facing challenges in gaining investors' trust, leading to difficulties in reaching their soft cap fundraising goals.",

All their goal is to launch and list on exchange then slowly rug pull.

Or are these even those classic icos where you send the money to the raiser, and hope that you even get the tokens? And the fact that projects are even doing \"ICO\"s is conserning. I would understand private sales, but ico as a funding method has turned out to be difficult to pull off, i mean lawfully.Those get in trouble all the time after it turns out it's an illegal sale of unregistered securities. And after that the raised money will go to fighting in the court.",

I think we should get over the ICO terminology itself because we have see lot of people losing their money to scam and 2017 & early 2018 were the era of ICO and post which it has been doomed. If the project is good they don't need ICO as we have seen so many projects doing good without ICO. I would suggest don't even waste your time by doing research on ICO projects, I have come across few projects which has advertised like they have been audited but when I check the firm which has audited them and figured out that it's new firm and no where reliable hence instead of trying to research ICO projects and falling for one or the another marketing traps they have laid it's better not even consider ICO.",

So my suggestion would be, never fall as a prey to those greedy/scammy devs' traps. Follow a well established projects to risk your money.If more than 50% of altcoin lovers agree with me, we will see ETH testing new high every 4 year at least along with bitcoin.
