They have good liquidity and provide many payment methods in the P2P feature. In addition, the fees are zero on these two platforms, and they have fast customer service ready to answer your inquiries or any problems that you face; all you need is to create an account on one of these exchange platforms and protect your account with 2FA and all other methods of security and then submit your documents and the necessary requirements to pass KYC.Do your research to choose the exchange platform that best suits your needs, and I recommend reading the following two articles: [ Secure P2P Trading: + Don't Fall Victim to Proof of Payment Scams ]Sources:[1] https://p2p.binance.com/en/trade/all-payments/USDT?fiat=KZT[2] https://www.okx.com/p2p-markets/kzt/buy-usdt",

Large exchanges are not done the first time.Next, I advise you to contact Apytioh. He is from Kazakhstan and he worked in a large Kazakhstani cryptocurrency exchange. Maybe he can help you.
