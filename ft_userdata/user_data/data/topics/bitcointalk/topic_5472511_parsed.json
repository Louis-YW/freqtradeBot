What I see here is that you may be trying to use tactics to cajole members here into registering with your link,  and this may not even pay you at the end of the day,  since not everyone who registers with your link will play on those casinos,  and your rewards can only come when those who register with your link have wagering within the month. So you have to find other means if I am not mistaken no one will believe this.",

I hope you do understand that a completely new account offering to share ways to gamble where you are guaranteed to make money is kind of sus right. Especially when its crypto + casino as this space has seen an unbelivable amount of scams and scammers.",

If your method would work am certain you will be making millions in no time and don't require nickels and dimes. As you level way faster by yourself.
