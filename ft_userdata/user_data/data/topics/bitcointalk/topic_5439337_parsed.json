Plus you kinda told the support, the phone number binded is your girlfriend's AKA another person...I suggest asking them if proving past account records would help? for instance, I remember some exchanges would ask stuff like proof of source of funds for past deposits and rough idea of the remaining balance. If you have withdrawn from a non-custodial address before and still have an access to it, you could also try signing a message. CEXs typically sends deposit and withdrawal emails, I assume bigone does the same.I have to ask, have you confirmed with your mobile service provider that the previous phone number is completely unrecoverable?",

      "body": "The format is a bit confusing, I thought it was sorted from oldest to newest at first, turns out it was the opposite. More edits would help to make it readable. That aside, If I understood correctly, you want to change your phone number, a staff asked you to do some verification, then you get connected to another support staff, saying that since you never KYC your account before, that verification is useless and they need your girlfriend/partner permission/personal info to make an update to your account, and after that you goes back and forth with them asking what happens with the previous video verification, etc. I believe the main issue is that since you never did a KYC, they consider that account as your girlfriend's account because the phone number is not yours, and any personal data you sent to them is dismissed. CMIIW.I don't think there is any other choice other than doing what they asked you to do if you don't want to hire a lawyer. Not to mention the cost of doing that might be higher than your account value. This is, unfortunately, the risk of using a centralized platform, most of the time you need to abide by their rules, even if it causes more trouble than necessary. Btw, a cellphone number (in my country at least) can be recovered by the provider if you make a request for it, albeit you need to pay to do that (plus do some KYC to prove it was yours). I second the suggestion to check what potato suggests above if recovering your phone number can help you move your funds from that exchange asap.",

After submitting this new video certification, they can help you change the previous phone number with a new one. You can try and tell us the result, and if it does not work, you should try to recover this number in any way.",

      "body": "Where is your old number? It seems it's very hard for them to verify you if you are the actual owner without the old number since you never verified the KYC before(2020). If you sent something before like an ID or video before then they could use it as a reference if you are the real owner. If you didn't send something before that can verify you then you can't pass this where is your old phone number?Anyway, I found this thread below it seems they do have bad reputation since before..- Exchange Big.One scam. False trading volumes. Fake tournaments. Theft of prizes",

First your said the account was your girlfriend account including her cell phone number right?To me you have violated all rules, you are not in any authority to make any changes without the concept of your girlfriend or her approval. Now how did they know is your girlfriend account?No matter any amount of claims, even though she comes up with evidence sorry to say that account might be under investigation and may rest in totally frozen.",
