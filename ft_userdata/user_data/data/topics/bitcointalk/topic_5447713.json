So, unless these guys are cheating a campaign there is no reason for this thread IMO. There is a thread for reporting alts. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5394559.0 for future reference. If the users aren't cheating a campaign and are doing nothing wrong, then you're trying to create a problem where there isn't 1. If¬† they're cheating the campaigns you mentioned post the proof and a link to the bounties so people can see the rules they are cheating and tag the users.

      "body": "In a general way, this puts a whole new spin the tactics employed by account farmers and scammers. They cannot use fake crypto addresses as it would defeat the object (they want to receive funds but will use different address to avoid getting caught) but they can easily give out social media accounts belonging to other people and that creates the misdirection. That stealing identity part of process is something that creates another smokescreen for their benefit.Quote from: Ratimov on April 06, 2023, 09:15:39 AMMost likely these accounts belong to the same person, although I did not research their posting much. Another thing I would like to point out is that it often happens that accounts that use the same social network addresses when applying for a bounty are not actually alts. I realized this a little later, when I went deeper into all sorts of investigations of huge account farms.There is a certain category of users on the forum who cheat bounty in a special way, they simply steal other people's social network addresses and use them to try to integrate into the bounty. Then, if someone notices this and conducts a public investigation, they accuse the innocent user of being a farmer and a cheater.How to identify such users who steal other people's addresses to participate in the bounty? One of the options is that he very often uses different nicknames and addresses in his applications. I do not want to say that this is your case, but this information can help you avoid empty accusations of cheating in the future.",
