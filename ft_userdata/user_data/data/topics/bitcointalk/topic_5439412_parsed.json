You can paste the transaction id here so someone can help you accelerate it, or you can accelerate it yourself for free through viabtc accelerator[1]. But you have to be fast since it gives you a chance to accelerate only once in an hour(UTC time) imo. Only 100 free transactions are accelerated by them in one hour.

Both incur additional fee but works differently.The problem is if your wallet supports those options and/or can work out a workaround to manually create such transaction.So which wallet was it sent from?",

To create a CPFP transaction right click on the unconfirmed transaction on the history tab and choose “Child pays for parent”. Set an appropriate fee and click on “OK”. A window will popup with the unsigned transaction. Click on “Sign” and then “Broadcast”.More here: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-do-a-manual-child-pays-for-parent-transaction/Quote from: Pocketchange on February 11, 2023, 03:53:18 AMThanks!

How bad of an idea is it to wait a week or two while I slowly learn cpfp?I'd bet that it won't take a week for it to confirm, but it's hard to predict the mempools.If you plan to use Electrum, it'll be straightforward.After creating a wallet connected to your ledger with the correct account,the unconfirmed transaction should be displayed in the history after a few seconds (minutes if it's first time install)By right-clicking the transaction, there should be a \"Child pays for parent\" option among the menu.Quote from: Edwardard on February 11, 2023, 04:09:01 AMQuote from: Pocketchange on February 11, 2023, 03:53:18 AMThanks!

If your transaction was removed from the mempool earlier, that was probably because the network was so congested and the nodes removed your transaction from their mempool due to reaching the maximum size of the mempool. It's very unlikely that OP's transaction will be removed from the mempool earlier than 14 days.",

If the original transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs, you don't even have to pay a lot in fee. Just 1000 sat or even less will probably be enough to reach the next block. You only have to get ahead of the bulk of transactions with 1 sat/byte and some that pay 2 sat/vbyte.Quote from: Pocketchange on February 11, 2023, 04:18:53 AMI set the fee for 1 sat /vb when receiving the transaction.For next time: 1.1 sat/vbyte puts you ahead of the many low fee transactions.",

If you can get your replacement transaction to them, then you will be able to use RBF even if your original is not opted in. They are only mining around 1 block a day at present, however.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on February 11, 2023, 05:29:54 AMIt's very unlikely that OP's transaction will be removed from the mempool earlier than 14 days.The mempool usage of my node running default mempool settings is currently around 260 MB. That's very close to the limit of 300 MB at which point low fee transactions start being evicted. It seems other nodes also hit this limit yesterday, and would have started evicting transactions: https://statoshi.info/d/000000020/memory-pool?viewPanel=1&orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now (note that 286 MiB is equivalent to 300 MB).",

Also, checkout the total no. of unconfirmed tx chart in the mempool here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mempool-count This gives you an idea on how much pending transactions are on the line and how fast they are increasing.

Correct me if Im wrong.Your \"feeling\" doesn't mean anything  Look at fees during the past year or 6 years: fees always went down again!QuoteI just don't want to have the transaction somehow disappear or be in limbo indefinitely  If the transaction disappears, you can make it again. It's not as if your Bitcoins disappear. If it's in limbo forever, you can either set your wallet to drop it, use RBF, or use CPFP. It all starts by using a good wallet.Quote from: Pocketchange on February 12, 2023, 02:45:56 AMWhat would you consider congested? I'm guessing if its purging transactions >300mb - its congested.

If we have been stuck with 200mb of mempool memory usage for a day or more, then I would definitely call that congested, for example.Quote from: Edwardard on February 12, 2023, 03:20:44 AMAlso, checkout the total no. of unconfirmed tx chart in the mempool here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mempool-countI don't find total transaction count a very useful indicator at all. We can have thousands of transactions which are only a few hundred vbytes in size each and don't take up much space at all, and conversely, occasionally an exchange like Binance will drop a handful of consolidation transactions which are all tens of thousands of vbytes in size. We can end up with the same amount of block space taken up by 10 transactions or 1,000 transactions.Personally, I use a combination of https://mempool.space/ and https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),8h,weight to pick my fee for a transaction.",
