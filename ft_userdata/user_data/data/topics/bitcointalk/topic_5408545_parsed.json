It is obvious that you didn't delve into the essence of these trusts. All trusts were written under false pretenses. One was angry that I constantly exposed his casino, which, by the way, doesn't give a hash before the start of the game, as they do on stake.com. The second one made up that I was offering a $100 collateral, although I clearly and clearly described: I have as a collateral 100 UST (US Terra), NOT $100 (US Dollar). And all subsequent negative trusts were also copied about the mythical scam with a collateral of 100 UST (US Terra), NOT $100 (US Dollar). They began to abuse their authority to slander me by scamming a yellow warning. It's just worth reading what they write and you will have a puzzle in your head.I don't know why my account is still considered newbie, but I've been on the forum since almost 2019.It's hard to believe that this particular coin can give a profit of up to 30x.People are not so dumb you say, but without reading why all my red flags are on fire automatically accuse me of non-existent scam, and some throw a new red flag. All this looks like madness.Yes, there are many scammers, but I'm not one of them.To be honest, I don't expect anyone to become an angel investor because I've read a lot of other topics and none of them ever found an angel investor, they only got allegations of attempted scam, although I can't say for sure if they were scammers or not . But I still created this topic just to be and it doesn’t matter if I find or not I find an angel of investors",

Please explain to me! If you call me a troll in front of everyone, then you can find out at least one quote of someone i troll? I first registered on the forum only at the end of 2019 and had never known about this forum before, until I went from the coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin page. You claim that I deceive people, where and whom did I deceive? I have not squandered this account, and you are well aware of this. That all the negative trusts were written by you and others out of malice to get back at me. Do you not repent of this, each time calling me a scammer, although not a single scam has been committed by me so far?Quote from: DireWolfM14 on August 04, 2022, 01:22:44 PMTrust abuse doesn't get tolerated for long around here.I have never abused anyone's trust. On the contrary, all those who threw a red flag at me abused their authority to accuse me of a non-existent scamQuote from: DireWolfM14 on August 04, 2022, 01:22:44 PMThis space doesn't exactly attract lemmings. Most people who get involved in crypto are able to think for themselves. If you had one or two negative feedback, you might be able to make the argument that they're inaccurate, but 8? Come on, man.So what if I have not 2, but 8 negative trusts, but in terms of content, these 8 negative reviews are equal to one, since they accuse me of non-existent scamQuote from: DireWolfM14 on August 04, 2022, 01:22:44 PMYou're lying again. You were asking for a $100 USDC loan, while offering 100 shittokens worth $4 as collateral. You even tried to exchange the $4 worth of shitcoins for $100 worth of other shitcoins. Deception is dishonesty, and you were being deceptive.It's you again misleading everyone that I offered a collateral equal to $100. Here's how it was -My post: \"I need a loan of $100 for 30 days\"Jawhead999: \"I don't think there's a dumb person who want to lend his money for 24 months to earn $9.92, even you're live in poor country, you can earn $9.92 in just a week for working on real life job. More importantly, you don't have any reputation and asking for non collateral loan.\"My post: \"I have a collateral (100 UST), but no one wants to take it\"Accordingly, it is indicated here that I have 100 UST (US Terra), not equal to 100 USDT. It's like if the dialog was built like this -Jawhead999: \"I don't think there's a dumb person who want to lend his money for 24 months to earn $9.92, even you're live in poor country, you can earn $9.92 in just a week for working on real life job. More importantly, you don't have any reputation and asking for non collateral loan.\"My post: \"I have a collateral (100 candy wrappers from chewing gum), but no one wants to take it\"And where is the scam? This is the answer to Jawhead999's questionQuote from: DireWolfM14 on August 04, 2022, 01:22:44 PMNo, the feedback is accurate, it's you who's spreading falsehoods and trolling.Who am I trolling and where am I spreading falsehoods. Will you show them to everyone?",

I was just about to invest at least 2 or 3 million but I am not allowed to. That makes me so sad when I see that the profit is 30x, and you made a promise that it's not a Ponzi scheme or a scam. I guess I have to cry myself to sleep tonight. Please, please consider taking everything I have. I beg you sir! My aunty always called me her little angel when I was little. I think I would be the perfect Angel Investor for your secret token project.",
