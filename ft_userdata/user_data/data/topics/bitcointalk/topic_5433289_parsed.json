  "content": "Hi all,I am looking to run some raffles over on the collectibles board and want to be able toaccept Lightning payments because the tickets will be very cheap to purchase andit makes sense to use Lightning.I have been trying to figure what wallet to use and have kind of settled on MUUNhttps://muun.comWhy?* It's non-custodial* Seems to have a lot of security features* Seems to take privacy seriously* It's open source...and seems to be super easy to use although I haven't actually made any transactions yet.So does anyone else use it?Is it as simple as clicking the Lightning tab and copying the address to receive funds?I have done some searching here and there isn't much info.....",

I sent it some sats and could not send again. I don't think it's on my side so either you can't recieve more at this time or it's a one and done.Also, keep in mind if you are doing a raffle most people know how to post their TXID getting the paid info for an LN payment can be a bit more work.-Dave",

So yea it's\"one and done\"Just reading back over what you said about Inurl and there is something about it inthe wallet but it doesn't make sense to me the instruction \"Scan an LNURL QR to receive Bitcoin\"but after reading a reply to another question on GitHub I see now what it's used for.QuoteWe currently only support a subset of LNURL features (more specifically just lnurl-withdraw, which allows you to scan/paste an LNURL and withdraw funds from another service). From what I read you are in need of lnurl-pay.Good news is that is already in our roadmap!Ok it seems that the MUUN service is not going to do it for me.",

I will probablylook at running a lightning one too.So yea hoping for a simple smartphone download to do what I want is wishful thinking,in the mean time for the first raffle at least I think I will just issue everyone who wants tobuy and pay for a ticket with ‚ö°with an invoice, there are only going to be 21 tickets andnot everyone will pay by ‚ö° I suspect",
