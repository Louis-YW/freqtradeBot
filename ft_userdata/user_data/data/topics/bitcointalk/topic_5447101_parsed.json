For the people who stick to it and control their guests list, the occurrence of food dragging is less. For those who do not control their guests maybe due to venue for the event or other reasons and those that cook in small amount as their budget can carry, there will be food dragging. In summary, many of the events we attend have uncontrolled guest and crowd, it is why there is food dragging most of the time.",
