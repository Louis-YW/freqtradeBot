  "content": "Hello fellow bitcoiners! I've launched a free web app to motivate bitcoiners to stack those sats and reach their next satoshi goal!Best viewed on desktop, the site is now live at www.satsgoal.comInput a recurring buy amount and stacking length, choose your stacking frequency and estimate the future price (annual growth rate or values on specific dates) to calculate how many sats you could accumulate.Alternatively the SatsGoal toggle enables you to enter how many sats you need to accumulate to hit your next goal, and the tool will output how much you need to regularly save in Bitcoin to reach your SatsGoal.The tool generates two graphs and a table illustrating your stack size and future fiat value rising so you can fully visualise your stacking journey.Try it out and let me know what you think!",

I quickly realized your idea when looking at the table.This method because you can DCA in bear market, in bull market. You can do it when you have money for investment. You can sell your Bitcoin when you want to take profit too.People think they only do DCA with buying. In fact they can do the same to take profit. Selling gradually your Bitcoin to take profit so you won't miss higher highs.",

You have not only added the growth algorithm in the calculator but also given option to add the prices of bitcoin manually at particular date and same can be done with multiple date instances. This is perfect one to understand how much and at what rate we will have our bitcoins in the future. Helpful tool when it comes to future hodling of the bitcoin. This can give great insights to long term holders and with the changing prices feature one can have the goals pre-set and understand the trading strategy too. Decent user interface.",

Quit your addictions and save up. You can easily make 0.05BTC until the next halving by Choosing to DCA instead of smoking, drinking, or both.",
