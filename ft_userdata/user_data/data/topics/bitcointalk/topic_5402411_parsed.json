This time is getting more exciting for people that have not bought bitcoin before, to buy at lower price. No one knows what could be the lowest price of bitcoin in this bear time, but who is holding and losing already should not sell, because bitcoin will still later increase and people that thought they are losing will later profit from their bitcoin holding.What I will just say is that people that do not know the appropriate way and time to invest in bitcoin should make more research about it before investing. Bitcoin investment is profitable than some people think if they can make research and be patient when there is need to be patient and buy at the right time.",

Although they can listen to themselves and their own intuitions but having that someone to tell and teach them what to do based on the past experience is a plus for them.This is all about everyone's decision and bet for their own future. If they believe that bitcoin will change their lives someday upon buying when it's down and the price will increase in the future, they have to think about it.Also, I think this generation during the pandemic have made people wiser if it's about investments and cryptocurrencies. Many have jumped into investing in crypto by researching first unlike the past years pre-pandemic.",

This just looks like BTC is a Ponzi scheme and you are luring in new buyers to boost up your portfolio. I know you are not, but it just looks that way and that's just a bad look for crypto.",

Buying bitcoin should always be understood from many angles. \"Always hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\" is a truth for life. If someone is investing, don't invest in something that can only benefit your livelihood. You might forget about the money, which is an old lesson.So today, the faint of heart should not read various shaman-analysts prophesying the next steps for bitcoin. No matter what happens in life, there is always someone who will say: \"I warned about this.\" Therefore, be calm and patient; otherwise, it’s time for you to understand that bitcoin is none of your business.",

Hence, we should set our mind if we were going to buy now and willing to wait even the price drops. I agree with this, no newbie will want to buy Btc now not having in mind when the market price is going to go up again, so I think it is the advantage of someone who has been in the bitcoin investment for a long time or probably someone who has enough funds in his portfolioWho can invest for the future not newbies who are yet to understand what the crypto market is all about, we may experience more drop in price we may also see an increase the market will determine.",

Others get scared away because they think it's a falling knife situation. Those who witnessed the last massive dump that saw Bitcoin lose 80% in 2018/19 will be smiling knowingly because they know it's a golden opportunity to buy cheap once more. I witnessed that event and I'm not panicking with this dip. Now it's that time to activate the W. Buffet principle of buying when others are scared and selling when they become greedy. However, I won't be surprised those who said they missed buying cheap when it was almost $70k not buying at this moment of its dip.",

      "body": "Alright, although this isn't FUD. When you invest in Bitcoin, you aren't guaranteed a return. as was once said by Benjamin Franklin \"Nothing in life is guaranteed, but deaths, and taxes\". That's true. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, and has a chance to not increase in value like it has in history. Remember, correlation isn't causation too, so when looking at charts, and speculating about price be careful. What you are guaranteed with Bitcoin: No third party involvement, the chance to be your own bank, take care of your own security, determine what fee you want to pay (although, somewhat restricted by miners not including it in the block if it's too low), and freedom of spending your money, without your bank preventing you. If you want to use it for gambling, you can use it for gambling. If you want to use it to pay for groceries, there's services out there that allows that. If you want to pay for your rent with it, you'll have to contact your landlord. Ultimately, what Bitcoin does provide is freedom. No, not the illusion of freedom that we've all become accustomed too, but proper freedom over your money. As above, you still have to pay your taxes, but other than that no one can tell you how to manage it or what to use it for. Obviously, a barring any illegal activity, but I think that goes without saying for the majority here. Quote from: Mpamaegbu on June 13, 2022, 06:57:46 PMOnly wise investors seem to buy at a time like this. Hmm, I wouldn't put it that way. I'd say those with less risk tolerance invest in times like this or perhaps a more biased view, would be those that believe in what Bitcoin stands for, rather than being wise.",

But, the thing to remember is as you said, never follow FOMO. For us, maybe we are able to differentiate the FOMO, but for newbies, it seems that they cannot, or they don't want to.Moreover, we know that most newbies are coming here because of that situation, expecting instant high profits without losing, but this seems to be difficult to have the situation like what we are expecting. That is why it may be good to invest little by a little while also watching how the market will be ongoing because this bearish is not ended yet, it is still continuing.",
