      "body": "To be clear, there is nothing like canceling a bitcoin transactions, what you can do is to double spend it to another or same address with a higher transaction fee than the initial one set for the transaction. This act is dependent on a the type of wallet you use, if the transaction wallet you use has the RBF bumping feee then you can double spend the already sent transaction that is if it hasn’t been confirmed yet. What you do to like cancel that transaction is to spend it to the same address it is coming from with a higher transaction, this is what the cancel transaction feature you see on wallets do. But theoretically you can cancel an already signed and broadcasted bitcoin transaction. You can use the above method if you wish use a self custodial wallet that allows fee bumping, but if it doesn’t then you will have to wait for the transaction to either be confirmed or be dropped; if the fee set is low.",

Apart from that, to speed up transactions, you can also use the RBF feature to increase transaction fees. To be able to do this, you must have remaining bitcoins in your wallet, otherwise you cannot do itTo see how RBF works, you can check out this thread : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422456.0",

The default time is (24) 14 days from the day you broadcasted your transaction but it varies because nodes have different mempool settings so could still have it beyond those days which extends the time for it to be dropped. Also the wallet you might be using could have an in built rebroadcasting feature which will continually rebroadcast your transaction and then stopping it from getting dropped Look into ViaBTC accelerator to see if you meet the conditions to use the free acceleration service",

However, you can control the speed of this transaction by reducing and increasing the transaction fee. And if your transaction is pending for a long time for a small transaction fee and the block is not confirmed, then it will automatically fail the transaction. But you cannot cancel the transaction manually. This is because Bitcoin cannot be controlled by anyone, it is completely decentralized.  You can't control it at will, it runs on its own rules",

As long as there is no other confirmed transaction invalidating that transaction, there's a chance that the transaction is confirmed.If you have broadcasted a transaction and you want to make sure that it won't be confirmed, you must create a new transaction using the same input and invalidate that. Provided that the transaction is still valid, it may be confirmed one day even if you broadcasted it months ago and your wallet doesn't show it anymore.",
