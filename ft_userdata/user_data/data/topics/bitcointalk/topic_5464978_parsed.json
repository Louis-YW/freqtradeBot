I think the op is considering such a time but it may be too soon because the bull market is unlikely to come soon. Moreover all the coins that are in the top 100 in cmc have a high marketcap so you can't push them away.",

As long as I can afford to buy it and I did my research on it, I'll hold. But for now, no reference and I want to stay from the current holdings that I have. Naming all of them will be a lot but it's not yet on my portfolio so I need to keep on researching before I include them.",

The grayscale news was triggering the bulltrend to happen but this will be only last for a week or more. I would rather await the bulltrend caused by the halving impact than good news from US. I saw only one or two tokens pumped so hard, how can you say that if the altcoins are starting to pump? Altcoin was just recovering its price from being traded at the bottom due to the bearish trend. Quote from: Tahid12 on August 29, 2023, 03:36:20 PMWhat altcoins you are holding? Are you planning to hold  ONLY Layer 1 altcoins?Mostly L1 and L2 coins. Im not interesting in picking gamefi or even ai coins. Exchange token is quite good at this moment as well as web3 tokens.

You can't see it as different compared to ordinary altcoin. I just try to mention some coins like cyber, stack or ton.",

Transferring to less volatile like bitcoin and eth will be best choice for alts or better yet use stablecoin or stay on that for a while until confirmation of a reversal it could also be a good opportunity to stack out for alts. But for holders, justvlike me better to be on safer coins or coins that has active use case on their platform.",

As i am kinda hoping for them to Bitfinex to get rest of their stolen bitcoins back. They already recovered $314K, which gives me hope, but that's not much of the total $3.6 Billion stolen. If they get rest of it back it's an insane moon time, like nothing we have seen before for Unu Sed Leo.",

Holding multiple altcoins is almost useless since they are following same trend which means diversifying is not really important. The only advantage of holding multiple altcoin is the chance that some of your altcoin will skyrocket out of normal pump range of tokens.I’m planning to hold few altcoins but only those show a sign of mega pump in the pump and still have strong community until now and not those shitcoins that already dead.",

Sometimes there is some truth, but there are also many things that are not true, especially for new investors who don't understand the ins and outs of the new project. they just bought a new altcoin without knowing at all, they are blindly, so when a crash occurs, they lose a lot of money and blame everyone, told to the public if the crypto is a scam.",
