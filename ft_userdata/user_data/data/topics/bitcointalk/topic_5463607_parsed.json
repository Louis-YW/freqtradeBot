Also just so you know how badly this can affect you if you are not emotionally strong, if you develop the habit of always checking the news about bitcoins and what is happening to it, you will most likely be susceptible to Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD).",

Do you want to know about upcoming events of a project? Or you just want to know latest crypto news for being updated? Both of them are necessary because to be a good trader you have to keep eyes on upcoming potential events because then price can move significantly. To know about upcoming events news and latest news the best application will be Coinmarketcal . Here is the application link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coincalAnyway some good news apps have been shared already and I am just adding some others. I will advise OP to try them and choose the perfect one for him. For latest crypto news related apps you can add these in your list and choose the best one.1. Crypto news 2. Coinstats3. Coinview4.

I am not asking you to do it necessarily because I found TG bots a good source for quick overview so I gave you this idea. Otherwise how you find it handy.",

Just how many seconds of your time are you trying to save?   Having to open apps on phone just to get bitcoin news is a lot of work. I know it is the OP's preference but he or she needs to consider the amount of stress they have to put up with just to get the crypto news. Also, they have to constantly deal with the ads pop ups that accompanies using those mobile apps which I find really annoying. All the OP need is a chrome browser and whenever they want crypto news just go and search for \" Bitcoin news now\", or \" Crypto news now\" or whatever keywords you want then go ahead and filter what you want. It is that simple instead of an app that would occupy your phone space, make you annoyed and leave you vulnerable to hacks and other security threats. Totally not worth it.",

I don't believe you need anything more than that, and it's much more convenient and versatile than visiting a specific website that may even be biased when I'm looking to read the latest news regarding a specific coin or incident.",
