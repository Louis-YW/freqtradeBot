That's why it's not recommended to put money that you would be needing soon especially taking a loan in investment. There's always a risk it's true that stock market might increase and decrease in just period of time, so loss doesn't make you a loser and it's true that you could still recover by learning from your mistakes. Just know your timing when to enter and leave the market and always do your own analysis.",

For you to avoid being betrayed just store your seedphrase somewhere safe or save it to your notes.What's the point to discuss about volatility? do you think stock, gold, and other assets don't have any volatility? volatility is the reason why someone interested to invest rather than hold their fiat money which the value will always decrease.What I mean about betrayed is you're tell how much your holdings, address, wallet and the place you stored your seed phrase. You have an option to not tell anyone else about it, in case you don't care if you will lose your coins if something bad happen to you. But I would choose to tell someone I trust rather than lose all of my coins which I accumulated from few years ago.",

Since a long time ago this brokerage business was quite evil. They promise all kinds of beautiful things to their customers just for profit. They make every effort to ensure that their clients keep investing, even when they lose money. Usually these brokers will say that the loss is reasonable because of market conditions and it will recover, even though their goal is only a percentage of each investment of their customers. In fact, what I hear is that the employees of this broker usually party or do luxury shopping when they get big investments from their clients, and that's quite normal in the brokerage business.",

They had to rely solely on brokers and financial advisers for investment advice. There was no internet when some of them invested in stocks, so they didn't have access to the kind of information the present generation have. Some of my teachers have died due to wrong financial advice that made them broke.But relying on anybody for financial advice in this current era is a sign of laziness. There are diverse investment opportunities that anybody can discover through personal research. For those that have lost money, \"sorry\" and others that are seeking investment avenuesÂ  \"do your research\".",

I think it would be wiser if we could end up with something much bigger and better in the long run, it would be smarter if we could just focus on what we can do with getting similar to stock market instead.Some people in the crypto world hate stock market, but that is a trillion dollar business, and if we could get just a bit similar to it, then we could be a much bigger market as well. Crypto is global, as in the whole world, and even with that we are still failing to beat just American stock markets, even Nasdaq is bigger than us all by itself. If we could be a bit more like that, we could grow and maybe pass that, maybe not be as big as the whole worlds stock markets combined, but at least be bigger than Nasdaq or Nyse.",

In that case, it really depends on what exactly a person invested in, and whether that stock has a history of going up and down and then recovering again. I mean, maybe the problem is that someone was simply scammed, or invested in something very bad and risky. The promises the op mentions certainly sound like a part of a scam. I'm sorry for the loss, but I don't know what can be done in a particular situation because there aren't any details.
