I hope both Sivasspor and Fenerbahce go to the group stage.Fenerbahçe's opponent was very weak, another result couldn't be expected. It was normal for them to win differently. They could have scored more goals, especially after Slovacko remained 10 players, it was expected that the match would go to very different scores, but they got only 3 goals.The new signing Lincoln turned out very well. He scored 2 goals and made 1 assist. I didn't expect him to make such a contribution. If he spreads this performance to the whole season, it will be like hitting the lottery for Fenerbahçe.",

I doubt that Arsenal is already in a position to take home several trophies at once. It seems that there is a good chance to go for the Europa League although it is not like they would easily beat Manchester United for example. It isn't looking bad for them on paper, But Roma or Lazio are definitely also able to win against them. Also, keep in mind that some teams from the Champions League will also join the pool later on. Could also be some heavy weights.",

Still, they should have defeated such a weak opponent in this match, but after taking the lead, they conceded the equalizer. This match shows the weaknesses in defense. They lost concentration because the tour was passed in their minds. Normally, the match should have ended with a clean sheet. Serdar Dursun scored, but he would not be the first striker of the team. They are also making new transfers, there is also Joshua King. Fenerbahçe has a strange manager mentality. Let's see what they do next round.",

Let's see what they do next round.The Fenerbahce team needs to be motivated and I believe their coach has a lot of work to do either to sign a very good defender to strengthen the defense line or work on the form of his defenders. It was a game they were supposed to have win easily as their opponent Slovacko didn't put up a good performance in the game. Fenerbahce lost control of the game after scoring their goal in the 56th minute of play I think they were tired and couldn't hold on to the game and the goal was finally equalized in the 58th minute and eventually ended as a draw, this is still applicable to Fenerbahce's opening league game that they drew 3:3 because of poor defense and lack of winning mentality in the team.",

If we are not plagued by injuries again this season, Arsenal's only competition may be Manchester United if they pick up performance.",

Fenerbahçe should pass Austria Wien under normal circumstances. It won't be like Slovacko match-up though, they need to be better prepared. People don't criticize them after today's game but you can't play like that against more quality teams. Jorge Jesus have to fix defensive problems and find their first striker. If every game different player get the jersey that won't affect team well. Players have to be ready but teams also have an ideal starting lineup.",

I know that the draw is already known but I don't know exactly who is playing against whom. I don't like looking at it as much as I used to. In the past you just had the right Knock out system and now you have group stage. Then you have a lot more chances to get through, but there is much less tension in the matches. I suspect it will be mostly commercial. More matches equals more revenue.",

This time their opponent is going to be Austria Wien which is a stronger one. But Fenerbahçe should be able to eliminate them as well without having a serious problem. I already see them in the group stage in short. After that I hope they get lucky about the draw for groups as well. They have a really nice history in this tournament like playing against Benfica in the semi-final. Maybe they would be successful again.",

      "body": "I have to say I'm not very hopeful for Turkish teams playing in Europa League today. Sivasspor's job is too hard, they will play with Malmö in Sweden. When I watched Sivasspor's Super Cup game I gave them their point, they were ridiculously bad. And that match was only three weeks ago. I don't think they have significant improvement in the team. Rıza Çalımbay don't have a magic stick in his hands. This team is bad. They have only one point in two league matches. Sadly I'm expecting a clear Malmö win today.On the other hand Fenerbahçe is favorite in Wien. Austria Wien started their local league very bad and only got one win and one draw in first four games. They also started with minus three points so now they are in the last position with only one point. There is a big difference between these two clubs. Austria Wien's best player valued less than Fenerbahçe's one of reserved players wage. Even though there is a huge difference, odds are still high enough for Fenerbahçe, that means bookmakers also don't make them heavy favorite. Another reason for this is Fenerbahçe's unbalanced results, there is no stability. Think about Ümraniyespor and Slovacko games again, I couldn't trust them either.",

The last 3 of them were against opponents that had joined Europa from the champions league but couldnt manage to win it all. All of the games were close though so, this could be a toss up again.
