The reason being he is nothing as compared to those developers who tried thier level best to make Bitcoin as big a sit is now. To my understanding he is a controversial individual like OP. If you look into those negative trust you will be able to understand. Who knows he is the same individual who is now trying to promote a frustrated tweet from a developer who left Bitcon and now he is coming back with a vengeance",

Well it's 2 years later some peoples opinion of it my have changed. But with Jeremy Rubin's current attitude I don't know if it will get any support with only him pushing it.And you also have to take into consideration a fact that I have said several times about BTC and other crypro things is that a lot of people just don't care about the same things we do here.They want to spend their BTC or make money with their BTC or whatever.So with BIPs or anything else you have to tell / show people how it will do that. Beyond that, they just don't care.-Dave",
