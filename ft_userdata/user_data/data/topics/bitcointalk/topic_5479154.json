I think what I honestly would hope for is that we could fully adopt straight bitcoin in stores and online for all goods and services, but also have a cash option for convenience purposes because lets face it cash is still king. That is honeslty a world though that is completely at odds ends with eachother and not quite realistic. Cashless society in the future is what it looks like.",

Those that are not against it are on neutral stand to see what happens of the countries that will first adopt the cryptocurrency as a legal tender.The government won’t just make bitcoin a legal tender without them haven something beneficial from that. Thinking of that, we need to raise eyebrows and be suspicious of their verdict if they allow bitcoin as legal tender.The crypto market could be in a state of chaos for a while as regulations which will be coming from the government will either make it strict or friendly to them. On what the basis of the regulations will be is what will determine how the market traders will react to that change.Quote from: Pokapoka124 on December 24, 2023, 07:57:00 PMWhat should we be suspicious of?

I can’t think of a negative outcome should governments adopt BitcoinNo one is thinking of a negative outcome if the government adopts the use of bitcoin as legal tender globally but what happens after that is the hidden reality that people are yet to know and will be very observant to look out for if there’s a step to take action on that. The governments that are not following the same part as El Salvador and Central Africa Republic are just scared and don’t want to fall bait of anything. The developing nations are more careful of that since the developed nations they are looking up to haven’t taken such steps for the adoption too. Bitcoin adoption continues to rise despite all this, one day government will either allow it or put some regulations on them on its use, I think that’s what will likely happen in the end of all this.",

And let's say if it will happen in the future, raising eyebrows and being suspicious might not be entertained anymore. The Government of the Nations is probably setting a plan for it, but it's still uncertain if that plan will be put into action. And if ever it gains positive feedback, then it will create a more positive market because of the sudden mainstream and adoption. However for now, I still see only a very slim chance for it to turn into reality.",

That's why I wouldn't even want to imagine it since no government would be interested to make it a reality as they'd won't have control of the somewhat reserve currency to print it brrrrr at will. But if that were to be the case, I can say for a fact that the days of bitcoin being heavily volatile would be over. How can a reserve currency do —40%  or +60% net in 12 calendar months? It would heavily affect the reserves. This isn't what we want Bitcoin.",

The power would always be with the people as that’s the nature of Bitcoin. A consensus of the people and it would continue to be so. Ain’t no way the government would be taking that from the people as that would completely undermine the idea of decentralized finance.What would be observed is a boom yo traders as, we would have more people pouring into a scarce commodity.",

It's no longer news that some countries have started legalizing Bitcoin, but the amount the government owns is so low due to risk considerations. While they have most of their foreign reserves in the USD.QuoteIf they do, dont you think we should raise eyebrows and be suspicious of what they could be up to?I don't think this is necessary as long as they make the purchase public. And of course, they would have seen the light in Bitcoin before they go on such a journey. However, making Bitcoin a substantial reserve is too risky and I don't think any country would do that. They might own a small amount of it, but not totally depend on it as the nation's reserve.Quotehow would it affect the crypto market and individual traders?The adoption of Bitcoin by governments means more demand and appreciation of the market price as this will add to the market capitalization. There is no way the price of Bitcoin will not reach the rooftop if this happens. However, that is not possible as Bitcoin is not enough (max. of 21 million circulating supply) to go round and the risk of depending on it is too high for a nation.",

People can't be deceived forever, Bitcoin is better than the current fiats system so if Bitcoin was to be adopted as a global reserve currency, things would be different than what it is but that won't be happening soon. The elite nations that are enjoying the flaws of the current currency system won't want that to change, they would want this to continue until it's no longer beneficiary to them.It's going to be a long process before Bitcoin can be declared a globally reserved currency but for it to be accepted as a alternative to fiats, that's just a matter of time. The more the fiat currency keep losing value and importance in the society, the quest for a better currency will be ignited and Bitcoin would come to the rescue.",

The decentralized system which bitcoin is actually seems to pose threat to bitcoin censorship and they will never want to let that go. This will affect bitcoin adoption rate as it will grow in large number but the question will be whether the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin be ok for everyone.",

This skepticism is a major reason why they resist accepting Bitcoin as legal tender. Achieving global adoption of Bitcoin seems unlikely, as some nations will persistently oppose the idea, indifferent to the potential economic benefits it could offer if embraced.Back to op.If Bitcoin becomes a global reserve currency, its value is likely to rise due to the limited supply of only 21 million coins. This scarcity may make Bitcoin more valuable than gold. In the future, owning Bitcoin could be a luxury mainly for the wealthy, given its potentially high price. You should also acknowledge that widespread acceptance of Bitcoin as a global reserve currency faces too many challenges. Achieving this would necessitate significant changes in the global financial system, and predicting the exact outcomes might be impossible.",

Instead, the value of Bitcoin would be determined by the market, rather than by central authorities.

Add to that the number of people who use it by buying it on CEX as an investment, and not as a currency, and we will see that there is no way it will become a global reserve currency.",
